SUBJECT: CUBA AFTER CASTRO -- ARE WE READY? 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  THIS CABLE ASKS THE 
QUESTION: \"IS THE UNITED STATES PREPARED FOR A 
SUDDEN CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN CUBA?\"  IT DOES NOT 
ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, NOR DOES IT 
SPECULATE ON THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH AN EVENT. 
IT ALSO DOES NOT PROPOSE COURSES OF ACTION DESIGNED 
TO BRING THAT EVENT ABOUT.  IT DOES SUGGEST THE 
USG ESTABLISH A STUDY GROUP TO CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS 
IN SUCH AN EVENTUALITY, AS UNLIKELY AS IT MAY APPEAR 
TO BE AT THIS TIME. 
 
 
3.  ALTHOUGH \"EXPERTS\" HAVE BEEN PREDICTING CASTRO\'S 
DOWNFALL FOR ABOUT 29 YEARS, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE 
THAT HE WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.  IF IT IS TRUE THAT 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN CUBA ARE VERY BAD 
AND CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE; IF RECENT HIGH-LEVEL 
MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES DEFECTORS ARE 
INDICATIVE OF A COLLAPSE OF THE \"NOMENKLATURA\"; 
IF CASTRO\'S AGE BEGINS TO TAKE ITS TOLL, COULD WE 
BE SEEING THE BEGINNING OF THE END?  MAYBE NOT, BUT, 
IF SO, ARE WE READY TO SEIZE WHAT MAY BE A FLEETING 
OPPORTUNITY BROUGHT ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, BY A MILITARY 
COUP, AS FAR-FETCHED AS THAT IDEA SEEMS RIGHT NOW? 
IT COULD BE A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT TO STUDY OUR 
OPTIONS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE QUESTION OF 
WHAT COULD BE CALLED THE \"DENAZIFICATION\" OF CUBA. 
THE U.S. HAS HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH \"EXORCISING\" 
OTHER SOCIETIES OF MILITARIZED, HATE-FILLED 
IDEOLOGIES WHICH MAINTAINED THEMSELVES IN POWER 
BY TERROR AND BRUTALITY.  HAVE WE EXAMINED, ON THE 
ONE HAND, THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
NAZI GERMANY, FASCIST ITALY AND JAPAN, AND CUBA ON 
THE OTHER?  IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE AND CERTAINLY 
MORE THAN SIMPLY AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE.  STRANGER 
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN HISTORY, THAT A TYRANNY 
SUDDENLY CEASES TO EXIST, DUE TO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL 
CAUSES.  IF THAT HAPPENS  IN CUBA, ARE WE PREPARED TO 
WORK QUICKLY WITH WHATEVER CUBANS INSIDE THE ISLAND 
MAY BE WILLING TO DETACH HER FROM THE SOVIET BLOC BEFORE 
HARD-LINE COMMUNISTS AND CASTROITES CAN SUCCESSFULLY 
REACT? IF WE ARE, CAN WE SUSTAIN THE EFFORT BY 
BEGINNING A PROCESS OF UNDOING NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF 
BRAIN-WASHING AND PROPAGANDA? 
 
 
4.  WE COULD EXAMINE OUR EXPERIENCE  IN A MINOR 
BUT MORE RECENT AND STILL RELEVANT CASE:  GRENADA. 
WERE WE READY FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE IN GRENADA IN 
1983?  ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT, 
DID WE MAKE OUR TASK EASIER OR MORE DIFFICULT BY 
OUR ADVANCE PLANS OR LACK THEREOF? 
WHAT WAS OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND 
MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE MISSION?  HOW WOULD IT HAVE 
WORKED IN THE CASE OF A SPANISH-SPEAKING COUNTRY WITH 
30 YEARS OF COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP INSTEAD OF 4 YEARS? 
ALTHOUGH AN INVASION OR OCCUPATION OF CUBA BY U.S. 
FORCES IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY, IT COULD BE THAT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, UNDER A SCENARIO OF A SUCCESSFUL COUP BY 
CUBAN MILITARY OFFICERS FOLLOWING, LET\'S SAY A CASTRO 
HEART ATTACK, THAT THE PROVISIONAL CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT WOULD ASK THE USG FOR ALL TYPES OF 
ASSISTANCE.  IF WE ARE NOT READY TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, 
A COUNTER-COUP COULD BE LAUNCHED. THE FATE OF CUBA 
FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS COULD THUS BE DECIDED IN A 
MATTER OF HOURS, WITH THE CORRESPONDING CONSEQUENCES 
FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.  HOW MUCH HAS A COMMUNIST 
BASE NINETY MILES FROM FLORIDA COST US IN THE PAST 
THREE DECADES?  EVEN IF THERE IS NO VIOLENT 
RESISTANCE TO THE \"NEW\" CUBAN GOVERNMENT, ARE WE 
PREPARED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC (E.G., FOOD, 
OIL) AND OTHER HELP WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT--ASSUMING, 
OF COURSE, THAT IT IS PRN-US--SEEKS? 
 
 
5.  A WASHINGTON-BASED TASK FORCE OR STUDY GROUP 
CONSISTING OF THE PRINCIPAL USG AGENCIES WITH 
KNOWLEDGE OF CUBA, AUGMENTED BY CONSULTANTS 
INCLUDING TRUSTWORTHY CUBANS AND AMERICANS SUCH 
AS LONG-TIME EXILES, RECENT DEFECTORS, ACADEMICS, AND 
PERSONS FAMILIAR WITH ISSUES SUCH AS \"DE NAZIFICATION\" 
IN POST WWII GERMANY, COULD PREPARE AN ACTION 
PLAN WHICH COULD SAVE THE UNITED STATES MUCH 
COST AND SUFFERING IN THE EVENTUALITY OF A SUDDEN 
CHANGE IN CUBA.

SUBJECT:  REACTIONS TO RELEASE OF FEB 
          92 COUP LEADER HUGO CHAVEZ 
 
REF: A) CARACAS 2512, B) CARACAS 2270 
 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  POLITICAL REACTION TO THE RELEASE OF 
THE PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE FEBRUARY 1992 MILITARY COUP, 
LTC HUGO CHAVEZ, HAS RANGED FROM \"GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY\" TO 
WARNINGS THAT IT SENDS SIGNALS TO THE ARMED FORCES THAT IT 
CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY. FOR HIS PART, CHAVEZ HAS EMBRACED 
THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT AND ACTIVELY TAKEN UP HIS NEW 
POLITICAL ROLE IN A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS AND 
PRONOUNCEMENTS.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U) IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE LEADER OF 
THE FEBRUARY 1992 MILITARY COUP (REF A), LTC HUGO CHAVEZ, 
VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPERS WERE FULL OF REACTIONS FROM 
POLITICAL LEADERS AND PREMONITIONS ON WHAT THE RELEASE 
WILL MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY.  ONE OF 
THE FIRST TO STRONGLY CRITICIZE THE DECISION WAS ACCION 
DEMOCRATICA (AD) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER EMILIO 
RONDON.  ACCORDING TO RONDON, THE PARDON OF CHAVEZ AND 
OTHER COUP PARTICIPANTS WILL SIGNAL THE MILITARY THAT IT 
CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY.  HE SAID THAT RATHER THAN 
ESTABLISHING HARMONY AMONG MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, 
THE PARDONS WILL BE AN IRRITANT TO THOSE MEMBERS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES WHO DEFENDED THE GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY SINCE 
MANY OF THOSE WHO TOOK UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ARE 
NOW BEING HAILED AS NATIONAL HEROES. 
 
3.  (C)  RONDON\'S CONCERNS ABOUT DISQUIET IN THE MILITARY 
OVER THE PARDONS WERE SEEMINGLY CONFIRMED BY PRESS 
INTERVIEWS WITH UNNAMED CIVILIAN AND MILITARY MEMBERS OF 
THE MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM.  THESE ANONYMOUS SOURCES SAW 
THE RELEASE OF THE COUP PARTICIPANTS AS A SIGN OF A LACK 
OF AUTHORITY AND WILLPOWER ON THE PART OF THE CALDERA 
ADMINISTRATION.  (COMMENT:  THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
MILITARY COURT SYSTEM ARE LESS THAN HAPPY WITH THE PARDONS 
OF THE 1992 COUP PLOTTERS IS HARDLY SURPRISING -- THEY 
WOULD VIEW THE GRANTING OF PRE-TRIAL PARDONS AS THE 
JUDICIAL EQUIVALENT OF SWEEPING THE ISSUE OF THE REBELLION 
UNDER THE RUG AND THUS DAMAGING THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
MILITARY\'S JUSTICE SYSTEM.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE NOT 
AWARE OF ANY SERIOUS SIGNS OF MILITARY DISCONTENT WITH THE 
POLITICAL DECISION TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE COUP 
PLOTTERS VIA PARDONS AND THEIR DISMISSAL FROM THE ARMED 
FORCES.  END COMMENT) 
 
4.  (U)  THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN COPEI 
PARTY, HILARION CARDOZO, SAID THE RELEASE OF THE COUP 
PARTICIPANTS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE ARMED FORCES AS AN APOLITICAL AND 
NON-DELIBERATIVE INSTITUTION.  HE SEES THE PARDONS AS A 
POSITIVE STEP FOR THE COUNTRY, AND CALLED ON CHAVEZ AND 
OTHER LEADERS OF THE COUP TO UTILIZE THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS, RATHER THAN ARMED INSURRECTION, TO EFFECT CHANGE. 
 
5.  (U)  IN KEEPING WITH THE POPULIST SENTIMENT IN SUPPORT 
OF THE COUP PLOTTERS, THE ARCHBISHOP OF CARACAS JOSE ALI 
LEBRUN SAID THE PARDONS ARE \"GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY\" AND WILL 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPIRIT OF PACIFICATION NEEDED IN 
VENEZUELA.  HE AGREES WITH PRESIDENT CALDERA THAT THE 
RELEASE WILL HELP PUT THE \"HOUSE IN ORDER\". 
 
6.  (C) IN A RELATED ISSUE THAT WON\'T SEEM TO GO AWAY, 
\"MOVIMIENTO AL SOCIALISMO\" (MAS) PARTY MEMBER LUIS MANUEL 
ESCULPI HAS ONCE AGAIN CALLED FOR A CONGRESSIONAL 
INVESTIGATION INTO A TRIP MADE BY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER 
RADEMES MUNOZ LEON (REF B).  THE NEW CALL TO INVESTIGATE 
STEMS FROM CHARGES MADE BY CHAVEZ THAT MUNOZ WAS ON A 
MISSION TO THE US LAST SEPTEMBER TO SECURE THE NEUTRALITY 
OF THE USG IN THE EVENT OF A HIGH LEVEL COUP IN 
VENEZUELA.  (COMMENT: CONGRESSIONAL DISINTEREST IN THIS 
ISSUE WILL ASSURE AN INVESTIGATION WILL NOT COME TO 
FRUITION.  WE SEE THIS AS MAS, ONCE AGAIN, TRYING TO MAKE 
POLITICAL GAIN FROM THE SITUATION.) 
 
7.  (C)  SINCE HIS RELEASE, CHAVEZ HAS BATHED IN THE 
POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT AND, THROUGH A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS, 
PRESS CONFERENCES, AND TRIPS, EMBRACED HIS NEW CIVILIAN, 
POLITICAL ROLE.  IN AN APRIL 4 INTERVIEW, FOR EXAMPLE, HE 
CONTINUED HIS ACCUSATION THAT THEN DEFENSE MINISTER MUNOZ 
LEON WAS PLANNING A COUP IN LATE 1993, ALTHOUGH HE 
ADMITTED HE HAD NO PROOF.  REACTING TO FORMER PRESIDENT 
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\' RECENT STATEMENT THAT HE INTENDS TO 
RE-ENTER POLITICS AND MAY ONCE AGAIN SEEK THE PRESIDENCY 
(ONCE CLEARED BY THE SUPREME COURT), CHAVEZ WARNED THAT 
SHOULD CAP RETURN TO POWER HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD 
\"FIGHT HIM FROM THE MOUNTAINS.\"  HE ALSO SUGGESTED, RATHER 
STRANGELY, THAT MUNOZ AND CAP WERE SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN A 
SCHEME TO SURRENDER VENEZUELAN SOVEREIGNTY IN THE GULF OF 
VENEZUELA TO COLOMBIA. 
 
8. (C)  COMMENT:  A SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED POLITICIAN, 
CALDERA KNOWS THAT TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  CHAVEZ WAS 
RELEASED ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE VENEZUELA SHUT DOWN FOR 
EASTER WEEK.  THE PAPERS FROM SUNDAY TO WEDNESDAY AFTER 
THE RELEASE WERE FILLED WITH STORIES ON CHAVEZ, HIS 
POPULAR SUPPORT, AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESSES.  THERE WERE NO NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY, AND THE CITY WAS EMPTY FOR EASTER SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY.  BY THE TIME PEOPLE RETURNED TO TOWN ON MONDAY, 
THE HEADLINES WERE BACK TO WHAT CONCERNS VENEZUELANS MOST; 
THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.  THE BIG STORY IS THE REOPENING 
OF BANCO LATINO. 
 
9.  (C)  CHAVEZ, OF COURSE, INTENDS TO KEEP HIMSELF IN THE 
HEADLINES.  HE IS CLEARLY CHARISMATIC AND ARTICULATE, AND 
DEFT AT USING HIS STATUS AS A HERO -- AT LEAST IN THE EYES 
OF SOME -- TO BUILD A POLITICAL MOVEMENT.  HIS IDEOLOGY AS 
EXPRESSED IN VARIOUS INTERVIEWS, INCLUDING HIS ANTI-US 
BIAS AND HIS OPEN THREAT OF ANOTHER COUP ATTEMPT SHOULD 
CAP BE RE-ELECTED (AN UNLIKELY EVENT), REVEAL AN 
ESSENTIALLY PRIMITIVE AND FUNDAMENTALIST APPROACH.  HE HAS 
BEEN PUBLICLY LABELLED AS A \"CRETIN\" BY AN INFLUENTIAL 
JOURNALIST, A VIEW WHICH IS SHARED BY MOST OF THE 
POLITICAL CLASS IN VENEZUELA.  IT IS AN OPEN QUESTION 
WHETHER A CHAVEZ WITHOUT HIS RED BERET AND MARTYR STATUS 
WILL CONTINUE TO ATTRACT SIGNIFICANT POPULAR SUPPORT.

SUBJECT:   CASTRO GREETS FORMER COUP LEADER CHAVEZ 
 
1.  (U) CARACAS NEWSPAPERS GAVE FRONT PAGE COVERAGE 
DECEMBER 15 TO THE VISIT TO HAVANA OF RETIRED ARMY LT. 
COL. HUGO CHAVEZ.  FEATURING PHOTOS OF FIDEL CASTRO 
EMBRACING CHAVEZ, THE PRESS REPORTED THAT THE CUBAN 
PRESIDENT WENT TO THE AIRPORT TO GREET THE PRINCIPAL 
LEADER OF THE FAILED FEBRUARY 1992 COUP AGAINST THEN 
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.  CHAVEZ WAS REPORTEDLY 
INVITED TO CUBA TO LECTURE ON SIMON BOLIVAR.  THE PRESS 
NOTED THAT CASTRO WAS IRONICALLY ONE OF THE FIRST FOREIGN 
LEADERS TO SEND A TELEGRAM IN SUPPORT OF FORMER PRESIDENT 
PEREZ AFTER THE FEBRUARY 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, AND NOW THE 
CUBAN CHIEF IS TREATING THE MAN WHO ORCHESTRATED THE COUP 
MUCH LIKE A VISITING HEAD OF STATE. 
 
2.  (U)  PROFESSING HIS ADMIRATION FOR CUBA (\"THE 
AUTHENTIC BOLIVARIAN DREAM BREATHES HERE\"), CHAVEZ 
AFFIRMED THAT VENEZUELA REQUIRED A ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, 
POLITICAL, AND MORAL REVOLUTION.  HE CALLED THE GOV A 
\"CIVILIAN DICTATORSHIP DISGUISED AS A DEMOCRACY\".  THE 
LEADER OF THE \"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT 200\" 
(MBR-200) ALSO ASSERTED THAT HIS GROUP WOULD SEEK POWER IN 
VENEZUELA DEMOCRATICALLY.  AT THE SAME TIME, CHAVEZ 
REITERATED THAT HE WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE 
ELECTIONS UNLESS THE \"RULES OF THE GAME ARE CHANGED.\" 
 
3.  (LOU)  ON THE AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 15, FOREIGN 
MINISTER MIGUEL ANGEL BURELLI RIVAS REPORTEDLY CALLED IN 
GERMAN GARCIA OTERO, THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR IN CARACAS, TO 
\"LAY OUT THE VENEZUELAN POSITION\" TOWARDS CHAVEZ\' WARM 
RECEPTION.  THE LACK OF PUBLIC COMMENTS REGARDING WHAT WAS 
SAID DURING MEETING LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THE EXCHANGE WAS 
COLD.  TWO DAYS LATER BURELLI RIVAS FELT COMPELLED TO 
COMMENT THAT HIS EXCHANGE WITH GARCIA OTERO DEALT ONLY 
WITH BILATERAL ISSUES.  THE MINISTER ALSO ASSERTED THAT 
THE RETURN TO CARACAS OF THE VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR IN 
HAVANA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHAVEZ INCIDENT.  IN 
OTHER REACTION, THE ARCHBISHOP OF BARQUISIMETO COMMENTED 
ON THE CHAVEZ VISIT IN HIS TELEVISED CHRISTMAS MESSAGE, 
BLASTING CHAVEZ FOR COMPARING CASTRO\'S CUBAN DICTATORSHIP 
TO THE BOLIVARIAN DREAM. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  IT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT WHAT 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL BENEFIT CHAVEZ EXPECTS TO DERIVE FROM 
HIS VISIT TO CUBA AND MEETING WITH CASTRO.  IF ANYTHING, 
IN THE EYES OF MOST VENEZUELANS THE ENCOUNTER WILL MORE 
CLEARLY PLACE THE NATIONALISTIC, POLITICALLY AMBIGUOUS 
CHAVEZ AND HIS MBR IN THE POLITICAL CAMP OF THE FAR LEFT. 
THE CUBAN MODEL IS NOT ONE THAT HAS MANY SUPPORTERS HERE, 
SO HIS FLIRTING WITH CASTRO WOULD NOT SEEM A MOVE THAT 
WOULD WIN HIM VAST SUPPORT AT HOME.  ON THE CONTRARY, A 
PERCEPTION THAT HE IS CLOSE TO CASTRO COULD COST CHAVEZ 
POLITICALLY SINCE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF HIS SUPPORT 
DERIVES FROM THE VIEW THAT HE IS AN ANTI-SYSTEM POPULIST, 
NOT THAT HE IS A LEFTIST.  WE PRESUME THAT FROM THE CUBAN 
PERSPECTIVE THE HIGH LEVEL ATTENTION PAID TO CHAVEZ WAS 
CASTRO\'S WAY OF SIGNALING HIS DISPLEASURE WITH THE GOV 
OVER VENEZUELA\'S COMMENTS ON THE NEED TO DEMOCRATIZE 
CUBA.  BURELLI RIVAS\' CALLING IN THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR 
PROVIDED THE GOV RESPONSE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  FORMER COUP LEADER AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HUGO CHAVEZ 
CELEBRATED A \"DAY OF DIGNITY\" ON FEBRUARY 4 (4F), THE SIXTH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HIS COUP ATTEMPT.  THIS CELEBRATION PROVIDED US AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE CHAVEZ CAMPAIGNING AT THREE EVENTS:  MASS AT 
THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL, A WREATH LAYING AT THE STATUE OF NATIONAL 
HERO SIMON BOLIVAR, AND A POLITICAL RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS. 
CHAVEZ, WHO HAD EARLIER CLAIMED HE WOULD DRAW 50,000, FOLLOWERS TO 
THE PLAZA CARACAS DREW ONLY BETWEEN 5,000 AND 6,000 OF WHICH A MERE 
1,000 TO 1,500 WERE AVID SUPPORTERS.  WHILE CHAVEZ CLEARLY APPEALS 
TO SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE \"MARGINAL\" AND LOWER CLASSES, HE HAS 
NOT DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY SO FAR TO BROADEN HIS BASE OF SUPPORT. 
BEGINNING ON THE DAY HE REGISTERED HIS PARTY, CHAVEZ LAID THE 
GROUNDWORK FOR HIS \"DAY OF DIGNITY\" BY ORGANIZING A SERIES OF 
RALLIES AND APPEARANCES IN AND AROUND CARACAS (REFTEL C).  CHAVEZ 
FAILED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS PREPARATORY WORK THOUGH, AND HAD 
LITTLE NEW TO SAY.  INDEED, CHAVEZ\' CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY 
OF HIS COUP ATTEMPT IS REMARKABLE FOR HOW LITTLE NEWS IT GENERATED. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
MASS AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL AND A VISIT TO THE PLAZA BOLIVAR 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS \"DAY OF DIGNITY\" WITH AN 11:00 A.M. 
WREATH LAYING CEREMONY AT THE TOMB OF NATIONAL HERO SIMON BOLIVAR 
AT THE NATIONAL PANTHEON.  AT 3:00 P.M., HE ATTENDED A MASS WITH 
HIS SUPPORTERS AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL WHICH IS LOCATED ON PLAZA 
BOLIVAR.  POLOFF OBSERVED THAT THE CATHEDRAL WAS FILLED TO 
CAPACITY.  AFTER MASS, CHAVEZ MOVED TO THE CENTER OF THE PLAZA TO 
THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF SIMON BOLIVAR TO ADDRESS A CROWD OF ABOUT 
1,500.  CHAVEZ CAMPAIGN WORKERS WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAINTAIN PEACE 
AND ORDER, AND USED BULLHORNS TO ASK THE CROWD TO REMAIN CALM AND 
\"RESPECTFUL ON THIS DAY OF DIGNITY.\"  AFTER LAYING A WREATH AT THE 
BASE OF THE STATUE, CHAVEZ DECLARED THAT THE GOAL OF HIS CANDIDACY 
IS TO ACHIEVE \"A MORE PERFECT DEMOCRACY AND HAPPINESS FOR ALL.\" 
CHAVEZ THEN CALLED FOR \"RENOVATION AND REBIRTH TO (ENABLE) 
VENEZUELA TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF BOLIVAR BY THE YEAR 2000.\"  HE 
DID NOT ENUNCIATE WHAT THE GOALS OF BOLIVAR ARE.  CAMPAIGN SIGNS AT 
THE PLAZA CARRIED THE SLOGAN \"FOR A PATRIOTIC DEMOCRACY.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
ONLY 5,000 TURN OUT FOR RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (C)  POLOFF AND PRESS REPORTS ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 5,000 PEOPLE 
ATTENDED CHAVEZ\' RALLY AT PLAZA CARACAS.  THE THEME OF THE RALLY 
WAS \"IT IS THE PEOPLE\'S TURN (LE TOCA AL PUEBLO).\"  CHAVEZ HAD 
EARLIER (REFTEL C) PROMISED THAT HE WOULD DRAW 50,000 PEOPLE TO 
THIS RALLY WHICH WAS TO MARK THE COMPLETION OF SERIES OF RALLIES 
HELD IN AND AROUND CARACAS OVER THE PREVIOUS THREE WEEKS.  POLOFF 
ESTIMATES THAT ONLY 1,000 TO 1,500 OF THE PEOPLE PRESENT WERE 
CONFIRMED CHAVEZ SUPPORTS.  MOST OF THESE SUPPORTERS WERE FROM THE 
WORKING OR MARGINAL CLASSES, AND MANY WERE FROM OUTSIDE CARACAS. 
MOST WHO ATTENDED THE RALLY WERE CURIOUS BY-STANDERS RATHER THAN 
ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE RALLY, AND MANY ONLY PASSED BY DURING 
RUSH HOUR ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WORK. 
 
4.  (C)  CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS MANNED TABLES IN THE SQUARE PASSING OUT 
FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT(MVR) LITERATURE AND REGISTERING NEW PARTY 
MEMBER.  REGISTRANTS WERE ASKED TO INDICATE WHICH \"FRONT THEY 
WOULD BE JOINING IN THE FIGHT TO \"REJUVENAE VENEZUELA AND 
VINDICATE THE DREAM OF BOLIVAR.\" EACH \"FRONT\" CORRESPONDS TO ONE 
OF VENEZUELA\'S TATES.  NEW PARTY MEMBERS WERE ALSO ASSIGNED TO 
DTACHMENTS TO MOBILIZE THE \"ABSTAINERS\" TO TURN OUTFOR CHAVEZ ON 
ELECTION DAY.  PRIOR TO CHAVEZ\' ARIVAL, ANNOUNCERS CALLED FORTH 
OFFICERS WHO PARTIIPATED IN CHAVEZ\' COUP ATTEMPT INDICATING THE 
OBECTIVES SEIZED BY THE OFFICERS. 
 
5.  (C)  WHEN CHVEZ ARRIVED AT THE RALLY, HE BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE CROWD AND PROMPTLY PROCEEDED TO ASSEMBLE JOURALISTS AND 
CAMERAMEN AROUND HIM.  AFTER ABOUT TWNTY MINUTES OBSERVING THE 
BACKS OF CAMERAMEN, TH CROWD BEGAN TO WHISTLE AND CALL FOR CHAVEZ 
TO ADRESS HIM.  CHAVEZ USHERED THE NEWSMEN AWAY, AND TUNED TOWARD 
THE CROWD WHILE DONNING HIS SIGNATURERED BERET.  LIKE POLITICAL 
RALLIES THE WORLD OVE, THERE WERE BANNERS, BALLOONS CORRESPONDING 
TO HE COLORS OF THE FLAG, AND BABY KISSING -- EXCEPT HERE THE BABY 
WORE CAMOUFLAGE. 
 
--------------------------- 
AND THE NEWS IS? -- NO NEWS 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  DURING HIS SPEECH, CHAVEZ FAILED TO CAPITALIZE ON THREE 
WEEKS OF PREPARATORY WORK BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS 
ANNIVERSARY TO MAKE ANY NEW PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  ONCE AGAIN, CHAVEZ 
ASSERTED THAT HE DID NOT LAUNCH A COUP AGAINST DEMOCRACY SINCE 
DEMOCRACY DOES NOT EXIST IN VENEZUELA.  CHAVEZ RECEIVED THE MOST 
APPLAUSE FOR HIS OFT STATED REMARK THAT HE ACTED \"AGAINST 
CORRUPTOCRACY, AGAINST THE GENOCIDE OF [IMPEACHED PRESIDENT] CARLOS 
ANDRES PEREZ.\"  CHAVEZ CONTINUED, \"THE FOURTH OF FEBRUARY HAS NOT 
DIED, AND NOW COMES ANOTHER BATTLE OF THE PEOPLE, THE ONE WHICH 
WILL LIBERATE [THE NATION] -- THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER [ELECTION 
DAY].\"  COMMENTING THAT HE IS NOW \"OPERATING ON THE ENEMY TERRAIN\" 
AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD), CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT (COPEI), AND 
MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM (MAS) PARTIES AND AGAINST FRONT-RUNNER 
IRENE SAEZ, CHAVEZ SAID \"THE WEAPONS [WE WILL USE ON ELECTION DAY] 
ARE THE SAME:  THE POPULAR VOTE.\"  CHAVEZ ASSERTED THAT NINETY 
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SUPPORTED HIS COUP ATTEMPT.  CHAVEZ 
CONTINUES TO CALL FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE \"DO NOTHING\" CONGRESS, 
AND FOR THE CREATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS (CONSTITUYENTE). 
HE DID ADD THAT HE WOULD RENOUNCE THE PRESIDENCY IF THE PEOPLE DID 
NOT SUPPORT HIS CALL FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS, SOMETHING 
CHAVEZ CONSIDERS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 
 
7.  (U)  RATHER THAN COVERING THE RALLY DIRECTLY, THE CARACAS\' 
LEADING DAILY \"EL UNIVERSAL\" CHOSE INSTEAD TO RUN A FULL PAGE 
ARTICLE ENTITLED \"CHAVISTAS COMMEMORATE THE COUP IGNORING THE 
JUDGEMENTS AGAINST IT.\"  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GUSTAVO TARRE BRICENO, 
ASKING RHETORICALLY IF IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE TO 
DIE IN THE COUP, ASKED \"WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF CHAVEZ, 
INSTEAD OF LAUNCHING A COUP, FOUNDED A PARTY INSTEAD?\"  SOME 
COMMENTATORS NOTED THAT THE COUP AWOKE VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL 
ESTABLISHMENT TO THE NEED FOR A NEW NATIONAL PROJECT AND FOR NEW 
LEADERSHIP SO THAT COUPS COULD BE AVOIDED IN THE FUTURE. 
HISTORIAN MANUEL CABALLERO COMMENTED, \"IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE 
HEIGHT OF CYNICISM THAT THE CHAVISTAS ARE CELEBRATING THE 4F 
(FOURTH OF FEBRUARY) AS A DAY OF NATIONAL DIGNITY WHEN THE OPPOSITE 
IS TRUE. . . .  [HE] IS A TRAITOR OF THE NATION (PATRIA). . . . 
CHAVEZ IS CIVIL WAR.\"  OTHER CARACAS DAILIES RAN BRIEF ARTICLES 
WHICH ESSENTIALLY NOTED THE EVENT. 
 
---------------------- 
27N TO SUPPORT CHAVEZ? 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  THE CARACAS DAILY \"EL GLOBO\" INTERVIEWED A PARTICIPANT IN 
THE FAILED NOVEMBER 27, 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, REAR ADMIRAL LUIS 
CABRERA AGUIRRE, REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE 
27N WOULD SUPPORT CHAVEZ.  CABRERA, WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE RALLY, 
SAID TO \"EL GLOBO,\" \"WE HOPE TO ESTABLISH A BLOCK OF OPINION, NOT 
A POLITICAL PARTY, THAT IS INTENDED TO INFORM ALL OF THE VISION OF 
THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S FAILURE TO GENERATE LARGE CROWDS FOR HIS \"DAY OF 
DIGNITY\" INDICATES THAT HIS PARTY IS HAVING PROBLEMS MOBILIZING 
SUPPORTERS.  HOWEVER, THESE PROBLEMS DID NOT UNDERMINE HIS CENTRAL 
PURPOSE:  TO WIN PUBLICITY.  BY CHOOSING RELATIVELY SMALL LOCATIONS 
FOR HIS THREE EVENTS -- THE CATHEDRAL, PLAZA BOLIVAR, AND PLAZA 
CARACAS -- EACH EVENT APPEARED ON CAMERA TO BE WELL ATTENDED. 
RECENT POLLIN SHOWS THAT CHAVEZ HAS PUSHED HIS POPULARITY LEVEL TO 
11 PERCENT, PUTTING HIM IN SECOND PLACE BEHIND IRENE SAEZ.  WITH 
THE MAJOR PARTIES YET TO IDENTIFY THEIR CANDIDATES, THE PRESS HAS 
FOCUSED ON SAEZ AND CHAVEZ AS THE CENTRAL PERSONALITIES OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND REFERS TO THEM AS THE \"THE BEAUTY AND 
THE BEAST.\"

------- 
 
1.  (C) CORRUPT POLITICIANS, FAILED INSTITUTIONS, AND POPULAR 
DESPAIR CHARACTERIZE VENEZUELAN POLITICS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
HUGO CHAVEZ TOLD AMBASSADOR DURING A SEPTEMBER 25 MEETING.  CHAVEZ 
SAID HIS CANDIDACY REPRESENTS THE LAST HOPE OF A FRUSTRATED AND 
DESPERATE PEOPLE.  THE SUCCESS OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID, AND HIS 
GOVERNMENT, WILL DETERMINE WHETHER VENEZUELA CONTINUES TO MODERNIZE 
WITHIN ITS DEMOCRATIC TRADITION OR FALLS INTO DOMESTIC 
CONFRONTATION AND CIVIL WAR.  CHAVEZ TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS 
SUCCESS DEPENDS IN GOOD MEASURE ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. 
HE COMPLAINED OF A \"DIRTY WAR\" CARRIED OUT BY HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES 
TO SOW DOUBT AND CONFUSION AMONG FOREIGN INVESTORS AND GOVERNMENTS. 
HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A DEMOCRAT WHO RESPECTED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY IN GOVERNMENT. 
HE DECLARED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF ONGOING PRIVATIZATION AND SAID HE 
WOULD RESPECT ALL GOV FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS COMMITMENTS, AND 
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  HE RECOGNIZED THE THREAT POSED BY DRUG 
TRAFFICKING, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND RELATED CRIMES, AND PROMISED TO 
MAKE COUNTERNARCOTICS COOPERATION A KEYSTONE OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  HE 
ALSO NOTED THAT HE WAS PREPARING A LIST OF MINISTERS WHICH WILL 
\"SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE.\" HE ASSERTED THAT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 
WAS ESSENTIAL TO \"RE-LEGITIMIZING\" THE STATE AND WINNING BACK THE 
CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE.  HE COMPLAINED THAT THE CURRENT 
CONSTITUTION WAS \"ARMORED\" AGAINST REFORM EFFORTS, AND THAT 
ENTRENCHED POLITICAL PARTIES WOULD RESIST REFORM EFFORTS.  HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED OUR CONCERN THAT ANY REFORM TAKE PLACE WITHIN A 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, BUT SAID IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO BREAK 
WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO CREATE A NEW ONE.  HE SAID 
HIS MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR WOULD ALLOW \"A LOT OF PEOPLE TO 
BREATHE EASIER,\" AND LOOKED FORWARD TO A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
MEETING HUGO CHAVEZ 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C) AMBASSADOR MET SEPTEMBER 25 AT THE RESIDENCE WITH LEADING 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FORMER COUPSTER HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE 
BREAKFAST MEETING, WHICH LASTED MORE THAN THREE HOURS, WAS 
AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST MEETING WITH CHAVEZ.  POLCOUNS ACCOMPANIED THE 
AMBASSADOR.  CHAVEZ WAS ACCOMPANIED BY CARLOS TINOCO, CHAVEZ\'S 
DESIGNATED LIAISON TO THE EMBASSY. 
 
3.  (C) AMBASSADOR TOLD CHAVEZ THAT HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM 
WASHINGTON, WHERE CONCERN ABOUT VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
SITUATION WAS PALPABLE.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE WAS MEETING WITH 
MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO LAY OUT THE U.S. POSITION 
REGARDING THE ELECTIONS AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
WHICH RESULTS.  AMBASSADOR MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
--  WE SUPPORT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  WE WANT FREE, FAIR, AND 
TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS.  WE WILL RECOGNIZE WHOMEVER WINS THOSE 
ELECTIONS.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR EXCELLENT BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH VENEZUELA FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS. 
 
--  THE BASIS OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN A SHARED 
COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER 
TATTERED VENEZUELA\'S INSTITUTIONS MIGHT BE, THEY ARE FUNCTIONING 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  ANY EFFORT TO REFORM THE STATE THROUGH A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY MUST PRESERVE CONTINUITY OF DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS.  JUDICIAL REFORM IS ESSENTIAL, IS UNDER WAY, AND IS 
SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.  WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENT LEGISLATURE, THERE IS 
NO DEMOCRACY. 
 
--  CHAVEZ\'S RHETORIC REGARDING A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN 
PROVOCATIVE AND CONFUSING.  HE SOUNDS AS THOUGH HE IS PROMOTING NOT 
A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, BUT A REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA DESIGNED TO 
CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONS AND INSTALL A TO-BE- 
DETERMINED FORM OF GOVERNMENT. 
 
--  FOREIGN INVESTMENT REQUIRES CLEAR AND RELIABLE RULES. 
UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY CHAVEZ\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RHETORIC HAS 
PUT THE BRAKES ON MUCH INVESTMENT.  THE PROSPECT OF CONTINUING 
UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY A CONFLICTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY PROCESS 
WOULD STOP FOREIGN INVESTMENT COLD, AND WOULD LEAVE VENEZUELA 
WITHOUT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL IT NEEDS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A SITUATION FOR THE NEXT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE 
DISASTROUS. 
 
--------------------- 
CHAVEZ SAYS HIS PIECE 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (C) CHAVEZ SAID HE WELCOMED THE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
SAYING, \"A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BREATHE EASIER.\"  HE NOTED THAT ALL 
VENEZUELANS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S. TO VENEZUELA\'S 
WELL-BEING, BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS 
OWN ADMIRATION FOR THE U.S., WHICH HE TRACED TO HIS EARLY LOVE OF 
BASEBALL AND HIS CONTACT WITH U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS DURING HIS 
SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES.  HE REGRETTED THAT HIS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE U.S. HAD FALLEN ON HARD TIMES FOLLOWING THE 1992 COUP 
ATTEMPT AND HIS IMPRISONMENT, BUT LOOKED FORWARD TO \"RE- 
ESTABLISHING\" THIS RELATIONSHIP AND WORKING TOGETHER CLOSELY IN THE 
EVENT HE WERE ELECTED. 
 
5.  (C) CHAVEZ COMPLAINED THAT HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES HAD SULLIED 
HIS IMAGE THROUGH A \"DIRTY WAR,\" ACCUSING HIM OF BEING EVERYTHING 
FROM A COMMUNIST TO A WIFE-BEATER.  HE EXPRESSED AMAZEMENT AT THE 
INVENTIVENESS OF SOME OF HIS ENEMIES--HIS FAVORITE RUMOR WAS THAT 
HE ALWAYS SET A PLACE AT HIS DINNER TABLE FOR BOLIVAR--AND SAID 
THAT HE OFTEN FELT \"LIKE THE ACCUSED IN THE DOCK,\" RESPONDING TO 
ONE ALLEGATION AFTER ANOTHER.  HE THEN MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
--  I AM A DEMOCRAT.  MY ROLE IN THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT HAS RAISED 
MANY DOUBTS ABOUT MY COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.  \"I KNOW 
YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ME, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY.\"  THE 1992 COUP 
ATTEMPT, SEEN IN HINDSIGHT, WAS \"INCORRECT.\"  HOWEVER, MY OWN 
FORMATION WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES, AND THE BLATANT CORRUPTION 
WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, HAD LEFT ME 
AND MY COLLEAGUES LITTLE CHOICE. 
 
--  I AM THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLE, AND WITHOUT ME DEMOCRACY WILL NOT 
LAST.  VENEZUELAN POLITICS IS CHARACTERIZED BY CORRUPT POLITICIANS, 
FAILED INSTITUTIONS, AND POPULAR DESPAIR.  THE HISTORY OF THE LAST 
DECADE, FROM THE 1989 SOCIAL UPRISING TO MY OWN CANDIDACY, HAS BEEN 
A SERIES OF EFFORTS BY THE \"PEOPLE\" TO MAKE AN INCREASINGLY 
ISOLATED AND INSULATED POLITICAL CLASS RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE 
COUNTRY.  THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES TO 
RESPOND TO THE \"CRY OF THE PEOPLE\" HAS DRIVEN VENEZUELA DANGEROUSLY 
NEAR THE BRINK OF SOCIAL CHAOS AND CIVIL WAR.  MY CANDIDACY HAS 
REIGNITED HOPE THAT MEANINGFUL POLITICAL CHANGE COULD BE ACHIEVED 
THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS.  IF THAT HOPE IS FRUSTRATED VENEZUELA 
WOULD FACE A DARK AND FOREBODING FUTURE. 
 
--  I WILL REFORM THE STATE THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY. 
THE STATE NEEDS TO BE \"RE-LEGITIMIZED\" AND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 
PEOPLE WON BACK.  THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS THROUGH A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THE POPULARITY OF THE CONCEPT OF SUCH AN 
ASSEMBLY IS PROOF THAT IT REPRESENTS A PROFOUND LONGING OF THE 
PEOPLE.  FURTHER PROOF OF THIS IS THE EFFORT BY OTHER PARTIES TO 
GET ON BOARD THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY BANDWAGON.  THE CONSENSUS 
FORMING AROUND THE IDEA OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER, 
HIDES THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE IDEA IN NARROW BUT STILL 
POWERFUL SECTORS OF POLITICAL SOCIETY.  I WORRY THAT I WILL NOT 
HAVE THE STRENGTH IN THE CONGRESS AND THE STATE ASSEMBLIES TO WIN 
APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT NECESSARY TO CALL A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  IF THE PARTIES WERE TO FRUSTRATE THE 
STRONG DESIRE OF THE PEOPLE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, I MIGHT 
HAVE TO BREAK WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO CREATE A NEW 
ORDER.  WHATEVER PATH IS TAKEN TO SUCH AN ASSEMBLY, IT WOULD NOT BE 
A REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA, BUT AN ELECTED BODY WITH SHARPLY DEFINED 
RESPONSIBILITIES.  PERHAPS MY MOST REVOLUTIONARY IDEA, IN THE 
CONTEXT OF VENEZUELAN POLITICS, IS THE DEMAND THAT ELECTIONS FOR 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY BY DIRECT, AND CANDIDATE AND 
GEOGRAPHY-BASED, AND NOT PARTY LIST-BASED. 
 
--  I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND I WANT 
MORE OF IT.  I KNOW THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS VITAL TO ECONOMIC 
GROWTH AND WELL-BEING.  I WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ASSUAGE 
THE CONCERNS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTORS.  MY POSITION 
REGARDING ECONOMIC REFORM AND INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MISREPRESENTED IN 
THE PRESS. I SUPPORT THE ONGOING PRIVATIZATION OF STATE ASSETS, 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PDVSA (THE STATE OIL COMPANY).  I WILL 
RECOGNIZE ALL CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE 
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.  \"MY GOD, MY GOVERNMENT\'S SUCCESS WILL DEPEND 
ON ATTRACTING INVESTMENT.  I HAVE MORE INTEREST--BOTH PERSONALLY 
AND POLITICALLY--THAN ANYONE ELSE IN A GOOD INVESTMENT CLIMATE.\" 
 
--  I WANT TO SELL MORE OIL TO THE U.S.  THE ENERGY RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA JOINS BOTH COUNTRIES AT THE HIP.  IT 
IS IN BOTH COUNTRIES\' INTEREST TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE THAT 
RELATIONSHIP.  I REGRET THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS REGARDING PDVSA, 
CITGO, AND PDVSA HEAD LUIS GIUSIT HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED.  \"I 
WILL WANT TO SELL YOU MORE AND MORE OIL.\" 
 
--  I WILL WORK TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DRUG TRAFFICKING, MONEY 
LAUNDERING, AND RELATED CRIMES PRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  I WILL MAKE SUCCESSFUL COUNTERNARCOTICS 
COOPERATION A KEYSTONE OF MY GOVERNMENT. 
 
--  I WILL PRESERVE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ARMED FORCES.  THE 
ARMED FORCES ARE VITAL TO THE STABILITY OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY, 
AND CANNOT BE POLITICIZED.  ALLEGATIONS THAT I WOULD REINCORPORATE 
IN THE ARMED FORCES THOSE OFFICERS CASHIERED FOLLOWING THE 1992 
COUP ATTEMPT ARE FALSE.  I WILL NOT PUNISH THOSE OFFICERS WHO 
OPPOSED THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT. 
 
--  I WILL SURPRISE YOU WITH MY CABINET MEMBERS.  I HAVE MADE NO 
COMMITMENTS REGARDING WHO WOULD FILL MY MINISTERIAL POSITIONS.  I 
HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL, RECOGNIZING THAT WHO I SELECT FOR THESE 
POSITIONS WOULD SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO OBSERVERS AND INVESTORS 
ABOUT HIS GOVERNMENT.  I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP MY CABINET CHOICES 
UNDER WARPS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  \"YOU WILL BE SURPRISED.  I 
WILL PICK A VERY GOOD GROUP.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR DURING THIS FIRST MEETING. 
HE WAS AT PAINS TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH US TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, SHOULD HE BE ELECTED, AND 
HIS OWN PERSONAL ADMIRATION AND AFFINITY FOR THE U.S.  HE DID NOT 
RAISE THE VISA ISSUE DURING THE MEETING, LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAD 
TOLD HIS ADVISORS THAT OUR ANSWER WOULD BE NEGATIVE.  HOWEVER, HE 
DID SAY TO THE AMBASSADOR ALONE THAT HE APPRECIATED AND FULLY 
RESPECTED WHAT THE SECRETARY SAID ABOUT THE SUBJECT DURING THE 
OASGA IN JUNE, AND HOW THE AMBASSADOR HAS HANDLED IT PUBLICLY.  HE 
ALSO NOTED, \"I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY I CAN WATCH A BASEBALL GAME 
IN YANKEE STADIUM.\" 
 
6.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ALSO INTENT ON CASTING THE MEETING AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS HE REALLY IS, WITHOUT THE 
NEGATIVE FILTER OF THE MEDIA OR HIS ENEMIES.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
AT THIS POINT HE CAN ONLY INSIST THAT HE IS A DEMOCRAT, AND WILL 
NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT HE IS ONE UNTIL HE ATTAINS OFFICE.  THE 
SAME IS TRUE REGARDING HIS PROCLAIMED COMMITMENT TO PRIVATIZATION, 
ECONOMIC REFORM, AND THE DESIRE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT. HE SEEMED 
RESIGNED TO THIS, SAYING, \"I HOPE GOD GRANTS ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PROVE THIS TO YOU.\" 
 
7.  (C) WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CHAVEZ, HOWEVER, AROUND THE 
ISSUE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  AT THIS POINT, HE SEEMS 
INTENT ON BREAKING WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO 
ESTABLISH THE ASSEMBLY, FOLLOWING A POPULAR REFERENDUM.  THIS WOULD 
BE A PROVOCATIVE MOVE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO IMMEDIATE CONFRONTATION 
WITH THE CONGRESS AND MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL POLITICAL PARTIES. 
NEVERTHELESS, HE UNDERSTOOD AMBASSADOR\'S INSISTENCE ON MAINTAINING 
THE CONTINUITY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROCESS, AND THE NECESSITY OF COMPROMISING WITH HIS POLITICAL 
ENEMIES TO GUARANTEE CONTINUITY.  WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS TO 
WORK ON HIM REGARDING THE MEANS OF ESTABLISHING AN ASSEMBLY, SHOULD 
HE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN HIS LEAD IN THE POLLS AND WIN THE 
ELECTIONS.  THIS MEETING WAS A GOOD FIRST ENCOUNTER, AND WILL 
FACILITATE FURTHER CONTACT, BOTH WITH CHAVEZ AND WITH HIS TEAM.  IT 
WILL ALSO PROVIDE US WITH OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PUBLICLY TALK 
ABOUT THE BASIS OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, OUR COMMITMENT TO 
DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT, AND THE ROLE WE SEE FOR 
OURSELVES IN ENHANCING THE GOVERNABILITY OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT, 
WHOMEVER THAT MIGHT BE.

SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHIC REPORT: LUIS MIQUILENA: POLITICAL GODFATHER TO 
HUGO CHAVEZ 
 
CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
---------------------------------------- 
LUIS MIQUILENA:  CHAVEZ\'S RIGHT HAND MAN 
---------------------------------------- 
 
1.  (C) LUIS MIQUILENA IS LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HUGO 
CHAVEZ\'S POLITICAL GODFATHER AND CONFIDENT.  HE WAS THE KEY 
INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN CHAVEZ AND LEFTIST POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE 
RUN-UP TO THE FAILED FEBRUARY 1992 COUP ATTEMPT.  HE ALSO ORGANIZED 
CHAVEZ\'S 1994 VISIT TO CUBA FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON. 
SINCE THEN, HE HAS WORKED TO BUILD A POLITICAL BASE FOR CHAVEZ, 
HELPING TO TRANSFORM CHAVEZ\'S BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT- 
2000 (MBR-2000) INTO A POLITICAL PARTY--THE FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT 
(MVR), AND BUILDING ALLIANCES WITH LEFT AND CENTER-LEFT PARTIES 
SUCH AS THE HOMELAND FOR ALL (PPT) AND THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS 
SOCIALISM (MAS).  CHAVEZ TRUSTS MIQUILENA AND RELIES ON HIM TO VET 
VISITORS, SET CAMPAIGN PRIORITIES, AND MANAGE HIS POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES.  HE HAS NAMED MIQUILENA HEAD OF CAMPAIGN ADMINISTRATION 
AND FINANCE.  IF ELECTED, IT IS RUMORED THAT MIQUILENA WOULD BECOME 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR (IN CHARGE OF VENEZUELA\'S CIVILIAN SECURITY 
APPARATUS AND NEXT IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION). 
 
------------------- 
THE FORMATIVE YEARS 
------------------- 
 
2.  (U) THE SEPTUAGENARIAN MIQUILENA IS OF THE SAME POLITICAL 
GENERATION AS PRESIDENT CALDERA AND DEMOCRATIC ACTION PARTY 
CANDIDATE LUIS ALFARO.  BORN IN CORO, FALCON STATE, IN 1919, 
MIQUILENA STARTED HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND 
THE NASCENT TRADE UNION MOVEMENT. 
 
3.  (U) IN THE 1940\'S MIQUILENA WAS A PRINCIPAL LEADER OF THE 
POWERFUL BUS DRIVERS UNION OF CARACAS.  HE SPEAR-HEADED SEVERAL 
STRIKES DURING THE ISAIAS MEDINA ANGARITA REGIME.  AT A TIME WHEN 
MAINSTREAM COMMUNISTS WERE SUPPORTING MEDINA, MIQUILENA, AN AVOWED 
COMMUNIST, PRESSURED THE MEDINA AND HIS RULING JUNTA FOR CHANGE 
THROUGH THE THREAT OF CRIPPLING TRANSPORTATION STRIKES.   HE WAS 
HARASSED BY STATE SECURITY AGENTS, PLAYING A CAT AND MOUSE GAME, 
AND WAS JAILED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. 
 
4.  (U) NEITHER A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION NOR JAIL TIME SOFTENED 
MIQIUILENA.  HE CONFRONTED THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF ROMULO BETANCOURT 
AND WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST PRISONERS OF THIS REGIME. 
UPON HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1946, HIS FAILURE TO RESPECT THE 
RESOLUTIONS OF THE FIRST COMMUNIST CONGRESS ALIENATED THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY, AND HIS RADICAL SPLINTER GROUP OF TROTSKYITES, THE BLACK 
COMMUNISTS, WERE EXPELLED BY THE PARTY. 
 
5.  (U) IN THE MIDST OF THIS TURMOIL, MIQUILENA ORGANIZED AND LED 
THE 1947 CARACAS BUS DRIVERS STRIKE, PARALYZING THE CAPITAL FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR.  THROUGH THIS ACTION, 
MIQUILENA WAS ABLE TO SECURE FOR THE UNION MEMBERSHIP THE SAME 
WORKING CONDITIONS AND BENEFITS THAT OTHER WORKERS WERE AFFORDED BY 
THE NEW LABOR LAW BUT HAD BEEN DENIED TO BUS DRIVERS. 
 
---------- 
MIDDLE AGE 
---------- 
 
6.  (U) FOLLOWING HIS OUSTER FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, MIQUILENA 
HELPED FOUND THE REPUBLICAN UNION MOVEMENT (URD), A LEFTIST 
POLITICAL PARTY SUPPORTED BY URBAN PROFESSIONALS WHICH BECAME THE 
MODEL FOR THE PPT AND THE MAS.  MIQUILENA WON A SEAT IN THE 
CONGRESS FOLLOWING THE 1958 FALL OF THE PEREZ JIMENEZ DICTATORSHIP. 
 
7.  (C) DURING THIS PERIOD, MIQUILENA WAS ALSO IN CONTACT WITH 
VENEZUELA\'S GROWING GUERILLA MOVEMENT.  HE WAS ACCUSED BY HIS 
ENEMIES OF MANAGING GUERILLA FUNDS AND USING THE URD AS AN URBAN 
POLITICAL FRONT FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  THESE SAME ENEMIES TRACE 
MIQUILENA\'S FORTUNE TO THIS PERIOD, ALLEGING THAT HE ABSCONDED WITH 
GUERILLA MONEY FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ARMED MOVEMENT, AND 
THAT HE USED HIS POSITION AS DIRECTOR OF THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTE OF 
POPULAR CREDIT (IMCP) TO EMBEZZLE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY.  HE WAS 
NEVER CHARGED WITH ANY SUCH CRIME. 
 
8.  (U) IN THE SIXTIES, MIQUILENA FORMED AN IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP 
WITH JOSE VICENTE RANGEL.  TOGETHER THEY FOUNDED THE NEWSPAPER EL 
CLARIN, WHICH WAS THE MOUTHPIECE FOR LEFTIST POLITICS.  AGAIN, HIS 
ENEMIES ACCUSED HIM OF USING EL CLARIN TO SUPPORT ARMED SUBVERSION. 
WHEN RANGEL MADE HIS UNSUCCESSFUL RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 1973, 
MIQUILENA WAS HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER. 
 
---------------- 
THE GOLDEN YEARS 
---------------- 
 
9.  (C) UNTIL RECENTLY, MIQUILENA HAS BEEN LIVING THE LIFE OF A 
WEALTHY CATTLE RANCHER IN BARINAS STATE, CHAVEZ\'S HOME STATE.  IT 
WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT HE MET CHAVEZ AND TOOK HIM UNDER HIS 
WING.  DURING CHAVEZ\'S PLANNING FOR HIS 1992 COUP ATTEMPT, 
MIQUILENA MANAGED CHAVEZ\'S EFFORTS TO BUILD CIVILIAN SUPPORT FOR 
HIS MILITARY INSURRECTION.  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THIS COURTING 
WAS THE RADICAL CAUSE PARTY (LCR), WHICH REJECTED CHAVEZ\'S 
OVERTURES, FEARING THAT A FAILED COUP WOULD SHORT-CIRCUIT LCR\'S 
EFFORTS TO CREATE A POLITICAL PROFILE FOR ITSELF INDEPENDENT OF THE 
RULING POLITICAL PARTIES:  COPEI AND AD. 
 
10. (C) FOLLOWING THE FAILED COUP, AND DURING CHAVEZ\'S TIME IN 
PRISON, MIQUILENA KEPT IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE COUPSTER. 
MIQUILENA SAW IN CHAVEZ THE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH HE COULD BREAK 
THE TRADITIONAL PARTY STRANGLEHOLD ON VENEZUELAN POLITICS.  VIEWING 
CHAVEZ AND \"CHAVISMO\" AS A SOCIAL MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD SWAMP 
TRADITIONAL POLITICS, MIQUILENA HAS FOLLOWED A TWO-STAGE STRATEGY. 
FIRST, HE BURNISHED CHAVEZ\'S RADICAL CREDENTIALS--ORGANIZING A TRIP 
TO CUBA AND MAINTAINING LINKS TO RADICAL LEFTIST PARTIES.  THIS WAS 
DESIGNED TO CREATE A POLITICAL PROFILE FOR CHAVEZ DRAMATICALLY 
DIFFERENT FROM HIS COMPETITORS IN THE LCR, PPT, AND MAS.  SECOND, 
ONCE ESTABLISHED AS A MAJOR CANDIDATE, MIQUILENA OVERSAW CHAVEZ\'S 
EFFORTS TO BUILD HIS OWN POLITICAL PARTY AND TO ALLY HIMSELF WITH 
PPT AND MAS--THUS PROVIDING CHAVEZ A MEANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
NOVEMBER 8 REGIONAL ELECTIONS. 
 
11. (C) CHAVEZ HAS MADE MIQUILENA DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND 
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND THE MVR.  MIQUILENA HAS USED 
HIS OWN WEALTH TO HELP FINANCE THE CAMPAIGN, BUT HAS ALSO 
SUCCESSFULLY REACHED OUT TO OTHER WEALTHY FARMERS AND BUSINESSMEN 
TO PROVIDE MONEY TO THE CAMPAIGN.  CHAVEZ RELIES ON MIQUILENA TO 
MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS CLEAN, AND THAT HE CANNOT BE CHARGED WITH 
SOLICITING OR ACCEPTING DIRTY MONEY.  MIQUILENA HAS DONE HIS JOB, 
SO FAR, VERY WELL, AND HAS PROTECTED HIS CANDIDATE.  HE REMAINS ONE 
OF THE FEW FIGURES WHOM CHAVEZ TRUSTS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A 
KEY ROLE IN THE MVR, THE CAMPAIGN, AND POSSIBLY THE GOVERNMENT, AS 
LONG AS HIS HEALTH HOLDS UP.

SUBJECT: HUGO CHAVEZ\'S PLAN TO TRANSFORM VENEZUELA:  PART I 
 
REF: CARACAS 03282 
 
CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR, REASON: 1.5 (D) 
 
------------------------ 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
------------------------ 
 
1. (U)  IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, HUGO CHAVEZ\'S POLITICAL PARTY, THE 
FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT (MVR) PUBLISHED ITS PLAN OF ACTION 
(REFTEL).  THIS DOCUMENTED WAS UPDATED IN OCTOBER WHEN CHAVEZ 
RELEASED HIS \"PLAN TO TRANSFORM VENEZUELA.\" 
 
2. (U)  CHAVEZ\'S PLAN CONSISTS OF FIVE-PARTS: 
 
--  POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM - THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY 
--  SOCIAL EQUILIBRIUM - SOCIAL JUSTICE 
--  ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM - COMPETITIVE, BUT HUMANE ECONOMIC PLANS 
--  TERRITORIAL EQUILIBRIUM - DECENTRALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
--  GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM - GLOBALIZATION AND SOVEREIGNTY 
 
3. (U) THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF 5 MESSAGES THAT WILL 
SUMMARIZE AND ANALYZE CHAVEZ\'S PLAN.  THIS INSTALLMENT WILL EXAMINE 
CHAVEZ\'S PLAN FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (CONSTITUYENTE). 
END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------- 
POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
--------------------- 
THE CALL FOR THE CONSTITUYENTE: 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (U)  CHAVEZ ARGUES THAT THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL SYSTEM IS 
CORRUPT AND MORALLY BANKRUPT AND BLOCKS ANY EFFORT TO CHANGE IT. 
ONLY THROUGH A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM CAN 
VENEZUELA ACHIEVE GREATNESS.  THIS TRANSFORMATION REQUIRES A NEW 
CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, WHICH CHAVEZ PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THROUGH A 
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (CONSTITUYENTE). 
 
5. (U)  THE CONSTITUYENTE WILL WIELD ITS TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER NOT 
JUST POLITICALLY (INSURING A REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS), BUT ALSO 
ECONOMICALLY (INSURING A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE ECONOMY), SOCIALLY 
(INSURING SOCIAL JUSTICE AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT) AND JURIDICALLY 
(INSURING AN IMPARTIAL LEGAL SYSTEM).  IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THE 
POSITIVE CHANGES ENVISIONED BY CHAVEZ ARISE FROM THE CONSTITUYENTE. 
 
 
THE CONSTITUYENTE PROCESS: 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (U)  THE PROCESS WILL CONSIST OF 5 DISTINCT PHASES:  ACTIVATION, 
CONTRACTUAL, CONVOCATION, MEETING, AND EXECUTION.  ACTIVATION WILL 
OCCUR UPON THE ELECTION OF CHAVEZ AS PRESIDENT.  THIS WILL BE 
QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY THE CONTRACTUAL PHASE, WHEREBY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ 
CALLS FOR A POPULAR REFERENDUM.  THE CONVOCATION OF THE 
CONSTITUYENTE, PHASE 3, WILL BE THE REFERENDUM.  THE ACTUAL 
ASSEMBLY AND AGREEMENT TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL BE PHASE 4, AND 
THE RATIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL 
END THE PROCESS. 
 
7. (U)  THE CONSTITUYENTE WILL BE A UNICAMERAL, REPRESENTATIVE 
BODY, WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT THAT \"WILL FORTIFY 
AND DEVELOP THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL GUARANTEE PUBLIC FREEDOM, 
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND REINSTITUTE A PARTICIPATIVE SYSTEM.\"  THE MEMBERS 
WILL BE ELECTED BY POPULAR VOTE, AND THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR EACH STATE WILL BE BASED ON THE POPULATION OF THAT STATE.  THE 
ASSEMBLY SHOULD HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.  NO 
REPRESENTATIVE CAN BE A CURRENT ELECTED OFFICIAL, JUDGE, OR UNION 
PRESIDENT.  FINALLY, THE MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE IMMUNITY DURING THEIR 
TENURE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY. 
 
8. (U)  ONCE THE ASSEMBLY COMPLETES ITS DELIBERATIONS AND PREPARES 
A NEW CONSTITUTION, THE FINAL PRODUCT MUST BE APPROVED BY A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF VOTERS.  DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD, THE EXISTING 
CONSTITUTION WILL REMAIN IN FORCE, UNLESS THE CONSTITUYENTE DECIDES 
OTHERWISE.  IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE CONSTITUYENTE WANTS, IT CAN 
DISSOLVE THE CONGRESS, REORGANIZE THE JUDICIARY, AND MODIFY THE 
STRUCTURE AND TERM OF OFFICE FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH; IT WILL HAVE 
COMPLETE POWER.  (NOTE.  CHAVEZ HAS DENIED THAT THE CONSTITUYENTE 
WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE POWER, BUT HAS NOT INDICATED WHAT MECHANISM 
WOULD LIMIT THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUYENTE.  END NOTE.) 
 
 
WHAT WILL THE NEW CONSTITUTION DO? 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (U)  THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL: 
 
--  REDEFINE THE EXECUTIVE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN A MORE 
PARTICIPATORY MANNER AND ALLOW FOR DEMONSTRATIONS OF PARTICIPATION 
IN THE FORM OF REFERENDA. 
 
--  MAKE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL.  JUDGES 
WILL BE POPULARLY ELECTED, INSTEAD OF APPOINTED BY CONGRESS. 
BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CLOGGED BY SMALL MATTERS, THE NEW 
SYSTEM SHOULD ALLOW FOR ALTERNATE SETTLEMENT METHODS, SUCH AS, 
MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION. 
 
--  CREATE A TRULY REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH THROUGH DIRECT 
ELECTIONS (PARTY LISTS AND PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WILL BE DONE 
AWAY WITH) AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH RECALL ELECTIONS. 
 
--  ESTABLISH A NEW, FOURTH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE MORAL BRANCH. 
THIS BRANCH WOULD CONSIST OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AN 
OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT ROLE: THE CONTROLLER GENERAL AND THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL.  IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CREATION OF A NEW 
OFFICER, THE OMBUDSMAN, AND A COORDINATING BODY FOR THE MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT, THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
THE CONTROLLER GENERAL, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.  THE MORAL BRANCH 
WILL BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GUARANTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
CHARACTER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTERACT BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE 
STATE.  THESE WOULD INCLUDE POLITICAL PARTIES, UNIONS, AND BUSINESS 
OR PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.  IT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO INSURE THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
 
THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (U)  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MUST TAKE ON A WATCHDOG ROLE FOR 
SOCIETY.  IT MUST ANALYZE, PLAN, AND EVALUATE THE BEST WAY TO 
MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER AND WELL-BEING.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, CHAVEZ WANTS 
A DECENTRALIZED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WITH FEWER MINISTRIES. 
LIKEWISE, IT MUST HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION TO DEAL WITH MARKET CRASHES 
OR DETERIORATIONS OF THE BUSINESS CLIMATE. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
11.(C)  THIS FIRST PART OF CHAVEZ\'S PLAN FOLLOWS CLOSELY THAT WHICH 
WAS LAID OUT IN THE MVR PLAN OF ACTION (REFTEL).  WHILE HE EXPOUNDS 
IN GREATER DETAIL HIS VISION OF THE CONSTITUYENTE, HE DOES NOT 
ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY HIS PROPOSAL FOR DRAMATIC 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  SPECIFICALLY, HE SIDESTEPS THE MEANS BY 
WHICH A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD BE CONVOKED (THE CURRENT 
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY), THE ROLE OF A 
REFERENDUM IN BUILDING POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL 
ASSEMBLY (THE ELECTORAL LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE REFERENDUM TO 
INVALIDATE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED RIGHTS), OR THE MEANS BY 
WHICH MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD BE ELECTED 
(CURRENT ELECTORAL LAW REQUIRES A MIXED SYSTEM OF DIRECT AND 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION).  NONE OF THESE ISSUES IS 
INSURMOUNTABLE.  A CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS TO REFORM THE CONSTITUTION 
EXISTS--THROUGH THE CONGRESS RE-WRITING THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN 
PRESENTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION TO THE PEOPLE FOR APPROVAL OR 
DISAPPROVAL IN A REFERENDUM.  FURTHERMORE, A MEANS TO ACCOMMODATE 
A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WITHIN THE CURRENT ORDER CAN BE 
FASHIONED--THROUGH AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION TO PERMIT THE 
CONVOCATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAVEZ\'S UNWILLINGNESS 
TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN HIS PLAN OF ACTION UNDERSCORES THE 
POLITICAL NATURE OF HIS PROPOSAL:  IT IS DESIGNED FIRST AND 
FOREMOST AS A POLITICAL MARKETING TOOL TO HIGHLIGHT HIS DESIRE TO 
COMPLETELY REFORM GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS IN VENEZUELA.

SUBJECT: HUGO CHAVEZ WINS IN A LANDSLIDE 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS WON THE DECEMBER 6 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN 
A LANDSLIDE, BESTING HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER 56 PERCENT TO 39 PERCENT. 
WITH MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE COUNTED, THE NATIONAL 
ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) DECLARED CHAVEZ THE WINNER LESS THAN THREE 
HOURS AFTER THE POLLS HAD CLOSED.  THESE ELECTIONS, A MODEL OF 
DECORUM AND ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY, BROUGHT APPROXIMATELY 
SEVENTY PERCENT OF VENEZUELA\'S ELECTORATE TO THE POLLS IN A 
PEACEFUL AND SUCCESSFUL VOTE OBSERVED BY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  DEFEATED CANDIDATE SALAS ROMER, IN A 
GRACIOUS AND STATESMANLIKE CONCESSION SPEECH, PROMISED TO WORK WITH 
CHAVEZ TO ACHIEVE THE \"RADICAL CHANGE\" NECESSARY TO REFORM 
VENEZUELA\'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, MAKE ITS DEMOCRACY MORE 
REPRESENTATIVE, AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF ITS 
CITIZENS.  CHAVEZ, FOR HIS PART, DECLARED THAT HE HAD \"NO POLITICAL 
ENEMIES,\" AND REACHED OUT TO HIS ELECTORAL ADVERSARIES, DECLARING 
THAT THROUGH RECONCILIATION VENEZUELA CAN OVERCOME ITS DIVISIONS 
AND CONFRONT ITS MAJOR CHALLENGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
CHAVEZ BY A LANDSLIDE 
--------------------- 
 
2.  HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS WAS PRONOUNCED THE WINNER OF THE DECEMBER 6 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BY THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) LESS 
THAN THREE HOURS AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED.  THE LIGHTENING VOTE 
COUNT, FACILITATED BY SUCCESSFUL AUTOMATION OF THE VOTING PROCESS, 
HAD TABULATED MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE FROM MORE THAN 
SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POLLING STATIONS, GIVING CHAVEZ A PROJECTED 
VICTORY OVER HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER BY A MARGIN OF 17 PERCENTAGE 
POINTS (56 PERCENT TO 39 PERCENT).  THIS IS THE LARGEST MARGIN OF 
VICTORY IN A VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1983, WHEN 
JAIME LUSINCHI BEAT RAFAEL CALDERA BY 57 PERCENT TO 34 PERCENT. 
 
---------------------- 
A GOOD, CLEAN ELECTION 
---------------------- 
 
3.  THE DECEMBER 6 VOTE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY DECORUM AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.  IN CONTRAST TO THE NOVEMBER 8 REGIONAL 
ELECTIONS, QUICK VOTING WAS FACILITATED BY PUNCTUAL OPENING OF THE 
VOTING CENTERS, IMPROVED ORGANIZATION, AND A SIMPLER BALLOT. 
ALTHOUGH INITIAL ESTIMATES OF VOTER TURNOUT WERE A FULL 15 PERCENT 
HIGHER THAN THE NOVEMBER 8 VOTE (70 PERCENT TODAY;55 PERCENT 
NOVEMBER 8), VOTERS MOVED THROUGH THE VOTING CENTERS QUICKLY AND 
EASILY, ONLY RARELY EXPERIENCING LONG LINES OR WAITS.  THE INFORMAL 
CONSENSUS OF THE NEARLY 300 INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS INVITED TO 
WATCH THE ELECTIONS WAS THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE WELL RUN AND WELL 
RECEIVED.  AGAIN, OBSERVERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CARTER 
CENTER, THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE, THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE, THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTORAL 
SYSTEMS, THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES, AND OVER FORTY 
MEMBERS OF THIS EMBASSY, NOTED THE DETERMINATION OF VENEZUELAN 
VOTERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO EXPRESS THEIR DESIRE 
FOR SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CHANGE THROUGH THE ELECTORAL AND 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. 
 
-------------- 
SALAS CONCEDES 
-------------- 
 
4.  FOLLOWING THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF THE CNE DECLARING CHAVEZ THE 
PROJECTED WINNER OF THE ELECTIONS, CANDIDATE HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER 
OFFICIALLY CONCEDED VICTORY TO HUGO CHAVEZ.  SALAS ROMER, IN A 
GRACIOUS AND STATESMANLIKE FASHION, CONGRATULATED CHAVEZ FOR HIS 
VICTORY, AND PROMISED TO WORK WITH CHAVEZ TO ACHIEVE THE \"RADICAL 
CHANGE\" WHICH SO MANY VENEZUELANS WANT AND DEMAND FROM THEIR 
POLITICAL LEADERS.  SALAS ROMER SAID HE WOULD NOT RETIRE FROM 
POLITICS, BUT INSTEAD WOULD IMMERSE HIMSELF EVEN DEEPER IN THE 
EFFORT TO REFORM VENEZUELA\'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, MAKE ITS 
DEMOCRACY MORE REPRESENTATIVE, AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING 
OF ITS CITIZENS.  HE PUT CHAVEZ ON NOTICE THAT HE AND HIS 
SUPPORTERS WOULD HOLD HIM TO HIS WORD TO AFFECT RADICAL CHANGE 
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRACY AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CHAVEZ REACHES OUT TO HIS ADVERSARIES 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  CHAVEZ, IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 
CNE\'S PRONOUNCEMENT, SAID HE HAD NO \"POLITICAL ENEMIES\" AND CALLED 
ON HIS ELECTORAL ADVERSARIES TO WORK WITH HIM TO CONSTRUCT A NEW 
VENEZUELA.  HE REACHED OUT TO HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER AND HIS PARTY, 
PROYECTO VENEZUELA, ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION PARTY (AD), 
THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (COPEI), AND OTHERS, TO JOIN HIM IN HIS 
ATTACK ON THE CORRUPTION, IMPUNITY, AND POOR MANAGEMENT WHICH HAVE 
RENDERED THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WEAK, INEFFECTIVE, AND DESPISED. 
CHAVEZ SAID IT WAS TIME TO \"FORGIVE AND FORGET\" AND THAT ONLY 
THROUGH RECONCILIATION COULD VENEZUELA FIND THE UNITY TO CONFRONT 
ITS MAJOR CHALLENGES. 
 
------------------- 
AND TO THE MILITARY 
------------------- 
 
6.  CHAVEZ, DURING THE INTERVIEW, SAID HE HAD REQUESTED THE GOV TO 
BRING HOME FROM WASHINGTON GENERAL RAUL SALAZAR SO THAT SALAZAR 
COULD PREPARE TO BECOME CHAVEZ\'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  CHAVEZ ALSO 
PRAISED THE CURRENT MILITARY HIGH COMMAND FOR ITS STRONG, 
INSTITUTIONAL ROLE DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  DEFENSE MINISTER 
ADMIRAL TITO RINCON BRAVO, FOLLOWING THE CNE PRONOUNCEMENT, TOLD 
THE PRESS THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD CONTINUE ITS ROLE AS GUARANTOR 
OF THE CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND WOULD FULLY 
SUPPORT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  WE STILL AWAIT CHAVEZ\'S FIRST MAJOR PRONOUNCEMENTS AS 
PRESIDENT-ELECT, WHICH WILL COME LATER THIS EVENING.  HOWEVER, WE 
KNOW THAT CHAVEZ\'S ELECTION MARKS AN HISTORIC MILESTONE IN 
VENEZUELAN POLITICAL HISTORY, AND WILL PRESENT THIS COUNTRY NEW AND 
SPECIAL CHALLENGES IN THE MONTHS TO COME.  THE PEACEFUL VOTE AND 
THE CELEBRATIONS WHICH FOLLOWED THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF CHAVEZ\'S 
VICTORY--WHICH HAVE NOT FEATURED ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE OR 
DISTURBANCE--ARE A TRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CNE, THE 
PREPARATION OF THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES CHARGED WITH 
MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER, AND THE MATURITY OF THE VENEZUELAN VOTER. 
IN THIS REGARD, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF DECEMBER 6, LIKE THE 
REGIONAL ELECTIONS OF NOVEMBER 8, WERE A VICTORY FOR VENEZUELAN 
DEMOCRACY AS MUCH AS FOR ANY SINGLE CANDIDATE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT HUGO CHAVEZ PAID POST ELECTION COURTESY 
CALLS ON ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, CHILEAN PRESIDENT 
EDUARDO FREI, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT HENRIQUE CARDOZO, AND COLOMBIAN 
PRESIDENT CARLOS PASTRANA DURING A DECEMBER 15-18 WHIRLWIND 
REGIONAL TOUR OF BRAZIL (REF B), ARGENTINA (REFS C AND D), AND 
COLOMBIA.  DURING THE TRIP HE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
INTEGRATION, ANNOUNCED THAT VENEZUELA WOULD CONSIDER SEEKING ENTRY 
TO MERCOSUR INDEPENDENT OF ITS ANDEAN COMMUNITY PARTNERS IF ANDEAN 
PACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MERCOSUR DID NOT SPEED UP, RESURRECTED THE 
IDEA OF CREATING A VENEZUELAN-BRAZILIAN BINATIONAL PETROLEUM 
COMPANY (LATER EXTENDING THE PROPOSAL TO COLOMBIA AS WELL), AND 
ANNOUNCED PRE-INAUGURATION PLANS TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES AND 
EUROPE TO ADVERTISE HIS GOVERNMENT\'S OPENNESS TO INTERNATIONAL 
INVESTMENT.  IN COLOMBIA, CHAVEZ URGED THE COLOMBIAN INSURGENTS TO 
DISARM, AND \"OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE.\"  CHAVEZ\' MERCOSUR REMARKS 
SPARKED CONTROVERSY AT HOME AND CONSTERNATION IN COLOMBIA.  HE 
SOUGHT TO SMOOTH RUFFLED FEATHERS BY CASTING HIS REMARKS IN LIGHT 
OF THE IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION, BUT LEFT CLEAR THAT 
VENEZUELA WOULD NOT ALLOW ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCOSUR TO BE HELD 
HOSTAGE BY ANDEAN PACT NEGOTIATIONS.   END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
MERCOSUR A \"STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE\" 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (U)  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS TRIP ON DECEMBER 15 IN BRAZIL WHERE HE 
RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THAT VENEZUELA MIGHT UNILATERALLY SEEK TO 
JOIN MERCOSUR (REF B).  MEETING WITH MENEM AND FREI IN BUENOS AIRES 
ON DECEMBER 16, CHAVEZ DECLARED VENEZUELA\'S INCORPORATION INTO 
MERCOSUR AS A \"STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE\" THAT WILL \"CONTRIBUTE TO 
DEEPENING THE PROCESS OF LATIN AMERICAN INTEGRATION\" (REF C).  THE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT PROPOSED THAT VENEZUELA\'S INTEGRATION INTO MERCOSUR 
SHOULD OCCUR IN TWO PHASES, BEGINNING WITH AN AGREEMENT SIMILAR TO 
THAT OF CHILE\'S, THEN MOVING FORWARD TO FULL INCORPORATION. 
 
----------------------------------- 
MERCOSUR STATEMENTS PROVOKE CONCERN 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U)  CHAVEZ\' MERCOSUR COMMENTS IN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL PROVOKED 
STRONG NEGATIVE REACTION AMONG VARIOUS QUARTERS IN VENEZUELA. 
PUBLIC REACTIONS REFLECTED CONCERN THAT VENEZUELA WILL RENEGE ON 
ITS OBLIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE AS 
A UNIFIED GROUP A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH MERCOSUR.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER MIGUEL ANGEL BURELLI RIVAS--WHO SAID THE INTERNATIONAL 
PRESS MAY HAVE MISCOMMUNICATED CHAVEZ\'S WORDS--SAID THE GOV HAS 
TREATY OBLIGATIONS WITH THE ANDEAN PACT WHICH IT CANNOT 
UNILATERALLY PUT ASIDE.  HIS CRITICISMS WERE REPEATED BY OTHER 
VENEZUELAN LEADERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY WHO URGED THAT 
VENEZUELA REMAIN IN THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY, EVENTUALLY NEGOTIATING 
INTEGRATION WITH MERCOSUR AS A BLOC. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
SPECTRE OF ADJUDICATION AND SANCTIONS RAISED 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U)  THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA\'S FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL, SILVANO 
GELLENI, SPECULATED THAT VENEZUELA COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE 
ANDEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BY THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY IF IT WERE TO 
ATTEMPT UNILATERALLY TO JOIN MERCOSUR.  HE ALSO MENTIONED POSSIBLE 
SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATING THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF 
TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS.  THE VENEZUELAN CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE (CONSECOMERCIO), THE VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN ECONOMIC 
INTEGRATION COMMISSION, THE FEDERATION OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE 
(FEDECAMERAS), AND THE ASSOCIATION OF VENEZUELAN CHEMICAL AND 
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ALSO ISSUED STATEMENTS CRITICAL OF CHAVEZ\' 
DECLARATIONS ON MERCOSUR, AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED CONTINUED 
COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
REAFFIRMS ANDEAN PACT COMMITMENTS 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (U)  FOLLOWING THESE CRITICISMS, CHAVEZ SAID HE WAS NOT 
ADVOCATING THE VIOLATION OF AGREEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ARRIVED AT WITHIN 
THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO WHATEVER 
HE COULD TO ADVANCE THE INTEGRATION OF VENEZUELA AND THE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY WITH MERCOSUR.  THE PRESIDENT-ELECT 
ALSO COMMENTED THAT HE WOULD BE MAKING A TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES 
AND EUROPE PROBABLY BEFORE HIS FEBRUARY 2 INAUGURATION TO PERSUADE 
INVESTORS THAT HE WAS NOT A \"BRUTAL EXTREMIST.\"  HE ADDED THAT 
\"INVESTORS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WELCOME,\" AND THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT COULD USE THE INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE THE FISCAL DEFICIT 
AND HELP FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS. 
CHAVEZ ALSO SAID HE WANTED TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE VENEZUELA\'S 
DEPENDENCE ON PETROLEUM EXPORTS BY STRENGTHENING THE AGRICULTURAL 
AND TOURISM SECTORS, AND BY DEVELOPING A PETRO-CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BINATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH BRAZIL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT CHAVEZ PROPOSED TO BRAZILIAN LEADERS THE 
CREATION OF A BINATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, CALLED \"PETROAMERICA.\" 
FOREIGN MINISTER BURELLI REACTED POSITIVELY TO THE IDEA, BUT 
UNDERSCORED THAT IT WAS NOT ORIGINAL, AND HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT THE 
1994 SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS IN MIAMI.  BURELLI EXPRESSED HIS HOPE 
THAT IDEAS INITIATED DURING HIS TERM, LIKE THE BINATIONAL PETROLEUM 
COMPANY, WOULD BECOME REALITIES DURING THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. 
CHAVEZ FURTHER SPOKE OF VENEZUELA\'S POTENTIAL IN THE AREAS OF 
AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK, AND TOURISM, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF 
MUTUALLY DEVELOPING THEIR SHARED BORDER AREAS. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
RAPID ANDEAN INTEGRATION WITH MERCOSUR 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U)  CHAVEZ TRAVELED TO COLOMBIA ON DECEMBER 17 AND 18 WHERE HE 
CONTINUED TO PUSH THE THEME OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION, URGING THE 
ACCELERATION OF AN ANDEAN COMMUNITY AGREEMENT WITH MERCOSUR.  HE 
ADVISED A GROUP OF COLOMBIAN BUSINESSMEN THAT \"WE CAN\'T GET BOGGED 
DOWN IN TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS WHILE THE WORLD ADVANCES.\"  COLOMBIAN 
BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS--CONSCIOUS OF THE VULNERABILITY OF 
ANDEAN ECONOMIES IN RELATION TO THE MORE MATURE ECONOMIES OF 
ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL--GREETED CHAVEZ\' EXHORTATIONS CAUTIOUSLY.  IN 
AN EFFORT TO REASSURE COLOMBIAN INVESTORS, CHAVEZ GUARANTEED CLEAR 
RULES FOR INVESTMENT IN CONSTRUCTION, ENERGY AND TOURISM.  HE ALSO 
PROPOSED THE INCLUSION OF THE COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM COMPANY, 
ECOPETROL, INTO THE EVENTUAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE BRAZILIAN AND 
VENEZUELAN OIL CONCERNS. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CALLS ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS TO DISARM 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U)  CHAVEZ ALSO ENGAGED THE ISSUE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEACE 
PROCESS, OFFERING HIS GOOD OFFICES TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS, BUT 
INSISTING THAT HE HAS NOT HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH EITHER COLOMBIAN 
GUERRILLA GROUP.  COLOMBIAN INSURGENTS PUBLICLY PASSED THEIR 
RESPECTS TO CHAVEZ, EXPRESSING THEIR SATISFACTION AT HIS ELECTION, 
AND CITING HIS VICTORY AS \"AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA.\" 
CHAVEZ RESPONDED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THEIR PUBLIC MESSAGES WITH 
\"GREAT SENTIMENT, RESPONSIBILITY AND UNITY,\" AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE 
TO RETURN THE SENTIMENT, \"BUT CARRYING THE SIGN OF PEACE.\"  HE 
URGED THE REBELS TO \"DISARM AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO OPEN THE PATH 
OF PEACE.\"  FINALLY, CHAVEZ CALLED FOR A PROFOUND DIALOGUE AND 
ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND THE ENTIRE 
CONTINENT.\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
STATEMENTS ON MERCOSUR CAUSE CONFUSION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C)  CHAVEZ\' VARIOUS STATEMENTS REGARDING MERCOSUR CONFUSED GOV 
OFFICIALS.  ECONOMIC COUNSELOR AND TRADE OFFICER MET DECEMBER 18 
WITH MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS JOSE ANTONIO MARTINEZ.  ECONOFFS ASKED IF 
CHAVEZ\' COMMENTS IN BRAZIL INDICATED A \"FOUR-PLUS-ONE\" APPROACH TO 
VENEZUELA\'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH MERCOSUR OR IF HIS COMMENTS IN 
COLOMBIA INDICATED A \"FOUR-PLUS-FOUR\" APPROACH.  MARTINEZ SAID HE 
DID NOT KNOW SINCE CHAVEZ\' STATEMENTS APPEARED TO DEPEND ON \"WHAT 
COUNTRY HE IS IN.\"  ECONOFFS THEN ASKED IF THE CHAVEZ TRADE 
TRANSITION TEAM LED BY MOVEMENT TOWARDS SOCIALISM (MAS) CONGRESSMAN 
GUSTAVO MARQUEZ INDICATED WHICH WAY CHAVEZ WAS LEANING.  MARTINEZ 
AGAIN SAID HE DID NOT KNOW.  \"WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM,\" HE 
EXPLAINED, \"BUT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION BACK TO US.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
ADVOCATES MEMBERSHIP IN MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C)  CHAVEZ CLARIFIED HIS TRADE POLICY AT THE VENEZUELAN- 
AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (VENAMCHAM) GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON 
DECEMBER 19.  HE STRESSED THAT HE WOULD SEEK VENEZUELA\'S MEMBERSHIP 
IN MERCOSUR, SIMILAR TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF CHILE AND BOLIVIA, WHILE 
MAINTAINING VENEZUELA\'S ANDEAN COMMUNITY COMMITMENTS.  \"IF BOLIVIA 
CAN BE A MEMBER OF MERCOSUR AND REMAIN PART OF THE ANDEAN 
COMMUNITY,\" HE ARGUED, \"SO CAN VENEZUELA.\"  HE CONTINUED, \"IF 
VENEZUELA CAN BE A MEMBER OF THE G-3 AND REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE 
ANDEAN COMMUNITY,\" HE CONTINUED, \"IT CAN ALSO BE A MEMBER OF 
MERCOSUR.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
PUSHED ANDEAN COMMUNITY TOWARD INTEGRATION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
12. (U)  SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, CHAVEZ PRACTICALLY ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM 
REGARDING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE ANDEAN PACT AND MERCOSUR.  HE 
SAID IF TALKS TO ACHIEVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO BLOCKS WERE NOT 
ACCELERATED, VENEZUELA WOULD TAKE THE SAME COURSE AS BOLIVIA AND 
JOIN MERCOSUR WHILE REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY. 
CHAVEZ SAID VENEZUELA HAD A VISION WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOPOLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH THE GROUP OF THREE (G- 
3), THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY COMMON MARKET (CARICOM), AND ANDEAN 
COMMUNITY.  \"WE WILL ACCELERATE THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, WHICH I 
HOPE WILL TAKE PLACE AS A BLOCK,\" CHAVEZ SAID, \"BUT THERE ARE OTHER 
OPTIONS.\"  HE NOTED, \"SHOULD THE TALKS REMAIN DEADLOCKED, VENEZUELA 
WILL JOIN MERCOSUR WITHOUT LEAVING THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C) THE PURPOSE OF CHAVEZ\' TRIP WAS TWO-FOLD:  EXTERNALLY TO 
ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY WITH KEY SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND ALLAY 
FEARS RAISED BY CHAVEZ\' PERSONAL HISTORY AND CAMPAIGN RHETORIC. 
DOMESTICALLY, TO PORTRAY CHAVEZ AS A PRESIDENT-ELECT WELCOMED IN 
SOUTH AMERICA\'S MAJOR CAPITALS AND FOCUSED ON THE MAJOR AGENDA 
ITEMS IN REGIONAL DIPLOMACY. 
 
14.  (C) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHAVEZ\' COMMENTS ON MERCOSUR, THE 
TRIP WAS WITHOUT INCIDENT.  FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS, WHOSE ROLE 
IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF THE TRIP WAS MINIMAL, WERE HAPPY 
THAT CHAVEZ SEEMED TO AGREE AND TO RATIFY CURRENT GOV POLICY TOWARD 
THE COUNTRIES VISITED.  SOME COMPLAINED THAT HIS MERCOSUR COMMENTS 
HAD UNNECESSARILY UPSET COLOMBIA.  HOWEVER, THEY NOTED THAT HE HAD 
MADE AN EFFORT DURING HIS VISIT TO BOGOTA TO SMOOTH WHATEVER 
FEATHERS HE HAD RUFFLED BY CASTING HIS MERCOSUR REMARKS IN LIGHT OF 
ONGOING REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. 
 
15.  (C) FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, TWO ASPECTS OF THE TRIP WORTH 
NOTING ARE:  FIRST, THE TRIP DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE CHAVEZ 
PLACES ON REGIONAL ISSUES, AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES.  HE IS CLEARLY EAGER TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MEMBER IN GOOD 
STANDING OF THE LATIN AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.  THIS 
INDICATES THAT HE WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE ADOPTING POLICIES OR 
POLITICAL MEASURES AT HOME THAT MIGHT OFFEND HIS DEMOCRATIC 
NEIGHBORS.  SECOND, CHAVEZ MADE CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT ALLOW 
VENEZUELA\'S RELATIONS WITH MERCOSUR TO BE HELD HOSTAGE BY ANDEAN 
PACT NEGOTIATIONS WHICH HAVE DRAGGED ON FOR THREE YEARS.  HE HAS 
PUT HIS NEIGHBORS ON NOTICE THAT THE GOV WILL TAKE A MORE ASSERTIVE 
ROLE WITHIN THE ANDEAN PACT, AND IS PREPARED TO ACT UNILATERALLY TO 
MEET NATIONAL INTERESTS.

(B) AND (D). 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
JOSE VICENTE RANGEL: VENEZUELA\'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
1.(U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS NAMED JOSE VICENTE RANGEL 
AS HIS FOREIGN MINISTER DESIGNATE.  THOUGH A LAWYER BY EDUCATION 
AND A JOURNALIST BY PROFESSION, RANGEL HAS A LONG AND STORIED 
CAREER IN VENEZUELAN POLITICS.  AS A LAW STUDENT, HE LED A STUDENT 
REVOLT AGAINST THE PEREZ JIMENEZ DICTATORSHIP AND WAS EXILED FOR 
HIS PARTICIPATION.  HE LATER RETURNED TO VENEZUELA AND SERVED FOR 
NEARLY 30 YEARS IN THE CONGRESS.  DURING THIS PERIOD HE HELPED 
FOUND THE LEFTIST NEWSPAPER, EL CLARIN, WON THE NATIONAL PRIZE FOR 
JOURNALISM, AND RAN UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR PRESIDENT THREE TIMES (NEVER 
GARNERING MORE THAN 5.2OF THE VOTE.)  EVEN NOW, THE SIXTY-NINE 
YEAR OLD LEADS AN ACTIVE PROFESSIONAL LIFE, PUBLISHING COLUMNS IN 
THE NEWSPAPERS EL DIARIO AND EL UNIVERSAL, AND HOSTING A POPULAR 
SUNDAY TELEVISION OPINION PROGRAM. 
 
------------------- 
THE FORMATIVE YEARS 
------------------- 
 
2.(U)  BORN IN CARACAS ON JULY 10, 1929, RANGEL FIRST EXPERIENCED 
POLITICAL TURMOIL IN 1935, WHEN HIS FATHER, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF 
DICTATOR JUAN VICENTE GOMEZ, WAS FORCED TO FLEE VENEZUELA FOR 
COLOMBIA UPON GOMEZ\'S DEATH.  AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN, WHILE 
ATTENDING SCHOOL IN BARQUISIMETO,  HE BECAME POLITICALLY ACTIVE 
AFTER LISTENING TO JOVITO VILLALBA OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN 
UNION (URD) SPEAK. INSPIRED, HE JOINED THE YOUTH SECTION OF THE 
URD. 
 
3.(U)  AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, HE ENROLLED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE 
ANDES IN MERIDA TO PURSUE A DEGREE IN LAW, BUT LATER TRANSFERRED TO 
THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF VENEZUELA IN CARACAS.  HE DID NOT, 
HOWEVER, COMPLETE HIS STUDIES.  IN 1953, ALONG WITH CHEITO HERRERA 
OROPEZA, LUIS HERRERA CAMPINS (FUTURE PRESIDENT AND SOCIAL 
CHRISTIAN PARTY LEADER), AND EDUARDO GONZALEZ, RANGEL LED A STUDENT 
PROTEST AGAINST THE CORRUPTION OF THE PEREZ JIMENEZ GOVERNMENT. 
THE PROTEST LED TO RANGEL\'S OWN EXILE TO CHILE AND SPAIN.  HIS 
EXILE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HIS LIFE IN TWO AREAS. 
POLITICALLY, HIS TIME IN EXILE HARDENED HIS POSITION AGAINST 
CORRUPTION AND HIS VIEWPOINT ON GOVERNMENT.  PERSONALLY, HE MET AND 
MARRIED ANA AVALOS, A CHILEAN SCULPTRESS, TO WHOM HE IS STILL 
MARRIED (WITH TWO CHILDREN) AND TO WHOM HE CLAIMS TO WRITE A NEW 
POEM EVERY DAY.  RANGEL RETURNED TO VENEZUELA IN 1958 FOLLOWING THE 
FALL OF PEREZ JIMENEZ AND WAS APPOINTED TO THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF 
THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, AND THEN WAS ELECTED TO THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES. 
 
----------------- 
POLITICAL TURMOIL 
----------------- 
 
4.(U)  RANGEL\'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES INCREASED IN THE SIXTIES.  IN 
1962, AS A MEMBER OF THE URD, HE WAS NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE 
COMMISSION ON INTERNAL POLICY OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND WAS 
REELECTED TO THE CHAMBER IN 1963.  WHEN RAUL LEONI OF DEMOCRATIC 
ACTION (AD) BECAME PRESIDENT IN 1964, LEONI, JOVITO VILLALBA OF THE 
URD, AND ARTURO USLAR PIETRI OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FND) 
AGREED TO FORM A NATIONAL POLITICAL FRONT - CALLED \"WIDE BASE\" -TO 
INSURE THE GOVERNABILITY OF VENEZUELA.  RANGEL VEHEMENTLY DISAGREED 
WITH URD\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FRONT AND LEFT THE PARTY. 
 
5.(C)  RANGEL BEGAN HIS FORMAL ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIALISM AT THAT 
TIME AND ALONG WITH SOME OTHER EX-URD LEADERS FORMED THE 
NATIONALIST POPULAR VANGUARD (VPN).  DURING THIS PERIOD, RANGEL 
DEVELOPED A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH GUERILLA ORGANIZATIONS.  HIS 
OVERT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE SEEN BY HIS ENEMIES AS A FRONT FOR 
CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATIONS.  IN 1966, WISHING TO UNIFY THE DISPARATE 
LEFTIST PARTIES, HE JOINED THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF NATIONALISTIC 
INTEGRATION (PRIN).  THE LOFTY UNIFICATION GOALS WERE NEVER 
ACHIEVED AND THE PARTY COLLAPSED AFTER THREE YEARS.   DURING THIS 
PERIOD, RANGEL MET AND BECAME FRIENDS WITH LUIS MIQUILENA (NEWLY- 
APPOINTED MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR IN THE CHAVEZ CABINET.)  THE TWO 
FOUNDED THE NEWSPAPER, EL CLARIN, WHICH WAS THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE 
VENEZUELAN LEFT. 
 
------------------------------------ 
PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS UNFULFILLED 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.(U)  THROUGH IT ALL, RANGEL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  IN 1973 AS THE MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM 
PARTY (MAS) CANDIDATE, AND WITH LUIS MIQUILENA AS HIS CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER, HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR RANGEL, HIS 
CANDIDACY NEVER STRUCK A CHORD WITH THE PEOPLE, AND HE FINISHED A 
DISTANT FOURTH (4.3) BEHIND WINNER CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ (48.7). 
UNDAUNTED BY HIS SHOWING IN THE 1973 ELECTIONS, HE RAN AGAIN FOR 
PRESIDENT UNDER THE MAS FLAG IN 1978 (THIRD PLACE WITH 5.2) AND 
AGAIN IN 1983 (FOURTH PLACE WITH 3.3) AS THE NEW ALTERNATIVE PARTY 
(NA) CANDIDATE. 
 
------------------ 
THE CAP CONNECTION 
------------------ 
 
7.(U)  RANGEL AND CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ (CAP) HAVE A STRONG AND 
IRONIC POLITICAL CONNECTION, TIED TO TWO SCANDALS.  IN 1980, CAP\'S 
POLITICAL ENEMIES WANTED HIM REMOVED FROM THE SCENE.  HAVING JUST 
COMPLETED HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT, CAP WAS THEN SENATOR-FOR-LIFE. 
DURING HIS PRESIDENCY, THE GOVERNMENT HAD BOUGHT A REFRIGERATED 
FISHING BOAT -- THE SIERRA NEVADA -- FROM NORWAY AT AN INFLATED 
PRICE.  BECAUSE THIS MISMANAGEMENT OCCURRED DURING CAP\'S 
PRESIDENCY, HIS ENEMIES WANTED HIM HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
MALFEASANCE, AND SOUGHT TO IMPEACH AND REMOVE HIM FROM THE SENATE. 
CONGRESSIONAL IMPEACHMENT ACTION FELL ONE VOTE SHORT.  THE ONE VOTE 
WAS THAT OF JOSE VICENTE RANGEL, WHO ABSTAINED, AND SAVED CAP\'S 
POLITICAL CAREER.  RANGEL EXPLAINED HIS ABSTENTION BY SAYING \"THE 
SIERRA NEVADA DEAL WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IMMORAL\", BUT NOT AN IMPEACHABLE 
OFFENSE. 
 
8.(C)  QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT RANGEL\'S ABSTENTION AND THE 
ACQUITTAL OF CAP.  RANGEL\'S POLITICAL ENEMIES CLAIMED THAT CAP 
DIRECTLY PAID OFF RANGEL.  A MORE SORDID VERSION HAS ALSO 
CIRCULATED.  ACCORDING TO THE STORY, RANGEL\'S WIFE WAS INVOLVED 
WITH A WELL-KNOWN GUERILLA IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.  IN EXCHANGE FOR 
HIS ABSTENTION, THE STORY GOES, CAP INTERVENED AND STOPPED HER 
PROSECUTION. 
 
9.(U)  NINE YEARS LATER, RANGEL, WORKING AS AN INVESTIGATIVE 
JOURNALIST HELPED UNCOVER THE SCANDAL THAT LED TO CAP\'S IMPEACHMENT 
AND IMPRISONMENT.  RANGEL DISCOVERED THAT DURING CAP\'S SECOND TERM 
AS PRESIDENT (1988 - 1993,) 250 MILLION BOLIVARES (APPROX. $16 
MILLION) WERE SECRETLY AND ILLEGALLY FUNNELED THROUGH THE 
SECRETARIAT OF THE PRESIDENCY TO FINANCE THE FORMATION OF 
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT VIOLETA CHAMORRO\'S SECURITY FORCE.  IN THE 
COURSE OF PASSING THE MONEY, THE BOLIVARES WERE EXCHANGED FOR 
DOLLARS AT A VERY FAVORABLE RATE, SUPPOSEDLY ALLOWING CAP TO SIPHON 
OFF A LARGE SUM OF MONEY.  ALTHOUGH, CAP MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE, 
THIS TIME NOBODY CAME TO HIS RESCUE AND HE WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE. 
 
--------------- 
SEMI-RETIREMENT 
--------------- 
 
10.(U)  IN THE LATE EIGHTIES, RANGEL RECEIVED MORE ATTENTION 
FIGHTING INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION.  DURING THE LUSINCHI PRESIDENCY, 
RANGEL REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY PLANNED TO PURCHASE OBSOLETE OR 
DAMAGED EQUIPMENT AT INFLATED PRICES.  HE WAS DETAINED AND 
INTERROGATED TWICE BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (DIM), IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
INTIMIDATE HIM.  THE ACTIONS BY DIM ONLY INSPIRED HIM TO PRINT MORE 
STORIES.  IN THE END, HOWEVER, NO PROOF WAS EVER UNCOVERED TO 
SUPPORT RANGEL\'S ALLEGATIONS, AND THE MILITARY BOUGHT THE 
EQUIPMENT. 
 
11.(U)  RANGEL HAS SPENT HIS RECENT YEARS HARD AT WORK, WRITING A 
WEEKLY COLUMN IN EL DIARIO AND EL UNIVERSAL AND HOSTING A POPULAR 
TELEVISION OPINION PROGRAM.  IN AUGUST 1992, RANGEL\'S MOST 
INTERESTING BROADCAST WAS NEVER AIRED.  SEVEN MONTHS AFTER HUGO 
CHAVEZ\'S UNSUCCESSFUL COUP ATTEMPT, RANGEL VIDEOTAPED A PRISON 
INTERVIEW WITH CHAVEZ.  A MILITARY JUDGE PROHIBITED THE BROADCAST 
OF THE SHOW AT THE LAST MINUTE.  RANGEL COUNTERED THIS MOVE BY 
INVITING JOURNALISTS INTO HIS HOME FOR A PRIVATE SCREENING OF THE 
VIDEO, PLAYED AT THE SCHEDULED AIR TIME OF HIS SHOW. 
 
12.(C)  RANGEL ENJOYS MAINTAINING A HIGH PROFILE AND HAS BEEN 
CALLED THE MOST SEEN AND HEARD JOURNALIST IN VENEZUELA.  LIKE HIS 
GOOD FRIEND AND POLITICAL COUNTERPART LUIS MIQUILENA, RANGEL HAS 
NURTURED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAVEZ IN THE YEARS SINCE THE COUP 
ATTEMPT.  HE SEES IN CHAVEZ A KINDRED SPIRIT WHO UNDERTOOK A 
QUIXOTIC STRGGLE AGAINST A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.   FOLLOWNG 
CHAVEZ\'S RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1994, RANGEL SED HIS NEWSPAPER 
COLUMNS AND HIS TV PROGRAM TO ROMOTE CHAVEZ\'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY.  HIS SUPPORT FOR CHAVEZ\' HOWEVER, IS NOT BLIND OR 
SYCPHANTIC.  HE HARSHLY CRITICIZED CHAVEZ FOR HIS FAMUS \"FRY 
ADECO HEADS IN OIL\" THREAT, AND USED HISNEWSPAPER COMMENTARY TO 
LECTURE CHAVEZ ON THE IMORTANCE OF USING PUBLIC OFFICE TO PROMOTE 
POLITICAL CHANGE, NOT TO CONDUCT VENDETTAS AGAINST POLITICL 
ENEMIES.  RANGEL ONCE TOLD POLOFF, \"CHAVEZ IS OT THE IDEAL 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BUT HE IS TE ONLY ONE WE HAVE.\" 
 
13.(C)  RANGEL\'S SELECTIONAS FOREIGN MINISTER WAS A SURPRISE.  HIS 
NAME HAD BEEN FLOATED FOR THIS POSITION, BUT HE HAD RULED OT ANY 
PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT, SAYING HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP 
HIS PRIVILEGED, INDEPENDENT POSITION AS A JOURNALIST.  IT WAS ALSO 
RUMORED THAT HE HAD HEALTH PROBLEMS AND DID NOT FEEL UP TO THE 
RIGORS OF WORK AS FOREIGN MINISTER.  NEVERTHELESS, HIS LOYALTY TO 
CHAVEZ, AND HIS FORTHRIGHT NATURE WERE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE CHAVEZ TO 
INSIST THAT HIS MENTOR ACCEPT THE FOREIGN MINISTER POSITION. 
 
14.(C)  RANGEL\'S LACK OF PRACTICAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS NOT 
SEEN BY VENEZUELAN COMMENTATORS AS A HINDERANCE.  HIS APPOINTMENT 
WAS GREETED POSITIVELY BY FOREIGN MINISTER BURELLI AND OTHERS, ALL 
OF WHOM REMARKED ON RANGEL\'S LONG PUBLIC CAREER AND HIS REPUTATION 
FOR INTEGRITY.

CLASSIFIED BY PERRY E. BALL, ECONOMIC COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
1.  THIS IS A JOINT STATE-COMMERCE REPORT 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C) LUIS REYES WAS APPOINTED VENEZUELA\'S MINISTER OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE BY PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE NEWLY CREATED 
MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE WILL OVERSEE MATTERS OF TRANSPORT, 
COMMUNICATIONS, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.  REYES WAS FORCIBLY RETIRED 
FROM THE VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE AS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL AFTER HIS 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE NOVEMBER 27, 1992, COUP ATTEMPT.  REYES IS A 
PERSONAL FRIEND OF CHAVEZ.  CHAVEZ\'S COMMENT THAT \"(REYES) IS AN 
HONEST MAN WITH GREAT MANAGERIAL ABILITY, AND AN UNYIELDING 
PATRIOT\" INDICATES CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW MINISTER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
MILITARY AND ACADEMIC BACKGROUND 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) BORN IN BARINAS IN 1953, REYES IS A PILOT AND AERONAUTICAL 
ENGINEER.  HE JOINED THE AIR FORCE IN 1970.  REYES WAS ONE OF FOUR 
VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE OFFICERS INVITED BY THE UNITED STATES AIR 
FORCE IN 1974 TO ATTEND AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE COURSE AT LACKLAND AIR 
FORCE BASE IN TEXAS, AND A ONE-YEAR UNDERGRADUATE PILOT TRAINING 
COURSE AT MOODY AIR FORCE BASE IN GEORGIA.  AFTER RETURNING TO 
VENEZUELA, REYES PURSUED UNIVERSITY STUDIES IN BARQUISIMETO, 
VENEZUELA, AND GRADUATED WITH AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN 
ADMINISTRATION.  HE BECAME A LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN 1982.  HE 
TRAVELED TO THE UNITED STATES IN 1988 TO ASSUME A POSITION IN THE 
DIRECTORATE OF INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS OF THE VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE 
(FAV).  HE RETURNED TO VENEZUELA IN NOVEMBER 1991, THREE MONTHS 
BEFORE THE COUP ATTEMPT OF FEBRUARY 4, 1992.  AT THAT TIME, HE 
SERVED AS THE CHIEF OF INVESTIGATION ON A CASE INVOLVING A 
VENEZUELAN AIR FORCE GENERAL WHO WAS EVENTUALLY CONVICTED OF 
CORRUPTION. 
 
------------------------ 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAVEZ 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S CONFIDENCE IN REYES COMES FROM MANY 
YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP.  REYES AND CHAVEZ GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN, 
ATTENDED THE SAME O\'LEARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND PLAYED BASEBALL ON 
CONTENDING TEAMS.  BOTH REYES AND CHAVEZ JOINED THE MILITARY -- 
REYES THE AIR FORCE AND CHAVEZ THE ARMY. 
 
5.  (C) REYES WAS AN EARLY CONSPIRATOR WITH CHAVEZ.  REYES TOLD THE 
EL UNIVERSAL NEWSPAPER THAT HE VIVIDLY RECALLS A DISCUSSION HE HAD 
WITH CHAVEZ ON DECEMBER 17, 1977, AFTER RETURNING FROM THE U.S.  HE 
SAID THAT CHAVEZ AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW CORRUPTION HAD DISTORTED 
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.  FOLLOWING THIS DISCUSSION 
REYES INCORPORATED HIMSELF IN CHAVEZ\'S CONSPIRACY.  BEGINNING IN 
1982, REYES WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING THE FAV\'S ACTIONS IN 
THE THEN FUTURE COUP ATTEMPTS. 
 
------------------------------- 
INVOLVEMENT IN \"THE CONSPIRACY\" 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) REYES DID NOT PART IN THE FEBRUARY 4, 1992, COUP ATTEMPT. 
INSTEAD, AS THE PERSON CHARGED WITH COORDINATING THE FAV\'S ACTIONS 
IN THE COUP ATTEMPT, REYES MANAGED TO PREVENT THE FAV FROM RISING 
AS A COUNTER-INSURRECTION FORCE.  REYES EXPLAINED, \"(SINCE) THE 
CONTINUITY (OF THE MILITARY) HAD BEEN BROKEN,...WE DECIDED TO 
NEUTRALIZE THE AIR FORCE AT THAT TIME.\"  REYES WAS ARRESTED AND 
DETAINED ONE AND A HALF MONTHS AS A RESULT OF HIS INACTION DURING 
THE FEBRUARY 4 COUP ATTEMPT.  AFTER HIS RELEASE, REYES BECAME ONE 
OF THE LEADERS OF THE NOVEMBER 27, 1992, AIR FORCE-LED COUP 
ATTEMPT.  HIS PARTICIPATION WAS MARKED BY FLYING A F-16 AT MACH 1 
SPEED OVER THE CITY OF CARACAS.  THE FLIGHT REPORTEDLY BROKE 
WINDOWS IN MANY PARTS OF THE CITY.  REYES SAID HE BROKE THE SOUND 
BARRIER TO FRIGHTEN THE ENEMY FORCES.  THE COUP ATTEMPT FAILED AND 
REYES WAS IMPRISONED FOR 14 MONTHS AT FORT TIUNA, THE MILITARY 
HEADQUARTERS IN CARACAS.  REYES REMAINED ALLIED TO CHAVEZ\'S 
MOVEMENT AND WAS LATER APPOINTED AS CHAVEZ\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
COORDINATOR IN LARA STATE IN 1998. 
 
-------------------- 
NEW RESPONSIBILITIES 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) REYES WILL HEAD UP THE MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH 
WILL CONSOLIDATE THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION (MTC) 
AND THE MINISTRY OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT (MINDUR).  THIS \"SUPER- 
MINISTRY\" WILL BE CHARGED WITH ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO AIR, LAND, 
AND WATER TRANSPORT, ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE, PUBLIC HOUSING, 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND \"WHITE ELEPHANT\" PROJECTS (PROJECTS LEFT 
UNFINISHED BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS).  INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 
PERTAINING TO OTHER MINISTRIES WILL ALSO BE CENTRALIZED IN THE 
MINISTRY.  REYES PLANS TO DIVIDE THE MINISTRY\'S RESPONSIBILITIES 
AMONG THREE SECRETARIATS, ONE EACH FOR TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATION, 
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.  HE ALSO INTENDS TO INCREASE THE 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES RELEVANT TO THE FUNCTIONS 
OF THE MINISTRY.  REYES SAID HE ACCEPTED THE POSITION AS MINISTER 
OF INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OF THE \"PERSONAL CHARGES GIVEN TO HIM BY 
THE PRESIDENT.\"  REYES HAS ALREADY MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON THE 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WHICH WELCOMED HIS VIEWS ON DECENTRALIZATION OF 
THE MINISTRY AND INCREASED MARKET LIBERALIZATION AS A \"PLEASANT 
SURPRISE.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
THE \"MINI-MINISTRO\'S\" GOALS 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) REYES DOES NOT WANT TO BE KNOWN AS \"SUPER-MINISTRO,\" BUT 
PREFERS THE TITLE OF \"MINI-MINISTRO.\"  HE BELIEVES IN 
DECENTRALIZATION OF THE MINISTRY\'S FUNCTIONS AND WANTS TO CREATE A 
SMALLER, MORE EFFICIENT MINISTRY.  HE SAYS DECENTRALIZATION IS A 
GOOD WAY TO RID A LARGE BUREAUCRACY OF CORRUPTION.  ONE OF REYES\' 
PRIMARY GOALS IS TO SECURE FAA CATEGORY I FLIGHT SAFETY STATUS FOR 
VENEZUELA.  AIRPORTS THAT DO NOT MEET REQUIRED STANDARDS WILL BE 
CLOSED DOWN.  REGULATIONS WILL BE ENFORCED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR AIRPORTS WILL HAVE TO COMPLY.  REYES DOES NOT LEAVE 
OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PRIVATIZING AIRPORTS. 
 
9.  (C) REYES CONSIDERS THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR TO BE A 
STRATEGIC SECTOR.  HE WANTS TO CONTINUE OPENING THE SECTOR, AND 
MOVE UP THE DATE FOR TERMINATING THE NATIONAL TELEPHONE COMPANY, 
CANTV\'S, MONOPOLY.  AT AN INVESTMENT MEETING HELD IN MID-JANUARY, 
REYES PLEDGED TO REVAMP THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY AGENCY, 
CONATEL, TO MAKE IT LESS DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL.  REYES 
HOPES TO ATTRACT PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT VIA CONCESSIONS TO 
REVISE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FRAMEWORK (SEPTEL). 
 
10.  (C) REYES WANTS TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE PROPER 
UPKEEP OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION; HAVE THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT 
SECRETARIAT CONSTRUCT MORE PUBLIC SPACE (RATHER THAN JUST PUBLIC 
HOUSING); ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION; AND 
REACTIVATE THE VENEZUELAN MERCHANT MARINE BY HAVING PRIVATE 
COMPANIES TAKE ON VENEZUELAN FLAG VESSELS.  HE IS A REALIST WHEN IT 
COMES TO WHITE ELEPHANT PROJECTS.  HE ATTRIBUTES THE STATUS OF 
THESE PROJECTS TO THE OVER-AMBITION OF PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, 
WITH NO REGARD FOR THE ACTUAL FUNDING AVAILABLE.  REYES INTENDS TO 
COMPLETE SOME PROJECTS, BUT ONLY AS MANY AS THE BUDGET PERMITS. 
REYES SAID THE MOST FEASIBLE PROJECTS TO FINISH WOULD BE THE 
HIGHWAY FROM SAN FELIPE TO PUERTO CABELLO, THE BYPASS NORTH OF 
BARQUISIMETO, AND A SECTION OF THE HIGHWAY LEADING FROM CARACAS TO 
THE EASTERN REGION OF VENEZUELA. 
 
---------------------- 
REYES AS AN HONEST MAN 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (C) THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON REYES\' PERSONAL 
CHARACTER.  HOWEVER, PRESIDENT CHAVEZ CHARACTERIZED HIM AS AN 
\"HONEST MAN\" WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED.  A SENIOR EXECUTIVE IN A 
VENEZUELAN COMMERCIAL AIRLINE TOLD EMBOFF THAT SEVERAL VENEZUELAN 
MILITARY OFFICERS WHO KNOW REYES UNIFORMLY DESCRIBED HIM AS 
\"STRICT, HONEST, AND INTELLIGENT.\"  THE EXECUTIVE ALSO REPORTED 
THAT REYES SAID TO HIM, \"I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP...I NEED AN HONEST 
OPINION ABOUT AVIATION ISSUES,\" BECAUSE HE EXPECTS TO BE APPROACHED 
BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING SPECIAL INTERESTS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  (C) REYES\' APPOINTMENT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF CHAVEZ\'S 
ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE WILL 
ABSORB THE MTC, WHICH IS WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS INEFFICIENCY AND 
CORRUPTION.  REYES\' ACCESS TO CHAVEZ AND HIS HONESTY PROVIDE THE 
CREDIBILITY HE WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE OLD WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS 
IN THE NEW MINISTRY.

CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM, AND LAYS OUT HIS AGENDA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON:  1.5 (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  HUGO CHAVEZ WAS SWORN IN AS VENEZUELA\'S PRESIDENT ON 
FEBRUARY 2, BEGINNING A THREE-DAY SERIES OF EVENTS CELEBRATING THE 
END OF WHAT HE CALLED \"AN OLD, CORRUPT ORDER\" AND THE START OF 
\"VENEZUELA\'S RESURRECTION.\"  TAKING HIS OATH OF OFFICE ON A 
\"MORIBUND CONSTITUTION\" WHICH HE PROMISED TO REPLACE QUICKLY WITH 
A NEW \"MAGNA CARTA,\" CHAVEZ CALLED ALL VENEZUELANS TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE COUNTRY\'S \"MORAL AND ETHICAL CRISIS\" WHICH HAD LEFT A CORRUPT, 
BANKRUPT GOVERNMENT AND A DIVIDED, ANTAGONISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH 
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION LIVED IN POVERTY.  DECLARING HIS 
OWN CULPABILITY AND ASKING FORGIVENESS FOR THE FAILED 1992 COUP 
ATTEMPT, CHAVEZ SAID VENEZUELANS MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR 
POLITICAL PAST, RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES WHICH PROVOKED THE FAILED 
COUPS ATTEMPTS, AND WORK TOGETHER TO \"DEFUSE OUR SOCIAL TIME BOMB.\" 
CHALLENGING THE CONGRESS TO \"GET TO WORK,\" CHAVEZ BRUSHED ASIDE 
INSTITUTIONAL BICKERING BY IMMEDIATELY ISSUING A DECREE CONVOKING 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM--SETTING THE STAGE FOR A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY--AND ASKED THE CONGRESS FOR ENABLING 
LEGISLATION TO ENACT EMERGENCY ECONOMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS 
VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS.  HE UNDERSCORED HIS COMMITMENT TO 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS, INSISTING THAT HE WAS THE 
\"PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC CHANNEL\" THROUGH WHICH VENEZUELA WOULD 
ADDRESS ITS \"SOCIAL EMERGENCY.\"  DECLARING, \"WE HAVE NOTHING TO 
FEAR FROM THE PEOPLE,\" HE SAID HIS PLAN FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL 
ASSEMBLY WAS TO \"RE-LEGITIMIZE THE STATE\" AND MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE 
REPRESENTATIVE AND PARTICIPATIVE.  ASSERTING, \"I AM THE 
CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE CAUSE\" OF VENEZUELANS\' DEEP YEARNING FOR 
POLITICAL CHANGE, CHAVEZ SAID HIS PROJECT IS A \"PROJECT OF ALL 
VENEZUELANS\" AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS NECESSARY 
FOR THE SURVIVAL OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN VENEZUELA. 
ALTERNATELY DRAMATIC AND BOMBASTIC, WITH FLASHES OF POPULISM AND 
AUTHORITARIANISM, CHAVEZ EMERGED FROM THIS THREE-DAY INAUGURAL 
CELEBRATION WITH AN ELECTRIFIED POPULATION, AN ARTICULATED AND 
ENVIGORATED AGENDA OF GOVERNMENT, AND HIS POLITICAL ADVERSARIES 
REELING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
VENEZUELA\'S NEW PRESIDENT 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) HUGO CHAVEZ WAS SWORN-IN AS VENEZUELA\'S PRESIDENT ON 
FEBRUARY 2, NEARLY SEVEN YEARS TO THE DAY AFTER HE HAD TRIED AND 
FAILED TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF THEN-PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES 
PEREZ IN 1992. 
 
3.  (U) THE SWEARING IN CEREMONY--WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE SENATE 
CHAMBER OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, BUT WAS BROADCAST LIVE ON 
NATIONAL TELEVISION AND CARRIED BY LOUDSPEAKER TO THOUSANDS OF RED- 
BERETED SUPPORTERS RINGING THE CONGRESS--WAS THE BEGINNING OF A 
THREE-DAY SERIES OF EVENTS AND CELEBRATIONS.  THESE INCLUDED THE 
SWEARING IN OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT AT MIRAFLORES  (THE PRESIDENTIAL 
PALACE), A WREATH-LAYING AT THE TOMB OF SIMON BOLIVAR, THE MILITARY 
CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY, A PUBLIC SPEECH BEFORE SEVERAL HUNDRED 
THOUSAND SUPPORTERS AT THE CARACAS EQUIVALENT OF THE MALL (LOS 
PROCERES), A STATE DINNER, AND A MILITARY PARADE. 
 
4. (U) OVER SIXTY COUNTRIES SENT DELEGATIONS TO THE INAUGURATION, 
INCLUDING SIXTEEN HEADS OF STATES.  THE U.S. DELEGATION CONSISTED 
OF: 
 
--  SECRETARY OF ENERGY BILL RICHARDSON 
--  AMBASSADOR JOHN MAISTO 
 
--  AMBASSADOR PETER ROMERO, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE AFFAIRS 
 
--  AMBASSADOR GABRIEL GUERRA MONDRAGON 
 
--  MARTIN CHAVEZ, FORMER MAYOR OF ALBERQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO 
 
5.  (U) SEPTELS REPORT MEETINGS U.S. DELEGATION HAD WITH PRESIDENT 
PASTRANA OF COLOMBIA, MINISTER OF MINES AND ENERGY ALI RODRIGUEZ, 
AND A LUNCH WITH CEOS OF VENEZUELA. 
 
-------------------------- 
THEMES OF CHAVEZ\' SPEECHES 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) CHAVEZ SET THE TONE FOR THE INAUGURATION AND HIS GOVERNMENT 
SHORTLY AFTER HE ENTERED THE SENATE CHAMBER.  ON HIS WAY TO THE 
DAIS, HE MARCHED PAST CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION 
PARTY\'S (AD) LEGISLATIVE LEADERS WITHOUT ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  HIS 
GREETING OF PRESIDENT CALDERA WAS POLITE BUT PERFUNCTORY.  THE 
TIGHT, ALMOST PAINFULLY ATTENTIVE DECORUM OF THE SENATE WAS 
IRRETRIEVABLY RUPTURED, HOWEVER, WHEN CHAVEZ TOOK HIS OATH OF 
OFFICE.  AFTER BEING ASKED BY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE LUIS DAVILA 
IF HE PROMISED TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS OF THE LAND, 
CHAVEZ RESPONDED, \"I SWEAR ON THIS MORIBUND CONSTITUTION,\" AND THEN 
ANNOUNCED, HIS RIGHT HAND STILL HELD HIGH, THAT HE WOULD DO ALL IN 
HIS POWER TO WRITE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND RETURN DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA.  AN AUDIBLE GASP RIPPLED 
THROUGH THE SENATE AT CHAVEZ\' DEPARTURE FROM PROTOCOL.  OUTSIDE THE 
CONGRESS, THOUSANDS OF RED-BERETED CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS CHEERED. 
 
7.  (U) IN THE SPEECH CHAVEZ GAVE IN THE SENATE FOLLOWING HIS 
SWEARING IN, AND IN FOLLOW-ON SPEECHES HE GAVE AT THE SWEARING IN 
OF HIS MINISTERS, THE PUBLIC SPEECH AT LOS PROCERES, AND IN REMARKS 
AT THE STATE DINNER AND THE MILITARY PARADE, SEVERAL THEMES WERE 
DOMINANT: 
 
--  ETHICAL AND MORAL CRISIS.  CHAVEZ BEGAN HIS SPEECH IN THE 
SENATE WITH A HARSH CONDEMNATION OF VENEZUELAN POLITICAL SOCIETY 
AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE VENEZUELAN STATE.  POINTING TO VENEZUELA\'S 
BOUNTIFUL NATURAL RESOURCES, ITS RELATIVELY SMALL AND YOUNG 
POPULATION, AND ITS ENORMOUS OIL WEALTH, HE WONDERED ALOUD HOW SUCH 
A COUNTRY COULD BE FACING A FISCAL CRISIS, HOW SUCH A COUNTRY COULD 
FIND EIGHTY PERCENT OF ITS POPULATION IN POVERTY, AND HOW SUCH A 
COUNTRY COULD HAVE STREET CHILDREN, ILLITERACY, AND A COLLAPSING 
PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  HE THEN FIXED BLAME FOR THIS SITUATION 
ON PUBLIC CORRUPTION AND THE NARROW CLIENTELISM OF TRADITIONAL 
POLITICAL PARTIES.  HE ACCUSED VENEZUELAN ELITES OF DEBASING PUBLIC 
LIFE, CREATING CORROSIVE CYNICISM, AND ESTRANGING CITIZENS FROM 
THEIR STATE.  THE RESULT, HE DECLARED, WAS AN AMORAL INDIVIDUALISM 
WHICH HAD CREATED A PROFOUND ETHICAL AND MORAL CRISIS.  ONLY BY 
RECOGNIZING THIS CRISIS, AND ADDRESSING IT THROUGH CREATION OF A 
REPRESENTATIVE AND PARTICIPATIVE STATE AND GOVERNMENT WHICH SERVED 
THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE, COULD VENEZUELA HOPE TO REBUILD 
ITSELF. 
 
--  FORGIVENESS.  WHILE POINTING AN ACCUSATORY FINGER AT 
VENEZUELA\'S TRADITIONAL POWER STRUCTURE, CHAVEZ REMINDED ALL 
VENEZUELANS THAT THEY WERE SILENT ACCOMPLICES IN THE DEBASEMENT OF 
THEIR DEMOCRACY.  HE INSISTED THAT NO ONE WAS FREE OF CULPABILITY. 
TO UNDERSCORE THIS POINT, HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF BORE BLAME FOR 
VENEZUELA\'S DIFFICULTIES.  HE THEN STRUCK HIS BREAST THREE TIMES 
AND SAID, \"MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA.\"  HE CALLED ON ALL 
VENEZUELANS TO FORGIVE EACH OTHER.  BUILDING ON THIS THEME DURING 
HIS FEBRUARY 4 SPEECH AT THE MILITARY PARADE, CHAVEZ ASKED PARDON 
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 1992 COUP.  IN HIS SENATE SPEECH, HE DESCRIBED 
THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT AS AN \"INEVITABLE\" RESULT OF THE 1989 SOCIAL 
UPRISING IN WHICH THE MILITARY HAD TO RESTORE ORDER AT THE COST OF 
HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF LIVES.  NEITHER JUSTIFYING NOR 
GLORIFYING WHAT HAPPENED IN 1992, HE LINKED THE COUP TO A POLITICAL 
ORDER WHICH HAD SET VENEZUELAN AGAINST VENEZUELAN.  THE COUP, HE 
SAID, WAS EMBLEMATIC OF THE CRISIS OF THE STATE.  ONLY BY ACCEPTING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS TAKEN, AND BY SEEKING FORGIVENESS, COULD 
VENEZUELA OVERCOME ITS CURRENT CRISIS.  HE REMINDED HIS LISTENERS 
THAT ON FEBRUARY 4, 1992, WHEN HIS COUP ATTEMPT HAD FAILED, HE 
SURRENDERED, ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE, AND 
SERVED TWO YEARS IN PRISON AS PUNISHMENT.  HE SAID HIS OWN 
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS SHOULD SERVE 
AS AN EXAMPLE TO FUGITIVE BANKERS AND OTHERS ACCUSED OF CRIMES. 
 
--  RECONCILIATION.  CHAVEZ SAID FORGIVENESS MUST LEAD TO 
RECONCILIATION IF VENEZUELANS WERE TO WORK TOGETHER TO RECREATE 
THEIR COUNTRY.  HE SAID HIS DECISION TO HOLD THE MILITARY PARADE ON 
FEBRUARY 4, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUP ATTEMPT, WAS NOT AN EFFORT 
TO GLORIFY THE EVENTS OF SEVEN YEARS AGO.  ON THE CONTRARY, HE SAID 
IT WAS AN EFFORT TO RECONCILE AN INSTITUTION AND A COUNTRY WHICH 
HAD BEEN RENT BY THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY 4.  DURING THE WREATH 
LAYING CEREMONY AT BOLIVAR\'S TOMB, HE LAID ONE WREATH FOR \"ALL THE 
SOLDIERS WHO DIED ON FEBRUARY 4.\"  HE ANNOUNCED IN THE SENATE, AS 
EVIDENCE OF RECONCILIATION, HIS INTENTION TO REACTIVATE THE 
PARATROOPER BATTALIONS THAT HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE COUP ATTEMPT. 
HE DID SO AT THE MILITARY PARADE, AND ALSO OFFERED TO REINSTATE IN 
THE ARMED FORCES THOSE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO HAD BEEN COURT 
MARTIALED FOLLOWING THE COUP. 
 
--  RESURRECTION.  CHAVEZ PREDICTED THAT VENEZUELA AND ITS PEOPLE 
WOULD BE \"RESURRECTED\" THROUGH FORGIVENESS AND RECONCILIATION. 
THIS RESURRECTION WOULD BE MANIFESTED THROUGH THE COMMON EFFORT OF 
VENEZUELANS TO FACE THEIR COUNTRY\'S DESPERATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
CONDITION.  HE CRITICIZED THOSE WHO CALLED FOR HIM TO CREATE 
CONSENSUS AROUND HIS POLITICAL AGENDA, ACCUSING THEM OF USING 
\"CONSENSUS\" TO SOW DIVISION.  HE ANNOUNCED, \"I AM NOT SEEKING 
CONSENSUS, I AM SEEKING UNITY.\"   HE INSISTED THAT THE VENEZUELAN 
PEOPLE HAD SPOKEN LOUDLY AND CLEARLY IN THE DECEMBER ELECTIONS. 
THEY WANTED DRAMATIC, SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CHANGE, AND THEY WOULD 
HOLD THEIR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING OR NOT IMPLEMENTING 
CHANGE.   IN THIS REGARD, RESURRECTION WAS LIKE THE REAWAKENING OF 
A GIANT--THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE--WHICH WOULD TOLERATE NO APPEAL TO 
\"LEGALISM\" OR \"COMMON POLITICAL PRACTICE\" TO DELAY NECESSARY 
REFORM. 
 
--  DEMOCRACY.  CHAVEZ ANNOUNCED IN THE SENATE, \"I AM THE 
CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE CAUSE\" OF THE PEOPLE\'S YEARNING FOR CHANGE. HE 
DECLARED HIMSELF THE VICTIM OF A DARK AND UGLY CAMPAIGN TO PAINT 
HIM AS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.  HE SAID THE REAL ENEMIES WERE HIS 
ACCUSERS, WHOSE CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION HAD BLINDED THEM TO THE 
SUFFERING OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF VENEZUELANS.  HE ASSERTED THAT 
HIS \"POLITICAL PROJECT\" WAS TO \"RELEGITIMIZE THE STATE\" AND TO \"RE- 
FOUND\" DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SO THAT THEY HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF 
THE PEOPLE.  HE ARGUED THAT HIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY 
WOULD BE THE CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE RE- 
INSERTED THEMSELVES INTO POLITICAL DEBATE.  ATTACKING THOSE WHO 
OPPOSED THE PROPOSAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, HE SAID, 
\"WHAT DO WE HAVE TO FEAR FROM THE PEOPLE?\"  HE POINTED TO THE 
DECEMBER 6 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS EVIDENCE OF THE POPULAR DEMAND 
FOR CHANGE, AND NOTED, \"WE CANNOT FAIL THE PEOPLE.\" HE ASSERTED 
THAT HE HAD OPENED A \"PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC CHANNEL\" FOR CHANGE, AND 
THAT ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THE WELL-BEING OF DEMOCRACY SHOULD 
WORK TO KEEP THAT CHANNEL OPEN.  IF WE FAIL, CHAVEZ SAID, \"THEN 
DEMOCRACY WILL FAIL.\"  CHAVEZ SAID THAT HE HAD TAKEN OFFICE TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE EVENTS OF 1989 AND 1992 NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN.  CHAVEZ 
REMINDED HIS LISTENERS THAT, DURING THE CALDERA GOVERNMENT, 
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAD BEEN SUSPENDED TEMPORARILY DURING THE 
FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 1993, AND HAD REMAINED SUSPENDED IN THE 
MILITARY THEATERS OF OPERATION ALONG THE COLOMBIAN FRONTIER.  HE 
SAID, \"I HAVE NOT TAKEN OFFICE TO SUSPEND GUARANTEES, BUT TO GIVE 
THESE GUARANTEES NEW LIFE AND TO EXTEND THEM TO ALL THE PEOPLE.\" 
 
------------ 
WORK AGENDA 
------------ 
 
8.  (U)  CHAVEZ USED THE THEMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS SPEECHES TO BUILD 
A BASE FOR HIS WORK AGENDA, WHICH WE LAID OUT CLEARLY: 
 
--   CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAVEZ SAID THE PRIMARY POLITICAL 
PROJECT OF HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  HE 
NOTED THAT OUTRIGHT OPPOSITION TO THE ASSEMBLY HAD NEARLY 
DISAPPEARED SINCE HIS ELECTION, AN IMPLICIT RECOGNITION THAT THE 
DECEMBER 6 VOTE WAS ALSO A VOTE IN FAVOR OF CHAVEZ\' PROPOSED 
\"CONSTITUYENTE.\"  CHAVEZ NOTED THAT CONGRESS, THROUGH THE SUPREME 
COURT DECISION WHICH HAD OPENED THE WAY FOR THE REFERENDUM ON THE 
ASSEMBLY, HAD PROPOSED TO CONVOKE THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF.  CHAVEZ 
WELCOMED CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE ASSEMBLY, BUT SAID THE 
CONGRESS WAS WASTING ITS TIME AND ENERGY ON A POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH 
THE DECEMBER ELECTIONS HAD DECIDED.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD 
ISSUE A DECREE FEBRUARY 2 CONVOKING THE REFERENDUM, WHICH HE DID 
DURING HIS FIRST CABINET MEETING IMMEDIATELY AFTER  HIS 
INAUGURATION.  CHAVEZ INSISTED THIS SURPRISE MOVE, WHICH LEFT MANY 
IN THE SENATE CHAMBER STUNNED, WAS NECESSARY TO GET THE CONGRESS TO 
FOCUS ON ITS REAL WORK--THE SECOND PART OF CHAVEZ\'S AGENDA--PASSING 
AN ENABLING LAW WHICH WOULD PERMIT CHAVEZ TO TAKE EMERGENCY 
ECONOMIC MEASURES. 
 
--  ECONOMIC REFORM.  CHAVEZ TOLD THE CONGRESS TO \"GET TO WORK\" AND 
PASS AN ENABLING LAW WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO ENACT A VARIETY OF 
ECONOMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS.  HE SAID 
THIS CRISIS REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ACTION, AND COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE 
POLITICAL DEBATE AROUND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY TO RUN ITS 
COURSE.  CHAVEZ SAID THAT HE WANTED SPECIAL POWERS TO DECREE A 
VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)--TO REPLACE THE CURRENT SALES TAX--AND A 
FINANCIAL SERVICES TAX, AND TO INSTITUTE CUSTOMS AND TARIFF REFORM. 
THESE MEASURES, ALONG WITH OTHERS, WOULD PERMIT THE GOV TO INCREASE 
ITS REVENUES AND BEGIN TO CLOSE A LARGE AND HAUNTING FISCAL GAP. 
CHAVEZ SAID EVEN WITH ENHANCED REVENUES VENEZUELA WOULD NOT BE ABLE 
TO PAY ITS DEBT, AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, WITHOUT GUTTING MUCH 
NEEDED SOCIAL PROGRAMS.  HE SAID THE GOV WOULD NEVER WALK AWAY FROM 
ITS FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS, BUT SAID HE WOULD SEEK RESTRUCTURING OF 
DEBT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  FINALLY, CHAVEZ SAID HE INTENDED TO MAKE 
VENEZUELA INVESTOR FRIENDLY BY MAINTAINING POLICY CONTINUITY, AND 
BY ENDING CORRUPTION AND JUDICIAL INSECURITY.  CHAVEZ URGED 
VENEZUELAN INVESTORS TO LEAD THE WAY FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS, CALLING 
ON THEM TO BRING BACK TO VENEZUELA THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW 
DEPOSITED OFFSHORE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S THREE-DAY INAUGURAL CELEBRATION WAS DRAMATIC.  HIS 
ENERGY, AND WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK ENDLESSLY (BY THE END OF THE FIRST 
DAY OF THE CELEBRATION--FEBRUARY 2--CHAVEZ HAD SPOKEN PUBLICLY SIX 
TIMES FOR A TOTAL OF MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS), WAS IN MARKED CONTRAST 
TO THE AGED PRESIDENT CALDERA.  NOT SINCE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\'S 
1989 INAUGURATION HAD VENEZUELANS SEEN A PRESIDENT WITH SUCH A 
COMMANDING PRESENCE.  BUT CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION WAS UNIQUE IN 
SEVERAL WAYS.  FIRST, IT WAS A POPULAR CELEBRATION.  THE CROWDS 
MASSED AROUND THE CONGRESS, AND THE CROWDS WHICH AWAITED CHAVEZ AT 
LOS PROCERES FOR HIS PUBLIC SPEECH, OFFERED LARGE AND VOCIFEROUS 
EVIDENCE THAT CHAVEZ IS A POLITICAL CELEBRITY WHOSE PERSONA AND 
MESSAGE RESONATE DEEPLY AMONG THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE.  SECOND, 
CHAVEZ\'S CALL FOR FORGIVENESS AND HIS CHALLENGE TO VENEZUELANS TO 
IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND TO GET TO WORK WAS INNOVATIVE POLITICAL 
RHETORIC TO WHICH ALL VENEZUELANS RESPONDED.   IT MARKED CHAVEZ AS 
DIFFERENT.  AS ONE SPECTATOR AT THE SENATE SPEECH TOLD US, \"I CAN 
NEVER REMEMBER A VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT ASKING FORGIVENESS FOR 
ANYTHING.  IN A SINGLE SPEECH CHAVEZ HAS SET HIMSELF APART FROM 
EVERY PRESIDENT WHO CAME BEFORE HIM.\"  FINALLY, THERE WAS 
SUBSTANCE.  CHAVEZ LEFT NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION.  HIS TWO-PART AGENDA, AND THE DETERMINATION WITH 
WHICH HE LAID IT OUT, LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT ANY ONE WHO OPPOSED 
HIM SHOULD BE READY TO FIGHT. 
 
10.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION ALSO RAISED CONCERNS.  THE FLASHES 
OF POPULISM IN HIS SPEECH, HIS MOVEMENT FROM HUMILITY TO PRIDEFUL 
PURPOSE, AND THE AUTHORITARIAN THREAT WHICH LURKED BEHIND HIS TOUGH 
POLICY STATEMENTS WERE CONSIDERED, BY THE TRADITIONAL POLITICIANS, 
TO BE A PORTENT OF VERY TOUGH TIMES AHEAD.  THOSE ACCUSTOMED TO THE 
STYLIZED POLITICAL RHETORIC AND \"YOU SCRATCH MY BACK, I\'LL SCRATCH 
YOURS\" CONDUCT OF PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS WERE UNPREPARED FOR CHAVEZ\'S 
FORCEFUL BREAK WITH PAST PRACTICE.  THESE ASPECTS BEAR WATCHING, 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN SAY THAT CHAVEZ\'S INAUGURATION HAS LEFT 
LITTLE DOUBT ABOUT WHO IS PRESIDENT, ELECTRIFIED VENEZUELANS, AND 
DEALT A BLOW TO THE SOLAR PLEXUS OF HIS ADVERSARIES, LEAVING THEM, 
FOR THE MOMENT, GASPING AND BENT OVER.  MEANWHILE, CHAVEZ, AWARE 
THAT HE MUST CAPITALIZE ON HIS MOMENTUM, IS PUTTING IN EIGHTEEN 
HOUR DAYS WORKING ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM AND MOLDING 
HIS GOVERNMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ\'S FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE HAVE 
BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DRAMATIC AND CONFRONTATIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF 
HIS AGENDA OF POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, ADMINISTRATIVE 
FUMBLING AS HE ATTEMPTS TO INSTALL HIS GOVERNING TEAM, AND 
CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY FROM THE CALDERA ADMINISTRATION. HIS 
IMPATIENCE WITH ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE, PROFOUND SUSPICION OF HIS 
POLITICAL ADVERSARIES, AND NEED TO RESPOND TO HIS POPULAR SUPPORT 
BASE HAVE LED TO ACTION AND RHETORIC WHICH, WHILE WELL WITHIN THE 
BOUNDS OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE (EXCEPT FOR  REMARK ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT FROM WHICH HE QUICKLY STEPPED BACK), HAVE GIVEN RISE TO 
CHARGES OF AUTHORITARIANISM. HIS ADVERSARIES DEEPLY RESENT HIS 
HECTORING WAYS, BUT HIS POPULARITY CONTINUES TO GROW WITH EACH 
SLASHING ATTACK AGAINST TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES AND CORRUPT 
PRACTICES.  DURING HIS FIRST FIVE WEEKS, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS-- 
SUCH AS THE CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT--HAVE LEARNED TO PUSH 
BACK WHEN SHOVED, AND A RECOGNIZABLE OPPOSITION IS SLOWLY FORMING 
IN THE CONGRESS.  IN THE MEANTIME, CHAVEZ\'S GREATEST THREAT COMES 
NOT FROM HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES, BUT FROM AN ECONOMY WHICH CANNOT 
PAY THE GOVERNMENT\'S BILLS, GENERATE EMPLOYMENT, OR PROVIDE THE 
ADDITIONAL REVENUE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
THE FIRST FIVE WEEKS 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (C) LIKE PECOS BILL RIDING THE TORNADO, PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ 
HAS STRAPPED HIMSELF TO THE BACK OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY AND VOWED 
TO RIDE IT TOWARDS PROFOUND POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. 
UNDAUNTED BY ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES OR THE NICETIES OF 
PARLIAMENTARY DISCOURSE, THE AT TIMES RHETORICALLY AGGRESSIVE 
CHAVEZ HAS CHALLENGED VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS 
TO RESPOND TO THE RESULTS OF THE DECEMBER 6 ELECTION AND TO MAKE 
VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY RELEVANT TO THE EVERY DAY CONCERNS OF THE 
VENEZUELAN PEOPLE. 
 
3.  (C)  IN SHORT ORDER, CHAVEZ HAS: 
 
--  ISSUED A DECREE CALLING FOR A REFERENDUM ON HIS PROPOSED 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY; 
 
--  ORDERED THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO BEGIN PREPARATIONS 
FOR THE REFERENDUM; 
 
--  ESTABLISHED A PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR 
SUCH AN ASSEMBLY; 
 
--  BEGUN A SERIES OF CONSULTATIONS WITH KEY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL 
SECTORS REGARDING THE AGENDA OF THE ASSEMBLY; 
 
--  SUBMITTED AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENABLING LAW TO THE 
CONGRESS, WHICH, IF APPROVED, WOULD GIVE HIM BROAD POWERS TO 
ADDRESS VENEZUELA\'S FISCAL CRISIS; 
 
--  JUMP-STARTED HIS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
THROUGH HIS \"PLAN BOLIVAR 2000,\" A MILITARY-RUN CIVIC ACTION 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING SUCH WARMLY-RECEIVED WORK IN THE POOREST SECTORS 
OF CARACAS AS PICKING UP TRASH, PAINTING SCHOOLS, AND STAFFING 
CLINICS WITH MILITARY DOCTORS). 
 
4.  (C) CHAVEZ HAS PUSHED HIS AGENDA IN A PUGNACIOUS AND 
CONFRONTATIONAL FASHION.  HE HAS LEAP-FROGGED THE CONGRESS ON THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY REFERENDUM, THREATENED THE SUPREME COURT 
WITH POPULAR WRATH THAT HE WOULD CHAMPION SHOULD IT BLOCK HIS PLANS 
FOR A REFERENDUM, AND CHARACTERIZED VENEZUELA\'S TRADITIONAL 
POLITICAL PARTIES AND INSTITUTIONS AS CORRUPT AND INEFFECTIVE. 
 
5.  (C) HIS HARD-HITTING AND POPULIST RHETORIC, WHILE WITHIN THE 
BOUNDS OF DEMOCRATIC TRADITION AND PRACTICE, HAS PROVOKED THE 
RESENTMENT AND HOSTILITY OF HIS ADVERSARIES.  THEIR INITIAL EFFORTS 
TO BLOCK OR RE-ROUTE CHAVEZ\'S CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY INITIATIVE 
WERE STEAM-ROLLERED BY CHAVEZ, WHO REFUSED TO ALLOW THEIR 
INSTITUTIONAL POSITION TO DILUTE OR DIMINISH WHAT CHAVEZ BELIEVES 
IS HIS ELECTORAL MANDATE TO EFFECT SWEEPING POLITICAL CHANGES. 
 
6.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S SUCCESS IN DRIVING HIS POLITICAL AGENDA FORWARD 
HAS HAD ONE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE:  MOVEMENT TOWARDS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IS A REALITY.  THE QUESTION NOW IS NOT 
WHETHER SUCH AN ASSEMBLY WILL HAPPEN, BUT HOW AND UNDER WHAT 
CONDITIONS.  THE RECOGNITION OF THIS HAS FORCED MOST IMPORTANT 
POLITICAL ACTORS TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF CHANGE, AND TO LOOK FOR 
A WAY TO LINK THEMSELVES TO THE REFORM PROCESS.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
CHAVEZ\'S CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS HAVE ACTIVATED NATURAL DEMOCRATIC 
DEFENSE MECHANISMS.  INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE CONGRESS AND THE 
SUPREME COURT, ARE LEARNING HOW TO PUSH BACK WHEN SHOVED.  FOR 
INSTANCE, WHEN CHAVEZ \"THREATENED\" THE SUPREME COURT ON ITS PENDING 
REFERENDUM DECISION, CHIEF JUSTICE CECILIA SOSA PUBLICLY LECTURED 
CHAVEZ ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE 
COURT WOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED.  THAT MEETING WAS FOLLOWED BY A 
CHAVEZ VISIT TO THE SUPREME COURT, AFTER WHICH HE STATED THAT HE 
WOULD, OF COURSE, ACCEPT WHATEVER DECISION THE COURT MADE.  THE 
RESULT HAS BEEN A CLEARER DEFINITION OF THE INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY 
OF THESE INSTITUTIONS.  ALSO, OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT IS 
FORMING IN THE CONGRESS AND ELSEWHERE.  THIS OPPOSITION, 
RECOGNIZING THE NECESSITY OF CHANGE, IS WORKING TO INFLUENCE THAT 
CHANGE, AND ENSURE THAT IT TAKES PLACE WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. 
 
----------------------- 
ADMINISTRATIVE FUMBLING 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S SUCCESS IN DRIVING FORWARD HIS POLITICAL AGENDA 
HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED IN THE FORMATION OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  SLOW 
MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS, EVEN SLOWER SELECTION OF KEY DIRECTOR- 
LEVEL POSITIONS WITHIN MINISTRIES, AND THE PRESIDENT\'S TENDENCY TO 
TALK TOO MUCH AND MAKE POLICY DURING PRESS CONFERENCES HAVE GIVEN 
THE FIRST MONTH OF GOVERNMENT AN AD HOC, IMPULSIVE QUALITY. 
 
8.  (C) LACKING A TESTED, LOYAL PARTY CADRE, AND FACED WITH AN 
ANXIOUS AND SOMETIMES INSOLENT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, CHAVEZ HAS 
HAD TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE MACHINERY OF 
GOVERNMENT.  ONE WAY HAS BEEN TO NAME FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS TO 
KEY POSITIONS WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY.  HIS ADVERSARIES ACCUSE HIM 
OF \"MILITARIZING\" GOVERNMENT.  ANOTHER INTERPRETATION WOULD BE THAT 
HE IS USING PEOPLE HE KNOWS AND TRUSTS TO GAIN CONTROL AND SET 
DIRECTION.  IN SOME INSTANCES THIS STRATEGY HAS WORKED, IN OTHERS 
IT HAS NOT.  WHILE TRUSTWORTHY, MANY OF THE MILITARY APPOINTEES 
HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CIVILIAN MINISTRIES, HAVE LITTLE POLICY 
ORIENTATION, AND EVEN LESS UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL NATURE OF 
THEIR WORK.  THE RESULT HAS BEEN UNEVEN PERFORMANCE IN MANY 
MINISTRIES. 
 
9.  (C) IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CHAVEZ IS IN THE PROCESS OF 
SHRINKING THE NUMBER OF MINISTRIES FROM 26 TO APPROXIMATELY 15, AND 
HAS DECIDED TO HOLD ALL MINISTRIES AND MINISTERS TO ACCOUNT.  THIS 
HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.  (HE ALSO HAS TO TACKLE THE PROMISED 
REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WHICH HE IS 
AVOIDING FOR THE TIME BEING.)  IN THIS REGARD, CHAVEZ HAS INVITED 
SCRUTINY WHICH, WHILE IMPORTANT TO THE PROCESS OF CHANGE, WILL BE 
PAINFUL FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT TRYING TO GET STARTED.  IN SHORT, IT 
WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE IN. 
 
----------------------------- 
CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY 
----------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S CAMPAIGN RHETORIC HAD CREATED CONCERN WITHIN THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR THAT THE NEWLY-ELECTED PRESIDENT WOULD IMPLEMENT 
POPULIST ECONOMIC POLICY, DEEPENING VENEZUELA\'S ALREADY SERIOUS 
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  DURING HIS FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE, HOWEVER, 
CHAVEZ HAS STEERED CLEAR OF SUCH POLICY, DECIDING INSTEAD TO 
MAINTAIN THE REFORM-MINDED ECONOMIC POLICY OF HIS PREDECESSOR. 
SPECIFICALLY, CHAVEZ HAS: 
 
--  NAMED MARITZA IZAGUIRRE AS FINANCE MINISTER (SHE WAS CALDERA\'S 
FINANCE MINISTER AND THE GOV\'S LINK TO THE MULTILATERAL BANKS); 
 
--  REQUESTED, IN THE ENABLING LAW HE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, 
EMERGENCY POWERS TO REINFORCE IZAGUIRRE\'S APPROACH TO VENEZUELA\'S 
FISCAL CRISIS THROUGH COST CUTTING AND REVENUE RAISING MEASURES; 
 
--  LEFT ANTONIO CASAS AS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK 
 
--  MAINTAINED CASAS\' SCORCHED-EARTH DEFENSE OF THE STRONG BOLIVAR; 
 
--  BEGUN TALKS WITH THE IMF. 
 
11.  (C) CHAVEZ, COGNIZANT THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE ECONOMIC 
WHEREWITHAL TO MEET VENEZUELA\'S PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS, IS 
ATTEMPTING TO ENHANCE GOVERNMENT REVENUES.  AGAIN, HE HAS FORSAKEN 
A POPULIST APPROACH.  INSTEAD, HE HAS: 
 
--  REQUESTED AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES, INCLUDING A VALUE 
ADDED TAX, FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX, AND REFORM OF THE INCOME TAX 
LAW; 
 
--  ORDERED IMPROVED TAX COLLECTION AT SENIAT AND CUSTOMS; 
 
--  LIMITED PUBLIC SECTOR WAGE INCREASES TO TWENTY PERCENT (BELOW 
THE 30 PERCENT INFLATION REGISTERED IN 1998, AND THE GOV\'S LATEST 
PROJECTED INFLATION RATE OF 25 PERCENT IN 1999); 
 
--  AUTHORIZED THE STATE OIL COMPANY PDVSA TO BORROW USD 1 BILLION 
(WHICH MATCHES PDVSA\'S ANTICIPATED ROYALTIES AND TAXES) ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS; 
 
--  DECIDED TO FINANCE THE BS 800 BILLION DEFICIT FOR THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF 1999 THROUGH REDUCTION IN MONETARY STABILIZATION 
INSTRUMENT (TEMS) ISSUANCES AND AN EVEN GREATER EXPANSION IN 
ISSUANCE OF NATIONAL PUBLIC DEBT BONDS (DPNS). 
 
----------------- 
RACE AGAINST TIME 
----------------- 
 
12.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S DECISION TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC 
POLICY IS DRIVEN BY THE PRIMACY OF HIS POLITICAL AGENDA.  CONCERNED 
THAT DRAMATIC ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ECONOMY WOULD EXPOSE HIM TO 
POLITICAL ATTACK, CHAVEZ HAS DECIDED TO PUSH HIS POLITICAL AGENDA 
AS FAR AND AS FAST AS HE CAN BEFORE TURNING TO DEAL WITH THE 
ECONOMY.  CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC POLICY BUYS HIM SOME POLITICAL 
SPACE, SINCE THE CONSENSUS AROUND THIS POLICY ALREADY EXISTS. 
 
13.  (C) HOWEVER, CHAVEZ CAN ONLY CARRY THIS CONTINUITY FORWARD FOR 
SO LONG.  HE KNOWS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SITS ON A CRUMBLING ECONOMIC 
BASE.  STILL DECLINING OIL PRICES AND SELF-IMPOSED PRODUCTION CUTS 
HAVE AGGRAVATED THE CURRENT RECESSION.  HIGH INTEREST RATES AND THE 
INCREASINGLY OVERVALUED EXCHANGE RATE HAVE UNDERMINED THE HEALTH OF 
THE MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURAL, AND TOURISM SECTORS.  INFLATION IS 
STILL HIGH. 
 
14.  (C) ADDITIONALLY, CHAVEZ STILL HAS TO CONVINCE THE 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (IFIS) AND THE FOREIGN BANKS 
THAT HE HAS THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN HAND, AND THE 
POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS.  TO DO THIS HE NEEDS AN 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE IMF AND PERSONAL EXPOSURE IN NEW YORK. 
CHAVEZ\'S TWO POSTPONED VISITS HAVE HURT HIM, AND HE AND HIS TOP 
ADVISORS ARE ONLY NOW UNDERSTANDING HOW MUCH. 
 
15.  (C)  VENEZUELA\'S BATTERED ECONOMIC AGENTS HAVE RESPONDED TO 
THESE WEAK ECONOMIC SIGNALS BY PREPARING FOR EVEN MORE DIFFICULT 
TIMES: 
 
--  INVESTORS CONTINUE TO SIT ON THEIR WALLETS; 
 
--  BANKS ARE PULLING BACK ON LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND INCREASING 
PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBT; 
 
--  COMPANIES ARE SHUTTING DOWN PLANTS AND ASSEMBLY LINES AND 
LAYING OFF WORKERS TO REDUCE COSTS; 
 
--  WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS ARE LOWERING PRICES TO CUT 
INVENTORIES; 
 
--  CONSUMERS ARE FORGOING LUXURY ITEMS, POSTPONING LARGE 
PURCHASES, AND PAYING OFF CONSUMER DEBT. 
 
16.  (C)  AS CHAVEZ ENTERS HIS SECOND MONTH OF GOVERNMENT, THE BIG 
QUESTION IS HOW LONG HE CAN POSTPONE MAJOR ECONOMIC REFORMS WHILE 
HE FULFILLS HIS POLITICAL AGENDA.  THE REFERENDUM FOR THE HOLDING 
OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 25.  THE ELECTION 
OF THE ASSEMBLY, THE WRITING OF A NEW CONSTITUTION, A REFERENDUM TO 
ACCEPT THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE ELECTION OF A NEW CONGRESS WILL 
PROBABLY RUN THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. 
 
17.  (C)  CHAVEZ\'S EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF ECONOMIC 
POLICY MAY NOT LAST THAT LONG.  THE GOV HAS ENOUGH INTERNAL DOLLAR 
RESOURCES (THE REMAINING USD 680 MILLION IN TREASURY BONDS RELEASED 
FROM THE 1997 GLOBAL BOND SWAP AND USD 160 MILLION IN NON- 
MONETARIZED GOLD) TO MEET VENEZUELA\'S FOREIGN DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH 
THE END OF MARCH.  AFTER THAT IT WILL HAVE TO RELY ON STATE OIL 
COMPANY PDVSA\'S EFFORTS TO RAISE FUNDS IN THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL 
MARKETS AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF VENEZUELA\'S DECLINING INTERNATIONAL 
RESERVES TO FINANCE FUTURE DEBT PAYMENTS.  THE PDVSA BORROWING WILL 
BE COSTLY (300 TO 400 BASIS POINTS OVER TREASURY RATES) BECAUSE THE 
MARKETS KNOW THAT THESE FUNDS WILL END UP IN THE GOV\'S ACCOUNTS. 
THE GOV WILL ALSO HAVE TO RELY ON THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DPNS 
TO MEET THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL.  THIS QUIET SCRAMBLE FOR FOREIGN 
AND DOMESTIC RESOURCES SHOULD PAY THE GOV\'S BILLS THROUGH THE END 
OF THE SECOND QUARTER. 
 
18.  (C)  AFTER THAT, IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.  OIL PRICES 
MAY RECOVER, BUDGET CUTS AND REVENUE MEASURES MAY BEGIN TO TAKE 
EFFECT, AND THE GOV MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE YEAR. 
ALTERNATIVELY, THE MARKET COULD LOOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE GOV\'S 
ABILITY TO FINANCE ITS DEFICIT, PROVOKING A RUN ON THE BOLIVAR AND 
A SUDDEN LOSS OF RESERVES.  THIS COULD FORCE THE GOV TO IMPLEMENT 
PRICE AND EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR A MAXI-DEVALUATION.  THE RESULTING 
SURGE IN INFLATION COULD THEN UNDERMINE CHAVEZ\' POLITICAL SUPPORT 
AND INVIGORATE HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN THE MIDST OF THE 
POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS. 
 
----------------- 
WHAT IT ALL MEANS 
----------------- 
 
19.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ELECTED TO BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL 
CHANGE IN VENEZUELA.  IT IS UP TO HIS GOVERNMENT, THROUGH 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, IMPROVED GOVERNMENT, AND ECONOMIC REFORM, TO 
MAKE DEMOCRACY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS MEANINGFUL TO THE EVERYDAY 
CONCERNS OF VENEZUELANS.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE IS THE 
CONSEQUENCE, AND NOT THE CAUSE, OF CHANGE IN VENEZUELA. 
 
20.  (C) HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT HIS POLITICAL AGENDA IS MOVING 
THROUGH A NARROWING ECONOMIC SPACE.  HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO 
COMPLETE HIS IMMEDIATE POLITICAL AGENDA BEFORE HE IS CAUGHT IN AN 
ECONOMY IN DEEP CRISIS.  HOWEVER, HE INTENDS TO GET AS FAR ALONG 
THE PATH OF POLITICAL CHANGE AS POSSIBLE.  AT THE LEAST, HE HOPES 
TO HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IN PLACE THAT SUPPORTS HIS 
POLITICAL AGENDA. 
 
21.  (C) CHAVEZ\'S FIRST FIVE WEEKS IN OFFICE HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC AND 
HIGHLY-CHARGED.  NO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS BROUGHT SUCH 
EXPECTATION TO OFFICE.  NO VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HAS SET SUCH A HIGH 
STANDARD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.  NO VENEZUELAN 
PRESIDENT HAS EVER ANTICIPATED SUCH DIRE RESULTS SHOULD HE FAIL. 
GIVEN THIS, CHAVEZ\'S IS OFF TO A DECENT START.  HOWEVER, TO 
SUCCEED, CHAVEZ MUST USE THE NEXT MONTHS TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM 
OF HIS POLITICAL AGENDA, IMPROVE HIS ADMINISTRATION, AND HOPE THE 
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO HOLD TOGETHER AS HIS INHERITED REFORMIST 
ECONOMIC POLICY, WITH HELP FROM THE IFIS AND FOREIGN BANKS, FALLS 
INTO PLACE.  THIS IS A TALL ORDER, BUT ONE THAT HE APPEARS TO BE 
DOGGEDLY COMMITTED TO CARRY THROUGH.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THE DIPLOMATIC FLAP BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA 
PROVOKED BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S MARCH 10 PRESS CONFERENCE COMMENT 
IS OVER.  VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL AND HIS COLOMBIAN 
COUNTERPART HAVE WORKED HARD TO RESOLVE THE INCIDENT AND TO FOCUS 
AGAIN ON THE TASK AT HAND:  MANAGING A COMPLEX BILATERAL RELA- 
TIONSHIP IN A WAY WHICH PROMOTES THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS AND 
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VALID VENEZUELAN BORDER SECURITY CONCERNS. 
WHILE WORRISOME, THE INCIDENT DOES NOT PRESAGE AN INCREASE IN 
TENSION BETWEEN BOTH COUNTRIES.  NEITHER SIDE IS LOOKING FOR A 
FIGHT.  THE INCIDENT DOES, HOWEVER, SHOW THE FARC\'S ABILITY TO 
MANIPULATE LINGERING DOUBTS AND HISTORIC ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN BOTH 
COUNTRIES TO THE FARC\'S ADVANTAGE.  IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE 
A SPECIAL ROLE TO PLAY TO HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE AND TO DEFINE 
ROLES AS VENEZUELA SEEKS TO ENGAGE POSITIVELY IN THE COLOMBIAN 
PEACE PROCESS.  END SUMMARY.

YESTERDAY\'S NEWS 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C) REFS A AND B INDICATE THAT THE DIPLOMATIC FLAP PROVOKED 
BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\'S MARCH 10 PRESS CONFERENCE REMARKS IS OVER. 
VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, ON MARCH 11, DECLARED THE 
INCIDENT \"TRANSITORY AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL\" AND \"WELL ON ITS WAY TO 
BEING RESOLVED.\"  ACCORDING TO REF A, COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
FERNANDEZ DE SOTO, ON MARCH 12, SAID THE \"DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN 
FULLY RESOLVED.\"  COLOMBIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO VENEZUELA 
LUIS GUILLERMO GIRALDO, ON MARCH 15, TOLD AMBASSADOR, \"THE 
INCIDENT IS OVER.\" 
 
---------- 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
3.  (C) HARD WORK BY RANGEL AND FERNANDEZ DE SOTO HAS PUT THIS 
FLAP BEHIND BOTH COUNTRIES, AND FOCUSED ATTENTION WHERE IT SHOULD 
BE:  MANAGING A COMPLEX BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN A WAY WHICH 
PROMOTES THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 
VALID VENEZUELAN BORDER SECURITY CONCERNS.  THE NEXT STEP IN THIS 
PROCESS, ACCORDING TO RANGEL, WILL BE A MEETING, AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE, OF FOREIGN MINISTERS.  THIS MEETING WILL SET THE STAGE 
FOR A MEETING BETWEEN CHAVEZ AND PASTRANA.  FROM OUR CONVERSA- 
TIONS WITH RANGEL AND GIRALDO, BOTH SIDES RECOGNIZE THAT THIS 
PRESIDENTIAL MEETING MUST BE VERY CAREFULLY HANDLED.  GIRALDO 
TOLD US THAT THE COMMUNIQUE AND PRESS CONFERENCES WHICH WOULD 
RESULT FROM SUCH A MEETING WOULD REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION, AS 
THE MEDIA WILL BE PROBING FOR ANY SIGN OF DISAGREEMENT OR DIS- 
PUTE. 
 
--------------------------- 
WHAT THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) AS THE COLOMBIANS AND THE VENEZUELANS PUT THIS ASPECT OF 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP BACK ON TRACK, IT IS WORTHWHILE LOOKING AT 
WHAT THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN AND, THEN, AT WHAT IT DOES MEAN. 
SPECIFICALLY, THE FLAP DOES NOT MEAN: 
 
--  AN INCREASE IN OVERALL TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE 
VENEZUELA-COLOMBIA RELATIONSHIP IS SOLIDLY FIXED IN A TIGHTLY 
WOVEN LATTICE OF COMMERCIAL, CULTURAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND MIGRATION 
PATTERNS AND RELATIONSHIPS.  THIS FOUNDATION HAS WEATHERED FAR 
WORSE TEMPESTS THAN THE RECENT FLAP. 
 
--  A HEIGHTENED POTENTIAL FOR BORDER INCIDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN 
REGARD TO MARITIME BOUNDARIES.  NEITHER COUNTRY IS LOOKING FOR A 
FIGHT.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE POLITICAL BUFFER 
OF BINATIONAL COMMISSIONS AND STUDY GROUPS TO ADDRESS ALL THESE 
ISSUES, AND TO MANAGE THEM IN A LOW KEY AND REGULAR FASHION. 
FURTHERMORE, AT AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL, THE MILITARIES OF BOTH 
COUNTRIES HAVE GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIPS ALONG THE FRONTIER, AS 
GENERAL WILHELM SAW DURING HIS VISIT LAST OCTOBER.  MOREOVER, WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN MILITARY LEADERSHIP HAS 
OPTIMAL RELATIONS WITH THEIR COLOMBIAN COUNTERPARTS.  REGULAR 
REPORTING ON INFORMAL INTELLIGENCE-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN 
BORDER UNITS, VENEZUELAN EXTRACTION AND INSERTION ASSISTANCE TO 
COLOMBIAN UNITS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCEDURES TO MANAGE 
CROSS-BORDER PURSUIT AND OTHER INCIDENTS FAR OUTWEIGH PRESS 
REPORTS OF ONE ARMY OR THE OTHER DEFILING THE TERRITORY OF THE 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY. 
 
----------------- 
WHAT IT DOES MEAN 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) WHAT THE FLAP DOES MEAN: 
 
--  CHAVEZ TALKS TOO MUCH.  AS WE NOTED IN REF B, CHAVEZ NEEDS TO 
CULTIVATE SOME DISCRETION WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN PEACE 
PROCESS.  FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, DEFENSE MINISTER, AND OTHERS 
AROUND CHAVEZ RECOGNIZE THIS.  THEY HAVE TOLD HIM TO MEASURE HIS 
WORDS.  THAT SAID, CHAVEZ IS TALKING TO THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE 
ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA, AND ITS IMPACT ON VENEZUELA, IN 
AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WAY.  NO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE 
THIS.  THE CALDERA GOVERNMENT MANAGED A TWO-TRACK POLICY OF 
PUBLICLY DEALING WITH THE GOC WHILE SECRETLY TREATING WITH THE 
GUERRILLAS.  CHAVEZ HAS BROUGHT THIS RELATIONSHIP OUT INTO THE 
OPEN, AND, IN THE PROCESS, TRIED TO ESTABLISH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY 
ON THE PART OF THE GUERRILLAS FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN VENEZUELAN 
TERRITORY. 
 
--  VENEZUELA IS ASSERTING ITS INTEREST IN THE COLOMBIAN PEACE 
PROCESS.  WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, VENEZUELANS PERCEIVE THAT 
THE GOC IS NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE 
VENEZUELAN SIDE OF THE FRONTIER.  VENEZUELANS TELL ALL WHO WILL 
LISTEN THAT THEIRS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE REGION WHICH WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF NEIGHBORING TROOPS ON THE 
BORDER.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE GOC IS HARD-PRESSED JUST TO 
MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF MAJOR CITIES AND ECONOMIC CENTERS, THE 
GOV RESENTS THAT BORDER SECURITY HAS DEVOLVED ALMOST SOLELY TO 
THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES.  IN THIS REGARD, THE COLOMBIAN PEACE 
PROCESS IS NOT SIMPLY AN INTERNAL AFFAIR OF COLOMBIA. 
 
--  THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE GOV 
ANTICIPATED.  WHILE THE GOV HAS HAD A RING-SIDE SEAT SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF THE INSURGENCY, AND HAS WATCHED WITH FASCINATED 
HORROR WHILE COLOMBIANS SLAUGHTERED EACH OTHER, IT ENTERED THE 
PEACE PROCESS AS AN INGENUE.  CHAVEZ THOUGHT HIS PERSONAL RELA- 
TIONSHIP WITH PASTRANA WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SECURE THE TRUST OF THE 
GOC, AND THAT HIS BOLIVARIAN RHETORIC AND THE CONNECTION OF SOME 
OF HIS POLITICAL ALLIES TO THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WIN 
THEIR COLLABORATION.  HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT BOTH SIDES OF 
THE COLOMBIAN CONFLICT WOULD VIEW WITH SUSPICION AND DISTRUST HIS 
BARGING INTO THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE ALSO DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT 
ELEMENTS OF BOTH SIDES WOULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXCLUDE 
HIM FROM THE PROCESS.  FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF THE PAST TWO 
WEEKS--SPECIFICALLY, THE KILLING OF THE THREE U.S. CITIZENS AND 
THE PASTRANA MEETING POSTPONEMENT--CHAVEZ AND HIS GOVERNMENT 
LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON.  AS RANGEL TOLD US (REF B), THEY ARE 
NOW REFLECTING ON THEIR ROLE IN THAT PROCESS. 
 
--  THE GUERRILLAS ARE CAPABLE OF MANIPULATING LINGERING SUSPI- 
CIONS AND HISTORIC ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA. 
THE FARC AND THE ELN ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO BENEFIT FROM THE 
RECENT FLAP.  BY TRYING TO PLAY ONE COUNTRY OFF AGAINST THE 
OTHER, THEY SEEK TO CREATE DIVISIONS AMONG THE PROTAGONISTS OF 
PEACE.  AS RANGEL TOLD US, THE GOV VIEWS THE RECENT GUT-WRENCHING 
BRUTALITY OF THE EXECUTION OF THE THREE U.S. CITIZENS AS JUST 
SUCH A PROVOCATION, DESIGNED TO CAUSE PROBLEMS AND DOUBTS AMONG 
VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, AND THE THIRD PLAYER IN THE PEACE PRO- 
CESS:  THE U.S. 
 
--------------- 
WHAT WE MUST DO 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C) THE VENEZUELANS HAVE REACHED OUT TO US AND REQUESTED OUR 
HELP IN EVALUATING RECENT EVENTS AND IN DEFINING THEIR ROLE IN 
THE PEACE PROCESS.  WE SHOULD RESPOND QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY TO 
THIS REQUEST.  AS AMEMBASSY BOGOTA NOTES IN REF A, COOLER HEADS 
HAVE PREVAILED IN THIS MOST RECENT INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT 
THE ANTAGONISTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE THE FARC AND THE ELN, WE CAN 
EXPECT MORE PROVOCATIONS.

CARACAS 00560 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON:  1.5(D). 
 
1.  (U) DURING AN APRIL 28 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, 
AMBASSADOR WAS PRESENTED WITH A LETTER FROM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT 
HUGO CHAVEZ TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.  (LETTER AND ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
WERE PASSED TO WASHINGTON PER REF. A, TEXT BELOW.)  UPON EXITING 
THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S OFFICE, RANGEL PRESENTED THE CHAVEZ LETTER 
TO AMBASSADOR FORMALLY BEFORE THE WAITING MEDIA CORPS.  AMBASSADOR 
RESPONDED TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS \"GOOD.\"  ASKED WHY THE 
PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA FELT IT NECESSARY TO PERSONALLY SEND A 
MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON NOW, AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THE REPORTER 
ASK FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, ADDING THAT IT IS ALWAYS POSITIVE 
WHENEVER CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES COMMUNICATE 
DIRECTLY. 
 
2. (C) IN THE PRIVATE MEETING BEFORE THE UNEXPECTED, SET-UP PUBLIC 
PRESENTATION, AMBASSADOR CALLED RANGEL\'S ATTENTION TO THE LETTER\'S 
LAST PARAGRAPH, SPECIFICALLY ASKING IF CHAVEZ WAS REFERRING THEREIN 
TO THE JANUARY MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THEN 
PRESIDENT-ELECT CHAVEZ.  RANGEL ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. 
AMBASSADOR TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECALL HIS PREVIOUS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND WITH CHAVEZ THAT ANY 
FUTURE VISIT BY CHAVEZ TO THE U.S. SHOULD BE PREDICATED UPON THE 
COMPLETION OF A CONCRETE AGENDA OF AGREEMENTS IN AREAS OF MUTUAL 
INTEREST, SUCH AS EXPANDED NARCOTICS COOPERATION, A MARITIME 
AGREEMENT, A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY, AND NOW A CLEAR 
UNDERSTANDING PERMITTING U.S. AIRCRAFT TO OVERFLY VENEZUELA AS PART 
OF A FORWARD OPERATING LOCATIONS (FOL) AGREEMENT IN CURACAO AND 
ARUBA, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, AMONG OTHERS (OUTLINED IN REFS. B 
AND C.)  RANGEL AGREED, ADDING THAT THE GOV WOULD FOCUS ON THESE 
ISSUES AFTER CHAVEZ\' MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PASTRANA AND HIS VISIT 
TO BRAZIL, BOTH IN EARLY MAY. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  THE GOV HAS HIGHLIGHTED CHAVEZ\' LETTER TO THE 
PRESIDENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISPEL LOCAL SPECULATION ABOUT THE STATE 
OF RELATIONS, STEMMING FROM THE CANCELLATION OF EB A/S LARSON\'S 
VISIT (SEPTEL), AND THE AT TIMES BLUNT PUBLIC AIRING OF DIFFERENCES 
OVER UNHRC HUMAN RIGHTS POSITIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND 
THE U.S. AMBASSADOR LAST WEEK.  EMBASSY UNDERSTANDS THAT RANGEL IS 
FEELING VULNERABLE.  THE MEDIA EVENT WAS LARGELY INTENDED TO 
DEMONSTRATE PUBLICLY THAT U.S.-VENEZUELAN RELATIONS ARE ON TRACK. 
AMBASSADOR INFORMED RANGEL AFTER THE EVENT THAT NICE WORDS ARE 
FINE, BUT THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WILL BE 
DETERMINED BY CONCRETE COOPERATION--OF WHICH THERE HAD THUS FAR 
BEEN NONE WITH THE CHAVEZ GOVERNMENT, AND THAT WE, OF COURSE, ARE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO FUTURE COOPERATION IN THE AREAS WE HAVE 
DISCUSSED.  RANGEL SAID HE AGREED, AND THAT WE WILL BE HEARING FROM 
THE GOV. 
 
4.  (U) BEGIN TRANSLATION OF CHAVEZ LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON: 
 
(LETTERHEAD) 
HUGO RAFAEL CHAVEZ FRIAS 
PRESIDENT 
REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA 
 
MIRAFLORES, APRIL 27, 1999 
 
DEAR PRESIDENT (HANDWRITTEN) 
 
I WAS PLEASANTLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR EXCELLENCY\'S STATEMENTS DURING 
OUR AMBASSADOR, ALFREDO TORO HARDY\'S PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
 
YOUR MESSAGE, WHICH I READ WITH GREAT INTEREST, VERY ELOQUENTLY 
EXPRESSES YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO RENEW AND REFORGE 
RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.  I VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY 
WELCOME THOSE INTENTIONS.  OUR GOVERNMENTS SHARE COMMON INTERESTS, 
AS DO OUR PEOPLE.  WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE DESIRE FOR A SOLID AND 
VIBRANT DEMOCRACY, THE KIND ENVISIONED AND PRACTICED BY MEN SUCH AS 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND SIMON BOLIVAR. 
 
THE CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM HELD LAST SUNDAY, APRIL 25, AND THE 
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY TO BE ELECTED WITHIN THE NEXT 
SEVERAL MONTHS, THROUGH FREE AND PLURALISTIC EXPRESSION, ARE 
MECHANISMS CHOSEN BY THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY RE- 
ESTABLISH THE REPUBLIC, THROUGH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, MARKED BY A 
PROCESS CHARACTERIZED BY FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DURING HIS 
VISIT TO CARACAS LAST DECEMBER AS A REAL \"DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION.\" 
 
AS YOUR EXCELLENCY WISELY POINTED OUT, MY COUNTRY FACES A SERIES OF 
SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WHICH WE ARE CONFRONTING RESPONSIBLY AND WITH 
AN ENTIRELY VENEZUELAN CONSCIOUSNESS.  WE INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN 
CRISIS.  WE PROPOSE RECOVERING IT THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES ORIENTED TOWARD PRODUCTIVE 
REACTIVATION AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM, BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE 
PEOPLE.  MR. PRESIDENT, WE ALSO INHERITED AN ETHICALLY TROUBLED 
COUNTRY.  WITH UNSWERVING DETERMINATION, HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEGUN TO 
RE-ESTABLISH THE MORAL CODE THAT MUST DRIVE EVERY SOCIETY, 
RELENTLESSLY FIGHTING THE SERIOUS DISEASE OF CORRUPTION, THROUGH 
WHICH RESOURCES EQUIVALENT TO FIVE \"MARSHALL PLANS\" WERE SQUANDERED 
IN VENEZUELA. 
 
WE SHARE YOUR OPINION THAT \"OUR ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION CAN HELP 
IMPROVE THE SITUATION.\"  THEREFORE, MR. PRESIDENT, OUR COUNTRY IS 
OPEN TO ALL TYPES OF U.S. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR INITIATIVES TO 
ADVANCE OUR COUNTRIES\' MUTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  LIKEWISE, I FULLY SHARE 
THE FIRM INTENTION TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND ALL CRIMES RELATED 
TO THAT DISEASE. 
 
I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY.  I 
THANK YOU FOR WARM EXPRESSIONS OF FRIENDSHIP, WHICH ARE RECIPROCAL. 
I FORMALLY PROPOSE THAT THE ITEMS MENTIONED IN THIS LETTER BE 
INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA FOR OUR NEXT CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON. 
 
SINCERELY, 
(SIGNED BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ)

SUBJECT: PERSONAL ATTACK ON CHAVEZ MARKS INDEPENDENCE DAY CEREMONY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON: 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) POLITICAL GADFLY, KNEE-JERK LEFTIST, HISTORIAN, WELL-KNOWN 
WRITER AND SPEAKER, FORMER CHAVEZ ALLY, AND DISAPPOINTED OFFICE 
SEEKER JORGE OLAVARRIA LAUNCHED A SCATHING ATTACK ON PRESIDENT HUGO 
CHAVEZ, CALLING HIM A \"DEMAGOGUE\" AND ACCUSING HIM OF VARIOUS 
VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE KEYNOTE SPEECH DURING THE 
TRADITIONAL JULY 5 INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATION.  THE DIATRIBE, 
WHICH OCCURRED IN CONGRESS AND BEFORE THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AND 
THE NATIONAL MEDIA, WAS INTERRUPTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY SENATE 
PRESIDENT AND CHAVEZ ALLY LUIS ALFONSO DAVILA.  SUPREME COURT 
PRESIDENT CELIA SOSA GOMEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY HIGH-COMMAND 
WALKED OUT OF THE SESSION. 
 
2. (C) THE INCIDENT FOLLOWED THE TRADITIONAL READING OF VENEZUELA\'S 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND A CONCILIATORY, STATESMAN-LIKE 
SPEECH BY CHAVEZ AT THE SENATE.  INVITING OLAVARRIA, CLEARLY THE 
WORK OF THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD) PARTY AS AN ACT OF POLITICAL 
REVENGE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, BACKFIRED, AND WAS ROUNDLY 
CRITICIZED BY MOST OBSERVERS, INCLUDING LEADING MEMBERS OF THE 
OPPOSITION WHO WERE OFFENDED AT OLAVARRIA\'S USE OF THE INDEPENDENCE 
DAY KEYNOTE ADDRESS AS A FORUM FOR POLITICAL ATTACK.  PRESIDENT OF 
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND OPPOSITION LEADER HENRIQUE CAPRILES, 
WHO HAD WORKED HARD TO SECURE CHAVEZ\' ATTENDANCE, EXPRESSED STUNNED 
DISMAY AT OLAVARRIA\'S ADDRESS.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, CHAVEZ 
MAINTAINED THE HIGH-ROAD, STICKING TO PATRIOTIC THEMES DURING THE 
MILITARY PARADE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE DAY LIKE ANY OTHER? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) VENEZUELANS BEGAN THE DAY-LONG CEREMONY MARKING THEIR 188TH 
INDEPENDENCE DAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL READING OF THE DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE IN THE SENATE, WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY A 
CONCILIATORY, STATESMAN-LIKE SPEECH BY PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE 
CEREMONIES THEN MOVED TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES SIDE OF CONGRESS 
WHERE IT IS TRADITIONAL FOR AN INVITED SPEAKER FROM OUTSIDE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER A KEYNOTE ADDRESS REVOLVING AROUND THE BROAD 
THEMES OF VENEZUELAN HISTORY AND VALUES.  THIS YEAR\'S INVITED 
SPEAKER, ATTORNEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE, AND FORMER 
CHAVEZ ALLY JORGE OLAVARRIA LAUNCHED A SCATHING PERSONAL ATTACK ON 
THE PRESIDENT. 
 
----------------- 
A PERSONAL ATTACK 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C) OLAVARRIA CALLED CHAVEZ A \"DEMAGOGUE\" AND ACCUSED HIM OF 
VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONS.  MEANWHILE, CHAVEZ SAT 
CALMLY BEHIND THE ORATOR, TAKING NOTES AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF 
DISCONTENT.  OLAVARRIA\'S WORDS CENTERED ON CHAVEZ\' ALLEGED 
DISRESPECT FOR THE NATION\'S INSTITUTIONAL POWERS AND INSISTENCE ON 
STEPPING OVER LAWS CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION.  \"THE PRESIDENT,\" 
OBSERVED OLAVARRIA, \"BELIEVES HE HAS RECEIVED ABSOLUTE DICTATORIAL 
POWERS FROM POPULAR MANDATE...IN A TRAGIC EUPHEMISM OF POPULAR 
WILL.\"  \"CHAVEZ,\" HE SAID, \"DOES NOT BELIEVE HE NEEDS TO ABIDE BY 
ANY OTHER LAW THAN POPULAR WILL.\"  \"IT IS CLEAR,\" SAID OLAVARRIA, 
\"THAT NOBODY CAN IGNORE THE REPEATED THREATS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
DIRECTED AT CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT AND ITS MAGISTRATES, THE 
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL, THE NATIONAL 
ELECTORAL COUNCIL AND THE ARMED FORCES.\"  \"HE WRITES LETTER TO THE 
SUPREME COURT CHALLENGING THEIR AUTHORITY--AND NOTHING HAPPENS,\" 
CONTINUED OLAVARRIA.  \"HE PUBLICLY ACCUSES MEMBERS OF THE COURT OF 
CORRUPTION--AND NOTHING HAPPENS.  HE SAYS THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO REPLACE CONGRESS AND THE REST OF THE 
GOVERNMENT--AND NOTHING HAPPENS.\" 
 
5.  (C) OLAVARRIA ALLEGED THAT CHAVEZ \"DISRESPECTED THE LAWS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION\" AND \"OPENLY INSTIGATES DISRESPECT FOR CONGRESS.\" 
ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS TO BE MOTIVATED BY REFORM, OLAVARRIA 
ASSERTED, \"HIS ATTITUDE IS NOT THAT OF A REFORMER.\"  CHARGING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT PRETENDS TO CREATE A \"DE FACTO GOVERNMENT,\" OLAVARRIA 
ASSERTED THAT \"NOT A SINGLE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER HAS BEEN EXEMPT 
FROM HIS THREATS.\"  CHAVEZ\' RECENT DECISION TO PROMOTE MILITARY 
OFFICIALS IN SPITE OF SENATE DISAPPROVAL WAS ALSO CITED BY 
OLAVARRIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF CHAVEZ\' SCORN FOR THE INSTITUTIONS OF 
GOVERNMENT.  \"HE PROMOTES MILITARY OFFICERS WHILE IGNORING THE 
SENATE\'S OPINION, DESPITE INSTITUTIONALIZED PROCEDURES FOR 
PROMOTION,\" SAID OLAVARRIA, POINTING OUT THAT THE IDEA FOR 
LEGISLATIVE CONFIRMATION OF VENEZUELAN MILITARY PROMOTIONS WAS 
ORIGINATED BY BOLIVAR.  HE ALSO ACCUSED CHAVEZ OF \"UNDERMINING ONE 
OF THE COUNTRY\'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS--THE ARMED FORCES.\" 
 
6.  (C) CONCLUDING, OLAVARRIA CALLED ON THE SUPREME COURT OF 
JUSTICE (CSJ) TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT\'S ACTS MERIT 
PROSECUTION.  SHOULD THE CSJ JUDGE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
OVERSTEPPED THE LAW, RECOMMENDED OLAVARRIA, THE MATTER SHOULD BE 
BROUGHT BEFORE THE SENATE.  OLAVARRIA CALLED ON VENEZUELANS TO RID 
THEMSELVES OF THEIR APATHY AND CONFORMITY AND ACT AGAINST \"THIS 
VIOLENCE AND IRREALITY.\"  DEFENDING HIS PERFORMANCE DURING A POST- 
CEREMONY INTERVIEW, OLAVARRIA SAID, \"I AM ASSUMING MY 
RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD.  THE PRESIDENT HAS CHALLENGED THE COUNTRY\'S 
INSTITUTIONS, AND I AM SAYING IT IS WRONG.\"  OLAVARRIA SAID HE 
MAINTAINED RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION OF THE PRESIDENCY, BUT \"I 
WILL NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM PUBLIC DEBATE.  THIS IS NOT TIME FOR 
HISTORIC DISCOURSES, BUT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT\'S HAPPENING NOW.\" 
 
---------------------- 
REACTION TO THE SPEECH 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) OLAVARRIA\'S SPEECH WAS INTERRUPTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY 
SENATE PRESIDENT AND CHAVEZ ALLY LUIS ALFONSO DAVILA, WHO CALLED 
FOR RESPECT FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE CEREMONY.  \"YOU\'VE INSULTED 
CONGRESS AND ALL OF US WHO HAVE COME HERE IN A DAY OF UTMOST 
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE COUNTRY,\" SAID DAVILA, A RETIRED ARMY COLONEL. 
\"WE HAVE NOT COME HERE TO LISTEN TO YOUR INSULTS AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT.\"  SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT CELIA SOSA GOMEZ AND MEMBERS 
OF THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND WALKED OUT OF THE SESSION.  SOSA 
DEFIANTLY ASSERTED THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT NEED ORATORS TO 
DEFEND IT; \"IT DOES QUITE WELL ON ITS OWN.\"  MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
RAUL SALAZAR STOICALLY OBSERVED THAT \"THE MILITARY FOLLOWS THE 
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW,\" ADDING \"IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT 
PROMOTIONS, THERE IS AN INSTITUTIONAL WAY TO SOLVE IT.\"   PRESIDENT 
OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND OPPOSITION LEADER HENRIQUE CAPRILES- 
-WHO LOBBIED HARD FOR CHAVEZ TO ATTEND THE SPEECH--EXPRESSED 
STUNNED DISMAY AT OLAVARRIA\'S REMARKS, COMMENTING TO THE AMBASSADOR 
THAT SPEAKER\'S COMMENTS HAD GONE FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF 
PROPRIETY. 
 
8.  (C) SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (COPEI) CONGRESSIONAL FACTION LEADER 
CESAR PEREZ VIVAS COMMENTED THAT \"CONGRESS, AS A CENTER OF DEBATE, 
HAS BECOME THE SCENE OF CRUDE CONFRONTATION.\"  PEREZ CAST SOME OF 
THE BLAME FOR OLAVARRIA\'S EXCESSES ON CHAVEZ.  \"THIS IS PART OF THE 
TENSE POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED IN OUR COUNTRY,\" HE 
SAID.  \"THE PRESIDENT HAS VERY AGGRESSIVELY BROUGHT ISSUES BEFORE 
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST FEW 
DAYS...THIS SPEECH IS A RESPONSE TO THESE ACTIVITIES.\"  IT\'S A 
SHAME THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS,\" SAID PEREZ.  \"HOPEFULLY, THE TONE 
AN TENOR OF THE DEBATE WILL DIMINISH AS MORE RESPECTFUL PUBLIC 
DISCOURSE EMERGES.\"  ECHOING DEFENSE MINISTER SALAZAR\'S COMMENTS, 
PEREZ CONCLUDED THAT \"THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE 
INTERPRETED AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SUPREME COURT AND FISCAL 
GENERAL.\"  PEREZ\' COPEI COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN PEDRO SEGUNDO BLANCO 
SAID OLAVARRIA \"SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE RESPECT FOR THE OCCASION, 
ALTHOUGH THE SPEECH DELIVERED AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE 
PRESIDENT, WHICH REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.\"  FOREIGN 
MINISTER JOSE VICENTE RAMGEL\'S COMMENTS WERE ALOOF AND CIRCUMSPECT, 
CRITICIZING OLAVARRIA FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNDERSTANDING \"HOW TO 
INTERPRET THE NATIONAL PROCESS,\" OR THE COUNTRY\'S CURRENT 
SITUATION.  RANGEL EXPRESSED RESPECT FOR OLAVARRIA\'S RIGHT TO SELF 
EXPRESSION, ALTHOUGH HE THOUGH IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE OF HIM TO USE 
THE INDEPENDENCE DAY FORUM FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES. 
 
9.  (C) OPPOSITION AD PARTY LEADER CANACHE MATA LAID THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OLAVARRIA\'S SPEECH SQUARELY ON CHAVEZ. 
\"CHAVEZ,\" HE SAID, \"HAS OFFENDED EACH OF THE COUNTRY\'S 
INSTITUTIONS, AND TODAY\'S SPEECH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT 
BEHAVIOR.  BESIDES CANACHE MATA, PROJECT VENEZUELA (PV) 
CONGRESSIONAL FACTION LEADER MIREYA RODRIGUEZ WAS ONE OF THE FEW TO 
PUBLICLY SUPPORT OLAVARRIA\'S PRESENTATION.  \"WE MUST CONFRONT THE 
DICTATORSHIP THAT CONFRONTS US,\" SAID RODRIGUEZ.  \"THAT IS NOT TO 
SAY THERE SHOULD NOT BE RADICAL CHANGE, BUT THAT CHANGE MUST TAKE 
PLACE MAINTAINING RESPECT FOR INSTITUTIONS.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
CHAVEZ REFRAINS FROM RESPONDING 
------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) A TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENCE DAY MILITARY PARADE FOLLOWED 
THE CEREMONY.  THE BISHOP OF CARACAS OPENED THE PARADE WITH A 
BENEDICTION CALLING FOR RENEWED FAITH IN GOVERNMENT, AND FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THAT RENEWED FAITH BY \"MAKING SOCIETY MORE 
JUST, AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLES\' DESIRES.\"  CHAVEZ 
REITERATED HIS CUSTOMARY THEMES:  \"THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE ARE THE 
TRUE MASTERS OF THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT,\" THE NEED TO RAISE A 
FEELING OF DIGNITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WIDER 
MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE.  \"THE ARMED FORCES,\" SAID 
CHAVEZ, \"WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO BUILD 
A TRUE DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE DESIRES OF THE PEOPLE, AND A STABLE 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM.\"  HIS ATYPICALLY SHORT SPEECH WAS 
REPLETE WITH ALLUSIONS TO CHRISTIANITY, AND A PHILOSOPHY HE CALLS 
\"REVOLUTIONARY HUMANISM.\"  CHAVEZ PRAISED THE ARMED FORCES FOR 
DEFENDING HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS, AND FOR ITS PATIENCE AND 
CONSTANCY.  \"RESPECT FOR THE SOLDIER,\" SAID CHAVEZ, \"IS RESPECT FOR 
ALL VENEZUELANS.\"  MAINTAINING THE HIGH-ROAD IN HIS REMARKS, CHAVEZ 
REFRAINED FROM REFERRING TO OLAVARRIA\'S DISCOURSE, STICKING TO 
PATRIOTIC THEMES.  THE PRESIDENT DID, HOWEVER, DECLARE THE END OF 
A PERIOD OF \"CORRUPTOCRACY\" AND SAID THAT \"VENEZUELA WAS OPENING UP 
TO A PERIOD OF TRUE DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN 
WHICH JUSTICE PREVAILS...LEAVING BEHIND A TYRANNY OF COWARDS.\" 
CHAVEZ CONCLUDED THE DAY\'S REMARKS, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE UPCOMING 
CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL CONSTRUCT A COUNTRY THAT IS 
\"TRULY DEMOCRATIC AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) OLAVARRIA IS A GADFLY POLITICAL INTELLECTUAL, KNEE-JERK 
LEFTIST, WELL-KNOWN SPEAKER AND AUTHOR WHO WAS VERY CLOSE TO CHAVEZ 
DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND HAD HOPED TO RECEIVE A HIGH- 
LEVEL APPOINTMENT IN THE CHAVEZ ADMINISTRATION.  EARLY ON, HIS NAME 
WAS FLOATED AS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR FOREIGN MINISTER, AND AT 
ONE POINT HE BELIEVED HE WAS THE ODDS-ON FAVORITE FOR AMBASSADOR TO 
SPAIN.  CHAVEZ, HOWEVER, TUNED INTO OLAVARRIA\'S OPPORTUNISTIC 
MOTIVATIONS AND PERIPATETIC POLITICAL CONVICTIONS BEFORE APPOINTING 
HIM TO A POST.  INVITING OLAVARRIA TO SPEAK WAS CLEARLY THE WORK OF 
THE AD PARTY AS AN ACT OF POLITICAL REVENGE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, 
BUT IT BACKFIRED.  THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WAS TAKEN ABACK BY THE 
SPECTACLE, AND MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT IT BENEFITTED CHAVEZ. 
 
12.  (C) IN ANOTHER FORUM, AT ANOTHER TIME, OLAVARRIA\'S COMMENTS 
WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED AS GOOD GRIST FOR PUBLIC DEBATE, BUT MOST-- 
INCLUDING LEADING MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION--WERE CRITICAL OF 
OLAVARRIA\'S USE OF THE INDEPENDENCE DAY KEYNOTE AS A FORUM FOR A 
POLITICAL ATTACK, WITH MANY USING THE WORD \"OFFENSIVE\" TO DESCRIBE 
THE EVENT.  A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ARGUED THAT THE SPEECH, GIVEN 
ITS PETTY CONTENT DIRECTED AT THE PRESIDENT, HAD NO PLACE AS PART 
OF A CEREMONIAL ACT HELD IN CONGRESS.  THE ONLY POLITICAL LEADER TO 
LEND UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT TO OLAVARRIA\'S VERBAL ADVENTURE WAS 
DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD) PARTY LEADER CANACHE MATA, WHO REACTED 
DEFENSIVELY TO INQUIRIES ABOUT HIS VIEW OF THE SPEECH.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ TO RUN AFTER ALL 
 
CLASSIFIED BY JOHN F. MAISTO, AMBASSADOR.  REASON 1.5 (D) 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: CHAVEZ HAS SAID HE WILL STAND FOR REELECTION. 
THE DECEMBER 15 REFERENDUM WILL ONLY CONTAIN ONE QUESTION: ON 
THE APPROVING OR NOT APPROVING THE NEW CONSTITUTION.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) REVERSING A POSITION HE HAD PUBLICLY REAFFIRMED EARLIER 
THE SAME DAY, PRESIDENT CHAVEZ ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 19 THAT HE 
WOULD RUN IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS TO BE HELD SOME TIME THIS 
SPRING.  DURING HIS CAMPAIGN, ANC PRESIDENT LUIS MIQUILENA WILL 
SERVE AS PRESIDENT.  AS A RESULT OF CHAVEZ\' DECISION, THE 
DECEMBER 15 REFERENDUM WILL CONTAIN ONLY ONE QUESTION FOR THE 
VOTERS: ON WHETHER OR NOT THE APPROVE THE CONSTITUTION.  THERE 
WILL NOT RPT NOT BE -- AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED -- ADDITIONAL 
QUESTIONS ASKING THE VOTER WHETHER CHAVEZ SHOULD BE EXCUSED FROM 
RUNNING, OR WHETHER THE VOTER WANTS THE GOVERNOR OF HIS STATE TO 
RUN. 
 
3. (C) NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HEAD ANDRES CALECA TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THE FOLLOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN SEEKING FOR A WHOLE 
WEEK TO CONVINCE CHAVEZ TO AGREE TO RUN RATHER THAN SEEK 
CONFIRMATION VIA THE REFERENDUM, SINCE THE LEGALITY OF PUTTING 
ANY OTHER QUESTION THAN THAT OF APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTION IN 
THE REFERENDUM IS CERTAINLY QUESTIONABLE.  IN ADDITION, CALECA 
NOTES THAT CONFIRMATION OF CHAVEZ IN OFFICE VIA THE REFERENDUM 
WOULD SMACK OF THE PLEBISCITE WITH WHICH DICTATOR MARCOS PEREZ 
JIMENEZ SOUGHT TO LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE IN THE 1950\'S (AND OTHER 
VENEZUELAN DICTATORS BEFORE HIM.) 
 
4. (C)  ASKED WHY CHAVEZ HAD BEEN HESITANT TO RUN, CALECA SAID 
CHAVEZ CITED THE ADDITIONAL COST OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AS 
WELL AS THE DISTRACTION OF HAVING TO CAMPAIGN AT A TIME WHEN 
THERE WAS MUCH SUBSTANTIVE WORK FOR HIM TO DO.  CALECA ALSO 
NOTED THAT CHAVEZ MIGHT FEAR GETTING A LOWER SCORE THAN HE DID 
IN THE LAST ELECTION, DUE TO THE ONGOING DETERIORATION OF THE 
ECONOMIC SITUATION BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT SPRING WHEN THE 
ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  (CALECA SAID HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT BE 
POSSIBLE TO GET THEM ORGANIZED BEFORE APRIL.)  FINALLY, WE HAVE 
ALSO HEARD THAT GOVERNORS OF CHAVEZ POLO PATRIOTICO COALITION 
HAD OBJECTED TO HAVING TO RUN IF HE DID NOT AND WAS NOT 
PROVIDING HIS COATTAILS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) THE RIVALRY BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA HAS BEEN 
LONGSTANDING, WITH ROOTS REACHING BACK AS FAR AS THE BREAK- 
UP OF GRAN COLOMBIA INTO SEPARATE STATES.  OVER THE YEARS, 
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES - AND ESPECIALLY 
BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARIES - MANIFESTED ITSELF AS 
A PERSISTENT TENSION.  OVER TIME, HOWEVER, THESE TENSIONS 
HAD BECOME INSTITUTIONALIZED AND MANAGED WITH GREAT EFFORT 
AND ENERGY THROUGHOUT SUCCEEDING VENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENTS.  FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOWEVER, THESE 
EFFORTS, AT LEAST ON THE VENEZUELAN SIDE OF THE BORDER, 
HAVE TAKEN A BACK SEAT TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMBITIONS OF 
VENEZUELA\'S CURRENT LEADER, PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  RECENT 
TENSIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP ARE NOT JUST THE RESULT OF 
MISCALCULATION OR INEXPERIENCE.  THEY ARE ALSO A DIRECT 
EXPRESSION OF DEEPLY-HELD CONVICTIONS BY CHAVEZ RELATING TO 
HIS ROLE IN THE WORLD, THE DESIRABILITY OF SPREADING HIS 
\"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION\" TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AND HIS 
VIEW OF THE FARC AND ELN AS PHILOSOPHICAL KINSMEN IN THE 
LATTER ENDEAVOR.  WE SEE ZERO LIKELIHOOD OF THESE VIEWS -- 
AND RESULTING GOV BEHAVIOR -- CHANGING IN THE FUTURE, AND 
ANTICIPATE FUTURE TENSIONS BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------ 
A VERY BUMPY ROAD SO FAR 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) THE FIRST SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT BETWEEN 
VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA OCCURRED JUST ONE MONTH INTO 
PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ\'S PRESIDENCY, ON MACH 10, 1999, 
DURING ONE OF CHAVEZ\'S FIRST PRESS CONFERENCES, WHEN HE 
MADE A STATEMENT WHICH APPEARED TO CONFER BELLIGERENT 
STATUS ON THE FARC, MUCH TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
PUBLICLY EXPRESSED CONCERN AND CONSTERNATION.  ALTHOUGH 
FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE VICENTE RANGEL TRIED TO DOWNPLAY THE 
INCIDENT, THE EVENT PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST EPISODE OF 
WHAT HAS BECOME AN OFT-REPEATED PATTERN IN VENEZUELAN- 
COLOMBIAN RELATIONS: CHAVEZ OR RANGEL MAKES A REMARK WHICH 
INSPIRES A SHARP PUBLIC REJECTION BY COLOMBIA.  THE 
VENEZUELANS EXPRESS SURPRISE AT THE COLOMBIAN REACTION, 
INSISTING THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.  THE COLOMBIANS LET 
THE MATTER DROP, AND RELATIONS APPEAR TO RETURN TO THE 
STATUS QUO ANTE, UNTIL A SIMILAR STATEMENT BY CHAVEZ OR 
RANGEL STARTS THE CYCLE AGAIN. 
 
3. (C) WE SAY \"APPEAR\" TO RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE 
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE INCIDENTS HAVE A CUMULATIVE 
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP.  (NOTE: WE WOULD 
WELCOME EMBASSY BOGOTA\'S COMMENTS ON THIS.)  FURTHERMORE, 
THE CHAVEZ/RANGEL BEHAVIOR THAT LEADS TO THESE DUST-UPS 
WITH VENEZUELA\'S NEIGHBOR SHOWS NO SIGNS OF TAPERING OFF. 
INDEED, THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT -- WHICH LED COLOMBIA TO 
RECALL ITS AMBASSADOR FOR CONSULTATIONS -- TOOK PLACE ONLY 
LAST NOVEMBER.  (NOTE: THE INCIDENT INVOLVED APPEARANCE BY 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FARC AT A SEMINAR ON PLAN COLOMBIA 
HELD IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE PALACE.  THE SEMINAR WAS 
SPONSORED BY THE VENEZUELAN REPRESENTATIVES TO THE LATIN 
AMERICAN PARLIAMENT, BUT IN FACT, WE HAVE INFORMATION TO 
THE EFFECT THAT THE GOV WAS FULLY INVOLVED IN FACILITATING 
THE TRAVEL OF THE FARC MEMBERS.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
CHAVEZ\'S LONGED-FOR ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) MANY OF THE STATEMENTS FROM CHAVEZ OR RANGEL THAT 
HAVE CAUSED A NEGATIVE PUBLIC REACTION BY COLOMBIA INVOLVE 
UNASKED-FOR SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS.  THESE 
STATEMENTS IN OUR VIEW REFLECT TWO STRONGLY-HELD 
CONVICTIONS BY CHAVEZ: 1) THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS 
SHOULD BE INTERNATIONALIZED; 2) THAT HE SHOULD PLAY A MAJOR 
ROLE IN ANY SUCH ESQUIPULAS-TYPE PROCESS.  THE TWO IDEAS, 
OF COURSE, ARE CLOSELY INTERRELATED.  CHAVEZ APPEARS 
SINCERELY CONVINCED THAT PASTRANA CAN\'T DO THE JOB ALONE, 
AND THAT INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION BETWEEN THE GOC AND THE 
REBELS IS NECESSARY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE IDEA OF A 
STARRING ROLE FOR CHAVEZ CLEARLY CONNECTS WITH HIS MANIFEST 
CONCEPTION OF HIMSELF AS A MAJOR THIRD WORLD LEADER, IN THE 
FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS TO CREATE A \"MULTIPOLAR\" (V. U.S.- 
DOMINATED \"UNIPOLAR\") WORLD.  IT IS NATURAL THAT HE WOULD 
SEE NEIGHBORING COLOMBIA, WITH ITS HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION 
WITH SIMON BOLIVAR, AS A NATURAL PLACE FOR SUCH ACTIVISM ON 
HIS PART. IT IS ALSO PERFECTLY RATIONAL FOR A VENEZUELAN 
PRESIDENT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA. 
BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE EGO-CENTERED ELEMENTS WE HAVE 
DESCRIBED ABOVE CAN BE IGNORED IN ANALYZING CHAVEZ\'S 
POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA. 
 
 
-------------------- 
WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON? 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) THAT\'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER.  THE OFFICIAL 
GOV LINE, BOTH PUBLICLY AND IN PRIVATE TO US, IS THAT 
VENEZUELA\'S CONTACTS WITH THE COLOMBIAN REBELS ARE CENTERED 
ON PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF VENEZUELANS WHO SUFFER FROM 
REBEL ACTIVITIES ON VENEZUELA\'S SIDE OF THE COMPLETELY 
POROUS BORDER: NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF KIDNAPPED 
VENEZUELANS, ETC.  CHAVEZ AND RANGEL HAVE RECENTLY ADMITTED 
THAT RETIRED VENEZUELAN NAVY CAPTAIN RAMON RODRIGUEZ CHACIN 
(LONG CLOSE TO CHAVEZ, WE BELIEVE) FROM TIME TO TIME 
CARRIES OUT SPECIAL MISSIONS FOR THE GOV IN COLOMBIA 
ITSELF.  HOWEVER, CHAVEZ AND RANGEL ASSERT THAT THESE 
MISSIONS ARE PURELY RELATED TO RELEASE OF KIDNAP VICTIMS 
(RODRIGUEZ CHACIN HAS IN FACT NEGOTIATED THE FREEING OF 
PERSONS HELD BY BOTH THE FARC AND THE ELN, INCLUDING A U.S. 
CITIZEN HELD BY THE LATTER) AND THAT THE MISSIONS TAKE 
PLACE WITH THE CONSENT OF THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, AND 
SOMETIMES EVEN AT ITS REQUEST.  ACTIONS SUCH AS PERMITTING 
REBELS TO MEET WITH VARIOUS OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL 
LEADERS, OR ERSTWHILE LEADERS, IN THE PEACE-PROCESS ARE 
JUSTIFIED AS DISINTERESTED GOOD OFFICES PROVIDED WITH GOC 
KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT AND AIMED AT PERMITTING COLOMBIANS 
THEMSELVES TO WORK OUT A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO 
THE INSURGENCIES. 
 
6. (C) IN FACT, AS WE HAVE REPORTED IN VARIOUS OTHER 
CHANNELS, WE BELIEVE THAT AT LEAST THE SYMPATHIES OF THE 
GOV FOR THE REBELS ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED 
OFFICIAL LINE SUGGESTS.  FROM HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS ALONE, 
IT IS CLEAR THAT CHAVEZ REGARDS THE FARC AND ELN AS 
LEGITIMATE BELLIGERENTS, AND THAT ANY PEACE SETTLEMENT 
SHOULD NOT JUST INVOLVE THEM TURNING IN THEIR ARMS AND 
TRANSFORMING THEMSELVES MEEKLY INTO POLITICAL PARTIES. 
 
7. (C) WHY WOULD CHAVEZ HOLD SUCH VIEWS?  THE FIRST POINT 
TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT HOWEVER ELUSIVE THE CONCEPT OF HIS 
\"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION\" MAY BE FOR OTHERS, IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
CENTRAL TO HIS THINKING AND ACTIONS.  ONE COMPONENT OF IT 
IS A CHAMPIONING OF THE INTERESTS OF THE LOWER CLASSES 
AGAINST ENTRENCHED ELITES.  IF ONE SEES ON ONE SIDE LEFT- 
WING GUERRILLA-FIGHTERS (WHOSE VERY IDENTITY AS SUCH IS 
LIKELY TO APPEAL TO CHAVEZ\'S ROMANTIC SIDE), AND ON THE 
OTHER A COLOMBIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH -- AT LEAST TO 
OBSERVERS IN CARACAS -- LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE CHAVEZ 
DESTROYED IN VENEZUELA,\" IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE WHICH SIDE 
HIS HEART LEANS TOWARD. WHETHER OR NOT HE SHARES ALL THE 
OBJECTIVES OF THE REBELS, IT SEEMS THAT HE REGARDS THEM AS 
AT LEAST PROTO-BOLIVARIANS, AND ALLIES IN THE GOAL WE 
BELIEVE HE HOLDS OF SEEING A VERSION OF HIS PROGRAM IN 
VENEZUELA SPREAD TO THE OTHER ANDEAN COUNTRIES, AND PERHAPS 
BEYOND.  WHILE CHAVEZ ISSUES FREQUENT PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF 
CONCERN ABOUT THE SCOURGE OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING, HE 
CONVENIENTLY IGNORES THE FARC\'S SUBSTANTIAL CONNECTION TO 
THE DRUG TRADE.  FINALLY, IT IS NOT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT 
MIGHT BE THE ADVICE OF HIS CLOSE FRIEND FIDEL CASTRO 
REGARDING THE MOST DESIRABLE OUTCOME IN COLOMBIA. 
 
 
------------------------ 
CHAVEZ AND PLAN COLOMBIA 
------------------------ 
 
8. (C) CHAVEZ AND HIS FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE MADE CLEAR 
THEIR STRONG OBJECTION TO THE MILITARY COMPONENT OF PLAN 
COLOMBIA, WHICH CHAVEZ RECENTLY REITERATED BY PUBLICLY 
STATING THAT HIS POSITION \"WOULD NOT CHANGE.\"  THEY SAY IT 
WILL SIMPLY INCREASE THE VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSE AN 
INFLUX OF REFUGEES IN VENEZUELA, AND LEAD TO A POSSIBLE 
TRANSFER TO THIS COUNTRY OF NARCOTRAFFICKING OPERATIONS 
CURRENTLY LOCATED IN COLOMBIA, COMPLEMENTING UNDERLYING 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE COLOMBIAN THREAT TO VENEZUELA.  IT 
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE CONCERNS ARE SHARED ACROSS A 
VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF VENEZUELAN SOCIETY, INCLUDING AMONG 
PERSONS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO OTHER CHAVEZ POLICIES RELATING 
TO COLOMBIA. 
 
 
----------------------- 
THINGS WON\'T GET BETTER 
----------------------- 
 
9. (C) IF OUR ABOVE ANALYSIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT, THEN 
IT IS PURE WISHFUL THINKING TO IMAGINE THAT CHAVEZ IS 
MERELY ON SOME KIND OF AN UPWARD-TRENDING, ALBEIT SHALLOW, 
LEARNING CURVE AS FAR AS HIS POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA IS 
CONCERNED.  RATHER THAN BEING JUST INADVERTENT MISSTEPS 
BORN OUT OF INEXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THOSE POLICIES STEM 
FROM THE DEEPLY HELD CONVICTIONS AND OBJECTIVES WE HAVE 
SOUGHT TO OUTLINE ABOVE.  THEREFORE, DESPITE CHAVEZ\'S 
CONSTANT PROTESTATIONS OF HIS DESIRE FOR GOOD RELATIONS 
WITH PASTRANA, WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT PATTERN OF GOV 
BEHAVIOR IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE, AND INDEED ITS NEGATIVE 
ELEMENTS COULD EVEN BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED UNDER CERTAIN 
SCENARIOS. 
 
10. (C) VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN RELATIONS HAVE LONG BEEN 
MARKED BY THE KIND OF SUSPICION WHICH SEEMS RELATIVELY 
COMMON AMONG NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.  BUT 
THAT SUSPICION HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN MODERATED BY A 
REALIZATION OF THE NEED FOR A MODUS VIVENDI.  THIS IN TURN 
LED TO THE CREATION OVER THE YEARS OF AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER 
OF POLITICAL BUFFER MECHANISMS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, 
INCLUDING A BI-NATIONAL COMMISSION INVOLVING THE 
PARTICIPATION OF NUMEROUS MINISTRIES, STUDY GROUPS, AND IN 
THE AREA OF COUNTER-NARCOTICS, INTELLIGENCE-SHARING 
ARRANGEMENTS AND EXTRACTION AND INSERTION ASSISTANCE, AND 
CROSS-BORDER PURSUIT COOPERATION.  AT LEAST PARTIALLY AS A 
RESULT OF RECENT DISTURBING BORDER INCIDENTS BETWEEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES\' MILITARIES, THE VENEZUELAN-COLOMBIAN BORDER 
AFFAIRS COMMISSION -- WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CHAVEZ ADMINISTRATION -- IS SCHEDULED TO 
MEET ON FEBRUARY 22.  (NOTE:  VENEZUELA SUSPENDED A 
COMMISSION MEETING SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 2000.) 
 
11. (C) CAN WE DO ANYTHING?  OUR REPEATED URGINGS, MADE TO 
CHAVEZ NOT MERELY BY THIS EMBASSY BUT BY HIGH LEVEL 
VISITORS, TO THE EFFECT OF FOLLOWING A \"NO SURPRISES\" (FOR 
PASTRANA) POLICY TOWARDS COLOMBIA HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BORNE 
NO FRUIT TO DATE.  NOR SHOULD THAT SURPRISE US, FOR 
CHAVEZ\'S CONCEPTION OF THE \"UNIPOLAR\" HEGEMONISTIC 
STRIVINGS OF THE UNITED STATES -- OF WHICH HE SEES PLAN 
COLOMBIA AS A PARTICULARLY CLEAR EXAMPLE -- MAKE US ABOUT 
THE LAST SOURCE OF ADVICE HE IS LIKELY TO TURN TO FOR 
MANAGING RELATIONS WITH COLOMBIA OR DEALING WITH THE 
GUERILLAS (OR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER). 
IN SHAPING HIS POLICIES TOWARDS COLOMBIA HE WILL CONTINUE - 
- AT THE PRICE, WHICH HE SEEMS WILLING TO PAY, OF LIKELY 
FUTURE CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE GOC -- TO FOLLOW HIS 
BOLIVARIAN VISION.  IT IS A VISION IN WHICH OUR COUNSEL HAS 
NO PLACE.

Summary 
------- 
1. (C) An August 8 Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL) press 
release asserted that the group defended Venezuela\'s 
sovereignty by attacking the Colombian National Liberation 
Army (ELN) July 31. Tachira state media, ranchers, and law 
enforcement officials told poloff August 5 and 6 that the 
expanding FBL are mostly to blame for an increase in 
kidnappings, which are becoming more violent, political, and 
urban, while opposition leaders allege links between the GOV 
and the FBL. Pro-GOV National Assembly Deputy Luis Tascon 
denied any GOV/FBL connection to poloff August 13. End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Where\'s the love? ELN Feuding with FBL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In an August 8 press release, the Bolivarian 
Liberation Forces (FBL) confirmed that its troops battled an 
ELN column July 31 to \"defend Venezuelan territory\" in 
western Apure state. They claimed the battle resulted in one 
wounded FBL fighter and five ELN casualties. The FBL rejected 
the allegation by unidentified military sources in an August 
10 La Nacion story that \"this battle is a product of a 
territorial dispute (for) extortion fees from Apure, Tachira, 
and Barinas ranchers.\" The release also claimed the ELN is 
blaming their kidnappings on the FBL and making alliances 
with \"enemies of the Bolivarian revolutionary process,\" such 
as Apure Governor Luis Lippa, San Cristobal Mayor William 
Mendez, and Guasdualito Mayor Jesus Rojas. The accused 
officials have denied the claim. Lippa told all-news channel 
Globovision August 11 that he suspected the charges were 
\"smoke and mirrors.\" 
 
3. (C) San Cristobal Police Chief Leonardo Iribarren told 
poloff August 6 that terrorist groups had previously 
respected each others turf as \"leftist brothers,\" but this 
respect is breaking down, largely the fault of the FBL\'s 
\"disregard for business.\" La Nacion newspaper president Max 
Vasquez asserted the animosity springs from an increasingly 
cozy FBL relationship with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and FBL intrusion into the ELN\'s extortion, 
kidnapping, and black market ventures. Vasquez claimed 
Colombian groups resent the attention the FBL\'s increased and 
sloppy kidnappings are generating. Tachira Businessman and 
Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC) leader David Rubio 
told poloff August 5 that trouble has been brewing between 
the ELN and FBL at least since December. The assassination of 
GOV-aligned Fatherland For All (PPT) party and alleged FBL 
leader Jorge Nieves April 26 was payback for cutting into the 
ELN\'s black market gasoline trade, according to Rubio (ref 
A). 
 
--------------------------- 
The FBL\'s Expanding Network 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Vasquez said conflicts among terrorist groups are 
inevitable as the FBL grows in strength and operational area. 
He estimated the core group of 2,000 to 3,000 based in south 
Tachira and west Apure states is being augmented by a new 
group of at least 30 to 40 around the La Fria/La Grita area. 
(Note: FBL size is wildly speculated. DAO sources have 
estimates ranging from 200 to 2,000.) Machiques Mayor Alfonso 
Marquez told poloff August 6 the FARC and a new FBL group are 
in the early stages of partnership to transport drugs across 
the border near Machiques, Zulia state. He said the FARC 
established a cocaine laboratory last year on the Venezuelan 
side of the border that is operated at least partially by the 
FBL. He explained that Colombian military success was 
beginning to force a small amount of the FARC\'s narcotic 
refinement and production across the border. 
 
-------------------------------- 
FBL: New Kidnappers on the Block 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Vasquez said more kidnappings had occurred in Tachira 
by August 4 (32) than all of 2003 (29). He claimed the FBL is 
rightfully receiving the blame for the increase, adding that 
troubling trends in kidnapping methods have accompanied the 
new group\'s three year ascent: 
--Political motives. The highly publicized July 25 kidnapping 
of former Tachira Governor and Christian Democrat (COPEI) 
leader Sergio Omar Calderon was a political, not an economic, 
crime, he asserted (ref B). Vasquez said at least three other 
kidnappings during the past year may also be politically 
motivated because victims had political connections and owned 
only small farms, not the large estate ranches that are 
typical targets. He suspected a deliberate attempt to \"send a 
signal\" that no member of old order is safe. 
--Proximity to cities. Most kidnappings still occur in remote 
locations, but an increasing number are occurring closer to 
cities, even within city limits. 
--Disguised. Dario Brillenburg was kidnapped from Zulia July 
31 after his driver stopped for a police check. Terrorists 
disguised as National Guardsmen beat the driver and took 
Brillenburg. Police uniforms have also been used. 
 
6. (C) Association of Tachira Ranchers (ASOGATA) President 
Genaro Mendez told poloff August 6 that ranchers used to pay 
extortion to a single group, but now many pay multiple groups 
and still get kidnapped. Another kidnapping trend is for 
common criminals to impersonate terrorist groups (Similar to 
an alleged scam in Apure, ref C). The National Guard and 
CICPC uncovered a ploy masterminded by a rancher\'s secretary 
to extort 12 million Bolivars using the name of fictitious 
FARC commander, according to Mendez. Police Chief Iribarren 
said extortions and kidnappings were largely confined to 
large ranchers out of his jurisdiction, but over the past 
three years San Cristobal businesses had been increasingly 
targeted with the advent of the FBL. 
 
--------------------- 
Alleged Links to GOV 
--------------------- 
 
7. (C) Vasquez and Tachira DCC leaders asserted that the GOV 
has links with the FBL. They claimed, for example, that the 
FBL is using a farm between Coloncito and La Tendida that is 
allegedly visited by high-ranking GOV officials as a training 
camp. DCC leader Jose Luis Rincon alleged that Infrastructure 
Minister Diosdado Cabello purchased the farm with state funds 
from Banco Industrial de Venezuela through an intermediary 
two years ago. GOV-aligned National Assembly Deputy Luis 
Tascon (MVR) vehemently denied any government support of the 
FBL to poloff August 13. He demanded \"liars trying to provoke 
a coup\" produce evidence of supposed FBL connections. He said 
if any links exist with individual GOV officials, they are 
not reflective of the GOV or President Chavez\'s Fifth 
Republic Movement (MVR) party, which \"do not recognize or 
respect any irregular military group.\" Tascon said he could 
not speak for the pro-GOV PPT party. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Increasingly active and publicized, the FBL is making 
it difficult for GOV officials to deny its existence. It is, 
however, a group whose nascent and illicit character make it 
difficult to define from basics as to its size to definition 
of alleged links to the GOV of the FARC.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Hugo Chavez climbed one point to 45 percent 
in approval ratings in December, according to two polls, 
after hitting a popularity trough of 30 percent in May 2003. 
Of the 59 percent of those likely to vote in a recall, 
however, only 34 percent say they would keep Chavez, with 65 
percent voting for recall.  Opposition leader Enrique Mendoza 
lags just behind Chavez for favorability at 44.9 percent, and 
is the favorite among the field of opposition candidates that 
might challenge Chavez in a new presidential election. 
Convincing undecided and apathetic voters remain key 
challenges for Chavez to win the referendum.  In a 
presidential election, however, the opposition will need to 
field its single candidate in order to have a shot at 
defeating the still popular president.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Popularity Boost Continuing or Peaking? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ref A reported that the favorability rating of 
President Hugo Chavez had risen to 44 percent by November 
2003, according to the polling firm Greenberg, Quinlan, and 
Rosner.  December figures from Greenberg show Chavez had 
squeaked up to 45 percent.  This corroborates data from 
polling firm Consultores 21 (C21) showing Chavez at 45.3 
percent favorability (among a stratified, urban sample of 
1,500 and a margin of error of 2.58 percent).  Chavez\'s 
figures are a dramatic improvement over the 30 percent he 
polled in May 2003, and up from his 37-percent showing in 
September.  The C21 poll was conducted Dec. 5-10, 2003, just 
a few days after the opposition\'s signature collection drive 
in support of a recall vote on Chavez.  Among those polled by 
C21, 52 percent thought Chavez should leave office; 43 
percent thought he should stay.  Similar figures for 
September showed a wider margin of 60-34 in favor of Chavez\'s 
departure (ref B).  Those approving of Chavez\'s 
administration reached 35 percent, a steady increase since 
July\'s low of 23 percent. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Recall Voters Still Likely to Boot Chavez 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The polls suggest Chavez would lose a recall vote, but 
by a shrinking margin.  Only 59 percent of those polled said 
they would participate in a presidential recall vote.  Among 
likely voters, 65 percent would vote to revoke Chavez\'s 
mandate, a drop from September\'s figure of 76 percent.  Of 
those who said they would not likely participate, 57 percent 
said they preferred to keep Chavez in office, while 32 
percent were opposed.  (Comment:  This data suggests that 
Chavez would need to tap into abstaining voters in order to 
win the referendum.  Based on the dismal performance of 
Chavez\'s political machinery in the November signature drive, 
this may prove difficult.  End comment.) 
 
-------------------------- 
Opposition Fails to Excite 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Miranda State Governor and opposition leader Enrique 
Mendoza reached 44.9 percent favorability, just behind 
Chavez.  Mendoza also polls highest among the field of 
opposition candidates (41 percent).  Other presidential 
front-runner Henrique Salas Romer polled 36 percent for 
popularity.  Asked whether they would participate in a 
primary to elect a candidate to run against Chavez, 62.8 
percent said they would not.  Of those who would vote in a 
 
 
primary, 35.6 percent prefer Mendoza.  In a field of the five 
leading presidential candidates -- including Chavez -- 
Mendoza polled 19 percent, well behind Chavez\'s 41 percent. 
All potential opposition candidates either remained static or 
dropped from their September poll numbers, while Chavez 
climbed dramatically. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) It is difficult from December\'s data to explain 
Chavez\'s popularity.  While Chavez\'s whining over fraud in 
the opposition signature drive may have hurt his image, the 
flurry of holiday bonuses -- granted by Chavez to public 
sector workers -- may have temporarily curbed people\'s angst 
over the political situation in the country.  For now, Chavez 
holds clear public support that appears to be growing (or at 
least not shrinking).  Chavez\'s rise in popularity also 
coincides with the launch of a series of high-profile social 
programs aimed at the poor (ref C).  Maintaining the 
enthusiasm (and funding) for these programs until a 
presidential referendum could prove challenging.  The 
opposition, however, still faces the problem of not offering 
much -- let alone a single candidate -- in exchange for 
Chavez\'s recall.

1. (C) VENEZUELAN CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES SEIZED A SHIPMENT OF 
USD 2.5 MILLION IN CASH OWNED BY ITALCAMBIO, THE COUNTRY\'S 
LARGEST CURRENCY EXCHANGE HOUSE.  THE MONEY WAS ABOARD A 
FLIGHT FROM MIAMI.  ITALCAMBIO PRESIDENT CARLOS DORADO 
CLAIMED THE SHIPMENT WAS ROUTINE AND THE SEIZURE IS IN 
RETALIATION FOR HIS ANTI-CHAVEZ OPINIONS.  HOWEVER, 
SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS IRVING OCHOA SAID ITALCAMBIO IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION FOR VIOLATION OF VENEZUELAN BANKING LAWS. 
VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES AND THE PRO-CHAVEZ PRESS HAVE USED THE 
SEIZURE TO PROMULGATE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT IMPLICATE THE 
USG IN VARIOUS NEFARIOUS SCHEMES. END SUMMARY.

CASH SEIZED ON ARRIVAL 
---------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) DECEMBER 30 VENEZUELAN CUSTOMS AGENTS AT SIMON 
BOLIVAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SEIZED A SHIPMENT OF USD 2.5 
MILLION IN CASH THAT ARRIVED ON AN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 
FROM MIAMI.  THE MONEY WAS CONSIGNED TO ITALCAMBIO, 
VENEZUELA\'S LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE HOUSE AND TRAVEL AGENCY. 
 VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO HOLD THE CASH AND CLAIM 
THAT ITALCAMBIO FAILED TO PROPERLY DECLARE THE SHIPMENT. 
AMERICAN AIRLINES PERSONNEL HAVE TOLD US CUSTOMS OFFICERS 
    THAT THE SHIPMENT WAS DECLARED PROPERLY BOTH ON DEPARTURE 
FROM MIAMI AND ON ARRIVAL IN CARACAS. 
 
--------------------------- 
ITALCAMBIO: \"ROUTINE\" 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C) ITALCAMBIO PRESIDENT CARLOS DORADO TOLD ECONCOUNS 
JANUARY 6 THAT THE SEIZURE WAS PART OF A PATTERN OF GOV 
HARASSMENT OF HIS FIRM IN RETALIATION FOR HIS FREQUENT 
ANTI-CHAVEZ STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  HE SAID THE SHIPMENT 
WAS A ROUTINE ACTIVITY DRAWN FROM THE COMPANY\'S BANK OF 
AMERICA ACCOUNT IN THE US THAT REQUIRED NO SPECIAL ADVANCE 
CUSTOMS NOTICE AND THAT FOLLOWED BOTH US AND VENEZUELAN 
DECLARATION REQUIREMENTS.  DORADO CLAIMED THAT AN OVERZEALOUS 
VENEZUELAN CUSTOMS OFFICIAL AT THE AIRPORT HAD REPORTED THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE MONEY TO NATIONAL CURRENCY CONTROL 
ADMINISTRATION (CADIVI) PRESIDENT EDGAR HERNANDEZ BEHRENS. 
HERNANDEZ BEHRENS APPARENTLY, AND MISTAKENLY, CALLED THE 
SHIPMENT \"CONTRABAND\" ACCORDING TO DORADO.  GIVEN HIS FIRM\'S 
PLACE AS AN IMPORTANT CONDUIT FOR LEGAL DISPERSAL OF 
CADIVI-APPROVED EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, DORADO SAID HE WOULD 
CALL ON THE SUPERINTENDENCY OF BANKS (SUDEBAN) AND THE 
CENTRAL BANK TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ITALCAMBIO\'S ACTIONS WERE 
LEGITIMATE.  HE STRESSED THAT THE MERE IMPORT OF DOLLARS FROM 
THE US WAS NOT A CURRENCY \"TRANSACTION\" THAT FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
CONTROLS WOULD GOVERN.  THE MONEY, HE SAID, WAS BROUGHT IN 
PRECISELY SO IT COULD BE USED IN LAWFUL TRANSACTIONS. 
 
---------------------- 
SUDEBAN: \"YES, BUT...\" 
    ---------------------- 
 
4. (C) IN TURN, SUDEBAN SUPERINTENDENT IRVING OCHOA TOLD 
ECONOFF JANUARY 6 THAT ON ITS FACE ITALCAMBIO\'S ACTIONS WERE 
LEGAL.  OCHOA SAID VENEZUELA HAS NO LAWS AGAINST THE 
IMPORTATION OF PROPERLY DOCUMENTED FOREIGN CURRENCY. 
HOWEVER, HE ALSO SAID THAT ITALCAMBIO COULD FACE LEGAL 
PROBLEMS IF IT COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF ITS IMPORTED 
DOLLARS IN CADIVI-APPROVED OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OPERATIONS. 
 IF NOT, THEN ITALCAMBIO WOULD HAVE VIOLATED VENEZUELA\'S 
BANKING LAW ACCORDING TO OCHOA. HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
SUDEBAN AUDITORS ARE ENGAGED IN DETERMINING IF ITALCAMBIO HAD 
FOLLOWED THE LAW IN THIS REGARD.  OCHOA NOTED THAT HE WAS 
AWARE OF THE IRONY IN INVESTIGATING ITALCAMBIO ON THESE 
GROUNDS WHEN INDIVIDUALS EXCHANGE DOLLARS ON THE STREET TWO 
BLOCKS FROM HIS OWN OFFICE. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"AND SPEAKING OF CONSPIRACIES...\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) IN DISCUSSING THE ORIGIN OF THE MONEY AND ITALCAMBIO\'S 
MOTIVATIONS, OCHOA CLAIMED THAT INVESTIGATORS FROM DISIP, 
VENEZUELA\'S INTERNAL SECURITY SERVICE, HAD TOLD HIM THAT THEY 
HAD PROOF THE SHIPMENT WAS A FUNNELING OPERATION FROM THE USG 
 
CARACAS 00000100  002 OF 002 
 
VE THE ACCUSATION; 
ECONOFF RESPONDED THAT SUCH A CLAIM WAS ABSURD. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) PRO-CHAVEZ NEWSPAPER DIARIO VEA HAS MADE A PUBLIC 
CRUSADE OF THE ITALCAMBIO CASE.  IT HAS FLOATED THEORIES THAT 
DORADO IS ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM BLACK MARKET 
CURRENCY EXCHANGE TO MONEY LAUNDERING TO USG-BACKED 
\"CONSPIRACIES.\"  INDEED, IN ONE BBC WEBSITE ARTICLE CULLED 
FROM A DIARIO VEA REPORT, THE EMBASSY WAS ACCUSED COMPLICITY 
WITH DORADO IN EFFORTS AT \"DESTABILIZATION.\"  THE PRESENCE OF 
A CONTRACTED ITALCAMBIO TRAVEL OFFICE IN THE EMBASSY PROBABLY 
PLAYS ITS PART IN FUELING SUCH WILD SPECULATION.  ITALCAMBIO 
IS ALSO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SUBCONTACTOR IN VENEZUELA.  IN 
REALITY, ITALCAMBIO\'S PROBLEMS ARISE FROM A CONFLUENCE OF 
FACTORS:  DORADO AS CHAVEZ CRITIC, ITALCAMBIO AS LEGITIMATE 
EXCHANGE HOUSE AND PROBABLE CURRENCY BLACK MARKET AGENT, AND 
VENEZUELA AS CONSPIRACY THEORY HOTHOUSE.  IRVING OCHOA IS A 
PRAGMATIST WHO IS LOATHE TO ALLOW SUDEBAN TO BE USED AS A 
TOOL OF POLITICAL PRESSURE, BUT IN THIS HIGH PROFILE CASE HE 
CANNOT TURN OFF THE SPOTLIGHT.  DORADO REMAINS COMBATIVE AND 
SAYS HE WILL NOT RESTRICT HIS CRITICISM OF CHAVEZ REGARDLESS 
OF THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION.  AS VENEZUELAN LAW IS AT 
BEST MURKY IN THE RELEVANT AREAS, THIS PROCESS WILL BE 
PROTRACTED AND FILLED WITH INVECTIVE.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELAN OIL PRODUCTION: A LOOK AHEAD FOR 2004 
 
 
Classified By: Amb. Charles S. Shapiro; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Despite a number of optimistic predictions that 
Venezuelan oil production will increase by the end of 2004 
(which seem largely to be attributable to the success of 
Venezuelan lobbying efforts in the U.S.), our sources in 
Venezuela are not as sanguine.  While some believe that 
Venezuela\'s 2004 production can be expected to remain roughly 
in the 2.5-2.6 million b/d range where it is generally 
believed to be at the current time, there are others who 
believe that, in the absence of significant investment either 
on the part of PDVSA itself or the international oil 
companies, Venezuelan production could drop to as little as 
2.0-2.2 million b/d by the end of 2004.  PDVSA President Ali 
Rodriguez announced January 5 that PDVSA will boost spending 
in 2004 with investment of $6 billion out of a total budget 
of $9.5 billion.  If the budgeted money is actually spent, 
PDVSA may yet be able to arrest the decline, although it 
faces a tough job.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
GOV STAYS ON MESSAGE 
-------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On January 7, PDVSA spokesmen informed visiting U.S. 
Congressional staffers that daily production is 3.4 million 
b/d including condensates, natural gas liquids, and the heavy 
crude processed into Venezuela,s patented Orimulsion fuel. 
Despite this posture on the part of the GOV as well as the 
success of its lobbying efforts in the U.S. (we have seen at 
least one New York bank analysis stating that production will 
increase to 2.9 million b/d by the end of 2004), local 
industry sources continue to be skeptical.  With the 
opposition\'s competing oil production report not yet out for 
the month of December, the most recent hard numbers come from 
the November report which maintains that production in the 
eastern and western production areas was 1,750 million b/d 
and 830,000 b/d respectively for a total of 2.58 million b/d. 
 (Note:  these are numbers for crude production and do not 
include condensates and the other products now included in 
the GOV numbers.  In the past, these were not customarily 
included in Venezuela\'s production numbers.  If PDVSA\'s 
current methodology were used, the opposition estimate might 
look more like 2.8 million b/d.  End Note.)  While production 
in both areas appears to have stabilized, the report asserts 
that PDVSA\'s own production (1.62 million b/d out of the 2.58 
million; production by international operators would be 
956,000 b/d) continues to drop slowly. 
 
------------------- 
HOW LOW WILL IT GO? 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) Some local sources, such as a consultant who works 
closely with former PDVSA President Luis Giusti, believe that 
Venezuela\'s 2004 production will remain roughly in the 
2.5-2.6 million b/d range (without counting condensates, 
etc.).  They believe that modest production increases by the 
four \"Strategic Associations\" (i.e., extra heavy crude 
upgrading projects) as well as by international companies 
working in Venezuela under operational agreements will serve 
to make up for continuing losses in PDVSA\'s own production. 
 
4. (C) ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark Ward, however, 
argues that production will continue to decline.  Ward, who 
believes national production has already fallen to or below 
2.5 million b/d, told econoff to remember the fundamentals of 
reservoir decline in Venezuela, i.e., a 20-25 percent annual 
decline rate that can only be overcome by continuous 
investment in maintenance of existing projects and 
development of new ones.   With fields that are generally 
believed to have been operated at the maximum rate in 2003, 
Ward speculates that the 2004 decline rate may be worse than 
normal.  Ward adds that he sees no evidence of concerted 
action by PDVSA to address the fundamental issues facing a 
production operation, i.e., a lack of maintenance of both 
reservoirs and support systems as well as the failure to do 
enough workovers and drilling to support old or new 
activities.  Ward is also skeptical that production increases 
 
by international operators will be sufficient to maintain 
current production levels. 
 
---------------------- 
SOME IOC\'S CAN DO MORE 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) In a January 6 conversation, Joaquin Moreno, President 
of Shell Venezuela, confirmed to econoff that Shell has 
increased its production of valuable light crude from the 
Urdaneta West field in western Venezuelan to 53,000 b/d. 
Moreno added that PDVSA is anxious to receive as much oil as 
Shell can produce and that he expects production from the 
field to increase to as much as 60,000 b/d in 2004. 
ChevronTexaco President Ali Moshiri then commented to econoff 
that, with oil at $34/barrel, all the international oil 
companies are anxious to produce as much as they can -- or as 
much as PDVSA will allow or can accept.  Moshiri, however, 
pointed to another problem -- infrastructure.  According to 
Moshiri, ChevronTexaco\'s Boscan field in western Venezuela is 
currently producing 115-118,000 b/d.  If PDVSA were to ask 
that Boscan production be increased to 130,000 b/d 
ChevronTexaco could do it quickly, he added, but PDVSA would 
be unable to lift the crude.   Moshiri underlined that the 
infrastructure must be there to handle the product, marketing 
and transportation.   He said that chaos still reigns in 
PDVSA\'s crude trading and shipping functions and that the 
current inefficient system can only handle a maximum of 
2.5-2.6 million b/d. 
 
6. (C)  For his part, ExxonMobil\'s Ward acknowledged that 
there will be \"some small incremental increases from the 
IOC\'s,\" but he does not believe that the increase will be 
enough to offset the natural decline rate.  Ward added that 
the Hamaca project (ConocoPhillips/ChevronTexaco extra heavy 
crude upgrading project; the fourth and last of the so-called 
\"Strategic Associations\"), the only big project expected to 
come on line in 2004, is already producing crude at or close 
to what will be its base level of production.  Further 
expansion of this or other of the Strategic Association 
projects will be impeded by the fact that they use shared 
pipelines and, of course, by the fact that the GOV has not 
moved ahead quickly with negotiations to allow expansion of 
these projects.  (Note:  Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis 
Vierma informed econoff January 7 that PDVSA will meet with 
Total the week of January 12 to discuss the expansion of the 
Sincor project, the Total/Statoil Strategic Association.)  No 
other larger projects are due to be turned on until the 
ExxonMobil La Ceiba field and the ConocoPhillips Corocoro 
field start production in 2005 (these were both projects 
originating in profit sharing deals inked in 1996). 
 
------------- 
PDVSA,S PLANS 
------------- 
 
7. (C)  Long time observers of Venezuela\'s oil scene, such as 
ExxonMobil\'s Mark Ward, say that Venezuela must invest in the 
range of $3-4 billion a year in order to stay ahead of its 
decline curve.  Ward stated bluntly to econoff that PDVSA 
would have to invest $8 billion in 2004 in order to recover 
lost production.  PDVSA has not made its 2003 spending 
figures available yet, although the Finance Ministry has 
reported that PDVSA\'s overall budget was cut by $2.6 billion 
from its original $8 billion in 2003.  PDVSA President Ali 
Rodriguez announced January 5 that PDVSA will boost spending 
in 2004.   He said that PDVSA\'s total budget will be $9.5 
billion (15.2 trillion bolivars) with investment comprising 
$6 billion (9.64 trillion bolivars).  However, in a January 7 
meeting with U.S. Congressional staffers, Vice Minister 
Vierma told econoff that PDVSA\'s investment budget in 2004 
will be $5 billion. 
 
8. (SBU) In an investment summary presented to U.S. 
Congressional staffers on January 7, PDVSA claims it will 
invest $35.4 billion during 2004-2009.  According to the 
presentation, about $13 billion will be invested in 
production over the next five years.  It also predicts that 
production capacity will be 5.04 million b/d by 2009.  (Note: 
 In November 2003, PDVSA announced that its 2004-2009 
investment program envisioned investing $39 billion to raise 
production capacity to 4.8 million b/d in 2009.  An earlier 
version contemplated an investment of $43 billion to yield a 
 
production capacity of 5.0 million b/d.  We are not sure how 
an investment program that seems to have been cut by  almost 
$8 billion according to the January 7 presentation will yield 
the same results. It is also worth remembering that, in 1998, 
PDVSA was talking about achieving a 6 million b/d capacity by 
2006.  End Note) 
 
9. (C) PDVSA has also announced that it will itself develop 
the Ceuta-Tomoporo field, the crown jewel of possible new oil 
projects that had multiple international oil companies lined 
up to express their interest.  The Ministry of Energy and 
Mines had stated publicly in late 2003 that Tomoporo would be 
spun off to a third party contractor in a bid process.   The 
Caracas rumor mill, however, holds that PDVSA President Ali 
Rodriguez went directly to President Chavez to protest, 
saying that the new PDVSA had to be able to show that it 
could take on such a project.  PDVSA has also stated publicly 
that it will itself develop other major new projects.  Where 
the money will come from for development of these projects is 
unclear. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) PDVSA may yet be able to arrest Venezuela\'s 
production decline if it moves ahead quickly with substantial 
investment in maintenance of existing projects and 
development of new ones.  ExxonMobil\'s Ward, however, 
believes that PDVSA could reach a point where it would be 
impossible to invest fast enough to arrest the decline and 
save itself.  The hard fact is that the 2002-2003 oil strikes 
followed on two other events that boded ill for Venezuelan 
oil production:  1) the end of an investment cycle by the 
international oil companies that had seen some $20 billion in 
investment since the early 1990\'s; and 2) the dimunition of 
PDVSA\'s own investment since the beginning of the Chavez 
government.  And, of course, the investments by the 
international oil companies ground to a halt because of the 
changes in the regulatory environment fostered by the Chavez 
government.  No new projects have been developed since the 
passage of the Hydrocarbons law in 2001 and this government\'s 
antipathy towards allowing major new involvement by 
international oil companies in the oil sector (as opposed to 
off-shore gas projects) seems to continue as the recent 
announcement about the Tomoporo field demonstrates.  Even if 
the political and regulatory environment were to improve 
substantially in 2004, there would be a significant lead time 
before this would be reflected in improved production numbers.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ TURNS UP THE HEAT ON CENTRAL BANK FOR 
TRANSFER OF RESERVES 
 
REF: 03 CARACAS 3941 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Chavez has renewed his struggle with the 
Central Bank over USD 1 billion in international reserves, 
which he has demanded be handed over to the GOV for 
agricultural spending.  The Bank has to this point resisted, 
citing controlling legal restrictions.  The National Assembly 
joined the fray January 7 with a non-binding resolution 
passed on partisan lines urging the Central Bank to comply 
with Chavez\'s request.  Despite the political upside for 
Chavez in this fight, the downside for Venezuela\'s economy if 
he succeeds in tapping the reserves would be severe.  End 
summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Chavez Hits BCV (Again) 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) In his December 28 \"Alo, Presidente!\" telecast, 
President Chavez renewed his call  for the Central Bank of 
Venezuela (BCV) to transfer USD 1 billion of its USD 21 
billion in international reserve holdings to the GOV for use 
in \"agricultural reactivation.\"  Since then Chavez has used 
every public appearance to repeat his demand.  Chavez cites 
provisions of the 1999 Constitution that generically require 
the BCV to promote the overall economic health of the 
country, including agriculture.  (Note: Article 320 of the 
Constitution and Article 32 of the Central Bank Law 
specifically prohibit the BCV from using reserves to fund GOV 
budgetary items.  End note.)  He has continued his threats to 
appeal to the Supreme Court or call for a referendum on the 
issue if the BCV does not yield.  In one major difference 
from his November statements on the issue (see reftel), 
Chavez has specifically targeted the corn and sugar sectors 
for receipt of the funds.  He has not been specific about 
what the process for distribution of the funds would be. 
 
---------------------------- 
Agricultural Credit Problems 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The conflict between the President and the BCV over 
the \"millardito\" (little billion), as Chavez calls the 
demanded amount, exists against the backdrop of a struggling 
agricultural loan program.  The Special Plan for the Resupply 
of Agriculture is an agreement between the BCV, the Ministry 
of Finance, and commercial banks that requires agricultural 
credits be 12 percent of bank loan portfolios.  According to 
the plan, these loans are to have a preferential 
\"agricultural interest rate\" calculated at 85 percent of the 
rate for oil project loans.  This rate currently stand at 
approximately 16 percent, which is about 10 percent below the 
prime lending rate.  Banks that do not meet the required 
percentage in their loan portfolios face fines; most are 
gladly paying the fines rather than issue high-risk, low and 
even negative return loans. 
 
-------------- 
BCV Holds Firm 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) The BCV has been steadfast in its refusal to bow to 
pressure from Chavez.  BCV President Diego Castellanos and 
Director Domingo Maza Zavala both made statements to the 
press December 29 that said any such transfer would violate 
the Constitution and that they would welcome a Supreme Court 
ruling on the matter.  Following a pro-Chavez \"millardito\" 
demonstration outside the BCV January 7, the bank issued a 
statement to the press and to all diplomatic missions, 
including the embassy, that detailed the constitutional and 
other legal restrictions on the use of international reserves 
to finance government spending.  (Note: The BCV statement 
characterized the agricultural loan program as having 
\"satisfactory results.\" End note.) 
 
 
------------------------ 
National Assembly Speaks 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) The National Assembly passed a resolution January 7 
urging the BCV to transfer the reserves.  The expected 
partisan wrangling colored the debate over the non-binding 
resolution.  MVR Deputy Willian Lara echoed Chavez when he 
claimed the transfer was legal under the provisions of the 
Constitution requiring the BCV to support national economic 
development.  Opposition deputies were dubious about the 
prospects for meaningful results from a prospective draw down 
of reserves; Proyecto Venezuela Deputy Vestalia de Araujo 
noted that the administration has had five years to improve 
the agricultural sector and has failed.  The resolution 
passed by a vote of 51 to 37.  Pro-Chavez members of the 
Assembly plan to deliver the resolution to the BCV during a 
march January 11. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Chavez Speech Rattles Bond Issue 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The fallout from the Chavez/BCV conflict has been felt 
as far away as New York.  The GOV issued USD 1 billion in new 
30-year bonds January 7 (details septel).  In an almost 
disastrous alignment of events, a Chavez speech in Zulia 
state at the inauguration of a food processing facility in 
which he railed against the BCV sent a momentary jitter 
through the bond operation.  The Ministry of Finance quickly 
issued a statement clarifying Chavez\'s position with 
assurances that all funds from the BCV were subject to legal 
controls that the GOV had no intention of violating.  Finance 
Minister Nobrega claimed January 8 that the executive branch 
was only seeking to utilize \"unused assets\" from the BCV\'s 
monetary desk. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) This issue is a win/win demagogic jewel for Chavez in 
the short term.  The vast majority of his intended audience 
has little understanding of the importance of BCV 
independence.  Therefore, he is able to frame this issue 
squarely in terms of elite \"haves\" keeping down poor 
\"have-nots.\"  The message requires others to engage in damage 
control as Nobrega\'s tortured explanation to international 
financial markets illustrates.  The ultimate danger lies not 
in this first attempt to commandeer the BCV\'s reserves, but 
in the addictive effect it could have on future GOV budget 
operations.  This administration does not have a good track 
record of fiscal responsibility; the laudable Macroeconomic 
Stabilization Fund (FIEM) intended to protect against oil 
price shocks has disappeared with little accountability at a 
time of record oil prices.  A policy of artifically high, 
exchange control-fueled reserves is an invitation to even 
higher inflation that was already 27.1 percent in 2003.  Our 
agricultural contacts, as well as our FAS counselor, are 
highly skeptical that any of the proposed transfer would 
become productive investment in that troubled sector.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela issued its fifth tranche of bonds in the 
past six months on January 7.  The new bonds raised USD 1 
billion for the GOV and were in heavy demand due to their 
high offered yield.  With a high rate of financing needed for 
the FY 2004 budget deficit and debt service, more bond 
operations can be expected.  However, external factors could 
lower the markets appetite for Venezuelan securities in the 
future.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
New 30-Year Notes 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) The GOV issued USD 1 billion in new 30-year bonds 
January 7.  JPMorgan Chase was the agent for the transaction. 
 For the first time since 1998, Venezuela registered the bond 
issue with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Therefore, the bonds can immediately be traded in US markets. 
 Final closing yield on the bonds was 9.38 percent.  The new 
issue raises Venezuela\'s total external debt operations since 
August 1, 2003 to USD 5.55 billion. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Oil Makes It Attractive Despite Chavez 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Luis Oganes, JPMorgan Chase Economist and Emerging 
Market Analyst for the Andean Region, told econoff January 8 
that the issue was oversubscribed by approximately USD 2.5 
billion dollars.  Investors were eager to snap up the 
relatively high yield bonds in light of continued high oil 
prices according to Oganes.  He added that the only hiccup 
was from an ill-timed threat from President Chavez to the 
Central Bank in the ongoing dispute over reserve transfers 
(ref A).  Oganes said that despite Chavez\'s remarks, only 
three smaller orders were cancelled.  The oversubscription of 
the issue pushed the yield almost a full point below the 
initially offered yield of 10.125 to 10.25 percent. 
-------------- 
Yields Are Key 
-------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Miguel Octavio, Executive Director of local 
investment firm BBO echoed Oganes in a conversation with 
econoffs January 14.  Octavio said higher offered yields were 
the key to Venezuela\'s successful debt offerings since 
August.  He said one only had to compare the 5 to 7 percent 
yields on recent issues from Mexico, Costa Rica, and Turkey 
to understand the attraction for Venezuelan bonds.  In a 
January 15 conference, Economist Cristina Rodriguez of local 
economic analysis firm Metroeconomica, predicted that the GOV 
would go to the markets again since it faces financing 
demands around 16 percent of GDP under the FY 2004 budget. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C)  The appetite of international markets for Venezuelan 
debt seems remarkable, at least when viewed from here, the 
epicenter of political and economic chaos.  Low US interest 
rates, high oil prices, and a perceived recovery in 
Venezuelan oil production are factors that strengthen the 
Ministry of Finance\'s ability to sell up to a USD billion per 
month in GOV paper.  However, should the US recovery result 
in the Fed raising interest rates or should oil prices 
falter, market interest in Venezuela could slacken.  We have 
already reported our skepticism regarding the third leg of 
this triad, Venezuelan oil production levels (ref B).  If 
international financial options are limited, other vehicles 
such as Chavez\'s effort to tap Central Bank reserves (ref A) 
may become increasingly important as the GOV seek to push the 
pain of any adjustment in spending into the second half of 
 
 
2004 when the current referendum/electoral cycle will 
presumably have passed.

1. (U) The following message is Sensitive but Unclassified 
because it contains corporate information.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Ambassador met January 13 with Dan Sanders, 
President of the ExxonMobil Chemical Company, to discuss the 
status of a possible investment in Venezuela.  The project, a 
joint venture with Pequiven, state oil compamy PDVSA\'s 
chemical affiliate, would see the construction of a $2.3 
billion petrochemical plant to create feedstock for the 
plastics industry.  ExxonMobil appears to be ready to move 
ahead with this investment, under discussion since 1996, 
despite some concerns about the political environment and its 
possible impact on the financing package.  The signature of a 
Preliminary Development Agreement (PDA), which may be 
preceded by a meeting in Venezuela between ExxonMobil 
Chairman Lee Raymond and President Chavez, is likely within 
the next two to three months.  In a best case scenario, the 
plant would come on stream in 2008-2010.  End Summary. 
 
3. (SBU) On January 13, the Ambassador, accompanied by 
EconCouns, Resources Attache and visiting Deskoff, met with 
ExxonMobil Chemical Company (EMCC) President Dan Sanders, two 
EMCC vice presidents, ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark 
Ward, and other company personnel.  Sanders and his team 
asked the Ambassador to comment on possible 2004 political 
events, saying ExxonMobil would be concerned about anything 
that could impact on investor confidence or the execution of 
the project.  Sanders informed the Ambassador that the 
signature of a Project Development Agreement (PDA) may be as 
little as a month away, following a possible visit to 
Venezuela by ExxonMobil Chairman Lee Raymond. 
 
----------- 
THE PROJECT 
----------- 
 
4. (U) The centerpiece of the proposed joint 
ExxonMobil/Pequiven (PDVSA chemical affiliate) project would 
be an ethane-based, ethylene cracker which would provide 
feedstock for three related facilities.  The integrated 
facility, to be located in the Jose Industrial Complex in 
Anzoategui State, 140 miles east of Caracas, would convert 
1.3 million metric tons of ethane into 1 million tons of 
ethylene.  The ethylene in turn would be converted into 
760,000 metric tons of both high- and low-density 
polyethylene (used for items such as grocery sacks and 
garment bags respectively) and 430,000 tons of ethylene 
glycol (used in polyester clothing).  The polyethylene would 
be used primarily to spur domestic projects and to penetrate 
export markets in South and Central American and the 
Caribbean.  The ethylene glycol production would be exported 
to European and Asian markets.  The capital investment for 
the project is estimated at approximately $2.3 billion. 
 
---------- 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
5. (SBU) Once the PDA is signed, a two to three year period 
will start in which ExxonMobil will have to revalidate the 
economics of the project, negotiate detailed agreements, get 
the GOV to agree to the necessary package of fiscal 
incentives, do the engineering, and, most importantly, get 
the financing.  Construction is expected to take three to 
four years and would generate approximately 8,000 jobs at its 
peak.  The project would create about 700 direct permanent 
jobs and would be expected to come on stream in 2008-2010 in 
a best case scenario. 
 
6. (SBU) PDVSA Gas was originally supposed to construct a gas 
separation plant to separate the ethane feedstock for the 
plant from gas provided in Anaco or associated gas from 
Venezuela,s eastern oil fields.  PDVSA was also expected to 
construct a dedicated pipeline directly to the plant. 
PDVSA\'s ability to provide enough gas for feedstock has been 
questioned.  EMCC President Sanders, however, told the 
 
Ambassador that ExxonMobil believes there is enough gas 
on-shore for development of the first train (i.e., production 
line).  Successive trains would likely be supported by 
off-shore gas. 
 
7. (SBU) Sanders conceded that there are questions about 
PDVSA\'s ability to meet its $1 billion plus commitment in the 
50-50 joint venture (as well as to fund construction of the 
plants mentioned above).  He said ExxonMobil has received 
assurances that the project funding has been included in 
PDVSA\'s budget.  He added, however, that ExxonMobil will be 
looking at investment models adopted by other projects that 
have locked in PDVSA cash calls.  He acknowledged that 
getting the financing will be difficult in the absence of 
investor confidence in PDVSA. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) ExxonMobil\'s interests in this project happen to 
coincide with Chavez\'s efforts to promote downstream 
industrial development in Venezuela.  Company sources believe 
the GOV dragged its feet so long on approving this project 
because it saw it exclusively as an export project. 
ExxonMobil, however, has bent over backwards to accommodate 
Chavez Administration goals to expand domestic industry.  For 
example, ExxonMobil has engaged to start importing resins to 
spur the further development of the domestic Venezuelan 
plastics industry before project construction.  The company 
has also pledged to provide technical assistance to the 
national industry in such areas as how to process resins, 
product applications, etc. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment Continued:  ExxonMobil has told us that, 
despite their best efforts to push for a low key ceremony for 
signature of the PDA, the GOV is likely to insist on a 
televized splash.  Any visit by ExxonMobil\'s Chairman to 
Venezuela is also likely to provide President Chavez with 
electioneering fodder.  GOV officials have already been 
quoted in the local press as saying that Sanders\' visit is a 
sign of investor confidence in Venezuela.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) officially began 
the verification process for the three signature drives to 
recall President Hugo Chavez and numerous National Assembly 
deputies January 13.  The CNE\'s announcement that 
gubernatorial and mayoral elections will take place as 
scheduled in July/August, however, stirred up tensions among 
opposition political parties over which electoral process 
will be the priority for the opposition.  Traditional parties 
(AD, COPEI, MAS) perceive an opportunity to defeat Chavez at 
the state and local level, while other parties (Primero 
Justicia, Proyecto Venezuela, Causa R) worry that a divided 
opposition will fumble the presidential referendum process. 
Frustrated by the slow pace of the CNE, the opposition has 
fallen into the trap of attacking each other.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
CNE Begins Physical Check of Chavez Signatures 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) On January 14, the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
began the physical verification -- the first step in the 
verification process -- of the signatures collected in 
support of the presidential referendum.  On January 13, 
National Electoral Council (CNE) directors Jorge Rodriguez 
and Ezequiel Zamora declared publicly that the verification 
process had begun.  The CNE board reportedly increased the 
number of lawyers on the committee examining the 
certifications (\"actas\") from 40 to 70 to speed up that stage 
of the verification process.  Rodriguez added that the CNE 
plans to work separately on the three signature drives, 1) 
against opposition deputies, 2) against President Hugo 
Chavez, and 3) against GOV-allied deputies.  An OAS observer 
told poloff January 13 that the CNE is planning to create a 
single report to announce the results of the three drives. 
(Note:  The rules permit 30 days to complete the verification 
process and two days for the CNE board to approve the 
results.) He doubted the CNE could finish the job in the 
legally prescribed 30 days, but expressed confidence that 
work would proceed expeditiously. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Regional Elections Cloud Picture 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The CNE\'s announcement that elections for governors 
and mayors would proceed on schedule at the end of July (or 
beginning of August) stirred up concern among opposition 
parties over the fate of the recall referendum against 
Chavez.  Primero Justicia (PJ), Proyecto Venezuela (PV), and 
Causa R denounced AD, COPEI, MAS, Solidaridad, and Union for 
allegedly giving priority to the regional elections instead 
of the presidential recall vote.  PJ Secretary General Jose 
Luis Mejias told poloffs January 14 that a meeting at the 
Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC) on January 10 
revealed strong disagreement between parties on how to 
proceed.  Mejias claimed that state and local elections will 
distract from the referendum, citing an example of a rural PJ 
candidate who asked party leadership not to criticize Chavez 
because he was supported by an important group of Chavez 
supporters in his town.  Mejias said PJ has proposed a 
unified campaign committee to coordinate candidate selection 
among the parties, basing the decision on who is most likely 
to defeat the Chavez-backed candidate.  Regarding PJ Deputy 
Gerardo Blyde\'s request to the Supreme Court to postpone the 
regional elections until December, Mejias thought the Court 
would reject the request, but added that at least PJ would 
make its point. 
 
4. (C) Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) President Felipe 
Mujica dispelled PJ\'s criticisms in a conversation with 
poloffs January 15.  Mujica said PJ has \"votes but not 
candidates\" and is less prepared for the regional elections. 
 
The dispute between parties is natural competition, he said, 
and for a party to ignore an election would be like trying to 
ignore the reality of one\'s own birthday.  The CNE calendar, 
he said, would require parties to name state and local 
candidates o/a March 20.  He noted that if the CNE announces 
at the beginning of February that there will be a referendum 
in May/June, then Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza, a 
potential candidate for president, would have to choose 
between the two.  The opposition, he said, is facing either 
\"a great opportunity\" or a \"big disaster,\" depending on 
whether they can coordinate on the various electoral events. 
 
5. (C) A representative of the DCC told PolOff that the 
January 10 meeting produced a deadlock among parties and NGOs 
over the question of regional elections.  The representative 
said he thought it unlikely there would be agreement on 
unified candidates for governors and mayors, but that as the 
elections approached, trailing candidates would throw their 
support to the leading opposition candidate.  The 
representative suspects the CNE will ultimately combine the 
regional elections with either the referendum against Chavez 
or the subsequent presidential election. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) For months we have heard from GOV allies their 
strategy to divide the opposition over the regional 
elections.  The opposition fell into the trap and turned on 
themselves by taking it public.  It should not be surprising 
that those political parties with strong chances of winning 
at the state and local levels are not willing to pass up the 
opportunity.  They hope to remove Chavez now via referendum, 
but think it foolish not to try to deal him a blow by 
defeating him in the regional elections.  We suspect the 
opposition\'s divisions over regional elections can be 
reconciled in time, though it will be a messy process.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Seeking to shift attention from the CNE and the recall 
referendum processes, President Hugo Chavez reacted to recent 
comments on Venezuela by USG officials, repeatedly calling 
National Security Advisor Rice \"an illiterate.\" Chavez 
believes that the USG is meddling in Venezuelan internal 
affairs and conspiring with the opposition.  In a 
nationally-broadcast show on January 10, Chavez said he 
considered the comments by USG officials, particularly 
comments by Rice, to be violation of Venezuelan sovereignty. 
The Vice President, National Assembly, Attorney General, and 
Foreign Minister also made comments insisting that USG not 
become involved in Venezuelan internal affairs.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
USG Comments on Referendum and Democracy in Venezuela 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (U) Recent public comments by USG officials reiterating 
our policy on Venezuela have drawn substantial attention.  On 
January 5 and again on January 12, the Department\'s Deputy 
Spokesman said, \"We (USG) remain committed to working with 
the OAS to support the Venezuelan Government and opposition 
achieve a constitutional, democratic, peaceful, and electoral 
solution to the current political impasse there.\"  Speaking 
at the Council of the Americas on January 6, WHA A/S Roger 
Noreiga did not mention Venezuela in his speech, but 
responding to reporters, he stated that he understood that 
Chavez was not a close friend of the U.S.  The Secretary also 
acknowledged the strained relationship with Venezuela and 
commented on the referendum, emphasizing US support for 
resolving Venezuela\'s political situation in a constitutional 
manner. 
 
3. (U) Responding to questions on the Venezuelan referendum, 
National Security Advisor Rice said, \"President Chavez has an 
opportunity to demonstrate that he believes in democratic 
processes by allowing this recall to go through unhindered, 
unfettered, and then living up to the terms of it.\"  She also 
noted that Venezuela is going through a difficult time in its 
democratic development.  Citing the USG,s support of the OAS 
and NGOs, particularly the Carter Center, to ensure that the 
referendum process is held without interference, she said 
that she hoped that Chavez would \"demonstrate that he 
believes in a democratic future for Venezuela by carrying out 
the wishes of his people.\"  Later at the Monterrey Summit, 
President Bush repeated the USG position, saying, \"We will 
work with the Organization of American States to ensure the 
integrity of the presidential recall and referendum process 
underway in Venezuela.\" 
 
------------ 
GOV comments 
------------ 
 
4. (U) S(j}) to Rice, referring to her 
again as \"a true illiterate.\"  He quickly explained to the 
audience that while she can read, she cannot read the truth. 
In response, he offered to send books to her from the Cuban 
 
literacy program.  Chavez read a transcript of Rice\'s 
comments and wryly asked, \"I don\'t have a reason to call her 
an illiterate?\"  After denouncing Rice\'s response to the 
April 2002 coup, Chavez likened Rice\'s comments to those of 
\"hypocritical Pharisees.\"  Chavez then claimed to have 
\"figured out\" that the flurry of USG comments were part of a 
plot with the opposition to overthrow him.  He said that if 
the CNE finds the referendum to be invalid, Washington and 
Rice will say that Chavez is not supporting democracy.  At 
the Monterrey Summit, Chavez stated that comments by 
President Bush on Venezuela \"were more intelligent\" than 
those of his national security advisor. 
 
6. (U) On January 6, Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said 
Ereli\'s comments were a \"broken record\" and questioned why 
the U.S. was giving such treatment to a country of such 
importance.  Rangel called the Secretary\'s comments 
\"impertinent,\" adding that \"it is not up to Mr. Powell, the 
US State Department or the United States, but (to) the 
National Electoral Council of Venezuela to decide.\" On 
January 9, Rangel acknowledged political differences, but 
said that he hoped to have a normal relationship with the U.S. 
 
-------------------------- 
Other GOV Branches Respond 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (U) On January 13, the National Assembly approved a 
statement introduced by Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) deputy 
Tarek William Saab.  The statement rejects \"repeated 
interventions and interference of the U.S.\" in Venezuelan 
internal affairs.  The document, which specifically 
references Powell and Rice,s comments, calls on the U.S. to 
respect the principles of non-intervention and 
self-determination.  In a similar fashion, Attorney General 
Isaias Rodriguez also issued a statement, insisting that 
countries in the region do not get involved in Venezuelan 
internal affairs, directly referring to Rice\'s comments.  He 
\"urged countries to avoid comments\" because they could 
\"complicate the situation and increase tensions.\"  Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton also rebuked Rice and the U.S. 
 He said that the referendum was an internal matter and that 
the USG should not start a fight with Venezuela. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Three factors explain the loud and disproportionate 
response to the statements by senior U.S. officials: 
 
-- the GOV wants to shift public focus from the CNE and the 
referendum to U.S.-Venezuelan relations; 
 
-- the GOV seeks to maintain pressure on the CNE; and 
 
-- Chavez wanted to burnish his nationalist credentials on 
the eve of the Monterrey Summit. 
 
9. (C) The impending visit of former President Carter (Jan. 
25-27) will of course underscore the valid role of foreign 
groups (OAS and Carter Center) in monitoring the CNE 
signature count process, and more generally the referendum 
process.  Our public statements should continue to stress our 
support for the referendum process and the implementation of 
OAS resolution 833.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  A significant increase in the number of dengue 
cases in Caracas in December sparked concern about an 
epidemic among city residents (including the Embassy 
community).  The upsurge in dengue, following shortly after 
an October 2003 outbreak of yellow fever, triggered questions 
about the GOV\'s public health capabilities.  Ministry of 
Health officials admitted to the existence of a dengue 
\"epidemic\", but have downplayed the threat to public health. 
An opposition oriented epidemiological NGO claims Ministry 
assessments are politically rather than medically based and 
warns that outbreaks of yellow fever pose even more danger to 
the public health than dengue.  The World Health Organization 
(WHO) representative in Venezuela was not alarmed by the rise 
in dengue cases but expressed concern about other public 
health issues including yellow fever, maternal mortality, and 
HIV/AIDS.  He praised the GOV\'s new \"Into the Slums\" program, 
which places Cuban doctors in low-income neighborhoods, as a 
step in the right direction.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
DENGUE AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS? 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU)  Dengue is a viral disease which is transmitted by 
infected Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes and usually results in a 
period of high fever and muscular pain in its victims.  Less 
commonly, the hemorrhagic form of dengue can result in death. 
 There are no vaccines against the 4 types of dengue and 
incidence of the disease in Venezuela typically rises 
seasonally, depending on the amount of rainfall.  Ministry of 
Health Director of Epidemiology Jose Mendoza blamed unusually 
heavy rains in the last few weeks of the year for almost 
doubling the number of cases reported in the capital city in 
2003 compared to 2002.  This rapid increase in the number of 
dengue cases allows the use of the word \"epidemic\". 
 
3. (SBU)  According to figures published weekly by the 
Ministry, there were 2,666 dengue cases reported in Caracas 
by week 49 (November 30 - December 6) of 2003.  Only 1,420 
cases had been reported by the same week in 2002.  National 
figures, however, showed 23,916 cases up to the first week of 
December 2003, compared to 36,658 cases in the same period of 
2002. Countrywide there were 1,999 reported cases of 
hemorrhagic dengue which resulted in five deaths in 2003, 
three of them in Caracas.  Although he acknowledged the 
existence of an \"epidemic\" in Caracas, Mendoza pointed to the 
year-on-year 34 percent decrease in national cases as proof 
that the Ministry was successfully working against the 
disease. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
FROM INADEQUATE INSTITUTIONS TO INCREASED VIRUSES 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (SBU)  Marisela Perdomo, President of an epidemiological 
NGO FUNDEPI, attributed the recent increase in dengue cases 
to Venezuela\'s failing health care infrastructure in a 
December 19 meeting with emboffs.  The NGO, founded in 1993 
with the help of the Ministry of Health, currently has nine 
independent epidemiologists affiliated with it.  Although 
FUNDEPI maintains a close relationship with the M1G

SUBJECT: DAS DESHAZO\'S MEETING WITH CNE PRESIDENT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) WHA DAS Peter DeShazo and the Ambassador discussed the 
verification process for the recall referendum with National 
Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco Carrasquero and 
CNE Secretary General William Pacheco January 22. 
Carrasquero assured DeShazo that the process is on track to 
be completed on or about February 15.  He described 
additional resources and guarantees of support the CNE has 
received from the GOV.  Carrasquero dismissed allegations of 
\"mega-fraud\".  He clarified several procedural details and 
outlined a timeline for the steps necessary to the 
verification process.  He dismissed concerns about delays and 
the CNE\'s ability to maintain its autonomy.  He expressed 
appreciation for international support and emphasized his 
belief that things will continue to go well.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
NO REASON FOR CONCERN 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) Deputy Assistant Secretary DeShazo, Ambassador, DCM, 
and econoff spoke with National Electoral Council (CNE) 
President Francisco Carrasquero and CNE Secretary General 
William Pacheco about the referendum signature verification 
process on January 22. DeShazo opened the conversation by 
noting that all international eyes are upon Venezuela and 
that the center of attention is the CNE, stressing the 
historic importance that the CNE\'s management of the 
verification process--and beyond-- will have.  Carrasquero 
assured DeShazo and the Ambassador that the CNE would be able 
to complete the verification process by the constitutionally 
mandated deadline of February 15.  He said the GOV had 
offered more staff and computers, as well as a guarantee from 
Vice President Rangel of credits for the purchase of 
equipment.  The CNE now has three teams working 24 hours 
every day on the verification of signatures.  Carrasquero 
also noted that VP Rangel had visited him that day (note: as 
Rangel had told DeShazo he would) and had stated publicly 
that the GOV would respect whatever decision the CNE made. 
 
3. (C) Carrasquero was not worried by recent criticism of the 
CNE or by accusations of deliberate delays, but he did 
express concern that certain sectors of society would not 
respect the CNE\'s final decision.  He insisted the 
institution would maintain its independence and continue to 
work in a calm and transparent manner.  Carrasquero agreed 
with DeShazo\'s positive assessment of the international 
observers\' role in maintaining transparency.  Although the 
teams had found a \"normal\" number of errors, Carrasquero said 
there was no sign yet of fraud.  He deemed it too early to 
make a meaningful determination on the 
issue. 
 
---------------------------- 
TIMING AND TECHNICAL DETAILS 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) DeShazo questioned Carrasquero on the details and 
timing of several steps integral to the verification process. 
 Carrasquero confirmed that CNE teams were engaged in the 
separate processes of physically verifying the tally 
sheets/certifications (\"actas\") and the signature sheets 
(\"planillas\").  Once the physical verification is complete, 
the quality control process of cross-checking rejected 
signatures with existing electoral data can begin. 
Carrasquero said the CNE would publish a list of rejected 
signatures and a list of valid signatures in the national 
press for review by the public.  He explained that citizens 
would have a period of five days to dispute their inclusion 
on either list and could do so at regional CNE offices. 
According to Carrasquero, the dispute period will occur 
before February 13 when the final verification report will be 
submitted to CNE board.  The board will have two days to 
approve the report.  Carrasquero assured DeShazo that the 
 
board would make a definitive decision and publish the 
results of the signature drive in the electoral gazette on 
February 15. 
 
5. (C) CNE Secretary General William Pacheco told DeShazo 
that each subject and author of a particular recall effort 
would have the opportunity to audit the process.  He 
explained that either party could ask for copies of relevant 
certification sheets and signature sheets to be certain that 
CNE teams were operating with unaltered information.  Pacheco 
said copies of signature sheets had already been delivered to 
several National Assembly members up for recall. 
 
--------------------- 
AFTER FEBRUARY 15... 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Carrasquero noted that the CNE\'s final decision on the 
verification process would be open to Supreme Court 
challenges for an unspecified time period after its 
announcement.  Also, he and Pacheco guaranteed the CNE\'s 
technical ability to mount the various referenda within the 
legal time-frame if warranted by the results of the 
verification process.  Carrasquero told DAS DeShazo the board 
had already consulted with Spanish company, INDRA, about the 
technical requirements.  DeShazo congratulated Carrasquero on 
his work so far and reiterated the USG\'s support for a 
democratic, constitutional, electoral, and peaceful solution 
to Venezuela\'s political crisis. 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador asked Carrasquero about President 
Chavez\' allegations of \"mega-fraud\".  Carrasquero said that 
the CNE hadn\'t finished its work, but that there was no 
mega-fraud.  He pointedly repeated his December 2002 public 
statement to the effect that the President\'s views on the 
validity of votes was not important in the CNE\'s autonomous 
verification process.  DeShazo praised Carrasquero\'s 
commitment to resisting political pressure, and emphasized 
the importance of institutional independence and transparency 
for the CNE\'s eventual decision to be seen as legitimate. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) Carrasquero was upbeat and cordial.  As critics on 
both sides of the political spectrum currently beset the CNE, 
it behooves Carrasquero not to display any uncertainty about 
its capabilities.  However, the presidential recall 
referendum is a process of unprecedented technical and 
political complexity.  Despite Carrasquero\'s confident 
insistence that the CNE will meet its February 13th deadline, 
the date could slip.  Between those in the CNE who may 
attempt to slow the process, and the technical difficulties 
imposed by the scope of work, delays will be hard to avoid. 
 
9. (U) DAS DeShazo reviewed this message.

--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2.    (C) ON JANUARY 22, 2004, WHA DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
    PETER DESHAZO, THE AMBASSADOR, AND PD OFFICER MET WITH 
JUSTICE IVAN RINCON, THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA\'S SUPREME 
COURT OF JUSTICE (TSJ).  JUSTICE JESUS CABRERA, ALSO A MEMBER 
OF THE TSJ\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER, JOINED THE MEETING  AS 
IT WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. 
 
3.    (C) RINCON WELCOMED DAS DESHAZO TO THE TSJ AND THANKED 
THE AMBASSADOR FOR CONTINUED EMBASSY ASSISTANCE WITH 
VENEZUELA\'S JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM EFFORTS.  RINCON NOTED THE 
SUCCESS OF A RECENT EMBASSY-SPONSORED PROGRAM IN WHICH 
SEVERAL VENEZUELAN JUDGES AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
TRAVELED TO THE UNITED STATES.  RINCON SAID HE ADMIRED THE 
MANNER IN WHICH THE US JUSTICE SYSTEM ALLOWED FOR COOPERATION 
BETWEEN LEVELS OF AUTHORITY, FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN THE MILITARY 
COURTS AND THE CIVIL POLICE.

USG INTEREST IN SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS

4.    (C) DAS DESHAZO TOLD RINCON HE HAD RETURNED TO 
VENEZUELA TO EXPRESS USG SUPPORT FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL, 
ELECTORAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO VENEZUELA\'S 
POLITICAL IMPASSE, OF WHICH THE CURRENT PROCESS OF 
VERIFICATION OF SIGNATURES BY THE CNE IS THE KEY ELEMENT. 
DESHAZO UNDERSCORED THAT THE USG STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE 
EFFORTS OF THE CARTER CENTER AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN 
STATES (OAS) TO MONITOR THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS. 
HE FURTHER EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE CNE BE ABLE 
TO OPERATE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRANSPARENCY AND AUTONOMY, 
FREE FROM INTERFERENCE. 

5.    (C) RINCON SAID THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE CNE, BUT THE TSJ IS CHARGED WITH 
ENSURING A LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  THE VERIFICATION PROCESS, SAID 
RINCON, INVOLVES CERTIFYING SIGNATURE FORMS (PLANILLAS) AND 
TALLY SHEETS (ACTAS).  RINCON SAID THE VERIFICATION TASK IS 
SQUARELY IN THE HANDS OF THE FIVE CNE DIRECTORS, AND THEY 
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE SIGNATURES TO GET TO A 
RECALL REFERENDUM FOR CHAVEZ, AS WELL AS VERIFYING SIGNATURES 
FOR RECALLING VARIOUS LEGISLATORS.  ANY CITIZEN COULD OF 
COURSE APPEAL ANY CNE DECISION TO THE TSJ, BUT HE EXPECTED 
APPEALS TO BE DECIDED RAPIDLY. 
 
6.    (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER AUTHENTIC SIGNATURES 
WOULD BE DISALLOWED FOR TECHNICAL REASONS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, A 
SIGNATURE FORM WAS NOT PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE 
CORRESPONDING TALLY SHEET. RINCON RESPONDED THAT EVERYTHING 
WOULD BE CERTIFIED BY THE CNE AND THAT SUCH ISSUES WOULD 
CERTAINLY DEPEND ON THE RULES THAT BODY ESTABLISHED.  THE 
TSJ,S ELECTORAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBERS, HE SAID, COULD 
 
SIPDIS 
NOT DECIDE SUCH THINGS BEFOREHAND AND MAKING STATEMENTS ON 
THE VERIFICATION PROCESS FROM THE TSJ MAY BE 
 
CARACAS 00000292  002 OF 003 
 
LE OF HAVEZ 
SUPPORTERS OR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF MAKING DIPLOMATIC 
REMARKS ABOUT THE AMBASSADOR, PRESIDNT BUSH OR NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR CONDOLEEZA ICE.  RINCON NOTED THAT 
RESPONDING TO CHAVEZ IS OT ALWAYS WISE.  SO IT IS, HE SAID, 
WITH THE CURENT CNE PROCESS.  IF THE SIGNATURES ARE 
VERIFIED,THAT WILL OPEN A ROAD TO A RECALL REFERENDUM.

7.    (C) RINCON RSPONDED TO SEVERAL QUESTIONS BY THE DAS 
AND THE ABASSADOR ABOUT CURRENT PLAYERS IN THE VENEZUELAN 
ELECTORAL AND POLITICAL SCENE.  WHILE THE PRESS AN CHAVEZ 
HAD PROBLEMS, THE PRESS, SAID RINCON, WA A GOOD INSTITUTION. 
RINCON SAID THE POWER OF FDECAMERAS, A BUSINESS COLLECTIVE 
AND A COORDINATO OF THE CRIPPLING NATIONAL STRIKE IN 
DECEMBER 202-FEBRUARY 2003, HAD NOW LARGELY DISAPPEARED. 
 
8    (C) RINCON RECALLED THAT DURING THE ATTEMPTED OUP IN 
APRIL 2002, A MILLION PEOPLE WERE IN THE TREET, CREATING A 
VERY \"DANGEROUS MOMENT\" AND AN NVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE WERE 
BEING KILLED AND LITLE HOPE EXISTED FOR AN ELECTORAL 
SOLUTION.  RINON NOTED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER 
CALLD ON VENEZUELANS TO BE PEACEFUL AND THAT WAS 
INSRUMENTAL IN GETTING THE PARTIES TO SETTLE DOWN AND 
    PROCEED TOWARDS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CABRERA WALKS IN, RNCON CHANGES TOPIC 
------------------------------------- 
 
9.    (C) LATE IN THE CONVERSATION, JUTICE JESUS CABRERA, 
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TSJ\'S CNSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER, JOINED 
THE MEETING.  WHEN ABRERA ENTERED, RINCON CHANGED THE TOPIC 
TO THE URRENT JOCKEYING TO CHANGE THE INTERNAL RULES OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND RECALL POLITICS.  RINCONSAID CHAVEZ 
SUPPORTERS ARE SEEKING TO SOLIDIFY THIR CONTROL OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO ENSURE THY RETAIN SOME POWER IF CHAVEZ 
FALLS.  HE NOTED TAT THE OPPOSITION WAS AT A DISADVANTAGE 
BECAUSE HAVEZ HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR FIVE YEARS AND 
THE OPPOSITION STILL HAS NO SINGLE CANDIDATE TOCHALLENGE 
HIM.

10.   (C) CBRERA SAID THE USG SHOULD BE ASSURED THAT THERE 
ILL BE NO ADVANTAGE GIVEN TO EITHER CHAVEZ OR TO HI 
OPPONENTS IF THE COURT IS ASKED TO REVIEW ISSUE REGARDING A 
RECALL REERENDUM.  NEVERTHELESS, H NOTED THAT CHAVEZ 
SUPPORTERS OBVIOUSLY DID NOT ARTICIPATE IN THE SIGNATURE 
DRIVE TO REMOVE THE RESIDENT AND THEREFORE WOULD MOST LIKELY 
NOT COMEBEFORE THE COURT.  (NOTE: CABRERA IGNORED THE 
POSIBILITY THAT THE COURT MAY REVIEW ISSUES STEMMING FROM 
THE SEVERAL SIGNATURE PETITIONS TO RECALL OPOSITION 
    LEGISLATORS BROUGHT BY CHAVEZ SUPPORTER.)  WITHOUT 
PROMPTING, CABRERA EMPHATICALLY DENIED REPORTS THAT THE 
TSJ,S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER IS CONTROLLED BY CHAVEZ, 
 
SIPDIS 
STATING DECIDEDLY, \"OUR DECISIONS WILL NOT BE POLITICAL.\" 
 
11.   (C) RINCON ADDED THAT THE OPPOSITION SHOULD HAVE FAITH 
IN THE TSJ\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER, NOTING IT WAS THAT 
CHAMBER THAT RULED AGAINST CHAVEZ IN THE TREASON CASE BROUGHT 
AGAINST MILITARY OFFICERS FOLLOWING THE APRIL 2002 COUPE 
ATTEMPT.  HE REPEATED A LINE FROM HIS SPEECH AT THE OPENING 
OF THE TSJ\'S DECISION:  \"OUR PARTY IS DEMOCRACY.\"

12.   (U) FOLLOWING HIS MEETING WITH DAS DESHAZO AND THE

SUBJECT: WHA/DAS PETER DESHAZO,S 1/22/04 MEETING WITH 
VENEZUELAN CHIEF JUSTICE IVAN RINCON 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1.    (C) During a January 22, 2004 meeting with Supreme 
Court (TSJ) Chief Justice Ivan Rincon, WHA Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Peter DeShazo noted that the USG remains vitally 
 
SIPDIS 
interested in a democratic and electoral process, supports 
the efforts of  the Carter Center and the Organization of 
American States (OAS) to monitor the signature verification 
process, and views as absolutely essential the independence 
of the National Electoral Council (CNE).  Rincon said the TSJ 
will not be biased in any decisions regarding a referendum. 
Following the meeting, Rincon publicly reminded the CNE to 
verify signatures for recall referenda responsibly and 
pledged the TSJ would remain vigilant.  Rincon\'s public 
statement shows a willingness to immediately translate 
privately communicated USG concerns into public statements. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Chief Justice Praises Embassy Support in Judicial Reform 
Efforts 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.    (C) On January 22, 2004, WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Peter DeShazo, the Ambassador, and PD Officer met with 
Justice Ivan Rincon, the President of Venezuela\'s Supreme 
Court of Justice (TSJ).  Justice Jesus Cabrera, also a member 
of the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, joined the meeting  as 
it was drawing to a close. 
 
3.    (C) Rincon welcomed DAS DeShazo to the TSJ and thanked 
the Ambassador for continued Embassy assistance with 
Venezuela,s justice sector reform efforts.  Rincon noted the 
success of a recent Embassy-sponsored program in which 
several Venezuelan judges and a Supreme Court Justice 
traveled to the United States.  Rincon said he admired the 
manner in which the U.S. justice system allowed for 
cooperation between levels of authority, for example between 
the military courts and the civil police. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
USG Interest in Signature Verification Process 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.    (C) DAS DeShazo told Rincon he had returned to 
Venezuela to express USG support for a constitutional, 
electoral, democratic, and peaceful solution to Venezuela,s 
political impasse, of which the current process of 
verification of signatures by the CNE is the key element. 
DeShazo underscored noted that the USG strongly supports the 
efforts ofthe Carter Center and the Organization of American 
States (OAS) to monitor the signature verification process. 
He further emphasized the need to ensure that the CNE be able 
to operate in an atmosphere of transparency and autonomy, 
free from interference. 
 
5.    (C) Rincon said the constitution assigns 
responsibilities to the CNE, but the TSJ is charged with 
ensuring a legal framework.  The verification process, said 
Rincon, involves certifying signature sheets (planillas) and 
tally sheets (actas).  Rincon said the verification task is 
squarely in the hands of the five CNE directors, and they 
will be responsible for verifying the signatures to get to a 
recall referendum for Chavez, as well as verifying signatures 
for recalling various legislators.  Any citizen could of 
course appeal any CNE decision to the TSJ, but he expected 
appeals to be disposed of rapidly. 
 
6.    (C) The Ambassador asked whether authentic signatures 
would be disallowed for technical reasons if, for example, a 
planilla was not properly accounted for in the corresponding 
acta. if a certification is slightly different from the 
CNE,s registration lists.  Rincon responded that everything 
would be certified by the CNE and that such issues would 
certainly depend on the rules that body established.  The 
TSJ\'s Electoral and Constitutional Chambers, he said, could 
 
SIPDIS 
 
 
not decide such things beforehand and making statements on 
the verification process from the TSJ may be 
counterproductive.  Rincon offered an example of Chavez 
supporters or the president himself making \"undiplomatic\" 
remarks about the Ambassador, President Bush or National 
Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.  Rincon noted that 
responding to Chavez is not always wise.  So it is, he said, 
with the current CNE process.  If the signatures are 
verified, that will open a road to a recall referendum. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
FEDECAMERAS Wilted, Jimmy Carter Inspiring 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7.    (C) Rincon responded to several questions by the DAS 
and the Ambassador about current players in the Venezuelan 
electoral and political scene.  While the press and Chavez 
had problems, the press, said Rincon, was a good institution. 
 Rincon said the power of FEDECAMERAS, a business collective 
and a coordinator of the crippling national strike in 
December 2002-February 2003, had now largely disappeared. 
 
8.    (C) Rincon recalled that during the attempted coup in 
April 2002, a million people were in the street, creating a 
very \"dangerous moment\" and an environment where people were 
being killed and little hope existed for an electoral 
solution.  Rincon noted that former President Jimmy Carter 
called on Venezuelans to be peaceful and that was 
instrumental in getting the parties to settle down and 
proceed towards a peaceful solution. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Cabrera Walks in, Rincon Changes Topic 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9.    (C) Late in the conversation, Justice Jesus Cabrera, 
vice president of the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, joined 
the meeting.  When Cabrera entered, Rincon changed the topic 
to the current jockeying to change the internal rules of the 
National Assembly and recall politics.  Rincon said Chavez 
supporters are seeking to solidify their control of the 
National Assembly to ensure they retain some power if Chavez 
falls.  He noted that the opposition was at a disadvantage 
because Chavez had been running for office for five years, 
and the opposition still has no single candidate to challenge 
him. 
 
------------------------------------- 
TSJ Constitutional VP Pledges No Bias 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.   (C) Cabrera said the USG should be assured that there 
will be no advantage given to either Chavez or to his 
opponents if the Court is asked to review issues regarding a 
recall referendum.  Nevertheless, he noted that Chavez 
supporters obviously did not participate in the signature 
drive to remove the president and therefore would most likely 
not come before the court.  (Note: Cabrera ignored the 
possibility that the Court may review issues stemming from 
the several signature petitions to recall opposition 
legislators brought by Chavez supporters.)  Without 
prompting, Cabrera emphatically denied reports that the TSJ\'s 
Constitutional Chamber is controlled by Chavez, stating 
decidedly, \"our decisions will not be political.\" 
 
11.   (C) Rincon added that the opposition should have faith 
in the TSJ,s Constitutional Chamber, noting it was that 
chamber that ruled against Chavez in the treason case brought 
against military officers following the April 2002 coup 
attempt.  He repeated a line from his speech at the opening 
of the TSJ\'s decision:  \"our party is democracy.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
Rincon Warns CNE in Public Statement 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.   (U) Following his meeting with DAS DeShazo and the 
Ambassador, Rincon took to the airwaves to remind the CNE to 
act prudently.  Speaking with the press, the Chief Justice 
said the CNE must do everything possible to fulfill its 
 
 
responsibility to follow the rules it had established to 
verify signatures in the several petitions for recall 
referenda, and it must do so in the time required.  Rincon 
softened his remarks by saying he was confident the CNE would 
act as requested.  Additionally, he pledged that the TSJ 
would remain vigilant to ensure the \"people\'s will\" was 
respected. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
13.   (C) Rincon presides over a court split evenly along 
ideological lines.  Rincon is regarded as a centrist leaning 
toward Chavez, but is not loved by Chavez supporters or the 
opposition.  The rumor mill has it that once the Assembly 
increases the number of TSJ magistrates from 20 to 30, Chavez 
will name Rincon, a devout Catholic, to be ambassador to the 
Vatican.  Rincon\'s public statement immediately following his 
meeting with DAS DeShazo sends a double message.  First, it 
shows an interest in encouraging the CNE to press through 
with its signature verification for a possible recall. 
Second, it shows a willingness to support the USG and the 
international community by immediately translating privately 
communicated concerns into public statements.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On January 22, WHA DAS Peter DeShazo and Ambassador 
met with Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton.  In addition to the 
Venezuelan recall referendum process, they discussed: 
DeShazo\'s speech to the Venezuelan American Chamber of 
Commerce, recent comments by USG officials regarding 
Venezuela, GOV-Cuban relations, GOV relations with FARC, the 
two Venezuelan National Guard lieutenants who have requested 
asylum in the US, and the Inter-American Convention Against 
Terrorism.  Chaderton assured DeShazo that a constitutional 
process would be followed with the referendum and provided 
standard GOV responses on other issues.  Chaderton was 
accompanied by MFA Chief of Staff Rene Arreaza and US Deskoff 
Rebeca Guevara; DeShazo by the Ambassador and Poloff.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
The Big Issue - The Referendum 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) DeShazo noted that there is great interest in 
Washington in the referendum process.  Washington is 
following the verification process closely and understands 
that the CNE is proceeding well in this technical period. 
Chaderton immediately made reference to the international 
observers and their constructive role.  DeShazo agreed with 
Chaderton, and said that a peaceful, constitutional outcome 
through the implementation of OAS resolution 833 is the goal 
of the USG and the international community.  Chaderton 
responded that a constitutional process will be followed, 
saying that if enough signatures were collected, there will 
be a referendum. 
 
---------------------------------- 
More GOV Reactions to USG Comments 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Weaved into the discussion on the referendum, 
Chaderton managed to make reference to USG comments by 
President Bush, the Secretary, Special Envoy Otto Reich, the 
Deputy Department Spokesman, WHA A/S Roger Noriega, and 
National Security Advisor Rice.  Chaderton found Bush to be 
\"well spoken\" at the Monterrey Summit and also agreed with 
the basic points that Secretary Powell has made regarding the 
referendum.  Chaderton called comments by Reich 
inappropriate.  He acknowledged that President Chavez\'s 
comments about Rice were \"very tough,\" but offered no apology 
(see reftel).  After listing her academic achievements, 
Chaderton asserted that Rice does not understand the 
situation in Venezuela.  Chaderton also said that what 
worries the GOV is that USG comments are biased toward the 
opposition.  DeShazo rejected Chavez\'s comments about Dr. 
Rice as an inappropriate personal attack. 
 
------------ 
Other Issues 
------------ 
 
4. (C) VenAmCham speech - Early in the meeting, Chaderton 
said the VenAmCham is becoming a politicized, Anti-Chavez 
organization, reserving special venom for the outgoing 
Venamcham President Andres Mata, owner of the Caracas 
newspaper \"El Universal.\"  DeShazo noted his personal 
friendship with Mata and support for Venamcham. 
 
5. (C) GOV-FARC relations - DeShazo repeated the comments he 
made to Chaderton in December about the need for Venezuela to 
be vigilant against terrorism, especially regarding the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Chaderton 
indicated that the GOV relationship with Colombia was 
 
delicate.  In addition, he referenced the recent killing of 7 
GOV National Guard members allegedly by Colombian 
paramilitary group AUC. 
 
6. (C) GOV-GOC relations - Responding to DeShazo\'s expression 
of USG concern about GOV-Cuban relations, which he had also 
raised with Chaderton in December, the Foreign Minister 
complained that US policy caters to the Cuban-American 
community in Miami and lamented that the embargo harms the 
Cuban people. He defended the presence of Cuban doctors in 
Venezuela, claiming that other countries (Guatemala) allow 
them in without US complaint. 
 
7. (C) GOV National Guard asylees - Chaderton broached the 
issue of the two GOV National Guard lieutenants, who the GOV 
claims are linked to two embassy bombings, seeking asylum in 
the U.S.  DeShazo indicated that there are legal processes 
that must be followed and assured Chaderton that any decision 
on extradition would be in keeping with pertinent legal 
requirements and procedures. 
 
8. (C) Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism (IACT) - 
Chaderton inquired about the status of the IACT in the USG. 
DeShazo explained that it is before the Senate.  He 
emphasized the administration\'s interest in ratification and 
the importance of coordinated action against terrorism in the 
Americas. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) In general, Chaderton appeared to be following strict 
guidelines on talking points, particularly when inquiring 
about the GOV National Guard officials seeking asylum in the 
U.S. and in defending Chavez\'s comments about USG officials. 
He was much harsher in his comments than was VP Rangel in the 
subsequent meeting.

SUBJECT: DAS DESHAZO\'S MEETING WITH G-5 OPPOSTION LEADERS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On January 22, WHA DAS Peter DeShazo gave opposition 
leaders (4 of 5 of the members of the so-called G-5) a 
positive assessment of his meetings earlier in the day with 
officials from the OAS, Carter Center, and UNDP, and of their 
ability to monitor the signature verification process in the 
CNE. GOV officials, he said, had expressed their commitment 
to respect the decisions of the CNE. He stressed the 
international attention focused on Venezuela, and his belief 
that the CNE would act as a fair arbiter of the referendum 
process. The leaders of the G-5 all stressed their lack of 
confidence in the Government, and their fear that the CNE was 
subject to pressures and might favor the government by either 
openly disallowing the signatures, or delaying a recall until 
after August, when the Vice President would serve out the 
President\'s term. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador hosted a dinner for DAS DeShazo with 
Julio Borges (Primero Justicia), Juan Fernandez (Gente de 
Petroleo), Henry Ramos Allup (Accion Democratica) and Enrique 
Salas Romer (Proyecto Venezuela) represented the G-5. Enrique 
Mendoza (COPEI) had accepted but did not attend. Also present 
were the Political Counselor, the Public Affairs Officer, and 
EmbOff (notetaker). 
 
------------------------------------ 
AD Concerned About National Assembly 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Henry Ramos Allup spoke first of the opposition\'s deep 
concern about the functioning of the National Assembly and 
the push for rules changes. He feared that the changes would 
be used to approve a far-reaching package of legislation, 
such as the reform of the Supreme Court, over the objections 
of the opposition. The TSJ law, Ramos said, is the most 
important threat to the opposition, since it would give the 
government almost complete control over the interpretation of 
the Constitution, and the governing body of the judiciary. 
Ramos stressed changes in Accion Democratica, from opening up 
its usually closed internal governing meetings to the press, 
and instituting a far reaching policy of alliances. He 
proposed that polls should be taken prior to the electoral 
campaigns for governorships, and all parties agree to back 
the candidate with the best chance to win. Enrique Salas 
Romer pointed out that this eliminated the campaign\'s ability 
to develop new candidates. Ramos stressed the need for the 
opposition to remain united even after the referendum, to win 
elections. 
 
4. (C) Ramos and Salas played down various polls including 
one showing up to 60 percent support for President Chavez in 
a recall referendum. Salas attributed President Chavez\' 
tendency rise in the polls at Christmas to lavish spending, 
and seasonal optimism. He predicted it would then fall 
sharply afterwards. Both expressed confidence that Chavez 
would lose the referendum. 
 
--- 
CNE 
--- 
 
5. (C) DeShazo told the leaders he was pleased to see the 
technical competency of the OAS observation team working at 
the CNE, and their own confidence in their ability to closely 
monitor the verification of the signatures collected for the 
referendum drives. He stressed the importance of the OAS in 
the process, and his optimism that they would guarantee the 
fairness of the process. He stressed the interest in 
Washington, among both business and government leaders, in 
the resolution of the political crisis in Venezuela, and that 
the message he and the USG have conveyed to the GOV is that 
the democratic process represented by a transparent and fair 
referendum campaign must be respected.  VP Jose Vicente 
Rangel and FM Roy Chaderton had given him assurances that the 
government would respect the decision of the CNE. He also 
 
mentioned TSJ Chief Justice Ivan Rincon\'s optimism and 
confidence in his institution\'s ability to fulfill its role 
in the process. 
 
6. (C) The four opposition leaders stressed their lack of 
confidence in the GOV, and their fear that it was pressuring 
the CNE. The delays in the verification of the signatures 
were cited as evidence that the CNE is not acting in good 
faith. Borges pointed out that not one signature had yet been 
verified, and that the stated goal of finishing in 22 days 
was impossible.  All the leaders acknowledged 70 percent 
public trust in CNE, but they did not share it. When asked by 
the Ambassador what they wanted to achieve from President 
Carter\'s visit, they all stressed \"fair play.\" 
 
7. (C) Ramos related VP Rangel\'s assertion that the 
opposition had not gathered more than 1 million signatures 
with the exhortation immediately afterwards that everyone had 
to accept the CNE\'s decision. He found this a clear sign of 
government pressure on the CNE, or even a sign of a deal. 
Ramos charged that the collection of signatures had not been 
fair, being stacked against the opposition with rule changes 
and military pressure.  Ramos talked of his fear that the CNE 
would try to prove its independence by disallowing some of 
the pro-government parties signatures against opposition 
deputies, and then disallow the recall referendum on the 
President. He pushed hard several times for a plan under 
which the opposition would accept all the signatures against 
their deputies, including 9 from Ramos\' AD, and go right to 
the recall elections.  This would put pressure on the 
government to do the same, and eliminate the opportunity for 
the CNE to use the recall referendums against deputies as 
legitimating for its throwing out the presidential 
referendum. 
 
8. (C) Salas responded strongly to DAS DeShazo\'s comment that 
the opposition parties\' negative sniping at the CNE was 
perceived as counterproductive and that they were seen as 
lacking a unified, positive message. Salas declared that the 
opposition was responsible for making the CNE an acceptable 
arbiter, despite it having a pro-government majority, and 
they had every right to want to them to be closely watched, 
and reminded of their responsibilities. He said the CNE had 
not earned its credibility, but been given it. 
 
9. (C) Borges also stressed the delays of the CNE in 
verifying the signatures, and asked DAS DeShazo if it would 
be acceptable to the international community if the delays of 
the CNE led to the recall referendum taking place after 
August, when the VP would substitute a defeated Chavez, 
rather than a popularly elected leader. He suggested this 
might be the CNE\'s intention in drawing out the verification 
process. DAS DeShazo responded that there was a limit, though 
not quantified, as to how much delay was acceptable, and that 
the circumstances and reasons for any delay would be a factor 
in determining the response of the international community. 
He stressed that both the GOV and CNE have pledged that the 
process will be transparent and fair and that the USG regards 
these as markers upon which to judge results.  Borges 
stressed that the constant addition of new rules to a 
signature verification process added uncertainty to the 
process. 
 
10. (C) Juan Fernandez stressed the tremendous distrust 
between the two sides, and the need to complete actions 
according to a pre-established timetable to build trust. He 
also suggested an agreement between the sides not to run to 
the courts to contest any outcome, as this would generate 
further tension. The Ambassador pointed out that a 
constitutional right was involved, but Fernandez suggested 
that the situation required some sort of corporative 
agreement between the sides to protect the peace. He also 
suggested Carter to help set up a direct line of 
communication between the two sides to help bring down 
tension. 
 
11.  (C) In a sustained aside conversation with AD leader 
Henry Ramos, DeShazo opined that for the opposition to be 
effective, it needed to reach out to public opinion with a 
coordinated, coherent, and positive public message, put 
 
forward a program or plan of action, and reach out not only 
to oppositionists but also to independents and chavistas.  He 
noted that he was hearing in many circles that opposition 
carping at the CNE at this early stage in the verification 
process was counterproductive.  Ramos agreed, offering strong 
criticism of the disunity of the opposition and its public 
affairs and seconding the need to reach agreement soonest on 
coordinating action and designing a platform. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) The leaders welcomed this opportunity to meet with 
DAS DeShazo. The concern about CNE foot-dragging is the 
preponderant theme for the opposition.  They discount that 
pressuring the CNE could backfire and will no doubt continue 
to make their views known. The marches January 23 are part of 
the strategy. DeShazo\'s message was unmistakable throughout 
his visit: support for the CNE -- and the important OAS and 
Carter Center observation -- as the way to achieve the OAS 
resolution\'s call for a democratic, peaceful, constitutional, 
and electoral solution. The G-5 bristled at the implied 
criticism of their carping, but took the message on board. 
 
13. (U) DAS DeShazo reviewed this message.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The verification process of the signatures in support 
of recall votes against President Hugo Chavez and various 
National Assembly deputies proceeds at a snail\'s pace at the 
National Electoral Council (CNE).  The CNE board initially 
proposed restricting the access of international observers to 
parts of the verification process, but relented when the OAS 
mission threatened to withdraw from the process.  The 
signatures for the presidential recall are still in the 
physical verification stage.  Allegations persist of the 
CNE\'s prejudice against the signatures collected against 
President Chavez.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CNE Director Zamora Criticizes CNE 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) Vice President 
Ezequiel Zamora, who is aligned with the opposition, alleged 
publicly on January 24 that certain CNE workers were engaged 
in \"sabotage\" of the signature forms presented by the 
opposition in support of a recall referendum against 
President Hugo Chavez, forms that are now in the physical 
verification stage in the process (prior to transcription). 
Zamora claimed that the referral rate of questionable 
signature forms to the Superior Technical Committee were 
unusually high compared to that of the pro-GOV signature 
drive against opposition National Assembly deputies.  Zamora 
blamed the head of the informatics section, Leonardo 
Hernandez, for the disparate treatment.  (Note:  The Superior 
Technical Committee, in charge of adjudicating questionable 
signatures, will review referred forms and determine whether 
the forms can be forwarded to the transcription process, 
where individual signatures are checked.  The higher rate of 
referral could result in up to 116,000 signature forms for 
the committee to review.  End note.) 
 
3. (C) OAS observer mission official Edgardo Reis confirmed 
to poloff on January 27 that the referral rate for the 
presidential signature forms was 40 percent, a significant 
rise from the pro-GOV\'s rate of about four percent.  Reis 
said the informatics section ordered a change in criteria for 
the physical verification stage once the review of 
presidential forms began.  Reis opined that the move was not 
illegal, but would translate into a heavy burden for the 
Superior Technical Committee.  Reis commented that CNE 
workers are performing adequately, but added that absenteeism 
of the temporary workers in the physical inspection and 
transcription stages averaged between 15 and 20 percent. 
 
----------------------- 
OAS Threatens a Walkout 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) Reis showed poloff an internal CNE memo dated January 
14 ordering the CNE\'s counsel to draft a resolution that 
limited observation of the verification process to the 
physical inspection and transcription steps.  Only CNE 
officials would be permitted access to the computer check, 
quality control, and Superior Technical Committee stages, 
according to the memo.  Learning of the proposal, OAS 
officials complained that imposing such restrictions would 
fatally undermine the observer mission.  Reis said the OAS 
mission, acting on instructions from OAS SYG Gaviria, told 
CNE officials that if observers were not granted necessary 
access, the mission would withdraw from the process.  Reis 
said the pro-opposition CNE Directors Zamora and Sobella 
Mejias had threatened to resign over the decision as well. 
 
5. (C) OAS mission leader Fernando Jaramillo requested 
formally on January 16 that the CNE include international 
observers in the quality control and committee review stages. 
 
 Reis said that Jaramillo and he expressed their concerns to 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, who promised to speak to 
CNE officials about it.  Reis said he thought everything was 
smoothed out until on January 26, when Pro-Chavez Deputy 
Nicolas Maduro complained that the OAS was trying to become 
\"the sixth member of the CNE board.\"  (Note:  The political 
proponents of each signature drive are also allowed observers 
in the process.  The proposal to limit observer access 
includes them as well.  End note.) 
 
6. (C) Reis admitted that observer presence in all stages of 
the process is not necessary in a technical sense so long as 
they are allowed to cull periodic samples from the rejected 
signatures.  He noted, however, the political value of having 
OAS observers covering multiple areas within the CNE.  Asked 
whether the CNE would fulfill the February 13 deadline, Reis 
said that it can, but probably would not at this pace.  He 
expressed concern over keeping the OAS team in place for more 
than one week beyond the deadline, noting limitations in 
financing. 
 
----------------------- 
CNE Apparently Gives In 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) CNE President Francisco Carrasquero tried to settle 
the issue on January 27 by announcing that the international 
observers would be given \"widened\" access in order to assure 
total transparency.  Carrasquero said the CNE would consult 
with the OAS and Carter Center to work out the parameters of 
their participation in stages in question.  Carrasquero 
quelled rumors of discord within the CNE, noting that 
relations among the five rectors are cordial.  He announced 
that the CNE may let slip the February 13 deadline, adding 
that the work would be done by the end of February.  (Note: 
Former President Carter told the press January 27 that he 
understood the CNE would finish no later than March 1.  End 
note.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Despite the conflict over access, the OAS mission 
seems to have maintained good relations with the CNE.  OAS 
(and Carter Center) observer presence is crucial to the CNE\'s 
success.  We were concerned by the CNE\'s move to limit 
observation and by reports of prejudiced treatment of the 
presidential recall signatures, and so DAS DeShazo\'s message 
to CNE President Carrasquero on January 22 was timely.  The 
political pressure against the CNE -- internal and external 
-- is immense and will only increase as the verification 
process proceeds.  However, while the CNE process is neither 
graceful nor efficient, it is inching forward.  The January 
25-27 Carter visit contributed considerably to increasing CNE 
openness to the OAS and Carter Center, and to statements by 
President Chavez that he would respect whatever the CNE 
decided.  Our message should be of continued support for the 
CNE as arbiter of the process -- so long as there is 
international observation and the process is transparent.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) From January 25-27, former President Jimmy Carter 
visited Venezuela to observe the referendum process and meet 
with the National Election Commission (CNE), Organization of 
American States, the National Assembly (AN), the Supreme 
Court, the Group of Friend\'s ambassadors, business leaders, 
public and private media, opposition leaders, and President 
Chavez.  In press remarks, Carter said that he observed no 
evidence of fraud in the referendum process, and that the GOV 
did not make any allegations of \"megafraud.\"  He also asked 
the private media to respect the CNE.  Carter requested, and 
obtained, CNE approval to extend OAS/Carter Center 
observation to critical parts of the CNE signature 
verification process.  Carter indicated that he thought the 
CNE was working hard, but it would not meet its 30-day 
deadline (February 13) to verify the signatures, likely 
reporting its results by March 1.  Carter urged all parties 
to accept the results of a constitutional, legal, transparent 
CNE decision.  Chavez told Carter that he would respect any 
decision made by the CNE.  Carter, however, could not obtain 
the same commitment from all opposition leaders.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Carter\'s Schedule 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) Carter arrived in Caracas on January 25 and the 
Ambassador accompanied him from the airport.  Later, Carter 
had dinner with Venezuelan business leaders.  On January 26, 
Carter met with the TSJ, AN deputies from opposition and 
pro-government parties, CNE leaders, opposition leaders, 
Carter Center personnel, OAS representatives, and President 
Chavez.  The Ambassador attended a dinner with the Group of 
Friends\' ambassadors and Carter.  At dinner, Carter noted the 
CNE\'s hard work, but showed concern that the CNE is applying 
more stringent revision of the signatures for the 
presidential referendum than for the deputies.  He also said 
the CNE assured him that the presidential recall referendum 
would not be delayed past August 19.  On January 27, Carter 
met again with Chavez and met with more opposition leaders. 
Carter held a press conference in the afternoon. 
 
-------------------------- 
Accepting the CNE Decision 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (U) At the press conference, Carter stressed the need for 
all parties to accept the decision of the CNE if the process 
is considered constitutional, legal, and transparent.  Carter 
said that he received full access to the CNE.  He also said 
that the CNE has ensured international observers\' access to 
all stages of the verification process.  Contrary to 
statements by Chavez that Carter was surprised by evidence of 
fraud by the opposition, Carter said that he was not/not 
surprised by anything he saw.  He said that Chavez presented 
two or three actas (tally sheets) with errors.  However, 
Carter emphasized, \"I have not seen any evidence of fraud.\" 
To promote further transparency, Carter encouraged all five 
CNE leaders to give updates through daily press conferences. 
Pointing to the CNE\'s immense amount of work, Carter thought 
that the CNE would announce a decision regarding the validity 
of the signatures by March 1, missing the 30-day deadline of 
February 13. 
 
4. (U) Chavez said publicly that he had told Carter that he 
wants the referendum process to be \"completely transparent\" 
and that the government will accept any decision made by the 
CNE.  Meeting with Carter twice, Chavez offered support for 
complete access to the referendum process for Carter and 
international observers, saying that he has no problem with 
the OAS and Carter Center observing the entire referendum 
 
 
process.  Carter indicated that there is a difference of 
opinion within the opposition regarding the acceptance of any 
CNE decision.  Some opposition leaders assured him that they 
would accept any CNE decision, but others did not. 
Regardless of the CNE\'s decision, Carter pledged his personal 
and the Carter Center,s support to Venezuela. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Carter\'s visit was welcome and timely, coming at a 
period of tension as the CNE struggles to complete its 
mandate.  Carter is clearly respected by all parties, who 
view him as impartial and honest.  His comments about not 
seeing fraud (on either side) helped refocus the CNE on its 
overwhelming task of verifying millions of signatures. 
Specific accomplishments were Chavez\'s public message that he 
would respect the CNE,s decision on the referendum; an 
absence of GOV/Chavista public claims of \"megafraud,\" more 
private media tolerance/respect for the CNE; and the CNE\'s 
decision to allow wider OAS/Carter Center observation of the 
signature verification process.  Where Carter came up a 
little short was with the opposition, which at least as a 
group was unwilling to respect any CNE decision that was 
\"constitutional, legal, and transparent.\"

interested in a democratic and electoral process, supports 
the efforts of  the Carter Center and the Organization of 
American States (OAS) to monitor the signature verification

will not be biased in any decisions regarding a referendum. 
Following the meeting, Rincon publicly reminded the CNE to 
verify signatures for recall referenda responsibly and 
pledged the TSJ would remain vigilant.  Rincon\'s public

privately communicated USG concerns into public statements. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Rincon Praises Embassy Support for Judicial Reform 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (C) On January 22, 2004, WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Peter DeShazo, the Ambassador, and PD Officer met with 
Justice Ivan Rincon, the President of Venezuela\'s Supreme 
Court of Justice (TSJ).  Justice Jesus Cabrera, also a member 
of the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, joined the meeting  as 
it was drawing to a close. 
 
3. (C) Rincon welcomed DAS DeShazo to the TSJ and thanked 
the Ambassador for continued Embassy assistance with 
Venezuela\'s justice sector reform efforts.  Rincon noted the 
success of a recent Embassy-sponsored program in which 
several Venezuelan judges and a Supreme Court Justice 
traveled to the United States.  Rincon said he admired the 
manner in which the US justice system allowed for cooperation 
between levels of authority, for example between the military 
courts and the civil police. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
USG Interest in Signature Verification Process 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (C) DAS DeShazo told Rincon he had returned to 
Venezuela to express USG support for a constitutional, 
electoral, democratic, and peaceful solution to Venezuela\'s 
political impasse, of which the current process of 
verification of signatures by the CNE is the key element. 
DeShazo underscored that the USG strongly supports the 
efforts of the Carter Center and the Organization of American 
States (OAS) to monitor the signature verification process. 
He further emphasized the need to ensure that the CNE be able 
to operate in an atmosphere of transparency and autonomy, 
free from interference. 
 
5. (C) Rincon said the constitution assigns 
responsibilities to the CNE, but the TSJ is charged with 
ensuring a legal framework.  The verification process, said 
Rincon, involves certifying signature forms (planillas) and 
tally sheets (actas).  Rincon said the verification task is 
squarely in the hands of the five CNE directors, and they 
will be responsible for verifying the signatures to get to a 
recall referendum for Chavez, as well as verifying signatures 
for recalling various legislators.  Any citizen could of 
course appeal any CNE decision to the TSJ, but he expected 
appeals to be decided rapidly. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador asked whether authentic signatures 
would be disallowed for technical reasons if, for example, a 
signature form was not properly accounted for in the 
corresponding tally sheet. Rincon responded that everything 
would be certified by the CNE and that such issues would 
certainly depend on the rules that body established.  The 
TSJ,s Electoral and Constitutional Chambers, he said, could 
 
SIPDIS 
not decide such things beforehand and making statements on 
the verification process from the TSJ may be 
 
counterproductive.  Rincon offered an example of Chavez 
supporters or the president himself making undiplomatic 
remarks about the Ambassador, President Bush or National 
Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.  Rincon noted that 
responding to Chavez is not always wise.  So it is, he said, 
with the current CNE process.  If the signatures are 
verified, that will open a road to a recall referendum. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
FEDECAMERAS Wilted, Jimmy Carter Inspiring 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Rincon responded to several questions by the DAS 
and the Ambassador about current players in the Venezuelan 
electoral and political scene.  While the press and Chavez 
had problems, the press, said Rincon, was a good institution. 
 Rincon said the power of FEDECAMERAS, a business collective 
and a coordinator of the crippling national strike in 
December 2002-February 2003, had now largely disappeared. 
 
8. (C) Rincon recalled that during the attempted coup in 
April 2002, a million people were in the street, creating a 
very \"dangerous moment\" and an environment where people were 
being killed and little hope existed for an electoral 
solution.  Rincon noted that former President Jimmy Carter 
called on Venezuelans to be peaceful and that was 
instrumental in getting the parties to settle down and 
proceed towards a peaceful solution. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Cabrera Walks in, Rincon Changes Topic 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Late in the conversation, Justice Jesus Cabrera, 
vice president of the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, joined 
the meeting.  When Cabrera entered, Rincon changed the topic 
to the current jockeying to change the internal rules of the 
National Assembly and recall politics.  Rincon said Chavez 
supporters are seeking to solidify their control of the 
National Assembly to ensure they retain some power if Chavez 
falls.  He noted that the opposition was at a disadvantage 
because Chavez had been running for office for five years and 
the opposition still has no single candidate to challenge 
him. 
 
------------------------------------- 
TSJ Constitutional VP Pledges No Bias 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Cabrera said the USG should be assured that there 
will be no advantage given to either Chavez or to his 
opponents if the Court is asked to review issues regarding a 
recall referendum.  Nevertheless, he noted that Chavez 
supporters obviously did not participate in the signature 
drive to remove the president and therefore would most likely 
not come before the court.  (Note: Cabrera ignored the 
possibility that the Court may review issues stemming from 
the several signature petitions to recall opposition 
legislators brought by Chavez supporters.)  Without 
prompting, Cabrera emphatically denied reports that the 
TSJ,s Constitutional Chamber is controlled by Chavez, 
 
SIPDIS 
stating decidedly, \"our decisions will not be political.\" 
 
11. (C) Rincon added that the opposition should have faith 
in the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, noting it was that 
chamber that ruled against Chavez in the treason case brought 
against military officers following the April 2002 coup 
attempt.  He repeated a line from his speech at the opening 
of the TSJ\'s decision:  \"Our party is democracy.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
Rincon Warns CNE in Public Statement 
------------------------------------ 
 
12. (U) Following his meeting with DAS DeShazo and the 
Ambassador, Rincon took to the airwaves to remind the CNE to 
act prudently.  Speaking with the press, the Chief Justice 
said the CNE must do everything possible to fulfill its 
responsibility to follow the rules it had established to 
verify signatures in the several petitions for recall 
 
referenda, and it must do so in the time required.  Rincon 
softened his remarks by saying he was confident the CNE would 
act as requested.  Additionally, he pledged that the TSJ 
would remain vigilant to ensure the \"people\'s will\" was 
respected. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) Rincon presides over a court split evenly along 
ideological lines.  Rincon is regarded as a centrist leaning 
toward Chavez, but is not loved by Chavez supporters or the 
opposition.  The rumor mill has it that once the Assembly 
increases the number of TSJ magistrates from 20 to 30, Chavez 
will name Rincon, a devout Catholic, to be ambassador to the 
Vatican.  Rincon\'s public statement immediately following his 
meeting with DAS DeShazo sends a double message.  First, it 
shows an interest in encouraging the CNE to press through 
with its signature verification for a possible recall. 
Second, it shows a willingness to support the USG and the 
international community by immediately translating privately 
communicated concerns into public statements. 
 
14. (U) DAS DeShazo reviewed this message.

SUBJECT: PRIVATE SECTOR OIL PRODUCTION 
 
1.  Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) A document prepared following a December luncheon in 
which private sector company representatives shared average 
monthly production numbers for both oil and gas production 
from their fields has given us a better idea of non-PDVSA oil 
production in Venezuela.  According to this document, 
December production by the private sector totaled 963,629 
b/d.  This figure is then broken down to show 503,000 b/d of 
production by the four extra heavy crude projects and 460,629 
b/d from the various Operating Agreements.  These numbers 
support the 1 million b/d figure that is generally cited as 
the assessment of private sector production.  Private sector 
production is ever more important as we believe it likely 
that PDVSA\'s own production will continue to decline slowly. 
This information may give us a basis on which to calculate 
the extent to which the private sector can ramp up production 
in 2004.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (SBU) The difficulty of assessing Venezuelan oil 
production (besides misstatements about the extent of PDVSA\'s 
own production by GOV authorities) is increased by the number 
and complexity of the business structures under which the 
private sector, both foreign and domestic, operates.  There 
are currently 32 active \"Operating Agreements\" or 
\"convenios,\" granted in three investment \"rounds\" in the 
1990\'s, under which a company provides financial resources, 
infrastructure, operational skills and technology and is paid 
by PDVSA on a fee-per-barrel-produced basis. 
 
3. (U) Under another structure, the so-called \"Strategic 
Associations,\" four projects were developed to extract the 
extra heavy crude of the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt and then 
convert it into synthetic crudes for the international 
market.  Hamaca, the joint venture between ConocoPhillips, 
ChevronTexaco and PDVSA, and the fourth and last of these 
projects, is already producing heavy crude.  Its upgrader is 
expected to come on line in the latter part of 2004. 
 
4. (U) This multiplicity of projects and fields has made it 
difficult to assess the actual production by private oil 
companies, which has become increasingly important as 
PDVSA,s own production is believed to be dropping.  (Note: 
This will become more complicated in 2005 when the first 
production is expected from a field developed under a \"Risk 
Exploration Agreement\" under which private companies took on 
exploration risks in assigned fields.  End Note)  The private 
sector has generally been credited with the production of 
approximately a million barrels of oil per day, with both the 
Strategic Associations and the convenios each  believed to be 
contributing about half. 
 
----------------------------- 
AND THE NUMBER SEEMS TO BE... 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Econoff recently received a document prepared 
following a producers luncheon in December in which the 
company representatives present gave average monthly 
production numbers for both oil and gas production from their 
fields as well as a few operational notes.  That information, 
covering most but not all of the Operating Agreements, is 
reproduced in para. 8 below. 
 
6. (SBU) According to the document, December production by 
non-PDVSA producers was as follows: 
 
Operating Agreements Production: 
 
-- Eastern Venezuela  207,511 b/d 
-- Western Venezuela  253,118 b/d 
 
Total                 460,629 b/d 
 
Strategic Association Production: 
 
-- Cerro Negro        121,000 b/d 
-- Hamaca              82,000 b/d 
-- Petrozuata         120,000 b/d (est.) 
-- Sincor             180,000 b/d 
 
Total                 503,000 b/d 
 
GRAND TOTAL           963,629 b/d 
 
As noted above, all the Operating Agreements were not 
included in this document.  South Monagas, a Round One block 
operated by Benton-Vinccler, produces about 22,000 b/d. 
Falcon East and West are small Round Two blocks operated 
respectively by Vinccler and Samson. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Most industry analysts believe PDVSA\'s own 
production will continue to decline in 2004 unless a serious 
investment and work program is implemented.  In that case, 
private sector production is ever more important.  There are 
limits, however, to the extent to which it can be increased. 
For instance, on January 28 Joaquin Moreno, President of 
Shell de Venezuela, informed econoff that production at 
Shell\'s Urdaneta West field has increased to 54,000 b/d and 
is \"on its way to 60,000.\"  When asked if production would be 
60,000 by year end, he responded that it would probably be 
only 55,000-56,000 b/d at the end of 2004 \"because of the 
difficulties of the reservoir.\"  Urdaneta West produces a 
desirable crude and Shell has been requested by PDVSA to 
produce as much as it can.  Other fields produce less 
desirable crudes and their operators have received no such 
requests.  There are also technical constraints such as 
pipeline and terminal capacity.   Finally, the private sector 
production, and particularly that from the extra heavy crude 
projects, does not produce the same revenue stream for the 
GOV as PDVSA\'s own production.  In sum, the private sector is 
not likely to provide a magic bullet to stabilize Venezuela\'s 
production levels, at least in the short term.  We hope, 
however, to use this information as the basis on which to 
calculate the extent to which the private sector may be able 
to increase its production in 2004.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ CARRIES BOLIVIA\'S WATER IN CHILE SEA SCUFFLE 
 
 
Classified By: Mark Wells, Acting Political Counselor, 
 for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Three months ago President Hugo Chavez began a 
rhetorical offensive in support of Bolivia\'s claim to its 
historic Pacific coastline, seized by Chile in 1879. 
Chavez\'s campaign has made international headlines, and 
resulted in Venezuela and Chile recalling their ambassadors 
for consultations.  Chavez has incorporated the Bolivian sea 
claim into his self-styled Simon Bolivar mythology, 
frequently portraying the Chileans as oligarchs.  MFA 
officials claim everything is fine under the surface and hope 
for relations to normalize.  Meddling in Bolivia\'s sea claim 
is a win-win for Chavez as a \"Bolivarian\" foreign policy 
issue, a distraction from his domestic political problems, 
and a helping hand to Bolivian ally Evo Morales.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Plowing Toward the Sea 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez began in October to press 
publicly for Bolivia to regain sovereign access to the 
Pacific coast, land which Bolivia lost to Chile in 1879 
during the War of the Pacific.  In several public comments 
Chavez spoke of his dream of swimming in \"a Bolivian beach.\" 
He subsequently elaborated on the theme by declaring that 
that Simon Bolivar, liberator of Bolivia and Venezuela, had 
bestowed access to the sea on the Bolivians when drawing the 
map of Gran Colombia during the independence era.  But, 
Chavez adds, the \"Chilean oligarchy\" seized the coast for 
\"economic reasons\" during the war.  Chavez claims that the 
Venezuelan president in 1879 opposed the land grab, and that 
it has been Venezuelan state policy ever since. 
 
3. (U) Chavez cited recent statements by UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan, former President Jimmy Carter, and Brazilian 
Formin Celso as growing international support for resolution 
of the issue.  He announced he would raise Bolivian access to 
the sea at future summits, a promised he fulfilled during the 
Monterrey Summit (though only in press encounters, we 
understand).  Chavez requested on January 7 that the Chilean 
government to take \"a more humble attitude\" with Bolivia, 
which has suffered economically from not having a port. 
Bolivian indigenous leader Evo Morales has thanked Chavez for 
his public support on the issue. 
 
--------------------- 
Chile Takes Exception 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) In reaction to Chavez\'s statements, Santiago recalled 
its ambassador, Fabio Vio, on November 15 for consultations; 
the Venezuelans reciprocated shortly thereafter.  The Chilean 
Charge d\'Affaires had told poloff in December that Vio 
expected to return at the beginning of the year, thinking 
that the issue would cool over the holidays.  Plans changed 
during the Monterrey Summit, however, after Chavez accused 
Chilean President Ricardo Lagos of misrepresenting the facts 
of Chile\'s \"occupation\" of Bolivia\'s coastline.  Lagos denied 
lying, pointing out that Bolivian access to the sea is a 
bilateral issue.  Both the Venezuelan MFA and the Chilean 
Embassy confirmed to poloff that their respective ambassadors 
would not return to their posts in the near future. 
 
---------------------------- 
MFA Hopes All Will Blow Over 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The MFA\'s Chile Desk Officer Romero Dimas told poloff 
January 14 the GOV hoped relations with Chile would be 
\"normalized\" once the public spotlight on the issue passes. 
He said that despite the mud slinging between its presidents, 
Venezuela and Chile enjoy good relations, citing 
 
accomplishments by an ad hoc bilateral working group (which 
last convened in 2001).  He characterized support for 
Bolivia\'s maritime claims as one of traditional solidarity 
among Latin American countries, though he admitted that 
President Chavez has pushed the issue more than previous 
presidents.  Romero was not aware of any attempt at 
discussing the issue privately at the Monterrey Summit, a 
fact confirmed by the Chilean Embassy. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Like most Chavez political plays, there is a 
self-serving interest under the surface of this issue.  His 
recounting of the War of the Pacific is revisionist, cast as 
a struggle between \"the people\" of Bolivia and \"the 
oligarchy\" of Chile.  Chavez has found a low-risk issue to 
flog around his neighborhood, giving him the appearance of a 
statesmen, at least among his core supporters.  He seems 
willing to sacrifice relations with Chile, though he has thus 
far stopped short of formally breaking ties.  Casting the 
issue as poor Bolivia at the mercy of rich (by comparison) 
Chile, Chavez looks like a champion for the underdog.  And, 
certainly his efforts have the practical objective of 
boosting support for Evo Morales, his ideological ally in 
Bolivia. 
 
7. (C) That said, we believe most other Latin American 
presidents must wonder why Chavez, whose country has 
outstanding territorial differences with Colombia and Guyana, 
would go out on a limb for Bolivia.

characterizing the Bank\'s international reserve holdings as 
\"excessive.\"  In a speech January 28, BCV Director Domingo 
Maza Zavala held firm, saying the reserves were necessary to 
maintain the strength of the bolivar.  The dispute between 
the administration and the BCV exists against a backdrop of 
parallel currency market troubles for the bolivar and 
Ministry of Finance debt-juggling.  With the bolivar trading 
at sometimes twice the official rate on the parallel market, 
the GOV is likely to issue new foreign debt to add some 
dollars to the economy.  Perhaps in light of that 
probability, Chavez has dropped his anti-BCV statements to 
more generic political statements in recent days.  End 
summary. 
 
------------ 
Excessive... 
------------ 
 
2. (U) In an appearance on the weekly \"Alo, Presidente!\" 
program January 18, President Chavez and Minister of Planning 
Jorge Giordani claimed that Venezuela\'s current international 
reserve holdings of USD 21 billion were \"excessive.\" 
Giordani stated that USD 15 billion was a sufficient level of 
reserves for an economy the size of Venezuela\'s.  He even 
claimed to be working on a new \"economic theory\" that would 
define exactly what was excessive.  Chavez and Giordani 
ascribed the withholding of reserves by the BCV as a 
neoliberalism-imposed limitation on Venezuela\'s development. 
Despite these claims, Chavez did not explicitly ask the BCV 
for more than his original demand of USD 1 billion to finance 
unspecified agricultural programs (Ref A). 
 
------------- 
Is Subjective 
------------- 
 
3. (C) The BCV has not budged from its position that a raid 
on reserves is both legally and economically unsustainable. 
Most recently, BCV Director Domingo Maza Zavala engaged in an 
\"ECON 101 Course\" in a speech to an economic forum January 
28.  Maza Zavala said that despite Chavez administration 
claims the reserve holdings were not excessive, indeed 
suggesting that the concept of \"excessive reserves\" did not 
make sense.  He added that the BCV\'s holdings were necessary 
to ensure the value of the bolivar.  Maza Zavala theorized 
that in the absence of exchange controls, the BCV\'s holdings 
would fall \"within a month\" to approximately USD 8 billion. 
(Note: Maza Zavala\'s statements hold Greenspan-like weight in 
Venezuela.  Despite Chavez\'s description of the BCV as a 
haven for neoliberals, Maza Zavala is decidedly leftist in 
orientation.  The octogenarian has worked at the BCV for over 
forty years and has been a director since 1994.  To say that 
he is personally impervious to political pressure is an 
understatement.  End note.) 
 
-------------------- 
Parallel Rate Spikes 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Fueled largely on rumors of an imminent devaluation 
and Chavez\'s railing against the BCV, the parallel market 
exchange rate peaked at approximately 3,200 bolivars/USD, 
twice the official rate, during the week of January 19. 
Miguel Santos, Chief Economist for the Venezuelan-American 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VENAMCHAM), told econoff 
January 22 that Finance Minister Nobrega had broached the 
subject of devaluation with President Chavez at Miraflores on 
the night of January 19.  According to Santos, Chavez had 
rejected the idea as politically impossible with the recall 
referendum still a possibility.  Santos said his opinion was 
 
 
the GOV would have to devalue relatively shortly in order to 
utilize exchange rate gains on reserve holdings to finance 
Chavez\'s electoral spending plans.  Other economists with 
whom we have spoken, including some associated with the 
Andean Development Fund, see devaluation well into the 
future, but agreed that is was eventually inevitable. 
 
----------------- 
MOF Managing Debt 
----------------- 
 
5. (C)  Alejandro Dopazo, Director of Public Credit for the 
Ministry of Finance, told econoffs January 27 that the GOV 
had sufficient resources to keep the bolivar at the 1,600 
official rate through 2004.  However, he said this was only 
possible if the GOV adhered to its historical pattern of 
75-80 percent budgetary execution.  Anything above that 
amount would require either exchange rate adjustment or 
additional debt operations according to Dopazo.  He also said 
the Ministry\'s main task for 2004 was to lower the domestic 
debt maturities coming due over the next three years.  These 
maturities represent approximately 85 percent of Venezuela\'s 
USD 18 billion internal debt load.  Dopazo hinted that a 
significant amount of this refinancing would be in the form 
of external debt offerings.  (Note: Two external debt 
offerings in 2003 were used as indirect exchange rate 
management vehicles.  See Ref B.) 
 
6. (C) Other avenues remain open for additional funds for GOV 
spending on Chavez\'s pet projects.  BCV Director of 
International Relations Mary Dager told econoff January 20 
that the Bank was sensitive to the economic demands of the 
country and was seeking legal ways to agricultural lending. 
Following Dager\'s comments on January 22, the BCV lowered 
reserve holding requirements two percent for banks that meet 
the GOV-mandated agricultural share of their loan portfolios. 
 That figure stands at 12 percent, although few banks meet 
the requirement.  The BCV also has USD 7.5 billion in 
certificate of deposit holdings in foreign banks.  In the 
past, the GOV has used earnings from these types of deposits 
to fund spending. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) In the latest \"Alo, Presidente!\" on February 1, Chavez 
kept his rhetoric against the BCV in check.  His brief 
remarks on the reserve issue were restricted to demands that 
the BCV guarantee agricultural financing and \"not only with 
promises.\"   Professor Gustavo Garcia of the Higher Institute 
of Business studies told econcouns January 22 that severe 
inflationary effects on the parallel exchange rate could be 
felt in as little as one to two months if Chavez were 
successful in obtaining the unrestricted reserve transfer 
from the BCV to GOV coffers.  We can assume that Fin Min 
Nobrega has told Chavez the same.  In the forum that mimics 
Chavez\'s thought-de-jeur most closely, his supporters in the 
National Assembly have likewise fallen silent on the issue, 
preferring raucous debate over their own procedures or 
changes in the Supreme Court Law. 
 
8. (C) The current environment perfectly illustrates the 
cross-pressures in the Venezuelan economy.  GOV fiscal health 
is dependent on low levels of budget execution, but its 
political health is dependent on short-term electoral 
spending.  Over the past week, Chavez and the BCV have called 
a truce that probably has two root causes.  First, the BCV 
has hinted all along that some sort of legal accommodation 
could be found.  Second, the MOF could not ignore the 
parallel rate being twice as much as the official exchange 
rate and will probably seek another bonds-for-dollars debt 
issue.  That measure requires a kinder, gentler Chavez to 
soothe investor worries.  Whether this is a conscious choice 
on his part or just another lapse of attention remains to be 
seen.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  With street battles between opposing labor groups, 
mass protests to force the removal of managers, new 
allegations of corruption in internal product sales, and 
rumors of yet another new Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) 
board, January has demonstrated yet again the disarray in the 
Venezuelan energy sector.  Rumors that Ali Rodriguez will 
leave the presidency of PDVSA or be replaced are also spiking 
once again.  Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma, who 
has been seen as an advocate for more involvement by private 
sector firms, is also now the subject of rumors that he will 
be dismissed.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
THE REVOLUTION IN THE STREETS 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) After a holiday calm, evidence of the battles that 
continue to rage within Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), 
between PDVSA and the rest of the government, and in the 
Venezuelan energy sector in general have once again erupted 
into public view in January.  Violence broke out in western 
Venezuela the week of January 19 as workers fighting over 
jobs and control of PDVSA\'s Cabimas plant began shooting at 
each other.  Five people were wounded as workers from the 
\"Bolivarian Workers Front\" clashed with those from the \"Che 
Guevara Trade Union of Unemployed Workers.\"  In eastern 
Venezuela, the situation was less violent but still tense as 
protestors massed outside PDVSA\'s Maturin offices to demand 
the removal of regional managers who had allegedly 
participated in the December 2002-February 2003 general 
strike.  The entire PDVSA Board traveled to Puerto La Cruz to 
discuss this incident that was apparently resolved on Janary 
21 with the appointment of a new district manager. 
 
3. (C) These two incidents appear more bizarre when one 
realizes that, in the case of Cabimas, the violence was 
between two pro-Chavez unions squabbling over control of the 
jobs in a PDVSA facility, while in Maturin the protestors 
were actually led by a member of the PDVSA Board, himself a 
union leader.  More seriously, a U.S. executive reported to 
econoff on January 22 that the PDVSA manager who was removed 
had worked well with international companies.  He added that 
another senior eastern area manager, with whom his company 
has worked most effectively since the strike, was also 
targeted by the protestors.  So far, this manager has been 
protected but he may yet be removed. 
 
---------------------------- 
THE REVOLUTION FIRES ITS OWN 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In yet another bizarre episode, Fabian Chacon, a 
Chavez loyalist who lasted as a legal counsel in PDVSA for 
ten months between February and November 2003 when he was 
reportedly fired by PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez, went 
public the week of January 26 with charges that PDVSA has 
lost millions of dollars by selling products at low domestic 
market prices to firms that then re-sold the products abroad 
at international prices.  Although such allegations should 
not come as a surprise to any observer of the chaos of the 
current Venezuelan energy scene, they have spurred PDVSA, the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines, and the National Assembly into 
saying they will investigate irregularities in the sales of 
crude and oil products.  Chacon himself has been accused of 
trying to funnel the legal business associated with the 
severance claims of ex-PDVSA employees to lawyer friends. 
(Note:  Stories of corruption in PDVSA\'s international 
marketing are rife.  The former commercial manager of PDVSA 
told econoff January 20 that he has received material from 
within the company that could send people to jail.  The only 
new thing here is the allegation of corruption in the 
internal market which would be very much in the trend 
 
 
described in reftel A.  End note.) 
 
------------------------ 
YET ANOTHER PDVSA BOARD? 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) VenEconomy, a respected local consulting service, 
published a story in its newsletter on January 29 stating 
that Chacon\"s allegations \"are thought to be part of a 
campaign to unseat Ali Rodriguez\" and other members of his 
Patria Para Todos (PPT) Party from PDVSA.  This follows 
public announcements by Rodriguez and Energy Minister Ramirez 
that President Chavez will soon announce yet another 
restructuring of the industry and yet another board of 
directors.  The press reports that the PDVSA Board will be 
expanded to eleven from its current eight members. 
Representatives from the Finance, Production and Commerce, 
and Planning Ministries will reportedly be added to the board 
to give the government more control over the company.  There 
is also speculation that the military will become more 
overtly involved in the running of the company. 
 
6. (C) The ever fertile Caracas rumor mill is once again 
seething with rumors that Ali Rodriguez himself is on the way 
out.  A staffer of the Permanent Energy Commission of the 
National Assembly informed econoff on January 15 that he 
believes Rodriguez and other PPT party members will pull out 
of the Chavez government when they think it will go down so 
as not to be associated with a failure.  This source, who 
claims to know Rodriguez well from his time in the National 
Assembly, believes Rodriguez will ultimately be more 
interested in advancing his own political career than in 
setting Venezuelan energy policy.  ChevronTexaco de Venezuela 
President Ali Moshiri commented to econoff on January 22 that 
Rodriguez is indeed less \"hands on\" than he had been a year 
ago.  Moshiri noted that everything to do with crude trading 
and lifting has been turned over to Senior VP Aires Barreto. 
Another oil company source, however, commented to econoff on 
January 29 that ultimately Rodriguez\'s most effective 
advocate with Chavez is Fidel Castro.  According to this 
source, Castro depends on Ali Rodriguez to keep the oil 
flowing to Cuba. 
 
7. (C) Some of the candidates rumored to be in line to fill 
Rodriguez\'s shoes include Energy and Mines Minister Rafael 
Ramirez; General Francisco Rangel Gomez, currently President 
of the state-owned Corporacion Venezuelano de Guyana (CVG); 
CITGO President Luis Marin; and Gustavo Perez Issa, the 
controversial former PDVSA internal security manager. 
Rumored candidates for new board members include Carlos 
Mendoza Potela, formerly Venezuelan Ambassador to Saudi 
Arabia and a member of the controversial Gaston Parra PDVSA 
Board in 2002; and Alfredo Rivera, currently a CITGO VP and 
said to be leading the charge to move the company from Tulsa 
to Houston because he would prefer to live in Houston.  One 
particularly cynical industry source commented to econoff 
that those now in control of PDVSA know they are \"on the way 
out\" and are fighting to get onto the board because of the 
excellent pension benefits they would receive. 
 
8. (C) And Rodriguez is not the only person whose imminent 
departure is rumored.  Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis 
Vierma, who has other important positions in PDVSA, is also 
said to be on shaky ground because of his support for more 
involvement by private firms in Venezuela\'s energy sector. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) PDVSA continues to be an almost dysfunctional 
organization with different groups struggling for power, 
jobs, control of its budget, and, of course, opportunities to 
make money.  But a larger stuggle may be looming in the 
Chavez government between the nationalists and those who 
support giving more operational freedom to the private 
sector.  This kind of managerial disarray only strenghtens 
our suspicions (reftel B) that the firm\'s production is 
likely to drift downward in 2004.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  President Chavez, though buoyed by the spread of 
benefits and end of year spending, will likely suffer a hard 
drop in popularity when the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
announces a referendum, a group of Venezuelan Governors told 
the Ambassador January 14.  The four Governors (including 
metro Caracas Mayor Alfredo Pena) also  commented on the 
irony of the opposition appearing to be anti-elections when 
it was seeking to keep the focus on the referendum and away 
from regional elections.  The Venezuelan leaders also 
commented on President Chavez\'s attempt to use international 
reserves for programs and the status of Cuban doctors in the 
country.  End Summary. 
 
2.  U) The Ambassador hosted a dinner January 14 to discuss 
Venezuela\'s political situation with Governor Didalco Bolivar 
(MAS -- Aragua State and an ally of Chavez), Governor Eduardo 
Lapi (Convergencia -- Yaracuy State), Luis Lippa (Alianza 
Civica -- Apure State), and Mayor Alfredo Pena (Independent 
-- Caracas).  Governor Enrique Mendoza (COPEI -- Miranda 
State) accepted, but was unable to attend.  DCM and PolCouns 
accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
------------------ 
What About Chavez? 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Bolivar said President Chavez has three options: 
accept a referendum, go for a constitutional amendment, or 
resign.  He asserted that Chavez will not accept a 
referendum.  Lapi commented that even he would resign if 
faced with a referendum because the office holder is running 
against himself.  Caracas Mayor Pena called the idea of 
Chavez pushing for a constitutional amendment a non-starter. 
The people, he said, would not accept having their \"voice,\" 
i.e., the recall referendum, taken away from them.  Pena also 
ruled out the possibility of Chavez resigning.  There would 
be immediate chaos, he asserted, with Chavez supporters 
quickly jumping ship. 
 
4.  (C) Alluding to public comments by opposition leaders 
that regional elections affect the referendum negatively for 
the opposition, the Venezuelan leaders commented on the irony 
of the opposition appearing not to want elections. Lapi 
defended the comments, saying the point is that the focus 
should be on the referendum.  Of course the opposition should 
register candidates and prepare to compete, he told the 
group, and they will do so.  Apure Governor Lippa noted that 
the comments were another indication that the \"center\" is out 
of touch with the regions.  Using his situation, where Accion 
Democratica (his old party) still supports his rival, Lippa 
said Caracas leaders want to impose candidates without 
relation to the possible support or popularity they may 
enjoy.  Bolivar added that even Chavez\'s Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) suffers from it.  The only difference, the 
Aragua Governor noted, is that in AD and COPEI, a group 
decides and in the MVR it\'s one person. 
 
------------ 
Poll numbers 
------------ 
 
5.  (C) Regarding Chavez\'s standing in the polls, Yaracuy 
Governor Lapi predicted that the President\'s numbers would 
decline immediately after the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) declares that there will be a referendum.  He 
speculated that the drop could be as much as 10 percentage 
points, i.e. to about 30%.  Aragua Governor Bolivar noted 
that once the CNE makes the declaration, Chavez becomes a 
lame duck.  Repeating Mayor Pena\'s observation about the 
effect of a Chavez resignation, Bolivar said Chavez 
supporters would quickly begin to jump ship.  He observed 
that Chavez rose in the polls through the spreading of 
benefits and end-of-year bonuses, but noted that support is 
not permanent.  Lapi recounted some of his experiences with 
populist opponents and noted that \"people want more than 
handouts.\"  Politically, they only go so far, he said. 
 
-------------- 
The Signatures 
-------------- 
 
 
6.  (C) The guests concurred that the number of signatures 
collected by the opposition to petition for a recall 
referendum against President Chavez is real.  Chavez, they 
agreed, did what he could to limit opposition efforts.  In 
Apure, Lippa commented, even the Bolivarian Liberation Force 
(FBL), an armed group believed to be promoted by Chavez 
supporters, intimidated people.  Bolivar told the group that 
Chavez learned too late how bad things were going for him 
with the opposition signature drive.  His political command 
deceived him, Bolivar reported, and after second day he 
learned from military officers the true status of things. 
Because of this delay, the closing of airports and other 
efforts to impede the petition drive had less effect.  Lapi 
commented that Chavez supporters -- who Bolivar described as 
hard-core believers in Chavez\'s revolution -- could not help 
but see striking difference between their signature drive a 
week before and the opposition effort.  By the second day, 
Lapi said, they were getting along with opposition, and not 
only that, they were continuing to do so now.  Bolivar noted 
that this experience has convinced all that the opposition 
has collected enough signatures for a recall. 
 
-------------------- 
Central Bank Billion 
-------------------- 
 
7.  Addressing President Chavez\'s push to get the Central 
Bank of Venezuela to make available $1 billion from the 
country\'s international reserves for the agricultural sector, 
Aragua\'s Bolivar asserted that Chavez will get the money.  He 
added, however, that the President does not really want the 
money per se.  What he wants is control of the bank, he said. 
 Pena noted that the people see the issue in simple terms: 
There are $21 billion sitting there idle, why not use some of 
it for the \"benefit\" of the country?  Lapi pointed out that 
for much of the Chavez audience, there is no understanding of 
the inflationary impact that acquiescing to Chavez\'s demand 
would have. 
 
------------------------- 
Cuban Doctors/Health Care 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The Governors and Pena concurred that the Cuban 
doctors brought by Chavez are providing a service to 
Venezuela.  Each noted having found ways to work with them. 
Pena noted, however, that the real problem is that the 
national government is seeking to change how Venezuela\'s 
health-care system operates.  He and Lippa pointed out that 
the government is demanding that 60% of the money destined to 
the states for the health sector be used for the Cuban 
doctors, leaving them without adequate resources to operate 
existing hospitals and clinics under their jurisdiction.  The 
force behind the revolutionary changes, they said, is Health 
Minister Roger Capella, who has long-standing sympathies with 
the Cuban system. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  With this latest of regular conversations over 
dinner at the Residence, the Governors once again provided 
interesting insights into various hot topics of the day. 
That Chavez may lose support quickly is speculation that 
merits further watching, not only for electoral 
possibilities, but also for how it may provoke other 
reactions.  Lapi (Yaracuy) and Bolivar (Aragua) are certain 
to be nominated by the opposition and the Chavistas 
respectively and almost certain to be reelected.  Lippa 
(Apure) is confident he can be reelected, but AD is promoting 
another candidate.  (Lippa broke away from AD and formed his 
own party.)  Pena is in dire shape with only 12% support in 
Metro Caracas and MVR gunning for him.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Technical and organizational problems, suspected 
employee sabotage, and lethargic decision making continue to 
stymie progress of signature verifications collected to 
convoke recall referendums on President Hugo Chavez and 67 
National Assembly deputies.  National Electoral Council (CNE) 
President Francisco Carrasquero stated January 30 that the 
CNE would not make the February 13 verification deadline. 
The 40-person Superior Technical Committee began work on 
February 3.  The CNE\'s decisions to send GOV-collected 
signatures back through the physical verification stage, 
produce signature form copies for the GOV\'s campaign to prove 
\"megafraud,\" and its inability to make decisions on verifying 
thumbprints or establish norms for the next stages of the 
process suggest more delays are imminent. End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Recall Drives Plod Along 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) progress verifying 
signature drives to convoke recall referendums on President 
Hugo Chavez and 67 National Assembly deputies continues at a 
slower than expected pace.  The CNE announced January 29 that 
they had started the transcription of signatures collected to 
recall President Hugo Chavez on January 28, the second of a 
seven-stage process in the signature verification process. 
By February 2, members of the opposition Democratic 
Coordinator (CD) claimed Jorge Rodriguez, CNE Director and 
President of the CNE\'s National Electoral Board (JNE), told 
them the transcription process for the Chavez drive was 
completed. (Note: OAS observers inform us that 90,000 of 
380,000 signature forms against Chavez - about 25 percent - 
have not been transcribed as they are awaiting reviews by the 
Superior Technical Commission.) 
 
3. (C) CNE employee (Civil and Electoral Registry Commission) 
Diego Acevedo told poloff January 29 that the signature forms 
to recall opposition deputies were more than half way through 
the transcription process (Stage 2 of verification). 
However, the CNE announced January 30 that they would require 
those signatures to go through the initial physical 
verification stage again because they had been approved using 
a less strict standard than the signatures gathered to recall 
Chavez.  The CNE was almost finished physically verifying 
signatures collected to recall pro-GOV deputies on January 
29, according to Acevedo.  He said enough signatures had 
already been invalidated to discount 11 of the 30 pro-GOV 
deputy drives. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Recall Holdups, Fraud, and Shenanigans 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Jorge Rodriguez confirmed publicly February 2 that the 
number of rejected signature collection forms suddenly spiked 
upwards during the physical verification of presidential 
recall signatures. He said the source of the \"abnormalities\" 
has been determined and employees involved have been fired. 
Acevedo claimed some Chavista transcriptionists were applying 
stricter standards to anti-GOV signature forms, such as 
overvigorously rejecting signatures because of transposed 
identification numbers, legibility issues, and thumbprint 
quality and were altering data, to include filling out blank 
spaces.  He suspected CNE employees would overrule the 
\"sabotage\" committed by temporary workers during the next 
stages of the verification (cross-check, quality control, and 
Superior Technical Committee review), but not before burying 
the process in a mountain of unnecessary work. 
 
5. (C) OAS observers told us transcription delays are caused 
by lack of a consistent supply of signature forms to 
transcribers, insufficient manpower, salary issues, and 
problems with software and technical support.  Staffing is 
 
particularly problematic for the night shift.  Acevedo 
claimed significant delays are caused by absenteeism 
(estimated at 15 to 20 percent by an OAS source, ref b) and 
deliberately slow work by Chavista employees who make up 
about 70 percent of the workforce in the physical revision 
and transcription stages of the process.  Carrasquero claimed 
80 percent of the regular CNE employees were allied to the 
opposition in response to recent criticism that the CNE was 
sending qualified employees on \"vacations\" and hiring hoards 
of Chavistas in an attempt to pack the CNE.  OAS reported 
January 31 that the Quality Control process had not started 
for any of the drives.  The 40-person Superior Technical 
Committee (CTS), the group that will review rejected 
signatures, began work on February 3. 
 
6. (U) During his weekly televised address February 1, Chavez 
praised National Assembly Deputy Luis Tascon\'s efforts to 
obtain certified copies of the signature forms requesting a 
presidential recall. Chavez promised to dedicate an upcoming 
address to exposing the supposed fraud.  Tascon is 
spearheading efforts by the GOV\'s electoral organizers, the 
\"Comando Ayacucho,\" to initiate an investigation into 
signature collection fraud, such as signatures of the 
deceased, from citizens living abroad, or for signature forms 
that are not accounted for on daily tally sheets (actas). 
Tascon announced January 31 that the CNE agreed to oversee 
the photocopying of opposition signature forms with both 
opposition and GOV observers present, although Comando 
Ayacucho will cover the cost.  He estimated the copies would 
be completed by mid-week.  OAS reports confirm that 
photocopying started January 31 at the unanimous consent of 
the CNE directors and related the concern that this could 
further delay the process.  Comando Ayacucho plans to collect 
complaints February 6-8 at voting centers national-wide from 
citizens who suspect their signatures were used illegally. 
Tascon said a report documenting the \"megafraud\" will be 
presented at a press conference tentatively planned for 
February 12.  (Comment: The CNE plans to publish the identity 
numbers of those who signed the petitions.  Hence, this 
operation seems designed to generate public attention for the 
GOV\'s \"megafraud\" theory. End comment.) 
 
----------------------- 
Whither the Thumbprints 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) No decisions have been made regarding verification of 
thumbprints on signature forms.  According to the February 1 
edition of daily El Universal, French company Sagem estimated 
it would take at least three weeks to verify 500,000 thumb 
prints.  The article also questioned the technical ability 
and resources of another potential contractor, Smartmatic, to 
verify the thumbprints.  According to a November 2003 report 
from the Ministry of Interior and Justice, 3.24 million 
records with citizen thumbprints which would be used to 
verify the signature form prints have not been labeled or 
filed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Opposition Refuses to Give CNE Unqualified Support 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (U) Following Chavez\'s January 15 statements that he would 
respect the CNE\'s decision \"whatever that decision may be,\" 
GOV leaders have consistently badgered the opposition to make 
a similar claim.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel 
characterized the CD\'s response as \"a grave insult to the 
members of the CNE ... by inferring that they will produce a 
decision that\'s neither transparent or lawful.\"  CD spokesman 
Americo Martin said February 1 that it would only respect the 
results of the CNE\'s verification process if it was 
\"transparent,\" a message consistent with comments of most CD 
leaders the previous week.  The CD has taken no formal 
position on whether or not it will unconditionally accept the 
CNE\'s verdict.  (Comment:  In his January 30 Diplomatic Corps 
greeting speech, Chavez said he would obey the CNE ruling, 
and even step down if he lost the referendum, \"as long as 
this was done with respect for the constitution and without 
pressure (chantaje)\" -- a message not dissimilar to the 
opposition\'s, but the opposition has not spun it as well.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Deadlines: Redrawing Lines in the Sand 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Members of the opposition alliance Democratic 
Coordinator (CD) met February 2 with Rodriguez to urge the 
JNE to stick to the February 13 deadline to conclude the 
verification process.  On January 30, CNE Director Francisco 
Carrasquero confirmed the CNE would not complete the 
verification process by February 14, the end of the 30-day 
time limit for verification that officially started January 
13.  He added the CNE was in the process of \"readjusting\" its 
timetable and a new deadline would be announced within days. 
Rodriguez announced January 29 that a new CNE committee would 
release an exact date and new schedule within 24 hours.  A 
formal announcement had not been made by February 4. 
 
10. (C) US President Jimmy Carter predicted a March 1 
conclusion of the process after meeting with the CNE on 
January 27 (ref a).  Acevedo predicted a final announcement 
between Feb. 29 and the first week of March.  From the 
opposition perspective, this is the third delay since the 
opposition delivered the Chavez signatures December 19. The 
CNE has pointed to the immense workload and unforeseen 
difficulties incumbent to overseeing more than 60 referendum 
drives, a new function for the Venezuelan electoral 
institution. 
 
----------------------- 
Sumate Unveils Database 
----------------------- 
 
11. (U) The civil organization Sumate unveiled a computerized 
database of 388,000 signature collection forms calling for 
Chavez\'s recall.  Petition signers can use their 
identification numbers to locate the digitally scanned forms 
they signed.  After comparing the data with the Permanent 
Electoral Registry (REP) and accounting for entry errors and 
blank entries, Sumate concluded more than 3.1 million valid 
signatures were collected.  During the last week of January, 
Sumate showed the database to the diplomatic corps, 
journalists, and President Carter, among others.  The group 
plans to deliver copies of the database to the OAS and Carter 
Center. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) The CNE continues its beleaguered march toward 
signature verification.  Symbolic of the one step forward, 
two steps back verification process, the formation of the 
Superior Technical Committee showed progress, but was 
undermined by an absence of rules the group needs to start 
its job.  The elusive fingerprint check and the publication 
of seven million identity numbers also remain significant 
hurdles.  International observers - notably the Carter Center 
- continue their public support for the CNE.  Our message 
should continue to be one of support for the CNE as the 
independent arbiter of the process.

------------------------------------ 
POLITICAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS LANDSCAPE 
------------------------------------ 
 
1. Venezuela continued to be embroiled in a political crisis 
over the government of President Hugo Chavez, who was elected 
in July 2000 in generally free and fair elections.  The 
democratic environment suffered from deteriorating rule of 
law and weakened institutions that were increasingly 
subordinated to political interests.  Respect for political 
rights continued to be of special concern as opposition 
groups petitioned the National Electoral Commission (CNE) to 
convoke a recall referendum on President Chavez\' rule.  The 
Government\'s human rights record remained poor.  Political 
violence and intimidation against opposition political 
parties, the media, labor groups, the courts, the Catholic 
Church, and human rights groups was common, often carried out 
by government sympathizers inspired by the rhetoric of the 
President and other government officials.  The police and 
military continued to commit numerous abuses, including 
extra-judicial killings of criminal suspects.  Arbitrary 
arrests, detentions and torture of detainees persisted. 
Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening. 
Impunity, one of the country\'s most severe human rights 
problems, allowed corruption and extreme inefficiency to 
flourish in the judicial system.  Child labor increased as 
economic conditions worsened, and violence against women and 
children remained problems. 
 
----------------- 
OUR 2003 STRATEGY 
----------------- 
 
2. The embassy focused its 2003 democracy and human rights 
efforts on support for political rights, while it continued 
conducting programs to fight other human rights abuses.  The 
Ambassador and every section/agency used contact and 
representational work to encourage the implementation of OAS 
Resolution 833 which calls for a constitutional, democratic, 
peaceful, and electoral solution to the country\'s political 
crisis.  In addition, embassy programs worked to strengthen 
Venezuelan institutions, encourage communication and 
dialogue, and oppose violence and extra-constitutional 
changes in government.  The embassy conducted programs that 
can influence human rights practices through a variety of 
sections including the Public Affairs (PAS), Political, and 
Consular Sections, the Legal Attache Office (LEGATT), and the 
OTI office of the Agency for International Development 
(USAID). 
 
------ 
ACTION 
------ 
 
3. To increase professionalism and lower the likelihood of 
extra-judicial killings and torture committed by the security 
forces, LEGATT, in conjunction with PAS and the Narcotics 
Affairs Section (NAS), arranged several training programs for 
law enforcement officials that incorporated rule of law and 
human rights concepts.  During the second half of 2003, 
LEGATT sent six Venezuelan officers to a 10-day seminar in 
the US on counter-terrorism; one officer to a three-month 
leadership course at the FBI Academy; and three officers each 
to the FBI\'s terrorism and police management training and 
\"Latin American Law Enforcement Executive Development 
Seminar,\" respectively.  LEGATT also organized a two-week 
course on terrorism crime scene investigations for 50 
participants and a one-week anti-kidnap seminar for 40 
participants. 
 
4. In compliance with the Leahy Amendment, the Political and 
Economic Sections, DAO and LEGATT worked to vet military 
units and law enforcement personnel for training and 
assistance to ensure that the beneficiaries of US assistance 
have not committed human rights abuses.  The Political 
Section\'s human rights officer also meets regularly with 
contacts in the private sector and within the government to 
foster support for human rights and track significant areas 
of concern. 
 
5. The mission\'s efforts to promote democracy, rule of law, 
and political rights continued to be quite strong.  The 
 
USAID/OTI office funded National Democratic Institute (NDI) 
activities to promote transparency in the electoral process 
through domestic observation.  To accomplish this objective, 
NDI is working with a consortium of civil society groups 
spanning the political spectrum to provide quality control in 
the electoral process, including administrative procedures 
and media reporting.  The OTI also funded the International 
Republican Institute (IRI) to provide training to political 
parties in 1) execution of electoral campaigns with emphasis 
on developing campaign strategies and communicating party 
platforms effectively to voters; and 2) observation of 
electoral processes, focused on assessment, reporting, and 
establishment of a volunteer trainer network.  In addition, 
the OTI funded the Carter Center\'s continuing mediation and 
electoral process observation efforts. 
 
6. Complementing OTI activities, the mission ensured that all 
press statements and speeches by the Ambassador, the DCM, and 
visiting USG officials, including Members of Congress, 
contained references to our strong support for OAS Resolution 
833 as the way out of Venezuela\'s political crisis.  In 
addition, post ensured wide distribution of relevant remarks 
by Washington policymakers and OAS officials to the media and 
placed them on the embassy website.  The mission also 
arranged a digital video conference (DVC) on the California 
gubernatorial referendum, during which the Venezuela 
referendum was discussed in detail. 
 
7. To improve the country\'s judicial system, the Public 
Affairs Section (PAS) conducted several programs to 
strengthen the administration of justice and prevent abuses. 
PAS organized a DVC on judicial ethics and sponsored five 
expert speakers on various aspects of the administration of 
justice.  PAS also sponsored a one-week workshop on 
\"Mediation and Conflict Resolution in Prisons\" conducted by 
an expert trainer in conflict resolution.  The participants, 
representing all sectors of the judicial and penal systems, 
used their workshop experience to create a network for 
continuing professional collaboration.  In late 2003, PAS 
arranged an additional expert speaker on victim protection 
and funded an International Visitor Program on \"Human Rights 
and Prison Reform.\"  A DVC on the country\'s human rights 
situation is planned for early 2004. 
 
8. To strengthen civil society and democratic institutions, 
the mission approved $718,500 of USAID/OTI funding for 14 
grants in the following program areas: justice/human rights, 
transparency in government, media/freedom of expression, 
conflict management, and community impact activities 
(dialogue among polarized groups).  For example, one project 
was designed to raise public awareness of and respect for 
human rights.  It accomplished the goal by conducting human 
rights workshops for leaders of key societal sectors and by 
distributing written explanations nationwide of the main 
national and international mechanisms for protection of human 
rights.  Another grant promoted democratic discussion between 
government and opposition parties in the National Assembly on 
topics such as freedom of expression.  The discussions were 
facilitated by an international expert. 
 
9. Especially relevant due to the standoff between the 
government and private media were embassy efforts to support 
a free and democratic press.  The Ambassador hosted a Press 
Freedom Day event to highlight the importance of free speech. 
 That message was backed up by USAID/OTI grants that 
emphasized the importance of an impartial media, allowing all 
candidates to have air time during elections, media 
regulatory systems, and the need to allow for democratic 
coexistence among those with opposing viewpoints.  In 
conjunction with  OTI, PAS arranged a DVC on the role of the 
media in a democracy for pro-government and opposition 
affiliated journalists.  The mission issued many press 
statements in suport of freedom of expression and against the 
use of violence by any party for political ends. 
 
10. To assist women\'s efforts to overcome discrimination and 
violence, the mission co-sponsored with Vital Voices Global 
Partnership a kickoff workshop for women who are business and 
community leaders.  The Vital Voices worldwide network helps 
women organize themselves to address a range of issues, 
including leadership training, coalition building, and the 
fight against trafficking in women and children.  The mission 
also co-sponsored a one-day conference on proposed changes to 
the Domestic Violence Law that would reduce protective 
 
measures available to battered women and children. 
Conference participants produced a written argument (amicus 
brief) against the proposed change and presented it to the 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. 
 
11. The Consular Section works with local immigration offices 
to strengthen immigration controls and prevent human 
smuggling and trafficking in persons.  In 2003, the section 
hosted one DHS Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services 
officer who trained 300 employees from airlines, airport 
security, and the immigration/passport agency in fraud 
detection.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Carter Center representative Francisco Diez believes 
the January 27-29 visit of former President Carter was 
pivotal in keeping the signature verification process at the 
National Electoral Commission (CNE) on track. In meetings 
with President Chavez, Carter emphasized the need for Chavez 
to allow the referendum to take place if the CNE so decides. 
Carter also convinced the CNE to gravitate toward March 1 as 
a realistic (albeit late) deadline for announcing the results 
of the signature drives.  Carter\'s visit stirred up some 
controversy when he praised Chavez publicly for fighting 
poverty.  We see Carter\'s visit as a buoy for the stressed 
out CNE and a reality check both for Chavez and the 
opposition.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Carter Center Rep Lists Trip Achievements 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) On February 5 Francisco Diez, local representative of 
the Carter Center, gave the Ambassador his readout of the 
January 27-29 visit by former President Carter.  Diez 
characterized the major achievements of the visit as: 
 
-- Getting the National Electoral Commission (CNE) on track 
on the issue of granting full access to international 
observers (Note:  The Carter Center will expand its observers 
from four to twelve.  End note.); 
 
-- Laying out the need to consider the intention of the 
signers over legalistic barriers to verifying the signatures 
collected in favor of a recall vote against Chavez and 
National Assembly deputies; 
 
-- Focusing the CNE on March 1 as a deadline for announcing 
the results of the verification process (Note:  CNE rules had 
dictated February 13, but political conflicts have made March 
1 more likely, for now.  End note.); and 
 
-- Delivering a message to Chavez that he must allow the 
referendum to take place despite his persistent claims of 
wholesale fraud by the opposition. 
 
In addition, Carter resolved the issue of OAS access to all 
parts of the verification process. 
 
3. (C) Diez highlighted the second meeting between Carter and 
Chavez (January 29) in which Carter praised Chavez for his 
social programs aimed at the poor.  Carter reportedly said he 
was impressed by the popular support that Chavez enjoys. 
Without giving Chavez a chance to respond, Carter moved 
directly to the conclusion that Chavez ought to permit the 
referendum, which he stands an excellent chance of winning. 
A victory at the polls would allow Chavez some breathing room 
and get society moving forward again.  When Chavez asserted 
the claim of \"megafraud,\" Carter repeated the message. 
 
-------------- 
TSJ/CNE Dinner 
 
SIPDIS 
-------------- 
 
4. (C) Carter had dinner with Supreme Court (TSJ) President 
Ivan Rincon and National Electoral Council (CNE) President 
Francisco Carrasquero during the visit.  Rincon told Carter 
that the decision to allow Chavez to run in the subsequent 
presidential election if he is recalled has already been 
drafted; its publication will await the results of a 
referendum.  Rincon promised that any legal challenge raised 
against the recall would be resolved quickly by the TSJ. 
 
5. (C) Carrasquero told Carter the CNE would complete its 
work by March 1 at the latest.  Diez said that Carrasquero 
 
comes across as someone who cares very much about his place 
in history and in fulfilling his mission to make the 
referendum process work.  (Note:  Carter made note of his 
conversation with Carrasquero in his press conference in 
which he suggested that March 1 would be the latest date the 
CNE should announce the results of the verification process. 
End note.) 
 
----------------------------- 
Opposition Grimaces At Carter 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Diez told Ambassador he was concerned that some in the 
opposition has criticized Carter for complimenting Chavez on 
his anti-poverty campaigns.  Diez has been personally 
attacked as a closet \"Chavista\" by some in the opposition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Former President Carter\'s visit was a touchstone for 
the verification process and buoy to the CNE.  Carter has 
high credibility with both sides and is seen as a senior 
statesman.  Carter\'s visit was key for delivering the message 
to Chavez that he must accept the CNE\'s results, which Chavez 
agreed to publicly.  By complimenting Chavez\'s social 
achievements, Carter also gave a reality check to the 
opposition about the tough electoral battles that lie ahead 
of them.  A reporter who covers the CNE full time told us on 
February 6 that the atmosphere in the CNE was completely 
different before and after the Carter visit.  Unfortunately, 
the warm glow wore off within the week, and the underlying 
political tensions between the Chavistas and the opposition 
have returned to prominence, including public accusations 
between CNE rectors.  While Chavez has not disowned his 
commitment to Carter that he would accept whatever the CNE 
decides, his lieutenants are doing everything they can to 
ensure that the decision is favorable to them.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Commission (CNE) faces a tough 
week, as the politically symbolic deadline of February 13 
will come and go without a definitive decision on the recall 
referendum against President Chavez.  Opposition groups plan 
a march on February 14 to \"defend\" their signatures and keep 
public pressure on the CNE.  Chavistas have countered with 
provocative statements and already occupy the grounds 
adjacent to the CNE building.  The CNE is stalled on how to 
treat fingerprints and whether to permit signature forms 
filled out in the same handwriting (called \"planillas 
planas\").  How the CNE comes down on these issues may 
determine whether the referendum goes forward.  OAS observers 
privately tell us the CNE cannot finish their work until 
March 15, assuming major roadblocks are removed.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Chain of Events To February 14 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) This is a key week for the National Electoral 
Commission\'s (CNE) effort to verify the 3.4 million 
signatures collected by the opposition in support of a recall 
vote against President Hugo Chavez.  The CNE began the 
signature count in earnest on January 13 and, by regulation, 
has 30 days to verify the signatures plus two days to approve 
the results.  Political squabbling and poor organization, and 
the need to constantly invent procedures and standards have 
delayed the process significantly, however, to at least March 
1 (see para 8).  The 30 days end on February 13 and the 
opposition plans a series of street actions designed to 
pressure the CNE to render a decision.  Current plans are for 
the NGO Sumate on February 13 to make copies of the signature 
forms available to those who signed the petition against 
Chavez.  Opposition leaders will visit the CNE the same day 
to demand the CNE hurry deliberations.  On February 14, the 
opposition will stage a march in which signers will carry the 
copy of their signature form to the CNE to \"defend\" their 
signatures. 
 
3. (C) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez (pro-GOV) announced 
February 6 that the CNE would release partial results of the 
signature counts, specifically, the pro-GOV signature drive 
to recall opposition deputies of the National Assembly. 
Opposition representatives have suggested to us that 
Rodriguez is hoping to lower tension by demonstrating that 
the CNE is working and will soon have final results.  One 
opposition representative told us that the CNE\'s partial 
disclosure could agitate Chavez supporters because key 
opposition deputies targeted by the GOV will, by press 
accounts, likely escape the recall. (Comment:  If the CNE 
releases partial information, it will likely pertain to 
petition drives against certain deputies whose revocation 
threshold is very low.  It is doubtful the partial results 
will cover the presidential referendum.  End comment.) 
 
4. (C) Minister of Interior and Justice Diosdado Cabello 
inflamed the situation further on February 6 when he 
announced that Chavez supporters would occupy Caracas Plaza 
next to the CNE building and that no one would enter the 
plaza until the CNE makes its decision.  \"We\'re not trying to 
scare the CNE directors,\" he said, \"but to protect them from 
the fascists that invent things ... we\'re going to support 
the rectors in the street.\"  Cabello made the statements at a 
ceremony commemorating the foundation of Venezuelan Popular 
Unity (UPV), a new political party headed by radical Chavista 
street activist Lina Ron.  Ron, who was also inducted into 
the \"Comando Ayacucho\" campaign committee during the 
ceremony, said the GOV is facing \"an electoral battle ... if 
someone tells me the signatures are valid and that they are 
going to remove Chavez, we can\'t accept it.  One way or the 
 
other, there will be combat.\"  Minister Cabello added that he 
was sure the opposition did not collect a sufficient number 
of signatures and, therefore, there would be no referendum. 
Asked by a reporter how the international community would 
react, Cabello responded, \"I don\'t give a ---- what the 
international community thinks.\" 
 
------------------------- 
Meanwhile, Inside the CNE 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Verification of the signature forms continues in the 
Superior Technical Committee (CTS).  Some 94,000 signature 
forms (averaging about nine signatures per page) from the 
presidential recall drive were referred to the CTS for 
further review, about 25 percent of the total number of 
forms.  OAS observers Edgardo Reis and Marcelo Alvarez told 
poloff February 9, that because of changes in criteria, the 
number of forms referred to the CTS is expected to increase 
to half of all the signature forms (which could contain up to 
1.6 million signatures).  The work of the CTS is to confirm 
or deny \"observations\" made by the CNE temporary workers who 
noted irregularities in the forms during the physical 
inspection stage.  In theory, the CTS may deny an observation 
and send the signature form for transcription; confirming an 
observation essentially kicks the decision up to the National 
Elections Board, headed by Jorge Rodriguez.  The observers 
noted a tendency in the CTS for examiners, for lack of clear 
rules, to confirm the observations, thus forcing the 
decisions to a higher level. 
 
6. (C) OAS observers noted two crucial problems with the 
signature forms under review in the CTS.  First, more than 
half of the forms are filled out with the same handwriting 
(called \"planillas planas\"), which Chavez supporters claim is 
evidence of fraud.  The opposition dismisses the allegation, 
noting that table workers during the signature drive filled 
out the forms for signers to ensure the writing was legible 
and correct.  The rules are silent on the issue, though OAS 
observers pointed out that representatives from both sides 
signed the back of each signature form.  The second problem 
is smudged or irregular fingerprints.  So far, there is no 
decision on how the fingerprints will be analyzed (see ref). 
 
7. (C) Rodriguez announced February 6 that a sample of 8,600 
signature forms (including 3,700 from the presidential drive) 
would be analyzed to see whether the same hand that printed 
the information also made the signature.  CNE Director 
Sobella Mejias publicly criticized Rodriguez, saying that 
such a decision required a decision by the CNE board.  OAS 
observers told poloff the CNE was looking at analyzing about 
80,000 signatures (30,000 for the presidential drive), not 
feasible considering a lack of time and qualified handwriting 
experts.  Given the quantity of signatures in dispute, the 
OAS observers concluded that if the CNE decides to reject the 
\"planas\" and forms with questionable fingerprints, there 
would be no referendum. 
 
------------------- 
Conflict and Delays 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) Reis and Alvarez said they worried that violence could 
break out either before or after the February 14 march.  They 
showed poloff a timeline they created in consultation with 
CNE employees that showed the process ending by March 15. 
Alvarez also pointed out that the complaint process for those 
whose signatures were rejected could take months if the 
normal electoral complaint process were used.  Reis and 
Alvarez criticized the opposition for bungling several issues 
during the process, such as demanding strict treatment for 
the pro-GOV signature drive, not realizing that the same 
treatment would be reciprocated on the signatures against 
Chavez.  Alvarez opined that if the process is pushed into 
April, the situation would \"explode.\"  Alvarez proposed that 
the OAS issue a statement on February 12 calling on all 
parties to respect the process. 
 
9. (C) Primero Justicia Deputy Ramon Jose Medina told poloff 
 
February 9 that the opposition took the decision to pressure 
the CNE on February 14 to avoid further delays.  Medina said 
violence was possible during the march, though much would 
depend on how the CNE handles the run-up.  Medina admitted 
that the decision to march could be falling into a trap by 
the GOV to force a confrontation that might impede the 
referendum process, but he said the opposition could not 
\"stand by with arms crossed\" while the CNE process drags on. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) Rather than strike a conciliatory tone, the 
opposition has opted for pressure tactics.  The Chavistas 
have responded with threats and intimidation.  Any time the 
two sides mount parallel demonstrations, as they appear to be 
doing for February 14, there is potential for conflict and 
violence.  Much depends on how the drama inside the CNE plays 
out.  The CNE is quickly reaching the point where decisive 
rulings -- such as what to do with the \"planas\" -- cannot be 
put off.  If the CNE is able to make these decisions, one 
side or the other will likely become inflamed. 
 
11. (C) As the battle within the CNE heats up, the role of 
the OAS and Carter Center observers becomes more important. 
Venezuelans want to have a credible CNE, but the obvious 
partisan politics indicate that the CNE, like other 
institutions, may well be broken.  The Carter Center and OAS 
need to ensure that the will of individual citizens is not 
trampled by wholesale invalidation of signatures using flimsy 
pretexts.

SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON THE USAID/OTI VENEZUELA PROGRAM 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  USAID\'S OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES (OTI) BEGAN ITS 
VENEZUELA PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER 2002 TO SUPPORT THE PRIMARY 
USG GOAL OF SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS TO 
VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL CRISIS.  USAID\'S OVERALL GOAL IN 
VENEZUELA IS TO SUPPORT A POLITICAL PROCESS THAT IS 
    DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL, ELECTORAL AND PEACEFUL. 
SPECIFICALLY THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON: SUPPORT TO ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES, SUPPORT OF A FAVORABLE ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT, 
FACILITATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT 
AND OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, AND PUBLIC CIVIC EDUCATION. TO 
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM, USAID IS FUNDING THE FOLLOWING PARTNER 
ORGANIZATIONS:  THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN 
INSTITUTE, THE CARTER CENTER, DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES, 
INC., AND A LARGE NUMBER OF VENEZUELAN CIVIL SOCIETY 
ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO RUN THROUGH EARLY 
FY 2005.  END SUMMARY. 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
2. POST HAS WITNESSED ENCOURAGING MOVEMENT TOWARDS A 
PEACEFUL OUTCOME OF VENEZUELA\'S CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS. 
ONE YEAR AGO THE COUNTRY WAS SHUT DOWN BY A NATIONAL STRIKE 
WHOSE GOAL WAS TO FORCE THE RESIGNATION OF PRESIDENT CHAVEZ. 
THE OPPOSITION HAS SINCE CHOSEN A PATH FOR POLITICAL CHANGE 
BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO RECALL 
ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS HALF WAY THROUGH THEIR TERMS OF 
OFFICE.  THIS CHANGE OF STRATEGY RESULTED IN TWO RECENT 
SIGNATURE-GATHERING EXERCISES:  NOVEMBER 21 - 24 TO RECALL 
37 OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; AND NOVEMBER 
28 TO DECEMBER 1 TO RECALL PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AND 30 PRO- 
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATORS.  THE TWO EVENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 
A PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DECLARED 
FUNDAMENTALLY FREE OF FRAUD BY THE CARTER CENTER AND THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.  THE OPPOSITION ANNOUNCED 
THAT IT HAD COLLECTED 3.6 MILLION SIGNATURES DURING THE 
    SIGNATURE DRIVE TO PETITION FOR A RECALL REFERENDUM AGAINST 
PRESIDENT CHAVEZ, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE 2.4 MILLION 
NEEDED. 
3. IF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL FINDS THAT THE 
OPPOSITION HAS MET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CALLING A REFERENDUM 
AGAINST PRESIDENT CHAVEZ, AND THE REFERENDUM IS SUCCESSFUL, 
THIS WOULD BE FOLLOWED A MONTH LATER (POSSIBLY SOMETIME IN 
JUNE) BY A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION - FOLLOWED BY ELECTIONS FOR 
GOVERNORS AND MAYORS IN LATE JULY.  IN DECEMBER 2006, THERE 
WILL BE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND AN ELECTION FOR 
ALL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS.  IF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT 
IS ANY GAUGE, ALL OF THESE ELECTORAL EVENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE 
CARRIED OUT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF MUTUAL DISTRUST AND 
ACCUSATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION.  USAID 
VENEZUELA\'S PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF 
VENEZUELANS WHO DEEPLY WISH TO MOVE FORWARD POLITICALLY SO 
AS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE GRAVE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
CURRENTLY BESETTING THE COUNTRY.

4.  USAID IS SUPPORTING TWO COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
(NDI). THE FIRST AGREEMENT PROVIDES $770,000 TO WORK WITH 
CIVIL SOCIETY TO HELP ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY 
OF ELECTORAL PROCESSES THROUGH DOMESTIC OBSERVATION.  THIS 
PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A CONSORTIUM OF GROUPS 
AFFILIATED BOTH WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION. 
SPECIFICALLY THE CONSORTIUM WILL FOCUS ON OBSERVING: 
POLITICAL/CIVIL/HUMAN RIGHTS, THE QUALITY OF THE ELECTORAL 
PROCESS INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, AND MEDIA 
    REPORTING. 
5.  THE SECOND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH NDI PROVIDES 
$550,000 TO STRENGTHEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND ENCOURAGE 
COALITION BUILDING.  THIS PROJECT IS JUST GETTING UNDERWAY 
WITH THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF THE PROJECT MANAGER BUT ALREADY 
HAS MADE A NUMBER OF KEY CONTACTS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
OPPOSITION WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT 
THE PROJECT. 
6.  USAID IS ALSO SUPPORTING TWO COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH 
THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE (IRI).  THE FIRST, 
FOR $450,000, IS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO POLITICAL PARTIES ON 
THE DESIGN, PLANNING, AND EXECUTION OF ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS. 
THIS IS BEING DONE THROUGH \"CAMPAIGN TRAINING SCHOOLS\" 
TARGETING CAMPAIGN MANAGERS.  THE EMPHASIS IS ON THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF VIABLE CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES AND EFFECTIVELY 
COMMUNICATING PARTY PLATFORMS TO VOTERS.  DIVIDED INTO SIX 
TWO-DAY MODULES, THE TRAINING IS BEING OFFERED IN FIVE 
REGIONAL CENTERS.  TO DATE THE FIRST MODULES HAVE BEEN 
OFFERED IN CARACAS (INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
STATES OF VARGAS (ARAGUA, GUARICO AND AMAZONAS), ZULIA 
(TACHIRA, FALCON, BARINAS, MERIDA, TRUJILLO AND APURE), 
ANZOATEGUI (AMACURO, MONAGAS, SUCRE, AND NUEVA ESPARTA)AND 
CARABOBO (LARA, COJEDES, GUARICO, AND YARACUY).  PARTICIPANT 
RESPONSE HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY ENTHUSIASTIC, AND AT LEAST IN 
ZULIA STATE, INVOLVED PARTICIPANTS FROM A BROAD SPECTRUM OF

NIFICANT DUE TO THE 
HIGHLY POLARIZED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS AN AREA TO 
WHICH IRI IS COMMITTED TO GIVING SERIOUS ATTENTION.  END 
COMMENT.) 
7.  THE SECOND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH IRI, FOR $285,000, 
IS TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE 
OBSERVATION OF ELECTORAL PROCESSES.  WORKING THROUGH A LOCAL 
    NGO, HAGAMOS DEMOCRACIA (HD), AND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE 
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, IRI/HD IS DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL 
MATERIALS FOR THE TRAINING OF POLL WATCHERS.  THE FOCUS OF 
THE TRAINING - WHICH HAS ALREADY BEGUN WITH TRAINING OF 16 
TRAINERS - IS ON OBSERVATION, ASSESSMENT, AND REPORTING. AN 
IMPORTANT EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FORMAL NETWORK OF CONTACTS AND VOLUNTEER 
TRAINERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
8.  USAID HAS AWARDED THREE GRANTS TO THE CARTER CENTER. 
THE FIRST, FOR $580,000, IS AN INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT GRANT. 
THIS FUNDING HAS ENABLED THE CARTER CENTER TO CONTINUE 
FACILITATING RECONCILIATION EFFORTS AIMED AT CALMING THE 
POLITICAL CRISIS.  A SECOND GRANT OF $100,000 SUPPORTED THE 
CARTER CENTER\'S OBSERVATION OF THE RECENT SIGNATURE- 
GATHERING DRIVES.  A FOLLOW-ON GRANT OF $60,000 IS 
SUPPORTING THE CARTER CENTER\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE 
VERIFICATION PROCESS. 
9.  WITH DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES, INC. (DAI), USAID 
VENEZUELA IS IMPLEMENTING A $3.5 MILLION PROGRAM OF SMALL 
GRANTS, PRIMARILY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VENEZUELAN CIVIL 
SOCIETY.  DURING THE PAST YEAR THE PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN TO 
FACILITATE DIALOGUE BETWEEN SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY WHO WOULD 
NOT NECESSARILY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO 
DISCUSS ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST.  THE 70-PLUS GRANTS TO 
DATE HAVE MOSTLY SUPPORTED WORKSHOPS DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC 
ISSUES SUCH AS FAMILY VIOLENCE, MUNICIPAL PLANNING, AND THE 
ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. 
-------------------------- 
NEXT STEPS - FY2004 FOCUS 
-------------------------- 
10.  WHILE PROVIDING A SPACE FOR DIALOGUE AND RECONCILIATION 
    WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SMALL 
GRANTS PROGRAM, THE EMPHASIS FOR FY 2004 ALSO INCLUDES THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA/VISION FOR THE FUTURE. 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN 30 EXISTING NATIONAL AGENDAS, 
AN INDICATION THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO RECOGNIZE THE PRESSING 
NEED TO HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE RATHER THAN FALLING 
BACK ON COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.  THIS 
PROJECT WILL WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE EXISTING NATIONAL 
AGENDAS TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VISION THAT WILL 
THEN BE VALIDATED IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS HELD THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY.  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE CITIZEN 
PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA - TO 
ENCOURAGE OWNERSHIP - AND TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS REGARDING EXPECTATIONS OF THE CITIZENS OF 
VENEZUELA. 
11.  ANOTHER UPCOMING PROJECT IS A NATION-WIDE CAMPAIGN TO 
BE LAUNCHED IN LATE FEBRUARY, WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH STRONGLY CONTRASTING OPINIONS.  THIS 
CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE A HEAVY MEDIA COMPONENT AND STRONG 
SUPPORT BY CIVIL SOCIETY WHO WILL IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS 
LOCALIZED PROJECTS IN SUPPORT OF \"CONVIVENCIA\" - LIVING 
TOGETHER IN PEACE.  INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROJECT HAS BEEN 
OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE, A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT 
VENEZUELANS ARE TIRED OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND 
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. 
12.  PROJECTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION REGARDING ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES WILL ALSO COMPRISE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DAI 
SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM FOR FY 2004 IN ORDER TO COUNTER-BALANCE 
THE INEVITABLE FLOW OF RUMOR AND MISINFORMATION. ALSO 
    INCLUDED IN THIS COMPONENT WILL BE PROJECTS DEALING WITH 
CIVIC EDUCATION ON THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
CITIZENS IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.  AS A COMPLEMENT, 
CONTINUED EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA 
IN A DEMOCRACY. 
13.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE USAID VENEZUELA PORTFOLIO - AND 
THE COMPLICATED AND FLUID NATURE OF THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL 
LANDSCAPE - USAID\'S IMPACT TO DATE IS HARD TO ASSESS. 
CERTAINLY THE USG IS BETTER ENGAGED AS A RESULT OF PROJECT 
ACTIVITIES CAREFULLY COORDINATED IN THE EMBASSY IN SUPPORT 
OF USG OBJECTIVES.  FUNDING FOR THE CARTER CENTER CONTINUES 
TO SUPPORT CRITICAL ACTIVITIES.  AT MINIMUM, AS A RESULT OF 
THE NDI, IRI, AND DAI ACTIVITIES THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN GROUPS THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY INTERACT. 
IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
INTERESTING INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE DAI 
ACTIVITIES. (NOTE:  THE DAI PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FOLLOWING UP ON COMPLETED 
PROJECTS TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT SO AS TO INCORPORATE 
LESSONS INTO FUTURE PROGRAMMING.  END NOTE.)

INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO RECOGNIZE THE PRESSING 
NEED TO HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE RATHER THAN FALLING 
BACK ON COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.  THIS 
PROJECT WILL WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE EXISTING NATIONAL 
AGENDAS TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VISION THAT WILL 
THEN BE VALIDATED IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS HELD THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY.  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE CITIZEN 
PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA - TO 
ENCOURAGE OWNERSHIP - AND TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS REGARDING EXPECTATIONS OF THE CITIZENS OF 
VENEZUELA. 
11.  ANOTHER UPCOMING PROJECT IS A NATION-WIDE CAMPAIGN TO 
BE LAUNCHED IN LATE FEBRUARY, WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH STRONGLY CONTRASTING OPINIONS.  THIS 
CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE A HEAVY MEDIA COMPONENT AND STRONG 
SUPPORT BY CIVIL SOCIETY WHO WILL IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS 
LOCALIZED PROJECTS IN SUPPORT OF \"CONVIVENCIA\" - LIVING 
TOGETHER IN PEACE.  INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROJECT HAS BEEN 
OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE, A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT 
VENEZUELANS ARE TIRED OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND 
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. 
12.  PROJECTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION REGARDING ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES WILL ALSO COMPRISE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DAI 
SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM FOR FY 2004 IN ORDER TO COUNTER-BALANCE 
THE INEVITABLE FLOW OF RUMOR AND MISINFORMATION. ALSO 
    INCLUDED IN THIS COMPONENT WILL BE PROJECTS DEALING WITH 
CIVIC EDUCATION ON THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
CITIZENS IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.  AS A COMPLEMENT, 
CONTINUED EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA 
IN A DEMOCRACY. 
13.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE USAID VENEZUELA PORTFOLIO - AND 
THE COMPLICATED AND FLUID NATURE OF THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL 
LANDSCAPE - USAID\'S IMPACT TO DATE IS HARD TO ASSESS. 
CERTAINLY THE USG IS BETTER ENGAGED AS A RESULT OF PROJECT 
ACTIVITIES CAREFULLY COORDINATED IN THE EMBASSY IN SUPPORT 
OF USG OBJECTIVES.  FUNDING FOR THE CARTER CENTER CONTINUES 
TO SUPPORT CRITICAL ACTIVITIES.  AT MINIMUM, AS A RESULT OF 
THE NDI, IRI, AND DAI ACTIVITIES THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN GROUPS THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY INTERACT. 
IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
INTERESTING INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE DAI 
ACTIVITIES. (NOTE:  THE DAI PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FOLLOWING UP ON COMPLETED 
PROJECTS TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT SO AS TO INCORPORATE 
LESSONS INTO FUTURE PROGRAMMING.  END NOTE.)

SUBJECT: CNE DIRECTOR MEJIAS INVOLVED IN NATIONAL GUARD 
SCUFFLE 
 
Classified By: Mark Wells, Acting Political Counselor, for reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
1. (C) An alleged attack on a National Assembly (AN) Deputy 
Edgar (Democratic Action) Zambrano and National Electoral 
Council (CNE) Director Sobella Mejias (pro-opposition) by 
National Guard (GN) troops as the two dined on February 7 
created a political firestorm.  At issue is whether GN Gen. 
Marcos Rojas, who was at the restaurant, ordered the supposed 
attack.  Rojas claimed opposition-aligned Zambrano scuffled 
with photographers and that the GN was never involved.  Some 
pro-GOV AN Deputies attempted to shift attention to the 
meeting, implying Zambrano and Mejias were conspiring to 
influence the CNE to accept signatures calling for a recall 
of President Hugo Chavez.  The GN, national investigative 
police, AN, and Public Prosecutors Office are all 
investigating the incident.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Entering the Lion\'s Den 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) National Assembly (AN) Deputy Edgar Zambrano 
(Democratic Action) accused National Guard (GN) Gen. Marcos 
Rojas of orchestrating an attack on himself and National 
Electoral Council (CNE) Director Sobella Mejias.  The alleged 
attack occurred February 7 at the El Faro restaurant in Catia 
La Mar, Vargas state (near the Maiquetia International 
Airport).  Zambrano told poloff February 10 that he and 
Mejias entered the restaurant at approximately 9 p.m. 
precisely because the presence of National Guardsman posted 
in the parking lot reassured them it would be safe. They sat 
at a table in the opposite corner from the Gen. Rojas, who 
was dinning at a large table with a mix of officers and 
civilians.  Rojas confirmed February 9 that he was at the 
restaurant at the same time as Zambrano and Mejias. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Deputy Zambrano: General Rojas Behind Attack 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) At about 9:20 p.m., two civilian-clothed men 
approached their table and started taking photos.  Zambrano 
claimed Rojas, a supporter of President Hugo Chavez, sent the 
men from his table to \"harass and intimidate\" Zambrano and 
Mejias, who are linked to the opposition.  Zambrano explained 
that Gen. Rojas was baiting him into a trap, which he 
admitted falling into by trying to take away one of the 
cameras.  Zambrano said the photographers asked no questions, 
did not identify themselves, and did not attempt to explain 
why they were taking the photographs, proving, Zambrano 
claimed, that they were civilians working for Rojas, not 
media photographers or concerned citizens.  As he struggled 
with the two men for the camera, four or five National 
Guardsmen joined the brawl.  Although Zambrano said during 
television interviews that he was immediately overwhelmed in 
the conflict, he boasted to poloff that he \"got a few blows 
in.\"  Zambrano leaped over a counter to get to the General\'s 
table and \"plead with him to stop this barbarity.\"  Zambrano 
said Rojas ignored him completely and his entourage left 
while National Guard troops pummeled him to the ground, 
handcuffed him, and lead him to the GN pickup parked outside 
the door.  Zambrano claimed the Guardsmen beat him and called 
him an \"enemy of the state\" and accused him of conspiring 
with Mejias to \"set a trap for the president.\"  The Guardsmen 
then allegedly moved him to a truck with a canopy to conceal 
the continued assault before dumping him, still handcuffed, 
in the parking lot and departing.  Zambrano estimated the 
confrontation took about 10 to 15 minutes. 
 
4. (C) Zambrano said Mejias told him that immediately after 
the fight broke out, two or three members of the wait staff 
led her behind a cashier\'s counter and stood \"valiantly\" 
between her and the troops.  However, armed troops eventually 
grabbed her by the arms, took her to the parking lot, and 
held her there until they dumped Zambrano and drove away. 
(Note: The language used to describe Mejias\' treatment in 
media reports, for instance claiming she was \"shoved\" or 
\"attacked\" seemed slightly exaggerated compared to Zambrano\'s 
 
 
account. End note.)  Zambrano claimed Mejias repeatedly 
yelled at the troops to respect Zambrano\'s immunity as a 
member of the National Assembly.  She claimed after they took 
Zambrano out of the restaurant, the customers started singing 
the opposition anthem \"se va, se va, se va, se va\" (\"he 
(Chavez) is going\"). 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Uncuffed and Angry, Zambrano Strikes Back 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Mejias drove Zambrano back to Caracas to GN 
headquarters in El Paraiso.  (Note: he was not arrested or 
taken to El Paraiso by the GN as reported initially. End 
Note.)  There he was treated \"respectfully\" by two Colonels 
(Jaime Franklin Marquez_ and Jose Rafael Sequera Cohen) and 
taken to the GN\'s Intelligence Division where the handcuffs 
were finally taken off.  He spent from 11:30 p.m. to 4 or 5 
a.m. providing his complaint to GN officials and demanding 
\"justice.\"  Sunday evening Zambrano filed a complaint with 
the federal investigative police (CICPC), where Zambrano also 
received a medical examination to document a black eye, cuts 
and bruises on his hands and wrists (which he showed to 
poloff), and alleged bruises covering most of his body. 
Zambrano is accusing Gen. Rojas of: assault, injury, abuse of 
power, instigation of violence, intent to kidnap, violation 
of parliamentary and CNE immunity, violation of freedom of 
movement, violation of freedom of expression, and abuse of 
authority.  Zambrano asserted \"this is one person\'s fault, 
that animal (Rojas).  I will not press charges against the 
soldiers for the orders of their commander.\"  The Public 
Prosecutor\'s Office (Ministerio Publico) announced its own 
investigation February 10, although Zambrano did not request 
it. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Denials and Innuendo: Rojas \"Outraged\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Gen. Rojas told reporters February 9 he was \"surprised 
and outraged\" by the allegations.  He said he was on his way 
out of the restaurant when he observed Zambrano and Mejias 
\"arguing with some photographers\" and denied that Guardsmen 
were involved.  Rojas speculated that the photographers were 
likely interested in why a National Assembly deputy and a CNE 
director were dining together, implying that they could be 
plotting to influence CNE acceptance of signatures calling 
for Chavez\'s recall.  Although Rojas made no direct 
accusation, he added that it was suspicious that Zambrano and 
Mejias waited two days after the incident before denouncing 
it.  He also found it \"curious\" that Zambrano did not have a 
hoarse throat or a black eye on television Sunday night, but 
developed both by Monday morning, implying that Zambrano beat 
himself up or had someone inflict the wounds Sunday night to 
make his story more believable. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
National Assembly to Investigate Politicized Attack 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (C) The National Assembly agreed to open an investigation 
of the incident during its February 10 session.  \"The only 
information we have to date has come from the media,\" said AN 
Vice President Ricardo Gutierrez, who demanded an 
\"exhaustive\" report from the Ministry of Defense.  Zambrano 
told poloff before the session he expected Chavista support 
for the investigation because \"they respect me\" and \"this was 
over the line.\"  Although Gutierrez and other pro-GOV 
legislators expressed disdain for any \"form of aggression 
against legislators,\" respect for Zambrano seemed lacking as 
some GOV-aligned Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) firebrands, 
such as Iris Valera, fiercely attacked the motives for the 
meeting.  Valera waved copies of the photographs and demanded 
that the opposition \"explain what is going on here.\"  She 
claimed the two had previously dined on February 6 in the 
Caracas Hilton and claimed such meetings violated Article 294 
of the Constitution, affirming CNE independence and 
impartiality.  Zambrano replied that he met with Mejias 
\"because I wanted to and because we live in a free and 
democratic country.\"  Ultimately the AN agreed to confine the 
investigation to the confrontation, not the content of the 
meeting, however, the AN commission will consist of a 
 
 
majority of pro-GOV deputies, not an even split as proposed 
by the opposition.  A proposal by Deputy Gerardo Blyde 
(Justice Fist) to suspend Rojas pending the outcome of the 
investigation was also defeated. 
 
8. (C) MVR Deputy Luis Velazquez told poloff February 11 he 
disagreed with his colleagues\' \"infatuation\" with the 
meeting.  \"Clearly everyone can meet with each other, I met 
with the old CNE directors.\"  He added that Zambrano and 
Mejias were only guilty of \"a lack of sense\" for giving MVR 
extremists an opportunity to criticize the meeting at a \"time 
of extreme tension\" and that Zambrano overreacted by 
attacking the photographers.  \"People take our picture all 
the time in the Assembly, he should be used to it.\"  He 
suspected that the photographers were indeed employees or 
friends of Rojas, but that they acted on their own behalf, 
not under the General\'s direction. 
 
---------------------------- 
Motives: Why Meet? Why Beat? 
---------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Zambrano said he met Mejias at a restaurant precisely 
because \"I have nothing to hide.\"  As the opposition Assembly 
representative to the CNE Restructuring Committee (Deputy 
Willian Lara is the pro-GOV representative) he had legitimate 
CNE business to discuss and, in any event, there\'s nothing 
wrong or illegal about CNE directors meeting with deputies. 
Zambrano claimed he heard a rumor that CNE President 
Carrasquero meets with pro-GOV deputies Willian Lara and Luis 
Tascon and that it did not bother him.  Velazquez confirmed 
that MVR leaders do met with CNE officials \"as you would 
expect.\" 
 
10. (C) Zambrano said Rojas wanted to scare them and 
symbolically intimidate the opposition, a strategy that will 
backfire and give the opposition a clear example of GOV 
bullying to rally against.  He said the set-up was an 
impromptu brainchild of Rojas and discounted anything more 
organized or sinister.  Both Mejias and Zambrano have spoken 
out publicly and often about the incident, claiming it has 
only galvanized their opposition to President Chavez.  \"I 
have an obligation to the Venezuelan people, and I will not 
allow this to intimidate me,\" Mejias said February 9. 
 
------------------------------------- 
National Guard Accounts Schizophrenic 
------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) GN Adjutant General Luis Mota told DAO Officer 
February 9 that it was the intelligence police (DISIP) that 
fought with and handcuffed Zambrano.  He claimed the GN had 
nothing to do with the incident and that Gen. Rojas just \"was 
in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"  He confirmed that the 
GN took Zambrano\'s handcuffs off later, but that the 
handcuffs had a DISIP serial number.  Mota also alluded that 
Zambrano may be blaming the GN to cover up an indiscretion 
with Mejias under investigation by the DISIP.  However, 
another military source close to the case told DAO Officer 
that members of the GN company stationed in Vargas were 
indeed involved and accosted Zambrano.  He added that one of 
the \"photographers\" was a colonel from Gen. Rojas\' table who 
\"was attacked and that is why he defended himself.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Media \"Testimony\" Support Zambrano 
---------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) According to media reports February 11, employees at 
a pharmacy next to the restaurant claim they sold disposable 
cameras to two men around 9 p.m. They claim the men then 
rushed back into the restaurant.  A anonymous witness at the 
restaurant backed Zambrano\'s story during a call-in 
television program February 10. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) Clearly, Zambrano or Rojas is lying, a gutsy act 
considering a restaurant full of people witnessed the 
incident.  We tend to believe Zambrano, although he is likely 
 
 
exaggerating and embellishing details.  Rojas\' argument that 
Zambrano waited \"two days\" to complain is weak. Rojas 
complained about the attack officially the same night (and 
has the documents to prove it) and went public less than a 
day after the attack.  Because the event took place on a 
Saturday night, it was not in the newspapers until Monday. 
The fact that Iris Valera had copies of the photos February 
10 and knowledge of another dinner the two had suggests there 
is more to this than a bad dinner.

AMBASSADORS 
 
Classified By: Mark A. Wells, A/PolCouns, for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Carter Center held a briefing on February 10 at 
the Ambassador\'s residence for Western Hemisphere ambassadors 
on the status of the signature verification process at the 
National Electoral Commission (CNE).  Carter Center 
representatives described the numerous administrative 
problems (inconsistent guidelines, lack of transparency and 
clear information, poor decision-making) and the urgent need 
for decisions to be made by the CNE if there is to be any 
hope of announcing the results by March 16.  Critical to the 
referendum\'s survival is the CNE\'s treatment of the \"plana\" 
signature forms filled out (but not signed) in the same 
handwriting.  The ambassadors attending the meeting were 
alarmed at the prospect that the CNE could toss out enough 
signatures on a technicality to kill the referendum.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Carter Center Lays Out Challenges 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Carter Center (TCC), in its role as process 
analyst of the signature collection for the revocatory 
referendums, in conjunction with the Organization of American 
States (OAS) gave a short presentation regarding the current 
situation on February 10. TCC representatives Marcel Guzman 
and Francisco Diez headed the presentation attended by OAS 
observer chief Edgardo Reis, OAS country representative 
Patricio Carbacho, UNDP country representative Antonio 
Molpeceres, and the Ambassadors from Chile, Argentina, 
Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and Colombia, plus the 
Charge from Peru. 
 
3. (C) During the presentation, Guzman stated that the role 
of the TCC is to evaluate and verify the legality, 
transparency and the results of the revocatory process. The 
main strategies to do so consist of procedural analysis, 
observation of the process, and three different samplings. 
 
4. (C) The TCC concluded that before February 13, the 
National Electoral Commission (CNE) will make a decision 
regarding the \"planillas planas,\" forms filled out in the 
same handwriting. The government alleges that these planillas 
are proof of mega fraud and should be annulled according to 
Article 22, which states that this process is intensely 
personal and the individual should fill out all the 
information, including biographical information. OAS 
representative Reis consulted with three independent legal 
experts who unanimously stated that they could see nothing in 
the law to invalidate these signatures; however, both the CC 
and OAS representatives agree that in the end this will be a 
political decision.   Since all three signature drives have 
large quantities of these \"planillas planas,\" the decision is 
potentially explosive. Invalidating these planillas will 
nullify an estimated 650,000 signatures from the presidential 
drive alone according to Diez. OAS representative Reis 
confirmed that if these planillas were rejected, there would 
be no referendum of any sort, not for president or any of the 
deputies.  (Comment:  Diez later told Ambassador he was not 
sure of the exact number of \"planas,\" intimating it could be 
a much lower number.  End comment.) 
 
5. (C) The CC also observed that inconsistencies exist in the 
rules being used to do the physical verification of the 
signatures. Those verifying the signatures use methods that 
are passed out on handouts printed by unknown authors to 
determine if quality of the fingerprints are acceptable or 
not. There is no clearly defined leadership and poor 
communication in the CNE, so erroneous perceptions that are 
not corrected are leading to bad decisions made by those 
working on the verifications. 
 
6. (C) The standards used also change as the process 
 
 
continues. For example, the signatures from each drive are 
verified in alphabetical order according to state names. 
Halfway through the second drive (the presidential), CNE 
workers employed new criteria without proper written 
authorization.  Referral rates to the Superior Technical 
Committee (CTS) skyrocketed from around 3 percent to 70 
percent.  OAS rep Carbacho pointed out that during the 
physical verification process of the presidential planillas, 
the change in criteria came suspiciously after the count 
surpassed 2.5 million just over the minimum threshold to 
convene the referendum.  When complaints arose of the CNE\'s 
disparate treatment, the board agreed to re-submit the 
planillas against opposition deputies to the same rigorous 
examination (Note:  On February 11, the CNE board decided to 
re-submit the presidential planillas that were originally 
approved back to the physical inspection using the new rules. 
 This will likely result in up to half of the 388,000 
presidential planillas being subjected to further scrutiny. 
End note.) 
 
7. (C) Diez noted that the CNE took a sample of 8,600 planas 
(3,700 from the presidential) for a handwriting analysis. 
The OAS estimated that there are not 40 handwriting experts 
in Venezuela. Even if the signatures under discussion were to 
be corrected during the five-day complaint period, the 
process would drag on for months. 
 
8. (C) The Chilean ambassador then suggested that the TCC or 
the OAS issue an official statement regarding the current 
situation. The Brazilian Ambassador adamantly seconded this 
request alluding to the fact that the situation was urgent 
and the governments of other Latin American countries should 
have information if they were to take action. 
 
9. (C) Diez backed off, noting that TCC was not suggesting 
that any government take action; this meeting was called 
solely to impart information. This included an \"optimistic\" 
timeline that shows a potential announcement of the results 
on March 17, if the CNE continues at its current pace. He 
made clear that the CC was not implying fraud on behalf of 
the CNE. The delays to the process until now have not been 
intentional, rather, they have been caused by administrative 
inefficiency, lack of planning and guidance, and no clear 
chain of command or communication. Reis also pointed out that 
the CC and OAS, as observers, have agreements with the CNE 
not to issue statements without clearance from the CNE. 
 
-------------------- 
Ambassador\'s Comment 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) What was planned as a routine briefing was a wake up 
call for these group of ambassadors.  The message from the 
TCC and OAS observers was clear:  the decision on the 
planillas planas will decide whether or not there will be a 
recall referendum.  There is no legal basis for rejecting 
them.  The decision is political.  President Chavez cynically 
told Brazilian foreign policy advisor Marco Aurelio Gomez on 
February 11 that he would love to have a recall because he 
would win it, but that he cannot influence the decision of 
the CNE since it is an independent branch of government. 
President Carter told the press when he was here in January 
that the will of the people signing the petitions should not 
be thwarted by legalisms.  My assessment is that is exactly 
what the pro-Chavez CNE majority intends to do.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The opposition remains convinced that the referendum 
is on track, according to a top aide for Enrique Mendoza. 
Organizers of the February 14 march to defend the signatures 
calling for a recall vote on President Hugo Chavez are 
planning on 100,000 (some hope for one million) to 
participate with some sporadic violence possible.  The march 
is an attempt to keep pressure on CNE after a month of 
relative calm among the opposition that saw little progress 
on the count.  The Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC) 
receives its CNE information from a variety of sources and 
then takes consensus decisions that are often not the most 
effective.  Traditional parties form one bloc of opinion 
within the opposition, while three parties -- Primero 
Justicia, Proyecto Venezuela, and Causa R -- flip-flop.  The 
DCC\'s executive group known as the G-5 rarely meets.  The DCC 
is close to forming a campaign committee to oversee the 
referendum.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Opposition Still Hopeful at CNE 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff met February 11 with Daniel Thiman (PROTECT), 
an aide for Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza, to 
discuss the Democratic Coordinating Committee\'s (DCC) views 
on the referendum process against President Hugo Chavez. 
(Note:  Thiman works on operations and logistics for Mendoza 
in the DCC.  While he sees himself as \"not a politician,\" he 
attends most DCC planning meetings.  End note.)  Thiman said 
the DCC remains convinced of the inevitability of the 
referendum, though he admitted some increased doubts over the 
last week due to the issue of \"plana\" signature forms (filled 
out but not signed in the same handwriting).  Still, he said 
that the date the DCC is using internally for getting a 
response from the National Electoral Commission (CNE) on the 
referendum is February 27 (Comment:  This is much sooner than 
the OAS/Carter Center estimate that the CNE would finish on 
March 16 at its current pace.  End comment.) 
 
3. (C) Poloff asked Gente de Petroleo chief Juan Fernandez on 
February 12 about the opposition\'s expectations at the CNE. 
Fernandez admitted that many opposition members are not 
following the signature count as closely as they should.  In 
the end, he said, the politicians in the opposition believe 
the CNE will strike a political solution and avoid the messy 
details.  (Comment:  This may well be the \"Venezuelan\" 
solution to the CNE\'s many troubles, though we wonder whether 
this meeting of the minds will happen.  End comment.) 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
February 14 March:  Caracas-Only Or Greater? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Asked why the opposition is pushing the February 14 
march, Fernandez said it is based on resentment between the 
DCC and the CNE.  Fernandez said that CNE director Jorge 
Rodriguez (pro-GOV) asked Mendoza in January to lower 
pressure in the media against the CNE so that the work could 
be carried out.  The DCC believes they were tricked once it 
became apparent the CNE was not going to meet the arbitrarily 
set deadline of February 13.  The DCC decided it was time to 
ratchet up the pressure, lest the count drag on interminably. 
 
5. (C) Thiman said DCC organizers of the February 14 march to 
the CNE are planning on 100,000 participants (refs a and b). 
He described the march as a \"metropolitan march,\" meaning 
that demonstrators would not be bussed in large numbers from 
around Venezuela, with the exception of some 2,000 Proyecto 
 
Venezuela participants from Carabobo.  The tactic of having 
six smaller marches rally at Plaza Venezuela and head toward 
the CNE downtown is designed to imitate a military maneuver 
that will intimidate Chavez, Thiman added.  (Note:  the GOV 
announced a \"megamercado\" of meat sales on February 14 and 15 
on Avenida Bolivar, in the path of the opposition march.  In 
the past, the opposition has skirted such events.) 
 
6. (C) Thiman expressed concern that the GOV seemed to be 
setting up the opposition for an April 11-like event in which 
an opposition march to the presidential palace turned bloody. 
 Thiman said the march did not intend to go all the way to 
CNE headquarters, which is currently surrounded by radical 
Chavez loyalists led by premiere street activist Lina Ron. 
Though organizers do not plan to come close to the Chavistas, 
Thiman worried that the march could \"get out of control.\" 
 
7. (C) Juan Fernandez said he received word that supporters 
were coming in from all over Venezuela, causing him to 
estimate that up to one million people might attend the 
march.  Fernandez said he was very worried about violence, 
pointing out that each side has radicals who want to force a 
conflict.  (Comment:  Fernandez is informed by his network of 
ex-PDVSA workers around Venezuela, but is not a march 
organizer.)  Fernandez said he was sure the main march would 
not come close to the Chavistas. 
 
----------------------------- 
Opposition:  An Idiot Savant? 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Speaking candidly, Thiman said the opposition suffers 
from several asymmetries when it comes to political battle: 
they have lots of guts but few brains.  He said the DCC has 
tremendous operational capability (organizing marches and 
signature drives) but lacks strategic sense.  He suggested 
this was the reason the opposition opted for a march on 
February 14 in order to keep pressure on the CNE. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Opposition\'s CNE Connection 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Thiman described how the opposition collects and 
processes information from the CNE.  The opposition\'s chief 
operative at the CNE is Enrique Naime (COPEI), seconded by 
Nelson Rampersaad (MAS).  Naime also has had an official 
sleeping at the CNE for the last 30 days.  In addition, each 
major political party has, as tradition has dictated, 
officials placed in key leadership positions throughout the 
CNE.  These officials report their observations to Naime and 
to their respective party chiefs.  Thiman noted also that 
opposition witnesses observing the verification process also 
report to Naime. 
 
10. (C) Naime and Rampersaad visit DCC headquarters daily and 
brief political party chiefs (secgens and presidents), who 
also receive information directly from their party members in 
the CNE.  Thiman said these meetings had been twice weekly, 
but are now being held daily.  The information is discussed 
and a consensus opinion emerges over next steps to take. 
Thiman also mentioned that Naime meets periodically with the 
OAS and Carter Center.  Thiman conceded that the need for 
consensus often prevents the opposition from choosing the 
first best solution, but it is a political reality. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Opposition\'s Party Blocs 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Thiman said that political parties are the principal 
actors in the DCC; civil society groups do not have 
significant influence on major decisions.  Traditional 
parties (AD, COPEI, and MAS) usually side together on DCC 
decisions with a collection of minor parties (Bandera Roja, 
Solidaridad, Union, etc.).  The pendulum votes are Primero 
Justicia, Proyecto Venezuela, and Causa R.  These parties 
banded together in January to chastise the other parties for 
putting priority on the regional elections instead of the 
 
referendum.  Thiman said these parties have about 15 
candidates between them, which made them averse to regional 
elections.  However, he noted that since then none of the 
parties have been in the press fighting over regional 
candidates, an example of what he called the \"tropical unity\" 
of the opposition. 
 
--------------------------- 
A Campaign Committee Coming 
--------------------------- 
 
12. (C) The DCC\'s executive committee, the so-called Group of 
5 (or G-5, consisting of Enrique Mendoza, Henrique Salas 
Romer, Julio Borges, Henry Ramos Allup, and Juan Fernandez) 
has not met in months, Thiman said.  The DCC\'s political 
committee, consisting of 60 representatives of parties and 
NGOs, will be augmented by a new \"G-17\" of full-time 
officials that will function as a campaign committee 
(\"Comando de Campana\").  Opposition leaders believe the 
campaign committee will make the opposition more agile in 
responding to Chavez on a day-to-day basis.  Thiman said 
there is almost full agreement on the formation of an 
executive campaign committee, with up to nine members, that 
will steer the DCC.  Enrique Mendoza will continue to head 
the DCC, he added. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) Thiman\'s report that the DCC is still optimistic for 
a February 27 announcement by the CNE is worrisome given the 
OAS and Carter Center believe the process will trudge on for 
another month.  We suspect this is a combination of the 
inaccurate and incomplete information as well as an 
intentional desire to maintain morale among opposition 
workers.  Still, these insights help explain why the 
opposition seems prone to error and miscalculation.  Against 
the autocratic style of its opponent, the opposition needs 
all the help it can get. 
 
14. (C) Both Thiman and Fernandez are concerned over possible 
violence on February 14, expecting a trap laid by the GOV to 
slice off another layer of potentially disloyal followers in 
the GOV and military.  Both agreed that fringe groups on 
either side could start something, which would most certainly 
be counterproductive for the opposition\'s efforts.

------------------------------------- 
Look Again: CNE To Re-hash Signatures 
Using Tougher Standards 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) OAS observers told poloff late on the evening of 
February 11 that, as expected, the CNE board will re-submit 
signature forms for the presidential recall referendum from 
11 states to an additional verification process, using a new 
stricter criteria.  OAS observers told poloff that during the 
 
inspection of the opposition\'s presidential recall signature 
forms the criteria for verification were tightened (see 
reftel), dramatically increasing the rate at which signature 
forms were referred to the CNE\'s Superior Technical Committee 
(CTS) for additional review.  The CNE\'s decision will ask 
workers to go back and look at all the forms previously 
reviewed to see if they meet the new higher standards. 
 
6. (C) A total of 25 percent of the signature forms have been 
sent to the CTS for additional review so far.  The CNE\'s 
decision to review all forms using the new tougher criteria 
could result in an additional 90,000 signature forms (or 
roughly 900,000 signatures) being referred to the CTS, 
thereby throwing as many as 50 percent of the signature forms 
into the pile to go through the heightened CTS scrutiny. 
This move will certainly slow the verification process and 
increase the number of signatures that could ultimately be 
stricken from the count. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CNE Promises Results by End of February 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez announced February 12 the 
results of the signature drive would be known by the end of 
February.  The CNE also announced that on February 12 they 
would begin to discuss establishing criteria for the CTS 
committee, which has already begun meeting without any formal 
instructions.  Visiting Carter Center representative Jennifer 
McCoy met with CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez February 12.  She 
announced that the Carter Center was concerned about public 
safety at the CNE building for the up-coming marches.  The 
OAS and Carter Center will meet together with the CNE on 
February 13. 
 
-------------------------------- 
CNE Chiefs Air Their Differences 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez, who was appointed by the 
pro-Chavez Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) party, made a 
statement February 11 to decry various unnamed \"sectors\" 
trying to hinder the CNE\'s work, alleging that opposition 
forces were pressuring the body to decide in their favor. 
Not to be outdone, CNE Vice President Ezequiel Zamora, 
appointed by the opposition, said he would ask authorities to 
remove a vocal group of pro-Chavez activists (\"chavistas\") 
camping on the sidewalk outside the CNE building.  The 
chavistas, led by pro-Chavez activist Lina Ron, posed for 
cameras and made speeches on bullhorns outside the CNE 
February 12, vowing that they would remain at the CNE to 
confront opposition marches scheduled for February 13 and 14. 
 Some wore Che Gueverra-style combat fatigues and berets. 
Nevertheless, Rodriguez announced February 12 that the 
results of the signature drive would be known by the end of 
February. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
GoV Warns Opposition, Pledges to Follow CNE Decisions 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
9. (C) Acting Foreign Minister General Arevalo Mendez told 
the Ambassador on February 12 that the opposition is trying 
to recreate the events which lead to Chavez\'s temporary 
removal in April 2002.  However, Mendez said the western 
neighborhoods of the capital will not march this time. 
Mendez said April 2002 was the only time in the country\'s 
history when Venezuelans took to the street to protest a coup 
d\'etat.  The difference between today and April 2002, said 
Mendez, is that today the \"people are organized\" and would 
prevent the opposition from attempting a coup to begin with. 
 
10. (U) Diosdado Cabello, the GoV Minister of Infrastructure 
and a long-time Chavez hard-liner, joined in the public war 
of words on February 11 by saying that the GoV knew how far 
it was willing to go \"to defend democracy\" and Chavez\'s 
self-declared bolivarian revolution.  Cabello denied that the 
GoV was planning an \"autogolpe,\" or self-coup, to stop a 
recall referendum, and repeated that the GoV would abide by 
 
the decision of the CNE. 
 
11. (U) MVR Deputy Dario Vivas announced February 12 the GOV 
would begin Carnival celebrations one week early by having 
activities such as beauty contest preliminaries at Plaza 
Venezuela, where the opposition had been planning to rally to 
distribute copies of the signatures to its marchers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Opposition Points to Sneaky Business in the CNE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
12. (C) During a February 12 meeting with the Ambassador, 
former Chavez advisor and current Chavez critic Luis 
Miquilena said he is very worried about the CNE\'s handling of 
the presidential signature drive.  Miquilena believes the 
\"fix is in\" with the CNE, and the TSJ will back them up to 
stop the referendum.  Miquilena also sees a potential for 
violence this weekend, which Chavez will use as a pretext to 
react strongly. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Conspiracy Theories Abound from Both Sides 
------------------------------------------ 
 
13. (C) Rumors persist that elements on both sides are 
planning to stage violent attacks during the February 13 and 
14 marches in an attempt to garner support.  In one scenario, 
an opposition fringe group is rumored to be instructing 
demonstrators to bring guns to the February 14 march on the 
CNE to protect against expected attacks from pro-GoV 
activists (\"chavistas\"), or to invite violence against 
themselves in order to repeat the events of April 2002, when 
the military intervened and temporarily removed Chavez. 
Other opposition rumors suggest that chavistas are willing to 
shoot their own supporters and cleverly blame it on the 
opposition in order to trigger a popular pro-Chavez outcry. 
 
14. (C) The GoV, for its part, is peddling its own conspiracy 
theories.  During a February 12 meeting with poloff, ruling 
MVR deputy Calixto Ortega painted an elaborate picture in 
which he asserted anti-GoV activists plan to infiltrate Lina 
Ron\'s group and throw explosives at the CNE building on 
February 13 or 14.  Ortega suggested this would provide cover 
for the opposition to enter the CNE, destroy evidence of 
their \"mega-fraud,\" and let them blame the GoV.  Ortega 
distanced himself from Lina Ron, asserting she was an 
uncontrollable extremist working on her own behalf.  While 
Ortega said he was sure that authorities would cooperate to 
keep violence to a minimum, he admitted that the GoV timed 
its Youth Convention (see reftel) in order to have GoV 
supporters on hand in case things \"get rough.\"

Chavez in Control of Military: Forced Departure Unlikely 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (C) Former presidential candidate and ex-Governor of Zulia 
Francisco Arias Cardenas told the Ambassador February 11 that 
President Hugo Chavez\'s solid control of the military and the 
state oil company (PDVSA) makes Chavez\'s involuntary 
departure from power unlikely in the short term.  Arias, now 
head of the Union party, claimed President Chavez purged 
military leadership very effectively since the events of 
April 11, 2002, placing loyalists in key positions.  Although 
he conceded there are still \"one or two\" higher-ranking 
officers and many mid-level officers that might support the 
opposition if Chavez flagrantly violated the constitution or 
rigged National Electoral Council (CNE) decisions, he 
discounted their overall significance.  He said Chavez 
informants have thoroughly infiltrated the military, that 
there is no mutual understanding between officers about what 
events would trigger open dissent, and that there is an 
inclination that \"this is not the right time\" for such 
dissent.  Chavez\'s public relations barrage, legitimizing his 
rule as just and democratic, and his constant, but 
\"selective,\" use of the Constitution make it difficult to 
justify any military break with his regime.  \"He is a 
dictator with the appearance of a democrat... There is no way 
for the military to organize against him.\"  Arias claimed 
Venezuelans have been approaching him on the street to tell 
him \"we\'re depending on you,\" implying Arias should use his 
military background to oppose the GOV if the recall effort 
fails.  But Arias said he did not have the influence in the 
military to provide such help. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
PDVSA: Onetime Opposition Base, Now Chavez Lifeblood 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C) Arias claimed that Chavez was using the same methods 
he used to secure control of the military with the state oil 
company (PDVSA), a process that accelerated after the 
two-month national strike that started December 2, 2002. 
Arias found it ironic that PDVSA once led the fight against 
Chavez, but was now keeping him afloat by financing his 
\"revolution.\"  He lamented that Chavez\'s increasing control 
of the armed forces, PDVSA, and the business sector would 
make any future challenge significantly more difficult for 
the opposition than previous attempts.  \"The most serious 
problem,\" said Arias, \"is that we do not have power anymore.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Failed Recall Will Lead to Protests and Panic 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Arias said that if the presidential recall is not 
approved by the CNE, there will be significant opposition 
protests and panic.  However, many public employees and 
 
 
recipients of government aid will forgo participating in any 
uprising for fear of losing their jobs or assistance, just as 
many of them decided not to participate in the signature 
drive calling for a presidential recall.  Their fear of 
reprisal will be vindicated if the recall is denied, proving 
the GOV\'s power and will to impose its political will on 
Venezuelan institutions. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Post-Chavez Administration Should Incorporate Chavistas 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. (C) If the recall is approved by the CNE, Arias predicted 
a thorough defeat for Chavez.  \"We will show them that they 
are the minority.\"  He added, however, that Chavez has 
significant support in poor neighborhoods and has armed his 
most rabid supporters.  Even if Chavez leaves peacefully, the 
next administration will have to deal with these potentially 
violent extremists, as well as Chavez sympathizers in the 
armed forces.  Arias argued that the \"war would not be won\" 
with a referendum that leads to Chavez leaving power, but 
rather when the opposition demystifies the Chavez revolution 
and incorporates the 35 to 40 percent of Venezuelans with 
pro-Chavez sympathies. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
National and Zulian Political Diagnosis 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Arias conceded that opposition parties would have 
difficulty maintaining unity during regional elections slated 
for August as \"they are all trying to protect their own 
space.\"  The Ambassador agreed, adding that the opposition 
would have to propose an agenda beyond opposing Chavez. 
Arias said this was \"slowly\" happening, and that 
gubernatorial and mayoral candidates fundamentally understand 
that they need to campaign to improve people\'s day-to-day 
lives, rather than on the coattails of national politics. 
Arias was concerned that pro-Chavez politicians have been 
successful blackmailing and corrupting both government 
officials and business leaders, particularly Interior and 
Justice Minister Lucas Rincon, and that this will prove 
useful to them during elections as they offer incentives and 
threaten to punish those tainted by deals with Chavismo. 
Although there are far more opportunists than true believers 
in Chavista ranks, Arias cautioned that appealing to 
opportunism \"has worked well\" for the GOV. 
 
 
7. (C) Arias stressed the importance of Zulia\'s oil 
resources, political significance, and the border with 
Colombia.  Neither of the Fifth Republic Movement\'s (MVR) 
front runners for governor, Calixto Ortega or Rodrigo Cabezas 
(both National Assembly), have a chance of beating Zulia 
Governor Manuel Rosales, according to Arias.  (Note: Ortega 
told poloff February 12 that he is confident he will win both 
the nomination and election.  He claimed Governor Rosales is 
not as popular as his reputation and that the Democratic 
Action party will nominate another candidate, splitting the 
opposition vote.  End Note.)  GOV forces are working hard in 
Zulia to shore up support for the eventual nominee, Arias 
noted, particularly in south Maracaibo, where they are 
\"spending a great deal of money\" through government programs 
and outright bribery.  Arias discounted the eventual success 
of this strategy.  He proposed regional and local governments 
of states on both sides of the Venezuelan-Colombia border 
take the initiative to combat border problems, as the federal 
government is not addressing border problems satisfactorily. 
 
----------------------------- 
Chavez the Great Communicator 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Arias claimed Chavez skips conventional political 
discourse by speaking directly to the people.  He said Chavez 
uses baseball and religious analogies deftly to make 
political points, using Venezuela\'s two most popular 
institutions to strip out political complexities and opposing 
viewpoints.  This is dangerous, considering many Venezuelans 
 
 
rely exclusively on his comments for social and political 
information, and is one reason his supporters remain loyal. 
Arias lamented that it is \"almost impossible\" to convince 
Chavez\'s core supporters that their \"savior\" might be wrong 
about anything, but that it would be impossible for Venezuela 
to \"go on without the Chavistas.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Unlike many opposition leaders, Arias has full 
appreciation for Chavez\'s intellect and abilities, and his 
assessment of the military\'s incapacity to stand up to Chavez 
is sobering.  His analysis of the importance of incorporating 
Chavistas in a post-Chavez Venezuela is sound.  Former 
Chavistas like Arias will be key to convincing Chavez\'s 
supporters that there is life after Chavez.

SUBJECT: GROWING PRESSURE FOR RENEGOTIATION OF OIL SERVICE 
CONTRACTS? 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES S. SHAPIRO; REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  There are signs that the GOV has started playing 
hardball in its efforts to force the oil companies that 
signed operating service agreements in the 1990\'s to convert 
these contracts into the majority GOV-owned joint ventures 
mandated under the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law.  Public claims by 
the Minister of Energy and Mines that two companies have 
already signed agreements have been disputed but Harvest 
International, a U.S. independent, is currently evaluating 
two oil and gas fields located close to its existing fields 
and hopes to negotiate the first such agreement. 
ChevronTexaco, with the largest exposure of any U.S. company, 
is dismissive of any efforts by the GOV to bring pressure in 
this area but others confirm that in addition to the \"carrot\" 
of potential access to new fields for those companies that 
review their contracts, PDVSA has used the \"stick\" of 
refusing to approve capital expenditures proposed by some 
operators in their 2004 budgets and setting production 
constraints for 2004.  For the Chavez government, a win on 
forcing companies to migrate into relationships under the 
2001 Hydrocarbons Law may be more important than a \"few\" 
incremental barrels from the operating agreements.  That 
said, we do not at this time expect the pressure to reach the 
point where the GOV would outright violate existing 
agreements although it could certainly make it more difficult 
for the companies to do business.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
GOV GETS SERIOUS ABOUT PUSHING HYDROCARBONS LAW? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) On January 12, Minister of Energy and Mines Rafael 
Ramirez_ said publicly that international operators in 
Venezuela will not be able to increase production without 
transferring their operating agreements to joint ventures 
under the terms of the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law.  The Minister\'s 
comments have been followed by reports that PDVSA is not only 
refusing to approve capital expenditures proposed by the 
operators in their 2004 budgets but is setting production 
constraints for 2004.  The GOV is also still refusing to 
authorize the 2003 transfer of British Petroleum\'s (BP) 
operating agreements for the DZO and Boqueron fields to 
French independent Perenco and is reportedly arguing that 
while the contracts with BP were grandfathered under the 2001 
law, this would not apply if the contracts were transferred 
to Perenco.  These events have sparked concern that the GOV 
has started playing hardball in its efforts to force the 
companies that signed operating service agreements in the 
1990\'s to convert these contracts into the majority GOV-owned 
joint ventures mandated under the 2001 law. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (U) In the 1990\'s, PDVSA planned an ambitious expansion 
program to capture a greater share of global energy markets. 
An economically viable way to achieve this goal was for PDVSA 
to enter into operating contracts for the reactivation of 
marginal oil fields with foreign investors who had the 
much-needed capital.  The result was 33 \"Operating 
Agreements,\" granted in three investment \"rounds.\"  The 
foreign investors signed 20-year contracts to develop these 
fields at the investors\' own expense. 
 
3. (U) Under these contracts, the foreign investors receive a 
fee per barrel produced from PDVSA.  Against this revenue, 
the investors may deduct the operating expenses (i.e, the 
\"operating fee\") incurred during the year.  A \"capital fee,\" 
to allow the recovery of capital expenditures incurred by the 
foreign investor on behalf of PDVSA, is also recoverable over 
ten years according to a complicated formula.  The contracts 
typically provide for a maximum total fee that may be charged 
by the investor and recovered during any given year.  Any 
fees allowable for the year, but not recovered because of the 
imposition of the maximum total fee, are carried forward to 
 
 
the next year and subject to applicable interest and 
inflation rate adjustments until the costs are recovered by 
the investor.  PDVSA pays royalties on the oil while the 
investor pays a 34 percent income tax. 
 
4. (SBU) The Chavez government, however, has rolled back the 
expansionary policy of the 1990\'s and made clear it 
particularly dislikes the operating agreement contracts. 
This distaste was codified in the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law that 
stipulated that future private sector investment in the 
Venezuelan oil sector must be through joint venture 
agreements in which the GOV will take a minimum 51 percent 
stake.  The law also increased most royalty payments from 
16.67 percent to 30 percent and changed other aspects of the 
tax structure.  Finally, the joint venture will not be able 
to commercialize the oil it produces, which must instead be 
sold through PDVSA or some other state entity.  Although the 
joint venture model would potentially give a company an 
equity stake in the oil it produces that it does not have 
under the current service agreement model, the companies 
claim that the economics simply do not support investment in 
projects under the 2001 law.   There have, to date, been no 
investments under the law and the GOV continues to complain 
about the administrative costs of managing the contracts and 
that the oil produced under the operating agreement contracts 
is \"high cost\" oil. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
VINCCLER & TEIKOKU DISPUTE MINISTER,S REMARKS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) In his January 12 remarks, according to press reports, 
Ramirez_ went on to add that two companies, Japan\'s Teikoku 
and Vinccler, a majority Venezuelan-owned company with a U.S. 
component, had already negotiated conversion of their 
operating agreements to joint venture agreements with PDVSA. 
In subsequent conversations with econoff, executives with 
Vinccler and Teikoku confirmed on-going discussions with the 
GOV concerning new gas (not oil) opportunities in their 
fields but denied that any contracts have been signed. 
Vinccler Technical Manager Emilio Sanchez_ said the Ministry 
had proposed to the company in July 2003 that its current 
operating agreement for the Round II Falcon East block be 
converted into a gas license for the entire area of the 
block.  Noting that the field produces less than 1,000 b/d, 
Sanchez_ said Vinccler is most interesting in expanding its 
business into the production of associated gas and, 
eventually, the development of off-shore gas.  In these 
circumstances, work is ongoing on an agreement to modify the 
operating contract into an agreement for associated gas and 
liquids, under which Vinccler will be paid a flat fee for the 
liquids.  Sanchez_ flatly denied, however, that Vinccler would 
agree to the 51-49 percent structure mandated by the 
Hydrocarbons Law. 
 
6. (C) Matsuro Manabe, President of Teikoku Oil de Venezuela, 
confirmed to econoff on January 23 that Teikoku\'s current 
interests in Venezuela are also focused on gas opportunities. 
 Teikoku currently has two operating agreements:  the East 
Guarico field acquired in the first round and the second 
round Sanvi-Guere field.  Production from the two fields 
totals about 6,000 b/d.  Manabe explained that the company is 
already producing associated gas from the East Guarico field 
and that seismic data by PDVSA/Teikoku on an adjacent area 
north of the field shows great potential for further gas 
development. 
 
------------------------------------ 
A U.S. COMPANY HOPES TO BE THE FIRST 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) A U.S. independent, Harvest International, does hope 
to be the first to negotiate a contract under the terms of 
the Hydrocarbons Law.  Harvest has an 80 percent share in 
Benton-Vinccler, that has operated three small oil fields in 
southern Monagas state since signature of a first round 
operating service agreement in 1992.  In November, Harvest 
announced that it had signed an agreement with PDVSA to 
undertake a six-month evaluation of two oil and gas fields 
(Temblador and El Salto) located close to its existing 
fields.  Any agreement on the two new fields is likely to be 
 
 
accompanied by re-negotiation of the original operating 
services agreement. 
 
8. (C) In a November conversation with econoff, Harvest CFO 
Steve Tholen said that Benton-Vinccler has one of the most 
profitable operating service contracts in Venezuela.  Thus, 
it would be a public relations victory for PDVSA and the 
Ministry if they were able to announce that Harvest had 
agreed its operations could be profitable under the 
provisions of the 2001 law.  The most complex part of the 
negotiation will cover the corporate structure.  Tholen 
emphasized that Harvest would insist on a structure that 
would allow the joint venture to focus on project economics 
and would allow Harvest to both book the reserves and have 
operating control (i.e., of such issues as the accounting 
rules).  According to Tholen, Harvest envisions a structure 
where a majority government-owned joint venture company would 
in turn contract actual field operations to a company in 
which Harvest would hold the majority share.  Benton-Vinccler 
employee John Paul McKee told econoff January 28 that the 
transfer of data from PDVSA needed for evaluation of the two 
fields has gone more slowly than anticipated but that the 
review is on-going. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
LAWYERS AGREE THAT RE-NEGOTIATION WOULD BE TOUGH 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
9. (C) Econoff discussed the complexities of re-negotiating 
the operating agreement contracts with several local 
attorneys whose practices focus on energy law.  They all 
agreed that it would be particularly difficult to quantify 
the sunk costs not yet re-paid under the capital fee.  Steel 
Hector & Davis attorney Alfredo Anzola, however, confirmed 
February 9 that his firm has been contracted to draft a model 
joint venture agreement to guide CVP in its discussions with 
companies.  Anzola added that CVP is \"under a lot of pressure 
to advance this as quickly as possible\" and said the model 
agreement would be provided to CVP that day.  Anzola 
specifically informed econoff that the CVP had said \"no\" to 
what he called \"sham structures\" that would allow the private 
investor to control the joint venture operations. 
 
------------------------------ 
CHEVRONTEXACO NOT CONCERNED... 
------------------------------ 
 
10. (C) Econoff discussed the issue with ChevronTexaco de 
Venezuela President Ali Moshiri who confirmed that he has 
been asked informally if ChevronTexaco would be willing to 
convert its contracts.  (Note:  With substantial investment 
in the Round Two Boscan field, and the LL-652 field acquired 
in Round Three, ChevronTexaco could have more to lose than 
any other U.S. company from any push by the GOV to force the 
migration of the operating agreement contracts.  End Note.) 
Moshiri said bluntly that he believes Ramirez_ was simply 
trying to make political points in his remarks of January 12. 
 He added that he believes neither PDVSA nor the Ministry 
have legal staffs capable of handling such negotiations. 
(Note:  Steel Hector & David attorney Anzola confirmed that 
the legal staff at CVP are all new hires; he does not know 
yet whether CVP will contract out the negotiating process.) 
When econoff informed Moshiri that the CVP has contracted 
with outside legal counsel to draft a model joint venture 
agreement, Moshiri emphasized that the important issue will 
not be the terms and conditions of any agreement but the 
economics of the deal.  Saying \"if we get equity barrels, the 
deal may not be bad,\" Moshiri said he would be interested to 
see what kind of offers would be made.  He emphasized, 
however, that ChevronTexaco will not accept a deal that 
prejudices the economics of its operations. 
 
------------------------------- 
BUT OTHERS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE SO 
------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Moshiri was also dismissive of reports that PDVSA is 
not only refusing to approve capital expenditures proposed by 
the operators in their 2004 budgets but is also setting 
production constraints for 2004.  Moshiri said \"they,re 
telling us to produce.\"  In subsequent conversations, 
 
 
however, ExxonMobil President Mark Ward and Williams General 
Manager Tim Penton confirmed these reports of problems with 
approvals of capital expenditures to econoff.  (Note: 
ExxonMobil and Williams have non-operational shares in the 
second round Quiamare-La Ceiba and third round La Concepcion 
fields respectively.)  Petrobras, which operates the La 
Concepcion field, reported in the January producers luncheon 
that PDVSA had approved its 2004 budget with severe cuts in 
capital and expenses as well as setting production limits 
below its current production level. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
12. (C) There might seem to be a discrepancy between the 
GOV\'s need for every barrel it can lay its hands on versus a 
strategy in which it would take possible production cuts in 
order to force the producers to accept contract negotiations 
under the 2001 law.  We believe, however, that for senior 
officials of the Chavez government a win on the 2001 
Hydrocarbons Law may be more important than a \"few\" 
incremental barrels from the operating agreements.  PDVSA 
may, indeed, be losing money on some of these contracts.  We 
do not at this time expect the pressure to reach the point 
where the GOV would outright violate the existing agreements. 
 That said, however, the GOV could definitely make life more 
difficult for the companies. 
 
13. (C) Companies other than Harvest are sure to bite if the 
carrot, perhaps in the form of payment of monies owed by 
PDVSA on their existing investments or new fields, is big 
enough.  Steel Hector & David attorney Anzola believes Shell 
is likely to be the first company approached with the model 
draft, followed by Repsol.

2. (U) THE INFLATIONARY PASS-THROUGH FROM THE GOV\'S FEBRUARY

MINISTRY OF PRODUCTION AND COMMERCE RAISED THE CEILINGS ON A

PASTEURIZED WHITE CHEESE, COFFEE AND CORN AND SUNFLOWER OILS. 
 THE PRICE HIKES RANGED FROM 10 PERCENT ON CORN FLOUR TO 30 
PERCENT ON COFFEE.  THE MINISTRY COMPLETELY REMOVED PRICE 
CONTROLS ON PASTEURIZED MILK.  THE INCREASES CAME AFTER 
PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM MINISTER OF FINANCE TOBIAS NOBREGA 
DISCOUNTING IMMEDIATE INFLATIONARY EFFECTS FROM THE 
DEVALUATION. 
 
--------------------- 
SURPRISED? YES, AND... 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) LUIS ZAMBRANO, CHIEF ECONOMIST OF BANCO MERCANTIL, 
VENEZUELA\'S LARGEST BANK, TOLD ECONOFF FEBRUARY 11 THE TIMING 
OF THE DEVALUATION WAS A SURPRISE.  HE SAID BANCO MERCANTIL 
HAD EXPECTED A DEVALUATION IN 2004, BUT NOT UNTIL A 
RESOLUTION OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS.  ZAMBRANO 
PRESENTED THE BANK\'S THREE NEW ECONOMIC SCENARIOS FOR THE 
YEAR BASED ON CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION OR 
POLITICALLY STRONGER OR WEAKER SUCCESSOR GOVERNMENTS TO THE 
CHAVEZ REGIME.  UNDER ALL THREE SCENARIOS, HE EXPECTED 
INFLATION TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAT THE GOV PROJECTED 25 PERCENT 
FOR THE YEAR.  THE ESTIMATES RANGED FROM 35 PERCENT UNDER A 
WEAK SUCCESSOR GOVERNMENT TO JUST OVER 40 PERCENT SHOULD 
    CHAVEZ CONTINUE IN POWER.  DESPITE HIGHER INFLATION, ZAMBRANO 
FORESAW POSITIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR 2004 RANGING BETWEEN 7.6 
PERCENT UNDER A CONTINUED CHAVEZ REGIME AND 9.2 PERCENT UNDER 
A WEAKER TRANSITION GOVERNMENT.  BANCO MERCANTIL PROJECTED 
BETWEEN USD 3 AND 4 BILLION IN DEBT PLACEMENTS THIS YEAR. 
 
-- 
NO

4. (SBU) FROM BANCO MERCANTIL\'S CHIEF RIVAL, BANCO 
PROVINCIAL, THE VIEW WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.  BANCO 
PROVINCIAL CHIEF ECONOMIST GIOVANNI DI PLACIDO TOLD ECONOFF 
FEBRUARY 12 THAT THE DEVALUATION WAS NOT A SURPRISE TO HIM 
PRECISELY BECAUSE OF EXPECTED DEBT ISSUANCES.  HE SAID GOV 
REFINANCING OF INTERNAL DEBT WITH EXTERNAL DOLLAR-BOND ISSUES 
WAS IMMINENT AND THE DEVALUATION WAS SIMPLY A WAY OF LOWERING 
THE UP-FRONT COSTS OF THOSE EXERCISES.  UNLIKE ZAMBRANO, DI 
PLACIDO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAVEZ\'S RECENT BOUNCE IN 
PUBLIC OPINION POLLS AS PROVIDING A POLITICAL MARGIN FOR 
ERROR THAT WOULD CUSHION ANY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE 
DEVALUATION AND THE ENSUING UP-TICK IN INFLATION.  DI PLACIDO 
ALSO WAS MORE CONSERVATIVE IN HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE 
INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE DEVALUATION WITH A PROJECTION OF 
ANOTHER 4.5 TO 5 PERCENT ON TOP OF THE EXPECTED GOV RATE OF 
25 PERCENT.  HIS PROJECTION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE YEAR 
 
CARACAS 00000549  002 OF 002 
 
PLACIDO\'S CONVICTION THAT THE INFLATIONARY 
EFFECT OF DEVALUATION WILL BE RELATIVELY MILD, THE FISCAL 
POLICIES OF THE GOV LIKELY WILL FUEL HIGHER INFLATION THAN 
LAST YEAR\'S 27.1 PERCENT (REF B).  THAT FIGURE INCLUDED A 
HOST OF PRICE-CONTROLLED STAPLES THAT WILL HAVE TO BE 
ADJUSTED TO THE BOLIVAR\'S NEW VALUE.  HOWEVER, THE GOV HAS 
BEEN REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL IN ITS BOND OPERATIONS OVER THE 
PAST YEAR AND THE HIGH YIELD BONDS ARE ATTRACTIVE VEHICLES 
FOR INVESTORS.  THE NET RESULT FROM FUTURE DOLLAR-CONVERTIBLE 
BOND ISSUES WILL BE SOME TEMPORARY PULL BACK ON THE 
UNOFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, WHICH HAS AT TIMES TOPPED TWICE THE 
OFFICIAL RATE, AND A SOFTENING OF INFLATION FROM THAT 
QUARTER.  THE HIGH-SPENDING WAYS OF THE CHAVEZ GOVERNMENT 
ALSO FIGURE IN THE MIX, SO THAT INFLATION WILL PROBABLY 
NECESSITATE ANOTHER DEVALUATION BEFORE YEAR\'S END.

End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Carter Center Calls on CNE to Finish the Count 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (U) In a February 13 statement issued after a meeting with 
officials of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Carter 
Center representative Fernando Jaramillo and Jennifer McCoy 
called on the CNE to publish a firm schedule of events 
through which they could finish their verification of 
signature sheets no later than February 28.  (Note: a copy of 
the Carter Center statement has been forwarded to WHA/AND). 
The statement reviewed the integral involvement of the OAS 
and Carter Center as observers in the signature collection 
and verification process, and noted \"technical obstacles\" 
that kept the CNE\'s Superior Technical Committee (CTS) from 
fully reviewing all the signature forms submitted.  These 
obstacles, the statement said, were due to the immense volume 
of forms referred to the committee and the \"new character\" of 
the process. 
 
8. (U) The statement said the Carter Center and the OAS are 
encouraged that the CNE announced February 12 that it would 
finish the verification process by end of the month, and 
encouraged the CNE to publish the results by that time.  In 
addition, the Carter Center and OAS encouraged the CNE to 
publish a schedule and comply with it, and urged transparency 
in all control mechanisms to guard against fraud. 
 
9. (U) Quoting former President Jimmy Carter, the statement 
said the expression of the people must take precedence over 
any legal technicality in counting the signatures.  Lastly, 
the statement said the CNE must be allowed to develop the 
process without political pressures, and urged all parties to 
express their concerns through peaceful means, without 
intimidating the CNE or its facilities. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
OAS Privately Skeptical of New Deadline 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) In a February 13 meeting, OAS observer Marcelo 
Alvarez confided to poloff that a February 28 deadline would 
most likely be impossible to meet logistically.  Alvarez said 
that setting another date effectively kicks the ball down the 
field, taking pressure off this weekend. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CNE Director Hints at New Schedule 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) When he arrived for a February 13 meeting with OAS 
and Carter Center representatives, CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez told the media that the signature results woudl be 
know by the end of the month.  Rodriguez also said security 
had been reinforced around the CNE building.  Additionally, 
Rodriguez announced on February 12 that the CNE\'s Superior 
Technical Committee (CTS) will be increased from 39 to 78 
members to accelerate the review of the signature forms. 
 
12. (C) OAS observer Julio Alvarez told poloff February 13 
that the CNE\'s computer check of the signature sheets has 
begun.  The CTS expects to receive instructions on February 
16.  They have not yet implemented the quality control step, 
in which a CNE supervisor reviews signatures that do not 
match the electoral registry.  Alvarez estimates it will take 
ten days per drive to perform the quality control step, but 
could be shortened by adding more staff.  The results of that 
step must be re-submitted for transcription to fix any error. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Opposition Leaders Abused, Chavez Blocks Broadcast 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
13. (C) Pro-Chavez activists (\"chavistas\") in battle dress 
camping out in front of the CNE building make good on their 
pledge to physically keep the opposition away from the CNE. 
As various opposition leaders approached the CNE headquarters 
on February 13, they were threatened, pushed, and otherwise 
ejected from the area.  National Assembly deputy Leopoldo 
Martinez (Causa R) told poloff February 13 that deputy Andres 
Velazquez was threatened by a man who pointed a pistol at his 
head when he tried to get near the CNE building.  According 
to Martinez, nearby National Guard troops refused to protect 
Velasquez, and instead told him to go away before more 
trouble erupts. 
 
14. (C) Threats are not limited to oppositon leaders 
approaching the CNE building. DCC operative Amado Dounia told 
poloff February 13 that Enrique Naime, a long-time Copei 
activists and chief CNE monitor for the DCC, has received a 
death threat against his 17-year-old daughter if he continues 
his work at the CNE. 
 
15. (U) Private television coverage showing crowds of 
pro-Chavez activists pushing and ripping the clothes of 
opposition leaders was interrupted on the afternoon of 
February 13 by a \"cadena\" broadcast by Chavez, in which the 
GoV instituted a mandatory broadcast on all media outlets. 
Chavez showed samples of the opposition\'s alleged 
\"megafraud,\" drawn from copies of signature forms. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Opposition Figures Not Encouraging 
---------------------------------- 
 
16. (C) Regardless of the deadline, Amado Dounia, a 
statistics manager for the DCC, told poloff February 13 that 
the new review of signature forms does not bode well for the 
chances of a getting a recall referendum.  With 93,000 forms 
currently in the CTS, Dounia calculates that, assuming a 
successful review rate of 25 percent, they could still 
trigger the referendum.  If 180,000-200,000 forms goes to the 
CTS for review via the new physical inspection, Dounia said 
the referendum will be lost.  All depends on how many 
criteria the CNE decides to apply, he concluded. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Opposition Defiant; Nervously Planning March 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
17. (U) Enrique Naime, spokesman for the broad opposition 
Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC) told the press early 
February 13 that the opposition would continue to protest 
until the CNE declared a recall referendum, scheduled an 
election, and published norms for its decisions.  Naime noted 
that the GoV was making the most noise because they \"have 
defeat painted on their face.\" 
 
18. (C) During a February 13 meeting with poloff, Lisette 
Behrens, legal adviser of the Democratic Coordinating 
Committee (DCC), said the DCC is still planning to press 
their march on February 14 to protest the continued shift in 
the CNE\'s verification rules.  Behrens expects over 600,000 
demonstrators.  Behrens said she and other DCC leaders met 
February 12 with officials of the Ministry of Interior and 
Justice to discuss security for the march.  The ministry 
officials not only refused to guarantee security, but also 
tried to convince the opposition to send the marchers to 
other areas the opposition regards as unsafe or too small for 
their numbers.  The GOV has already made the most direct 
route to the CNE difficult by scheduling a meat market on the 
same route.  To avoid attacks, opposition leaders plan to 
decided the actual march route on the night of February 13. 
Behrens said opposition marchers have been instructed not to 
carry weapons of any sort, to deny Chavez the ability to 
blame them for any outbreaks of violence.  Behrens spoke with 
concern about the Democratic Bloc, a small opposition fringe 
group who does not believe in the referendum. 
 
19. (C) Opposition National Assembly deputy Leopoldo Martinez 
 
is less sure.  Martinez told poloff February 13 that he 
doubted the success of the February 14 march.  People might 
go to Plaza Venezuela to get their signature, but not toward 
the CNE for fear of violence.  He said the Avenida Bolivar 
meat market spoils their plans.  Alternate routes are also 
dangerous and all empty out at Plaza Caracas, where 
pro-Chavez activists are waiting. 
 
------------------------------ 
Sporadic Protests Turn Violent 
------------------------------ 
 
20. (U) Various opposition street protests broke out on the 
evening of February 12 in cities across the country in the 
wake of the announcement of the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) to postpone a decision to schedule a recall referendum 
on the rule of President Hugo Chavez (reftel).  Several 
protests were directed specifically against regional offices 
of the CNE.  A national student coordinating group is 
apparently organizing protests against the CNE, with protests 
fueled by student groups launched in Anzoategui, Trujillo, 
Merida and Valencia.  In some cases, confrontations between 
protesters and security forces turned violent.  In Merida, a 
protest near the University of Los Andes sparked 
confrontations with local police that shut down businesses 
and blocked traffic throughout the day.  A truce was reached 
between student leaders and police late in the afternoon, but 
street violence erupted again by the evening, eventually 
broken up by police with tear gas and rubber pellets. 
Twenty-five protesters were reported injured, among them a 
journalist.  In Valencia, protesters near the Technical 
University confronted police in response to the arrest of 
eight student leaders.  Several buses were set ablaze and 
university buildings were ransacked over the course of the 
evening. 
 
21. (U) Unrest broke out in several state capitals February 
12, resulting in injuries and detentions, but no deaths.  The 
most heated protest occurred in Merida, where three student 
demonstrators and one press photographer, Victor Serra, were 
injured by rubber bullets or tear gas.  In Valencia, Carabobo 
state, students briefly held hostages and seized two 
vehicles.  A standoff between opposition and GOV supporters 
in Anzoategui state occurred outside the local CNE branch 
office.  GOV supporters also allegedly attacked the Social 
Christian (COPEI) headquarters in Aragua state. 
 
22. (U) The original purpose for most of the marches was to 
celebrate the Day of Youth, when students joined in a battle 
against colonial Spain.  Some students were protesting arrest 
of student leaders accused of rebellion for the evenets in 
April 2002.  However, the marches took on political 
significance following the CNE\'s decision to review signature 
forms.  A majority of the demonstrators were students, joined 
by political parties and civic groups. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GoV Denies Violent Demonstrations Took Place 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
23. (U) Vice-President Rangel dismissed the February 12 
demonstrations as staged events, perpetrated by the 
opposition-controlled media.  He claimed the opposition was 
panicking because it realizes it doesn\'t have enough 
signatures to convoke a presidential recall referendum. 
 
-------------------------- 
GoV Orders Heliport Closed 
-------------------------- 
 
24. (U) The Avila Heliport, the principal launching site for 
helicopters run by private media organizations in Caracas, 
was ordered closed February 14 by the GoV\'s Ministry of 
Infrastructure.  The last time the GoV closed the heliport 
was during the opposition\'s exercise to collect signatures 
seeking a recall referendum.

(d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) On 07 February, the Ambassador met with a group of 
opposition \"wise-men\" who made a presentation on a plan for a 
unified candidate to run for president in elections following 
an eventual recall referendum. The group claimed that the 
plan had possible widespread support among leaders of the 
opposition, ranging from civic groups and the Catholic 
Church, to the main political parties and potential 
candidates. The centerpiece of the presentation was a plan 
for a two-stage primary to choose the candidate. The NGO 
SUMATE would organize the primary. The exact timing of each 
aspect of the primary process had been extensively debated, 
and was not finally decided in all its points. The main 
conclusion was that the primaries would be announced around 
the time the referendum was officially approved by the CNE, 
and that the final phase would take place after the 
referendum. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by EmbOff notetaker, met 
with Carmelo Lauria (ex-Minister, AD), Gustavo Tarre Briceno 
(ex-Deputy, COPEI), Carlos Blanco (columnist for El 
Universal, ex-Minister, AD), Joaquin Marta Sosa (author, 
ex-head of VTV), Fernando Martinez Mottola (ex-Minister, 
ex-head of CANTV), and Maria Corina Machado (SUMATE). The 
group is composed of retired politicians, columnists, and 
members of the private sector who have met weekly for 10 
years to discuss politics. The group has been consulting with 
SUMATE over proposals for selecting a single opposition 
candidate. 
 
-------------- 
Why Primaries? 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Martinez made a presentation on the debate over the 
best system to choose a unified opposition candidate. He and 
several of those present were part of a larger group that has 
been circulating among the opposition, trying to arrive at a 
consensus on the best way to resolve several issues. They 
presented an impressive list of the groups they have spoken 
to, and who they claim have agreed to the plan. 
 
4. (C) The group starts from the premise that support for the 
recall of Chavez is much stronger than that of the 
opposition\'s candidates against Chavez. So while the 
referendum will be won if it is allowed, the election could 
still be lost, especially since Chavez himself is much more 
popular than any single opposition leader. Martinez stressed 
the importance of the opposition developing a positive 
message for the future to attract those anti-Chavistas who do 
not support any of the opposition candidates (a figure the 
presentation put at 13%), and the 10% swing vote between the 
opposition and Chavez. 
 
5. (C) According to Martinez, a primary is the only option 
that enjoys widespread support, and seems likely to give the 
eventual winner legitimacy beyond hard-core anti-Chavistas. 
It is also seen as the best way to force the potential 
candidates to develop a positive forward-looking campaign, to 
counter Chavez\' relatively clear political message. To this 
end, Martinez proposed a tightly structured debate for the 
candidates, forcing them to address the issues of the day, 
and not just attack one another. The main difficulty of a 
primary is its organization within the tight schedule 
provided by the Constitution, which stipulates 30 days 
between the referendum, and the ensuing presidential 
elections. Machado was confident that SUMATE could organize 
and execute the primary. 
 
------------------ 
Unresolved Issues 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) Martinez\' presentation stressed six main issues that 
 
still need to be resolved. 
 
Announcement of the primaries: A consensus was emerging that 
the announcement of the primary could come as soon as the CNE 
declared a referendum. 
 
Before or after the referendum? While their are good 
arguments on both sides, the thinking now is to launch the 
two-stage primary after the referendum, though organization 
and campaigning might begin before-hand. 
 
CNE intervention: The constitution dictates that the CNE 
oversee elections of party officials, which could impede a 
possible primary. Machado believes there is a legal argument 
to avoid CNE involvement, as an opposition candidate is not a 
party official. 
 
Candidate eligibility: Candidates would be required to 
present signatures proposing them for the ballot. The group 
tended toward a low threshold (10,000 signatures) in order to 
keep most potential candidates inside the process. 
 
One round or two? Two rounds would produce a unified 
candidate with a majority backing, while a single round among 
all candidates could produce a winner by a slim margin. Only 
if one candidate got 40% or more of the vote, and 10% more 
than the next person, would the second round be suspended. 
The members of the G5 have reportedly accepted the plan, as 
have Celia Sosa, Manuel Cova, Americo Martin, and Enrique 
Tejera Paris. Salas Romer has agreed, but wants a primary 
with no runoff. Only Teodoro Petkoff has rejected the plan. 
 
Who can vote? Should the primary depend on the electoral 
registry or those who signed the \"Reafirmazo\"? The group 
leaned toward a broader and inclusive process. 
 
------------ 
Can it work? 
------------ 
 
 
10. (C) Blanco insisted repeatedly that no one would 
participate in the process unless they were assured that the 
winner would not only be the sole candidate, but would have 
the full organizational support of all the other parties. 
Martinez felt that Mendoza would probably withdraw to run in 
2006 if he saw he could not win the primary. The group noted 
that Henrique Salas Romer was supporting the plan because it 
has not emanated from the CD, which Salas views as Mendoza\'s 
campaign committee . 
 
11. (C) Joaquin Marta Sosa is working on a consensus campaign 
platform and a more basic plan of governability for the 
opposition. But irreducible differences would need to be 
solved by allowing the candidates to run in the primary on 
those issues where they differ. The main issue is whether the 
candidates will run again in 2006 if they win (Henrique Salas 
Romer), serve only until 2006 (Enrique Mendoza), or serve 
only as an interim leader (Manuel Cova). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C) The opposition has got a number of issues it must 
deal with simultaneously: getting the CNE to set a date for a 
referendum, winning the referendum, settling on a single 
opposition candidate for president, developing a unified 
campaign organization and platform, and winning the election 
are the near and medium-term tasks. This proposal helps 
resolve the candidate and platform issues, while the 
coordinadora focuses on the CNE. The group was confident 
their proposal would be accepted by all the interested 
groups. The key to its ability to achieve this feat seems to 
have been a preference for negotiation and compromise over 
demands and impositions. Getting Salas to agree has been the 
most impressive accomplishment so far. If it is as close to 
acceptance by all candidates as they claim, this group will 
have provided a tremendous service to the opposition.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) WHA DAS Peter DeShazo told Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel on February 16 that the world is watching the manner 
in which the National Electoral Council(CNE) carries out the 
signature count on the recall petition against President Hugo 
Chavez.  DAS DeShazo expressed full support for the work of 
the OAS and Carter Center in providing international 
observation of the signature verification process.  He urged 
the GOV to give precedence to the will of the citizens over 
technicalities in the verification process.  VP Rangel 
countered that the USG is trying to place the opinion of the 
OAS and Carter Center over the decision of the CNE, which has 
sovereign authority in the matter.  He challenged the USG to 
declare its willingness to respect the CNE\'s decision 
regardless of the outcomes.  DeShazo reiterated several times 
that the process must be transparent, fair, and respectful of 
citizens who signed in good faith.  Individual press 
statements by both DeShazo and Rangel after the meeting 
echoed the same sentiments.  End Summary.

2. (C) WHA DAS Peter DeShazo, accompanied by the Ambassador, 
met with Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel on February 16. 
New Foreign Minister Jesus Perez, MFA Chief of Staff Arevalo 
Mendez, North American Deskoff Rebeca Guevara, and poloff 
(notetaker) also attended.  DAS DeShazo started by expressing 
the USG\'s full support for the work of the OAS and Carter 
Center in the signature verification process, especially of 
the statement issued by the two institutions on February 13 
(ref).  DeShazo said the USG is concerned that the National 
Electoral Council CNE) is apparently raising excessive 
technicalities in the signature verification process in the 
various recall drives, including against President Hugo 
Chavez.  DAS DeShazo expressed concern that these technical 
issues are being given prevalence over the will of citizens 
who signed the petition against Chavez in good faith. 
DeShazo said the USG values very much the opinion of the OAS 
and Carter Center in the process.

3. (C) Rangel responded that the OAS and Carter Center are 
invited as observers by the CNE, the only entity that can 
call the referendum.  Rangel repeatedly tried to trap DAS 
DeShazo into saying that the OAS and Carter Center were 
\"above\" the CNE.  DeShazo replied each time that we support 
the OAS and Carter Center observation effort.  Rangel accused 
the USG of attempting to supplant the OAS and Carter Center 
over the CNE.  He said the GOV will respect the decision of 
the CNE no matter what (though he noted that both the GOV and 
the opposition would have the right to appeal the decision to 
the Supreme Court).  He challenged the USG to commit to 
respect the decision of the CNE, suggesting that the USG 
would not respect a decision that favored President Chavez. 
Rangel said the \"will of the people\" is respected in 
Venezuela better than any other country because its 
constitution permits the recall of elected officials.  Rangel 
objected to labelling as \"technicalities\" serious problems 
like signatures by the deceased, signatures by foreigners, 
and multiple signatures by the same person.  Rangel noted 
that the signature forms presented by GOV supporters against 
opposition deputies contained many errors as well. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Means Just As Important As the Ends 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) DAS DeShazo assured Rangel the USG respected the 
 
sovereignty of Venezuela and the authority of the CNE, 
however, he noted that transparency in the process is 
crucial, something that can only be helped by OAS and Carter 
Center participation.  These institutions have raised the 
existence of problems, such as the treatment of the 
\"planillas planas\" (signature forms in which required 
information was filled out by one person and then signed by 
individual signatories).  Declining to answer Rangel\'s demand 
that the USG commit to respect the final CNE decision, 
DeShazo insisted several times that the manner in which the 
decision is carried out is just as critical.  It must be 
transparent and fair and give precedence to the will of the 
citizens, he told the Vice President.  The USG and the rest 
of the world would draw its conclusions based on these 
criteria, DeShazo concluded. 
 
---------------------------- 
Press Statements Trade Shots 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Speaking to press after the meeting, DAS DeShazo 
reiterated USG support for the OAS and Carter Center, noting 
that their presence facilitated a peaceful, constitutional, 
democratic and legal solution in accordance with OAS 
Resolution 833.  He backed up the observers\' joint statement 
of February 13, highlighting the need to favor popular 
expression over excessive technicalities.  In response to a 
question, DAS DeShazo recognized that the CNE will make the 
decision, but that it should do so free of political 
pressure.  Asked about recent charges by President Chavez 
that the USG is funding allegedly seditious NGOs via the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), DeShazo pointed out 
that the NED\'s work has an established track record for 
supporting democracy worldwide and is open to a wide range of 
political actors.  Both sides in Venezuela have received 
funding, DeShazo noted. 
 
6. (U) VP Rangel, after meeting with DeShazo, told reporters 
he welcomed OAS and Carter Center participation.  He said 
they would widen international observation to include other 
groups that observed the signature drives.  He also warned 
the USG to refrain from casting the OAS and Carter Center as 
a parallel mechanism to the sovereign authority of the CNE. 
Rangel said he had asked DeShazo what the USG response would 
be if the CNE rejected the presidential recall petition and 
said he got no response.  He then added that he did not care 
what the USG thinks since the matter is exclusively 
Venezuelan.  Rangel renewed Chavez\'s accusations that the USG 
is funding the opposition, suggesting that those groups who 
took money might be guilty of violating a Supreme Court 
decision from 2001. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Rangel was contentious throughout the meeting and 
repeatedly tried to bait DAS DeShazo into committing to the 
CNE\'s final decision.  He was in lockstep with the Chavista 
line that the international community seeks to subordinate 
the CNE to international observers.  The GOV is obviously 
disturbed by the OAS/Carter Center statement of February 13 
and has begun a smear campaign to discredit them.  The GOV is 
clearly positioning itself to deny the referendum, and to 
neutralize the moral authority of the international 
observers.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) WHA DAS Peter DeShazo expressed USG support for the 
OAS and the Carter Center in a lunch on February 16 for 
representatives of both organizations hosted by the 
Ambassador.  OAS Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo said it is 
clear the National Electoral Council (CNE) is attempting to 
invalidate as many signatures as possible to terminate the 
recall referendum petition against President Chavez.  Noting 
that the CNE cut off information after the OAS-Carter Center 
statement of February 14, Jaramillo expressed doubt that the 
observation mission could continue under such conditions. 
Carter Center representative Francisco Diez said his 
organization had also been told that requests for information 
must be made in writing and be approved by the CNE board. 
Diez said the situation of the observers is precarious. 
DeShazo emphasized the importance of both institutions to 
ensuring the transparency of the process.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
OAS Chief Doubtful of Mission Success 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador hosted a lunch on February 16 for WHA 
DAS Peter DeShazo to hear from representatives of the OAS and 
Carter Center about the signature verification process at the 
National Electoral Council (CNE).  The OAS was represented by 
OAS SYG Gaviria\'s Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo, OAS 
country representative Patricio Carbacho, OAS head observer 
Edgardo Ries, and OAS observer Marcelo Alvarez.  Francisco 
Diez and Andres Araya represented the Carter Center.  DCM, 
Polcouns, and poloff also attended. 
 
3. (C) Jaramillo said he sees no purpose in the OAS mission 
remaining in Venezuela.  He said CNE President Francisco 
Carrasquero launched into a tirade against him on February 13 
after the OAS and Carter Center made a joint statement 
pointing out that excessive technicalities were delaying the 
signature count process.  (Jaramillo also noted that the 
February 13 statement said that the observers had not seen 
evidence of fraud in the process, a poke at the GOV\'s 
contention that the opposition was engaged in \"megafraud.\") 
Jaramillo said that since then OAS observers had been cut off 
from information from CNE mid-level officials with requests 
now having to go through the CNE board. 
 
4. (C) Jaramillo asserted that from the point when the CNE 
changed the rules halfway through the physical verification 
of the presidential signature forms, the CNE has tried to 
invalidate as many signatures as possible.  The \"planillas 
planas\" issue (signature forms that were apparently filled 
out by one person but signed by another) is a clear example 
of this strategy, he said.  Jaramillo said it was likely the 
CNE board\'s decision on which criteria to apply to the 
\"planas\" would be decisive, though he thought it likely the 
CNE would put off that decision until the last.  Jaramillo 
noted that when the CNE\'s self-appointed deadline of February 
29 arrives, the CNE will not/not be ready to make 
announcement regarding the referendum. 
 
5. (C) Acknowledging that he was brainstorming, Jaramillo 
said the OAS could not sit back and wait for the process to 
be pronounced dead.  Their credibility as observers would be 
at stake if they simply continued to go along, attesting to 
procedures that ran counter to the spirit of recognized 
electoral and legal concepts, he noted.  Asked by the 
Ambassador if his views reflected OAS SYG Gaviria\'s 
perspective on the situation, Jaramillo said yes.  Diez 
cautioned that any decision by the observers to curtail 
activities should be based on actions, not fears of what 
decisions will be made.  Diez said President Carter would 
likely agree that if the CNE refused to provide access and 
 
information necessary for completing the mission, the Carter 
Center would have to withdraw. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Carter Center Still On the Good Side 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Francisco Diez said the CNE was probably more angry at 
the OAS than the Carter Center, but noted that access to 
information had also become more complicated.  Diez said that 
on February 14, an \"informal flow of information\" at the 
mid-level that Carter Center was using to extract samples 
from the signature forms was cut off.  Diez conceded that 
written permission made sense and immediately submitted the 
request to the CNE board.  He said the Carter Center had 
collected only half of the signature forms needed for the 
statistical sample when access was cut.  (Note:  Diez and 
Jaramillo met with the CNE on February 17 and told reporters 
they had discussed with the CNE directors ideas for how to 
proceed with their observation mission, noting they would 
follow up in writing shortly.) 
 
7. (C) Regarding the CNE\'s announcement that it would invite 
additional international observers, most believed it would 
not help the process.  Jaramillo noted that no reputable 
observers would join the process in mid-stream.  He did not 
preclude the possibility that the GOV would find 
personalities that would be nonetheless willing to lend 
themselves to the affair.  Diez said he had suggested to the 
CNE \"for the sixth time\" that they extend an invitation to 
the UNDP; the board refused.  (Note:  Opposition groups also 
called for the UNDP\'s involvement, as they are part of the 
tripartite committee that facilitated the May 29 agreement.) 
 
------------------- 
Support For OAS/TCC 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) DAS DeShazo briefed the observers on his meetings with 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel and ambassadors of 
interested countries (septels).  He told the observers the 
USG fully supports their work \"in the trenches\" on helping 
Venezuela reach a solution to the political impasse. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The situation for the electoral observation mission is 
deteriorating.  The GOV has taken a hostile position toward 
the international observers, whom they portray as a threat to 
the credibility of the CNE\'s ability to block the referendum. 
 The situation could improve if and only if Chavez were to 
change his approach.  The observers are still in place and 
CNE directors still speak with the observer chiefs.  The 
CNE\'s ruling on the \"planillas planas,\" which has been once 
again postponed, will give an indication as to the CNE\'s -- 
and Chavez\'s -- determination to fulfill its mission in a 
transparent manner. 
 
10. (C) It is encouraging that OAS and the Carter Center are 
willing to take action sooner rather than later.  If they 
don\'t act while the patient still has a chance of pulling 
through, their report is likely to be a coroner\'s report on 
the cause of death.

Department 
         on 2/14/2004 and is reported by cable for the 
record.) 
-------- 
 
1. OAS: 
 
-- (C) OAS chief of staff Francisco Jaramillo told the 
Ambassador February 13 that the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) board meeting with the Carter Center and OAS was \"a 
disaster.\"  Jaramillo said the CNE refused an OAS and Carter 
Center proposal to bring fingerprint experts from the Mexican 
government to analyze signature forms. 
 
2. Opposition: 
 
-- (U) Streets and freeways in the eastern sections of the 
city were awash with thousands of opposition demonstrators 
peacefully congregating February 14. 
 
-- (C) Opposition representative told poloff February 14 that 
the march was a success, estimating 500,000 opposition 
demonstrators, but it would not continue to the CNE building 
because it was blocked by GoV security forces and 
sympathizers armed with clubs. 
 
3. GoV: 
 
-- (U) The Ministry of Interior and Justice announced at the 
end of the march that everything had been carried out in 
peace.  MinInt officials had warned opposition leaders on 
February 13 that the GoV could not guarantee their safety if 
they marched to the CNE building. 
 
-- (U) The GoV mounted a large open food market, with free 
medical clinics, naturalization fairs, and cultural events, 
in the path of the march. 
 
-- (U) Official GoV television used a split screen with 
selective footage to play down the numbers of participants in 
the march. 
 
-- (U) Chavez said on February 13 he would appeal any 
decision by the CNE allowing a presidential recall referendum 
to the Supreme Court. 
 
4. CNE: 
 
-- (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez (pro-GOV) said February 
13 the CNE board will announce criteria to be used in the 
verfication process by the Superior Technical Commission 
(CTS) on February 16. 
 
-- (U) Rodriguez also said the CNE believes the controversial 
signature forms alleged to have been filled out in the same 
handwriting may exceed 50,000 signature sheets (or 
approximately 450,000 signatures). 
 
-- (C) On February 13 CNE Vice President Zamora (opposition) 
threatened not to attend further meetings in the CNE board 
until the \"encirclement\" of the CNE by pro-Chavez activists 
(\"chavistas\") is ended. 
 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
CNE meeting with OAS and Carter Center a \"Disaster\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador met on the evening of February 13 with 
OAS chief of staff Francisco Jaramillo for a readout on the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) board meeting with the 
Carter Center and OAS earlier that day (reftel).  Jaramillo 
 
confirmed that the pro-Chavez activists camped out around the 
CNE building made getting to the building nearly impossible. 
Jaramillo said when his car was stopped by traffic, he jumped 
on the back of a motorcycle-taxi to arrive late to the 
meeting. 
 
6. (C) The meeting, said Jaramillo, was \"a disaster.\"  The 
Carter Center and the OAS proposed bringing fingerprint 
experts from the Mexican federal prosecutor\'s office to take 
a random sample of 1,000 signature forms (about 8,500 
signatures) for an analysis, he said.  The CNE board rejected 
the proposal.  The OAS and Carter Center representatives then 
shared the statement they were about to read to the press 
(see reftel) and then left for the press area.  After Carter 
Center representative  Jennifer McCoy left for a meeting with 
President Hugo Chavez, Jaramillo returned for a wrap-up with 
CNE President Francisco Carrasquero.  Jaramillo said 
Carrasquero was furious with both organizations for allegedly 
making proposals that tried to shortcut the CNE\'s procedures. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Opposition March: Peaceful and Growing 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Opposition marchers started massing February 14 at 
about 10:00 a.m. at several gathering points in Caracas.  By 
mid-day, streets and freeways in the eastern sections of the 
city were awash with thousands of opposition demonstrators 
peacefully congregating.  Opposition plans called for 
marchers to converge from six points around the capital to 
Plaza Venezuela near the Botanical Garden to collect printed 
certificates showing copies of their signatures to petetion 
for a resesidential recall referendum. 
 
8. (C) Opposition statistic expert Amado Dounia told poloff 
at 2:30 p.m. that the march had been a success, but it would 
not continue to the CNE building because it was blocked by 
GoV security forces.  Douia said Miranda State Governor 
Enrique Mendoza suspected an ambush after observing the 
number of troops and a band of GoV sympathizers carrying 
clubs in teh proximity.  Dounia guessed that 500,000 
opposition demonstrators took to the streets in Caracas. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
GoV Organizes Events To Block March Route 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Officials of the Interior Ministry asked the 
opposition yesterday via press conference not to march 
farther than the Botanical Garden due to lack of security. 
The GoV also mounted a large open market on Avenida Bolivar 
in the capital, in the path of the planned opposition march, 
on February 14.  The GoV announced late on February 13 that 
in addition to a GoV-subsidized meat sale, there would also 
be free medical services, free medicines, an express 
naturalization process, and music concerts.  The DCM walked 
the GoV-sponsored megamarkets before the opposition march 
began, noting tens of thousands of people.  The DCM noted the 
market was not overtly partisan or hostile, with many 
apparently attracted by the fifteen percent price break on 
meat and vegetables. 
 
----------------------------- 
Tricky GoV TV Claims No March 
----------------------------- 
 
10. (U) Official GoV television showed used a split screen to 
show selective footage on February 14 depicting higher 
concentration of people at the GoV\'s megamarket than at teh 
opposition march.  The right side showed a close-up of the 
GoV-sponsored crowd assembled for its cultural events and 
food markets.  The left side showed sections of empty road in 
Caracas, purporting to indicate that few showed up for the 
opposition\'s march.  Keeping with the theme, Vice President 
Jose Rangel announced February 14 that the opposition was 
invisible.  Nevertheless, all other commercial media outlets 
showed thousands of marchers in all areas of the planned 
march route.  The GoV footage showed the same truck passing 
 
the same empty street over and over, suggesting that the GoV 
TV was using a video loop.  PD Off observing the opposition 
march confirmed huge crowds massing in the capital\'s eastern 
sections. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Chavez Pledges Legal Challenge if CNE Calls a Referendum 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
11. (U) During his press conference to foreign correspondents 
on February 13 (carried live for 2 hours by GoV mandate on 
all/all media outlets in the country), Chavez said he would 
appeal any forthcoming decision by the CNE to allow a 
presidential recall referendum to the Supreme Court of 
Justice (TSJ).  Only if the TSJ upholds a referendum, Chavez 
said, would he participate. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
CNE Expects New Rules for Technical Review Committee 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
12. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez (pro-GOV) February 13 
announced the CNE board will discuss rules for the 
verification of signatures to be used by the Superior 
Technical Commission (CTS) during the weekend on February 14 
and 15, and announce final criteria on February 16. 
Rodriguez also said the CNE believes the controversial 
signature forms alleged to have been filled out in the same 
handwriting (the so-called \"planillas planas\", see reftel) 
may exceed 50,000 signature sheets (or approximately 450,000 
signatures).  Rodriguez did not/not address when the CNE 
would provide rules for the possible 5-day period during 
which voters listed on questionable signature forms could 
come to the CNE in person to affirm their name and signature. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Zamora Worries About Chavistas, New Schedule at the CNE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
13. (C) On February 13 CNE Vice President Zamora (opposition) 
threatened not to attend further meetings in the CNE board 
until the \"encirclement\" of the CNE by pro-Chavez activists 
(\"chavistas\") is ended.  Zamora comlained about having to 
enter the CNE building through back entrances to avoid the 
Chavista camp in front of the building.  The Chavistas have 
moved back 20 meters since February 13, and National Guard 
troops continue to guard the perimeter.  Zamora said the CNE 
approved a schedule on February 13 for the rest of the 
verification process, but it has not yet been published.

ECONOMY 
 
REF: CARACAS 03/4011 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard M. Sanders 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  In a February 19 meeting with Econcouns, IMF 
Resident Representative Humberto Arbulu expressed deep 
skepticism over Chavez administration economic policies and 
frustration over the lack of transparency in economic 
information made available to him.  He gave the Finance 
Ministry high marks for its borrowing activities, while 
seeing the Central Bank as vulnerable to Chavez\'s attacks. 
He was appalled at the Planning Ministry\'s preoccupations 
with food self-sufficiency, and believed that PDVSA was 
keeping large amounts of money off-shore.  His medium-term 
prediction for Venezuela was \"steady decline,\" rather than a 
big crash, a view with which we concur.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
The Borrowing Machine Rolls On 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Arbulu suggested that within ten days, the GOV would 
issue its long expected bond issue which would roll over 
existing internal debt into a mixture of foreign and domestic 
obligations with longer maturities.  (Note:  Finance Minister 
Nobrega told the Ambassador on February 6 that the issue 
could be for as much as USD 3 billion dollars.)  Arbulu 
predicted that savings in loan amortizations could be as much 
as USD 1.5 billion over time.  This would all, he predicted, 
be ploughed back into current spending by the GOV.  He 
confirmed that like previous issues, this one would entail 
the immediate exchangeability of purchased bonds for dollars 
at the official rate (see reftel for further details on this 
mechanism).  This has the effect of making such bonds \"a 
killing\" for purchasers, noted Arbulu. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Financial Wizardry, Amidst Continued Economic Doldrums 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  (C)  The successful bond swap means that the GOV will be 
able to maintain fiscal equilibrium avoiding a painful 
adjustment \"at least until October or even December,\" in 
Arbulu\'s view, assuming that world oil prices do not drop 
significantly.  This would, however, entail renewal of the 
.05 pct tax on financial transactions, which is due to 
expire.  Arbulu also suggested that once it got past the 
current political season, the Finance Ministry would be 
looking at revenue enhancement measures.  (Note:  Finmin 
Nobrega has spoken on occasion of extending value-added tax 
to a wider range of products.  End note.)  While the GOV may 
have covered its financial flanks, and thus can avoid a 
crisis, it would not, he suggested, be able to achieve 
robust, job-creating growth, because Venezuela\'s private 
sector does not face conditions favorable to investment.  His 
overall medium-term economic prediction was \"slow, steady 
decline.\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Tension Among Economic Decision-Makers 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Arbulu, whose office is located at the Central Bank 
headquarters, painted a portrait of a government bureaucracy 
racked by suspicion and confusion.  The Central Bank was 
under great pressure, following Chavez\'s public attacks on 
it.  His own access at the Bank was diminishing, as once 
easily obtained information becomes less available.  Chavez\'s 
repeated, public demonization of the IMF was, he concluded, 
making Central Bank officials increasingly less willing to 
talk to him.  The Finance Ministry remained a somewhat more 
normal environment, he suggested, although Nobrega has been 
weakened by Chavez\'s evident intention to maintain a single 
exchange rate, rather than go to a dual rate system.  He saw 
the departure of Banking Superintendent Irwing Ochoa, a 
U.S.-trained technician and a close Nobrega associate, as a 
precursor to Nobrega\'s own departure. 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
Bizarre Meeting at Planning Ministry 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  A recent meeting at another key player in economic 
policy-making, the Planning Ministry, had been a \"disaster,\" 
according to Arbulu.  He had sought a meeting with members of 
Minister Luis Giordani\'s team for several months with the 
purpose of trying to understand the sources of funding for 
the various GOV \"missions\" in health, education, and job 
creation and the purposes to which they were being put.  The 
Planning Ministry officials danced around his questions, and 
ultimately it became obvious that they did not have any clear 
understanding themselves.  Ministry officials, however, did 
devote considerable energy to defending GOV supposed 
initiatives to revitalize domestic agricultural production. 
This was crucial, they asserted because Venezuela was 
import-dependent now, and \"a foreign power\" could blockade 
the country\'s main ports, reducing it to starvation. 
 
----------------- 
The PDVSA Mystery 
----------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Arbulu said that by his calculations in 2003 state 
oil corporation PDVSA earned more than USD 2 billion than it 
reported to the Central Bank.  This very large sum was 
presumably being kept in off-shore accounts.  Arbulu 
suggested that a considerable amount of the funding which the 
various GOV social spending programs were receiving was in 
fact coming off the books from PDVSA.  Amounts earned by 
private individuals in exchanging this money, which would not 
go through the Foreign Exchange Control Commission (CADIVI), 
were, he further speculated, likely to be enormous. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Arbulu\'s picture of turbulence and lack of 
transparency at GOV economic institutions tracks what we hear 
from other sources.  The combination of ideology, 
improvisation, corruption and short-term politicking that 
affects economic decision-making is not likely to change 
while Chavez is in office.  Successful borrowing operations, 
both externally and internally, mean that a financial crash 
is unlikely.  But political tension, growth-smothering 
exchange controls, and lack of attention to the fundamentals 
mean that the modest recovery we are seeing right now after 
two dreadful years is unlikely to be sustainable.  Arbulu\'s 
prediction of further decay over the medium term seems right 
on the money to us.

1. (C) During his February 15 \"Alo Presidente\" broadcast, 
President Chavez accused several human rights organizations 
of receiving funding from the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED) through the Washington-based Center for 
Justice and International Law (CEJIL) to help overthrow the 
GOV.  Several of the named NGOs issued statements rejecting 
the accusation and demanding that Chavez retract his 
statements.  While publicly projecting an image of 
fearlessness in the face of this frontal attack, the 
organizations\' directors privately acknowledge their worry 
about the possible consequences of being labeled as traitors. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (U) During his February 15 \"Alo Presidente\" broadcast, 
President Chavez accused several human rights organizations 
of receiving funding from the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED) through the Washington-based Center for 
Justice and International Law (CEJIL), itself a recipient of 
NED funding.  Chavez named the Human Rights Education and 
Action Program (PROVEA), the Committee of Relatives and 
Victims of the February 1989 Events (COFAVIC), the Support 
Network (Red de Apoyo), and the Human Rights Office of the 
Catholic Church (Vicaria), among others.  Chavez claimed that 
the NGOs, like Sumate, had accepted NED funding to 
participate in efforts to overthrow the GOV.  Vice President 
Rangel followed up February 16 with a statement that the NGOs 
had broken the law, citing a Supreme Court ruling that limits 
the activities of organizations that receive foreign funding. 
 
 
3. (U) PROVEA fired back with a February 17 press release 
denying it has ever requested or received funding from the 
USG.  It also affirmed that doing so would not be a crime, 
and it acknowledged its strong working relationship with 
CEJIL.  The NGO states that it has condemned all \"ruptures of 
constitutional continuity,\" including Chavez\' own 1992 coup 
attempt and the brief presidency of Pedro Carmona in April 
2002.  PROVEA also reminded the President that it has 
requested protective measures favoring Chavez from the 
Inter-American Human Rights Court, but that it would not be 
deterred from its work \"by threats from any government 
official, current or future.\" 
 
4. (U) PROVEA plans to invoke its right under Article 58 of 
the Constitution to demand that the President rectify the 
damage he has caused by making false statements.  COFAVIC and 
the Vicaria made similar statements on February 16 and 
accused Chavez of \"setting a very negative precedent,\" 
according to news reports. 
 
5. (C) Carlos Correa and Liliana Ortega, directors, 
respectively, of PROVEA and COFAVIC, told poloff February 18 
that they are very concerned about the possible consequences 
for their staff and activities as a result of being labeled 
traitors by Chavez.  According to Ortega, \"the threatening 
email and phone calls have already begun.\"  Correa told 
poloff that PROVEA had activated its normal security 
procedures and is staying alert, \"but so far we haven\'t been 
subjected to any direct threats or violence.\" 
 
6. (C) Jose Gregorio Guarenas, the Vicaria\'s general 
coordinator, told poloff February 19 his staff is receiving 
threatening email and phone calls, and that being singled out 
by Chavez has \"definite security implications,\" as they go 
about their usual activities.  He also told poloff that the 
National Assembly (AN) appointed a committee February 18 to 
investigate all of the human rights NGOs named by Chavez. 
\"The investigation will only magnify the danger for us,\" he 
said. 
 
7. (U) Amnesty International issued a statement February 18 
insisting that Chavez respect the work of human rights NGOS, 
emphasizing that international human rights treaties, to 
which Venezuela is a signatory, form the basis for such work. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
8. (U) In November 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that NGOs 
that receive funding from foreign governments or whose 
leaders are not Venezuelan are not part of civil society. 
The ruling concludes that such NGOs may not represent 
citizens in court or bring their own legal action, but it 
does not criminalize the acceptance of foreign funding.  All 
of the organizations named by Chavez receive funding from a 
variety of foreign sources and state that their financing is 
public information. 
 
9. (C) The common characteristic of the human rights NGOs 
named by the President is their refusal to wink at certain 
actions for political or monetary reasons.  It is precisely 
this institutional integrity and independence that threatens 
Chavez and has led him to seize on the link to CEJIL and the 
NED as a means to weaken a societal sector that he doesn\'t 
control.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  The GOV continues to show signs of slippage in its 
commitment to the protection of intellectual property rights. 
 In 2003 the government persisted in its policy of approving 
domestic copies of internationally patented pharmaceutical 
products for sale in Venezuela.  Venezuela\'s anti-trust 
agency ruled that this practice did not constitute an act of 
unfair competition.  The GOV also maintained its refusal to 
issue second use patents to international pharmaceuticals in 
2003.  Industry contacts say the National Assembly is 
debating proposed changes to the new Industrial Property Law 
which would worsen the legal framework for protection of 
intellectual property.  Piracy and contraband have grown 
increasingly problematic, while government efforts toward 
deterrence and prosecution remain minimal.  Venezuela\'s 
ongoing political and economic troubles have resulted in a 
large informal sector including ever-increasing numbers of 
vendors who sell illicit products on the street.  Based on 
the GOV\'s demonstrated lack of willingness to take action 
against piracy and its continued lack of adequate IPR 
protection, we recommend that Venezuela remain on the special 
301 watch list this year. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
NO CHANGE ON DATA EXCLUSIVITY AND SECOND USE PATENTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (SBU)  Venezuela has ratified many of the relevant 
international treaties for TRIPS compliance, however, the GOV 
continues to pursue policies which demonstrate a lack of 
commitment to international standards on IPR protection.  The 
Venezuelan government still allows data on internationally 
patented drugs, most of which require lengthy and expensive 
development, to be used by domestic companies seeking 
approval for their own versions of the same product. 
Venezuela\'s food and drug regulatory agency (INH) began 
approving the commercialization of these copies in February 
2002.  In July 2003 the Venezuelan anti-trust agency 
(PROCOMPETENCIA) ruled on one of the many cases alleging 
unfair competition brought by international pharmaceutical 
companies against domestic companies selling bioequivalents 
of their products.  PROCOMPETENCIA ruled that trading 
replicas of anti-allergy drug Allegra in the Venezuelan 
market did not constitute an act of unfair competition. 
 
3. (SBU)  PROCOMPETENCIA\'s president explained the ruling as 
the inevitable result of a conflict between domestic health 
legislation which mandates data revelation as part of the 
regulatory process and existing legislation on IPR protection 
which does not specifically protect test data.  At least 
three other cases brought by international pharmaceutical 
companies are pending.  The Association of Foreign 
Pharmaceutical Companies (CAVEME) is one of the entities, 
which has proposed explicitly including five year test data 
protection in the new Industrial Property Law which is 
currently being debated by the National Assembly.  According 
to CAVEME, government officials including the president of 
Venezuela\'s Patent and Copyright Office (SAPI) have indicated 
their opposition to this proposal.  GOV officials have said 
the five year rule would be detrimental to national health 
concerns.  International pharmaceutical contacts tell us the 
length of protection afforded to data within the system is so 
short that legitimate new products may enter the market after 
illicit copies do. 
 
4. (SBU)  The GOV maintained its policy of refusing to issue 
second-use patents on the basis that they do not qualify as 
inventions.  According to SAPI officials, only four patents 
for new pharmaceutical products were issued in 2003.  This 
appears to be the result of new politically driven policy at 
SAPI.  Several long-serving SAPI officials, including the 
head of the patent division, were fired in the final months 
of 2003 for what, they claim, are political reasons. 
Industry contacts tell us these officials have been replaced 
by political appointees with much less experience in the 
 
sector.  We are told by a Ministry of Production and Commerce 
counterpart that Venezuela is unlikely to ratify or implement 
the two internet treaties; the WIPO Copyright Treat and the 
WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty because of opposition 
from the president of SAPI. 
 
-------------------- 
PIRACY GETTING WORSE 
-------------------- 
 
5. (SBU)  Piracy and contraband trade remain significant 
problems for Venezuela, which has still not moved 
aggressively to implement an effective law enforcement 
regime.  The commission created by President Chavez in 2002 
to address the problem did not generate viable 
recommendations or solutions, despite GOV concern about 
losses due to tax evasion on contraband.  According to 
Venezuela\'s association of authors and artists, 80 percent of 
the optical media and 50 percent of the computer software 
currently sold in Venezuela is pirated.  Piracy of compact 
discs and DVDs worsened as the economic downturn in 2003 
forced more Venezuelans to seek work in the informal sector, 
mainly as street vendors.  In response to concerns raised by 
the legitimate optical media industry, the GOV insisted on 
finding a solution which included street vendor 
participation.  When private industry representatives 
proposed making street vendors part of their supply chain by 
allowing them to market legitimate products, government 
representatives counter-proposed the creation of street 
vendor cooperatives which would produce as well as distribute 
product.  More than 50 percent of working Venezuelans are 
employed in the informal sector, amaking it unlikely the GOV 
will take any effective action against piracy which would 
deprive these a number of these citizens of their livelihood 
in a potential election year. 
 
------------------------------- 
LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL A PROBLEM 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU)  The issue of enforcement of intellectual property 
rights remains problematic in Venezuela, due to a lack of 
political will and severe budgetary constraints.  The entire 
staff of the National Copyright and Trademark Protection 
Police (COMANPI) was rotated to another unit in March, 2003. 
The new team of seven inspectors for the entire country is 
new to the field of IPR enforcement.  It continues to operate 
with extremely limited resources and only one special 
prosecutor with jurisdiction over criminal IP violations. 
Complicating their job is the fact that COMANPI has no 
jurisdiction within Venezuelan ports and must coordinate 
their actions with Venezuela\'s Customs and Tax Service 
(SENIAT).  In addition, the special prosecutor\'s workload 
remains split between intellectual property cases and human 
rights violations, which often take priority.  As a result 
the prosecutor\'s office is extremely slow to process charges 
of criminal IP violations even when successful raids were 
carreid out by the police and infringing goods are available 
as evidence.  Most cases of trademark infringement continue 
to be settled out of court. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU)  The ongoing political confrontation between the GOV 
and its opposition remains a significant factor in the 
government\'s commitment (or lack thereof) to implementing 
adequate IP protection.  As part of his strategy to maintain 
control, Chavez has placed ideologically motivated supporters 
in key positions throughout the government, including in 
SAPI.  As a result, we are unlikely to see any softening in 
Venezuela\'s position with regard to second-use patents and 
data exclusivity.  The GOV will most likely avoid taking any 
action against piracy which could have negative impact on the 
growing number of low-income informal sector workers who 
depend on illicit sales for their livelihood.  Accordingly, 
we recommend that Venezuela\'s current status on the special 
301 watch list be maintained.

and (d) 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1.    (C) During a February 16 meeting in Caracas, DAS Peter 
DeShazo told ambassadors from interested countries that the 
international community needs to make clear its strong and 
unified support for the democratic process, the OAS and the 
Carter Center.  The Spanish ambassador worried about a CNE 
collapse if the two opposition directors walk out.  The 
Canadian ambassador observed that Chavez\'s recent rhetoric 
sounded like a \"bully,\" more intransigent and more 
aggressive, and noted that OAS resolution 833 could still be 
used for additional action.  The ambassadors from Mexico and 
Colombia chafed at the prospect of their governments making 
additional bilateral statements on the CNE process.  While 
the Mexican ambassador agreed that we need an expression from 
the international community, he suggested the OAS could 
effectively carry Mexico\'s message. 
 
2.    (C) The Spanish ambassador reported rumors that the GoV 
is suppressing news of violence during the opposition 
demonstration on February 14.  The Chilean ambassador 
observed that military commanders loyal to Chavez locked down 
troops in their barracks during the march.  The Canadian 
ambassador said he visited the CNE building on February 14 
and observed \"frightening\" people preparing for a 
confrontation.  The Mexican ambassador said the National 
Guard has an active presence near the CNE building in order 
to exert pressure on the CNE. 
 
End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Message of Support for OAS and Carter Center; 
International Community Urged to Act 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.    (C) During a February 16 visit to Caracas, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Peter DeShazo and Ambassador 
Charles Shapiro met with Spanish Ambassador Manuel Viturro de 
la Torre, Canadian Ambassador Allan Culham, Chilean 
Ambassador Favio Vio, Colombian Ambassador Maria Angela 
Holguin, Mexican Ambassador Enrique Loaneza, and Argentine 
Charge d\'Affaires Carlos Riva regarding the current situation 
in Venezuela and the role of the international community in 
regard to the National Electoral Council (CNE) and the 
on-going process to verify signatures on petitions seeking a 
recall referendum on the rule of President Hugo Chavez. 
 
4.    (C) DAS DeShazo told the diplomats that the USG is 
urging countries and any individuals with influence to weigh 
in on the question of Venezuela\'s continued movement toward 
an electoral solution to the on-going political impasse.  He 
said he was pleased that Canadian OAS Permanent 
Representative Paul Durand is planning to visit Venezuela. 
(Note: Durand is currently the president of the PAS permanent 
council).  Unfortunately, DAS DeShazo reported, Ambassador 
Durand will be delayed because of emergency meetings 
regarding Haiti.  DAS DeShazo polled the diplomats on their 
opinions on what members of the international community could 
do regarding Venezuela.  After discussion, DAS DeShazo said 
all interested parties in the international community need to 
make clear their strong and unified support for the OAS and 
Carter Center.  That message should be communicated both 
publicly and privately, in multi-national groups such as the 
Friends of Venezuela or the OAS, as well as in bilateral 
meetings with the GoV.  The central message for all is that 
each government/country supports the democratic process and 
the involvement of the OAS and the Carter Center. 
 
------------------------- 
Spain: Venezuela Must Act 
------------------------- 
 
5.    (C) Spanish Ambassador Viturro said that the message he 
took away from recent briefings from the OAS representative 
Francisco Jaramillo and Carter Center representative Jennifer 
McCoy was that public criticism of the CNE could be a 
disaster.  As a result, the ambassador was surprised that the 
February 13 OAS/Carter Center statement seemed to advise the 
CNE on internal processes.  The OAS and Carter Center, he 
said, must remember the process is exclusively in the hands 
of Venezuela, or risk becoming embroiled in angry GoV 
statements about attempted \"colonialism.\" 
 
6.    (C) Viturro noted that Chavez was in the midst of a 
political campaign, and predicted that he will try to force 
the hand of the CNE.  In answer to a question from the DAS, 
Viturro said any public criticism brought by the OAS/Carter 
Center against the GoV and the CNE for failing to verify the 
signatures would provide \"a balloon of oxygen\" for the 
Venezuelan opposition. 
 
7.    (C) Viturro noted that the OAS is in some ways at a 
disadvantage because it makes decisions by consensus and the 
GoV can block action it does not like.  The Carter Center, 
the ambassador said, can speak more clearly because it is a 
private NGO and has only its own opinion to pronounce.  The 
Spanish ambassador also noted that the work of local NGO 
Sumate, which maintains an electronic database with digitized 
images of every signature gathered, makes any fraud by the 
GoV very difficult.  Canadian Ambassador Culham added that 
Sumate is impressive, transparent, and run entirely by 
volunteers. 
 
8.    (C) Viturro noted that the CNE\'s decision is not final 
and is subject to review by the Venezuelan Supreme Court of 
Justice (TSJ) in legal challenges brought by either the GoV 
or the opposition.  He worries about the international crisis 
in the CNE board.  If the two opposition CNE directors were 
to walk out, the CNE would collapse and the situation would 
be very serious.  Viturro wondered if the CNE collapses 
whether the TSJ would step in.  Such a situation would affect 
all electoral processes.  Accordingly, he said the OAS and 
Carter Center need to focus not only on the activities of the 
CNE, but also on the CNE itself. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Canada: Chavez Talks Like Bully; Resolution 833 Still There 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
9.    (C) Canadian Ambassador Culham expressed surprise at 
the tone of Chavez\'s statements during his weekly television 
and radio show \"Hello President\" on February 15.  Colham 
observed that Chavez\'s rhetoric was as tough as he had ever 
heard him.  \"He sounded like a bully,\" said Culham, more 
intransigent and more aggressive. 
 
 
10.   (C) Culham noted that OAS resolution 833 was still 
available for reference and could be used for additional 
action, such as calling for a report from the observers or 
another visit from OAS SYG Cesar Gaviria.  Culham said we are 
not yet at a stage where nothing can be done.  The Canadian 
government will shortly issue a statement supporting the 
OAS/Carter Center. (Note that statement issued)  Those 
organizations and their work, said Culham, are all that stand 
between Venezuela\'s future and \"complete chaos.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Argentina: Court Ruling Would Help 
---------------------------------- 
 
11.   (C) Argentine Charge Riva noted that the whole 
electoral process will likely end up in court before the TSJ. 
That may be a net benefit.  A court ruling, said Riba, may 
give the people more confidence in the process. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Mexico and Colombia: Isn\'t the OAS Enough? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
12.   (C) The ambassadors from Mexico and Colombia both 
 
chafed at the prospect of their governments making additional 
bilateral statements on the CNE process.  Mexican Ambassador 
Loaeza suggested that the OAS could effectively carry 
Mexico\'s message.  DAS DeShazo pointed out that the OAS was 
limited and messages from members of the broader 
international community would be helpful.  Loaeza agreed, and 
said the wider \"Inter-American Community,\" including Western 
Hemisphere nations and interested countries like Spain and 
Portugal, would make a good working group.  Loaeza said his 
government\'s principle worry was to avoid any perception of 
an intervention by outside countries.  Nevertheless, Lonaza 
agreed that it was clear that we needed some expression from 
the international community.  Any such statement, Loaeza 
said, must be formulated to show no preference toward either 
side.  Loaeza asked if the U.S. would sponsor a resolution to 
that effect in the OAS. 
 
13.   (C) DAS DeShazo said the U.S. was currently working 
within the OAS but, in addition, the USG urged every country 
to speak bilaterally with the GoV to communicate worry and 
interest regarding the current situation and to express 
support for the OAS and the Carter Center.  The DAS added 
that we could speak privately about specific issues such as 
the disqualification of signature sheets, but public 
statements would be more useful is kept to a general 
statement of support for the process and OAS/Carter Center 
involvement. 
 
14.   (C) Colombian Ambassador Holguin said her government 
was particularly sensitive about any communication that could 
damage the already delicate relationship between the 
neighboring countries.  Therefore, she saw little chance that 
Colombia would make any movement outside the OAS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Chile: OAS/Carter Center Must Appear Independent 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
15.   (C) Chilean Ambassador Favio Vio said the perception 
that the OAS and the Carter Center are operating 
independently is extremely important.  The developments he 
saw during the week of February 9 were particularly 
worrisome.  The Government of Chile, said Vio, feels OAS SYG 
Gaviria will have to personally re-enter the field. 
Ambassador Shapiro noted that Gavira may have influence with 
the Inter-American Community, but the Carter Center has more 
influence with Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Opposition March Peaceful But Pressure on CNE Still Evident 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
16.   (C) The Colombian ambassador was thankful the February 
14 opposition march was peaceful, and was happy the 
opposition decided to avoid any confrontation by not marching 
to the CNE building as originally planned.  Spanish 
Ambassador Viturro said that he was in the Venezuelan resort 
of Los Roques with a group supporting the opposition, and 
they reported rumors that the GoV had killed two opposition 
demonstrators in Caracas on February 14.  The rumor, reported 
Viturro, is that the GoV is suppressing news of the deaths. 
The point, he said, is although the march was peaceful, 
rumors still circulate in some opposition circles.  Chilean 
Ambassador Vio said he was impressed at how effectively the 
military commanders loyal to Chavez had locked down the 
troops in the barracks during the march. 
 
17.   (C) Canadian Ambassador Culham reported that he had 
personally gone to the zone near the CNE building on the day 
of the February 14 march, and observed \"frightening\" people 
preparing for a confrontation.  Ambassador Shapiro noted that 
directors of the CNE themselves effectively require 
permission from pro-Chavez activists camped outside the CNE 
to enter.  Mexican Ambassador Loaeza said the National Guard 
has an active presence near the CNE building in order to 
exert GoV pressure on the CNE. 
 
18.   (U) DAS DeShazo cleared the text of this cable after 
leaving post.

1. (C) During his February 8 and 15 \"Alo, Presidente\" 
broadcasts, President Chavez accused the USG of supporting 
opposition efforts to oust him by funneling $60,000 to the 
NGO Sumate and millions more to assist other opposition 
groups.  Chavez also claimed that the CIA\'s refusal to 
provide any information on Sumate to a journalist\'s FOIA 
request is conclusive proof that the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED), a Sumate funding source, is a CIA front 
organization.  Chavez made no mention of USAID funding to 
Sumate. End Summary.

September 2003 to work on referendum and general electoral 
activities.  On February 15, Chavez referred to free-lance 
journalist Jeremy Bigwood\'s FOIA request to the CIA on 
Sumate, and the CIA\'s subsequent refusal to confirm or deny 
that it possessed such information, as proof that the NED is 
a funding arm of the CIA for Venezuelan opposition groups. 
During the same broadcast, Chavez asked the Solicitor General 
to analyze Sumate\'s original funding request to determine if 
it included grounds for charging the NGO with treason. 
 
3. (U) During the February 8 broadcast, Chavez also mentioned 
the National Assembly of Educators (ANE) as one recipient of 
NED funding, claiming it was associated with the opposition 
party Democratic Action (AD).  He also asserted that 
Democratic Coordinator spokesman Jesus Torrealba is ANE\'s 
director.  ANE spokesperson Leonardo Carvajal explained that 
the organization most recently received NED funds between 
2001 and 2002, according to a February 9 news report. 
Carvajal also denied that the ANE is associated with AD, 
saying that \"no ANE board director belongs to any political 
party,\" though he indicated the ANE had been linked with the 
MAS party during 1975-1988. (Note: Carvajal is closely allied 
with the opposition, and ANE is a member of the Democratic 
Coordinator.) 
 
4. (C) Presumably unbeknownst to Chavez, USAID/OTI awarded 
Sumate a grant for $89,000 in August 2003 to verify the 
reliability of the National Electoral Register (REP) by 
visiting the homes of randomly chosen registered voters. 
The study found the REP was 97 percent reliable, information 
which benefits both the government and the opposition. 
Following standard procedure, USAID/OTI asked a reputable 
Mexican statistician to review Sumate\'s methodology and asked 
Sumate to delay releasing the study results until the 
statistician\'s review was complete.  Sumate agreed to the 
request but then announced the study results anyway.  Due to 
this procedural disagreement, the embassy reduced the grant 
amount to $42,000 to cover work accomplished up to that point 
(late 2003).  In addition, Sumate\'s higher profile as an 
opposition NGO made it more difficult to carry out an 
ostensibly non-partisan study. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) This GOV attack on Sumate, a highly effective and well 
organized opposition group, as a puppet of the USG is a 
centerpiece of Chavez\' anti-referendum campaign.  Chavez is 
using the news of opposition participation in NED programs as 
further \"evidence\" of a USG plot to remove him from power. 
That pro-government groups have been beneficiaries of those 
same programs will continue to be staple fodder in 
Venezuela\'s political battles.  Allegations similar to 
Chavez\' comments appear on the website 
www.venezuelafoia.info, \"...devoted to investigating US 
meddling in Venezuela.\"  The website includes the Bigwood 
FOIA request, the CIA\'s response, and names the NED as a 
Sumate grantor.  The website also  concludes that NED has 
 
exclusively supported various opposition groups with grants 
totaling more than $800,000 and thereby contributed to the 
country\'s political destabilization.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) announced 
February 24 that petition forms with more than one third of 
the signatures to petition the recall of President Chavez 
will be submitted to the CNE\'s Superior Technical Committee 
(CTS) for further review because they were filled in with the 
same handwriting.  The OAS and the Carter Center issued a 
joint statement February 24 renewing support for a democratic 
process and calling on the CNE to reach a decision by the end 
of February. The Canadian Embassy in Caracas issued a 
statement February 20 reiterating support for the OAS and the 
Carter Center\'s on-going efforts.  The European Union (EU) 
February 24 expressed \"worry\" at the CNE\'s delay in verifying 
the signatures.  OAS Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo told 
the Ambassador February 25 pro-GoV CNE Director Rodriguez 
threatened to kick out the international observers if they 
pre-empted the CNE.  Jaramillo said he anticipates more GoV 
delays, at least through March 18.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CNE Sends Planillas to CTS for Review 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Francisco Carrasquero, president of the National 
Electoral Council (CNE), announced February 24 that 148,190 
petition forms (planillas) will be submitted to the CNE\'s 
Superior Technical Committee (CTS) for further review.  These 
forms represent roughly 1.3 million signatures of the 3.4 
million submitted by the opposition seeking a recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  The forms, the CNE 
said, are suspect because they contain some personal 
information filled out in handwriting different that the 
signature (so-called \"planillas planas\"), allegedly in 
violation of the CNE instructions. 
 
3. (U) Pro-GoV CNE director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters 
February 25 that when the norms for the signature drive were 
discussed, the full CNE board was in agreement that every 
signer would have to fill in his or her own data.  Rodriguez 
said that any signature forms with the same handwriting were 
therefore suspect.  He refused to confirm a press report that 
the CNE was planning to start the process by which citizens 
can challenge the validation of their signatures on March 11, 
and reiterated that no signatures have been invalidated. 
Rodriguez rejected the statistical sampling system proposed 
by the OAS and the Carter Center, calling it was 
\"statistically deficient.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
Statements Supporting the Process 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The OAS and the Carter Center issued a joint statement 
shortly after Carrasquero\'s February 24 statement renewing 
support for a democratic process and calling on the CNE to 
continue reach a decision by the end of February.  The 
Canadian Embassy also issued a statement February 20 quoting 
its Foreign Minister and reiterating the GoC\'s firm support 
for the OAS and the Carter Center\'s efforts to guarantee a 
\"transparent, legitimate and peaceful\" referendum process. 
The statement said the citizens\' rights are paramount, and 
called on the CNE to adopt methods to ensure maximum citizen 
participation.  (Note: A copy of the Canadian statement has 
been forwarded to WHA/AND).  The European Union (EU) February 
24 expressed \"worry\" at the CNE\'s delay in verifying the 
signatures, and called on the CNE to quickly fulfill its 
duties by February 28.  The EU statement reiterated support 
for the OAS team of observers and referred to May 29, 2003 
agreement between the GoV and the opposition to move forward 
with a constitutional process. 
 
5. (C) On February 25, OAS Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo 
 
told the Ambassador that he had objected to some changes that 
the Carter Center (including President Carter) had wanted to 
include in the OAS/Carter Center message, the OAS had been 
willing to make an independent statement, but compromise 
language was reached just before it was released.  The Carter 
Center had wanted to release the statement before the CNE 
decision, but Jaramillo said CNE Director Rodriguez 
threatened to kick out the observers if they pre-empted the 
CNE.  Jaramillo told the Ambassador that he does not see any 
will in the CNE to reach a decision on the referendum. 
Jaramillo anticipates more delays, at least through March 18. 
 
6. (C) Jaramillo considered the statements by the EU and 
Canada very useful.  He said he needs more support from 
countries for the OAS mission, though ruled out most other 
key players in the region.  OAS Permanent Council President 
Durant\'s visit may not be a good idea now, Jaramillo said, 
especially since the Canadians issued a statement already.  A 
statement from the OAS Permanent Council is not feasible.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Pro-GOV Merida State Governor Florencio Porras ordered 
an investigation against 24 opposition-aligned citizens in 
January, alleging civil rebellion stemming back to events in 
April 2002, when President Hugo Chavez was briefly removed 
from power.  Students led violent protests January 29 and 
February 12 in support of the implicated Meridans, which 
include student leaders and professors.  Opposition leaders 
have characterized the charges as a political witch hunt, 
timed to leave them leaderless during regional elections and 
distract attention from presidential recall efforts.  Pro-GOV 
contacts largely confirmed the political timing of the 
charges, although they defended the Governor\'s right to press 
them.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
24 Opposition Leaders Accused of \"Civil Rebellion\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (U) Pro-GOV Merida State Governor Florencio Porras (Fifth 
Republic Movement or MVR) started an investigation in January 
implicating 24 opposition-aligned political, business, and 
student leaders in civil rebellion during April 12, 2002. 
The alleged rebellious acts the morning after President Hugo 
Chavez was briefly removed from power involved opposition 
supporters gathering outside the statehouse to demand Porras 
also step down.  University of the Andes (ULA) professor and 
ex-Merida Mayor Fortunato Gonzalez told poloff February 5 
that prosecutor Danilo Anderson delivered summons January 22 
for 15 to 16 members of the group to attend a formal reading 
of the charges January 29, which also include conspiracy, 
assault, and deprivation of movement.  In addition to 
Gonzalez,  Porras is accusing student leader Nixon Moreno, 
Merida Chamber of Commerce President Cesar Guillen, Merida 
Mayor and gubernatorial candidate Carlos Belandria 
(Democratic Action or AD), and gubernatorial candidate and 
former governor Jesus Rondon Nucete (Christian Democrat or 
COPEI), among others. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Opposition Attacks Charges as Unconstitutional 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (C) Guillen explained that he and seven other implicated 
Venezuelans filed a joint motion to throw the charges out on 
constitutional grounds.  The judge concluded February 4 that 
he was not competent to rule on the matter.  Anderson claimed 
Judge Aranbulo Brady was prejudiced against him and requested 
another judge February 3.  Convergencia party leader Luis 
Izarra told poloff February 17 that the appeals court 
rejected Anderson\'s argument February 12 and returned the 
case to Brady. 
 
4. (C) Dr. Marcos Avilio Trejo said when Anderson read him 
the charges he learned he was being singled out for comments 
published April 11, 2002, regarding the possible 
constitutionality of a coup outlined in article 350. 
According to Trejo, the Governor has repeatedly berated and 
implied the guilt of the implicated on his weekly radio show, 
for example saying \"they should start working out to prepare 
for the penitentiary Olympics.\"  Trejo claimed the case 
should be thrown out on the basis of a document signed by 16 
public officials on April 12, 2002, including Porras, stating 
the Governor never resigned and was never detained. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Opposition: Charges are a Political Witch Hunt 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (C) Seven implicated contacts told poloff Army Gen. Wilmer 
Moreno, who had taken control of statehouse security, 
summoned them and others to the statehouse April 12 to 
restore calm and discuss forming a transitional government. 
 
Gonzalez asserted that all 200 opposition-aligned Venezuelans 
who entered the statehouse at some point on April 12, 2002, 
could ultimately be charged, though he speculated many of 
them have already paid to get off the list.  He alleged that 
Gov. Porras intentionally accused a broad range of 
Venezuelans, including political, business, academic, and 
student leaders, to send the message that no one was beyond 
his reach, including three Venezuelans who were not \"anywhere 
near the statehouse\" during April 12. 
 
6. (C) Ultimately, Gonzalez said they will prove \"that we did 
not ever detain, threaten, or attack\" Porras.  Gonzalez 
lamented that having the law on their side might not matter 
because \"this is a purely political process with an executive 
officer (Porras) controlling the judicial branch.\" 
Opposition contacts universally told poloff February 4 and 5 
that the real motive for the charges is to deflect attention 
from efforts to convoke a presidential recall referendum, 
install fear in the opposition, and leave them leaderless 
during regional elections. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Most MVR Sources Agree Charges are a Political Tool 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (C) Two out of three pro-GOV Merida contacts that 
discussed the issue with poloff agreed that the charges were 
political in nature.  National Assemblyman Luis Velazquez 
(MVR) told poloff February 11 that the events of April 12 
constituted an \"extreme\" lack of respect for the Governor, 
but that they did not rise to the level of civil rebellion 
and Porras knows it.  He said the charges, almost two years 
after the event, were timed for \"political effect\" and that 
the case would fall apart after the August regional elections 
before any of the implicated spends any time in jail. 
Nevertheless, he defended Gov. Porras\' right to press charges 
because \"they hit him\" and entered his offices without 
consent. 
 
8. (C) MVR state representative Guevara told poloff February 
4 that the crowd\'s actions in 2002 did not constitute 
rebellion and that most of them gathered because \"it was 
ambiguous what to do in this situation and people had heard 
that the Governor resigned.\"  However, he argued that Porras 
had every right to exaggerate the charges and time them to 
his greatest political advantage as \"a question of strategy.\" 
 
 
9. (C) Gov. Porras\' Secretary, Luis Martin, defended the 
substance and legality of the charges, claiming the crowd 
intended to kill Porras and his inner circle.  Martin 
admitted to poloff February 5 that media video and photos 
were the prosecution\'s only evidence, but argued that was 
enough \"to prove all those implicated were there or we 
wouldn\'t have cited them.\"  He also maintained that it was 
normal to have a special prosecutor in special cases, citing 
precedence in murder cases. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Charges Spark Violence in Student Protests 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10. (C) Student-organized protests broke out January 29 and 
February 12 in Merida in support of the implicated. 
University of the Andes (ULA) student president Nixon Moreno 
told poloff February 17 that other students protested across 
Venezuela February 12 to show solidarity with the Merida 
students, protest decisions made by the National Electoral 
Council (CNE), and celebrate the Day of Youth (ref a). 
Moreno claimed five students, one opposition protester, one 
reporter (Victor Ferra with newspaper Cambio de Siglo), and 
16 police were injured during the February march.  He 
explained the February march was peaceful until state police 
started firing tear gas.  Moreno, one of the implicated, said 
he also faces similar charges of civil rebellion and public 
damage for organizing the protests. 
 
11. (C) Moreno claimed 12 students and four police were 
injured in the January 29 protest.  Moreno was one of five 
students seriously injured with plastic bullets after he 
urged protesters to cross police barricades from the roof of 
a police paddy wagon.  Moreno maintained the January 29 
protest was necessary to prevent Gov. Porras from imprisoning 
 
the implicated after they formally received the charges at 
the state prosecutor\'s office the same day, a common 
sentiment in opposition circles.  (Note: Tachira state 
Governor Blanco La Cruz imprisoned nine opposition leaders 
similarly charged with civil rebellion during April 12, refs 
b and c).  However, Chamber of Commerce President Guillen 
told poloff February 4 that the \"demonstration was important, 
but wouldn\'t have changed the outcome.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Chavistas Attack AD Headquarters While Leaders March 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
12. (C) AD state legislator and gubernatorial candidate Lubin 
Diaz told poloff February 5 that during the January 29 
demonstration, a group of about 80 pro-GOV \"Chavistas\" 
ransacked the Merida headquarters of the Democratic Action 
(AD) party.  Most of the AD leaders and staff were 
participating in the march at the time.  Police showed up in 
advance, but did not attempt to restrain the crowd until they 
broke up the looting at about 2:30 p.m., said Diaz.  He 
claimed the group burned a wooden door and AD documents, 
destroyed two nativity scenes, destroyed or stole office 
equipment and computers, and removed a large steel door. 
During the looting Esthela Lacruz, a local radio reporter, 
told poloff that she had to use a filing cabinet drawer for 
protection from projectiles from the crowd, who \"did not want 
me to cover the story.\"  Diaz estimated about $7,000 of 
damaged. He claimed a similar attack on AD headquarters 
occurred February 12, 2003. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) The defense by the Merida Governor\'s Secretary of the 
charges seemed particularly hollow, especially when he failed 
to recall how many people were implicated or summoned (\"20 
something\").  Additionally, when asked about the details of 
the case, he replied only in blank stares and uttering the 
mantra \"they beat\" the Governor.  Once again, Danilo Anderson 
has been handed a dubious political case, confirming what his 
fellow prosecutors told us in June about his role as GOV 
hatchet man (ref d).

1. (C)  House Western Hemisphere Subcommittee staff members 
met with opposition and government leaders, members of the 
National Assembly, and the UNHCR representative in Caracas 
February 18-20.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel 
emphasized the importance of maintaining a good 
Venezuelan-U.S. bilateral relationship despite the flare up 
of occassional conflicts.  Opposition leaders told staffers 
the GOV was only nominally a democracy, but acknowledged the 
success of Chavez\'s social programs.  OAS and Carter Center 
representatives said the government-allied CNE majority had 
rejected their proposal for verifying individuals\' signatures 
using a statistically random sampling of the disputed 
petition forms. The UNHCR representative explained to 
staffers that the GOV needs to rapidly improve its 
application process in order to deal with its growing 
Colombian refugee population.  Staffers also discussed the 
work of the \"Boston Group\" and pledged to continue plans for 
establishing a TV channel for the National Assembly.  END

MEETING WITH THE G-5 
-------------------- 
 
2. DCM hosted dinner for Caleb McCarry, Staff Director 
Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Jessica Lewis, Democratic 
Staff Director Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, and Paul 
Oostburg Sanz, Deputy Democratic Chief Counsel with leaders 
of the opposition:  Enrique Mendoza (head of the Democratic 
Coordinating Committee and Governor of Miranda State), 
Henrique Salas Romer (Proyecto Venezuela), Henry Ramos Allup 
(Secretary General of Accion Democratica), and Juan Fernandez 
(Gente de Petroleo).  The leaders characterized the GOV as a 
dictatorship in fact, with the cover of a constitution. 
Ramos said the international community does not understand 
that when a Venezuelan institution takes an action or makes a 
decision (such as the National Electoral Council), that it is 
typically subordinated to revolutionary politics.  The 
leaders agreed that the GOV\'s social programs have been very 
successful, especially Mision Robinson (literacy), Mision 
Barrio Adentro (medical services), and the Mercals 
(subsidized food products). 
 
----------------- 
THE GOV\'S MESSAGE 
----------------- 
 
3. (C)  The Staffers and Ambassador met February 19 with Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel.  The Vice President 
underscored the necessity for Venezuela and the United States 
to maintain a good bilateral relationship, despite occasional 
conflicts.  He pointed out that the U.S. needs regional and 
Venezuelan support to achieve its foreign policy goals and 
vice-versa.  He urged continued focus on the big picture in 
order to overcome any problems.  Rangel warned against 
misunderstanding Venezuela\'s purpose, which is not to become 
another Cuba, but to address long-standing problems in the 
country.  He noted that Cuban doctors established in other 
countries, such as Guatemala, do not draw the same criticism 
as those working in Venezuela and denied any political 
purpose to the project.  McCarry responded that the USG 
remains concerned about the extent of the Cuban government\'s 
role in Venezuelan policies. 
 
4. (C)  The Ambassador questioned Rangel about developments 
in the CNE.  The Vice President reiterated the government\'s 
message about the existence of major fraud.  He agreed that 
the OAS and the Carter Center played a beneficial role as 
observers but stressed that the CNE\'s opinion of the process 
must take precedence over the opinion of international 
organizations.  Rangel accused WHA DAS Peter DeShazo of 
giving more weight to the opinion of the OAS and Carter 
Center over that of the CNE during his recent visit to 
Venezuela and warned against this interpretation of the 
process.  Ambassador conveyed the USG\'s view that through 
their presence the OAS and the Carter Center lend credibility 
to an institution which, as Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez_ had 
 
stated, has none.  While the CNE has the legal authority to 
make this decision, the OAS and Carter Center observers\' 
views were of great importance.  McCarry added the U.S. 
Congress\'s concurrence with Ambassador\'s points. 
 
5. (C)  In a separate meeting, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Arevalo Mendez and pro-government National Assembly member 
Luis Tascon told staffers and Ambassador that they had proof 
of extensive fraud in the Presidential recall referendum 
signature collection.  Tascon cited a few examples, but 
claimed to have 20,000 testimonials from individuals 
explaining how their names were fraudulently used.  Tascon 
also alleged 60,000 forms were handed out on the four 
mornings of the signature drive and not returned in the 
evenings of the same day, in violation of the rules.  Mendez 
expressed their conviction that President Chavez has already 
won the  2006 election and that official candidates will win 
governorships in Miranda, Anzoategui and Zulia.  Mendez went 
on to say that since democracy is best expressed in elections 
and electoral processes, Venezuela currently has the 
strongest democracy in the world. 
 
------------------------------ 
VIEWS FROM OAS & CARTER CENTER 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C)  Ambassador hosted a meeting in which OAS country 
representative Patricio Carbacho and Carter Center 
representative Francisco Diez gave staffers their assessment 
of progress in the National Electoral Council (CNE).  Diez 
offered a more pessimistic view of the situation, saying he 
saw no hope for an acceptable CNE decision on the question of 
fraudulent signatures.  Carbacho told staffers he was 
optimistic that the CNE would be able to successfully mount a 
system for validating any challenged signatures.  Diez and 
Carbacho said they had proposed contacting individuals in a 
random sampling of the challenged population of petition 
forms (\"planillas planas\") to verify their signatures.  The 
CNE directors rejected this proposed statistical sampling. 
Diez noted that the directors were also considering obtaining 
national identification information through the banking 
system. 
--------------------------------------------- - 
BOSTON GROUP FIRMS PLANS FOR VENEZUELAN C-SPAN 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (SBU)  Staffers met with Venezuelan Boston Group 
organizers Pedro Diaz Blum (Proyecto Venezuela) and Calixto 
Ortega (Fifth Republic Movement) and other members of the 
group to discuss ongoing plans for establishing a TV channel 
with continuous live broadcasting from the National Assembly 
(ref A).  The members agreed to move forward with the project 
and to schedule another meeting on the topic with 
Representatives Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Bill Delahunt (D-MA) 
and Gregory Meeks (D-NY) for early May, 2004 in Venezuela. 
In response to a request from Ortega, McCarry explained the 
mechanics of NED project funding, emphasizing the 
organization\'s bipartisan support within the U.S.  After 
debating the topic, the group members agreed to refrain from 
making any public statements about GOV accusations that the 
USG is spending millions of dollars to assist opposition 
groups since it might affect the Boston Group\'s own 
existence.  In response to McCarry\'s outline of the proposed 
Boston Group television project, Rangel promised support and 
resources. 
 
------------------------- 
A DIFFERENT CHAVISTA VIEW 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C)  DCM also hosted dinner for staffdel with five 
Chavista leaders, only one of whom attended, Ibrain 
Velasquez, Assembly deputy from Margarita Island.  Velasquez 
told staffers the political split among the different parties 
is so wide that cooperation and compromise are almost 
impossible.  The pro-Chavez deputy said he does not think the 
referendum will happen and asserted that there was mega fraud 
in the signature collection.  Ambassador and DCM asked why no 
statements were issued at the time of collection, to which 
Velasquez replied that no one had anticipated it as a 
problem.  He claimed that signature forms were not promptly 
returned because they were taken to \"laboratories\" to be 
fraudulently filled out.  He stressed that only a technical 
solution to the problems in the CNE offered an acceptable 
resolution to the recall process.  According to Velasquez, in 
a yes/no vote, the President would win if an election were 
 
called right now.  However, the government will not call for 
an election because it is unwilling to accept the conditions 
which the opposition would insist on. 
 
------------------------ 
ON THE TOPIC OF REFUGEES 
------------------------ 
 
9. (C)  Staffdel McCarry met February 20 with Virginia 
Trimarco, the Caracas-based regional representative for the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to discuss the 
extent of the refugee problem in Venezuela, the GOV response, 
and UNHCR\'s role.  Trimarco explained to the delegation that 
historically Venezuela did not have large numbers of refugees 
and therefore had no system in place for processing them. 
Also, movement across the border in both directions has 
always been very fluid, which wasn\'t a problem until a few 
years ago when large numbers of  Colombians began to enter 
Venezuela and stay.  The number of applicants for refugee 
status is large and growing due to guerrilla violence and 
drug trafficking.  Trimarco estimates that there are 150,000 
Colombians in the Western Venezuelan states; Zulia, Tachira 
and Apure.  UNHCR vets applicants in conjunction with 
security forces to weed out known criminals, but the security 
forces need training in this area. Trimarco told the staffers 
her office had sent VP Rangel a letter explaining the refugee 
situation, and emphasizing the dire need for improved

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Opposition groups staged two days of protests in the 
wake of the February 27 march that left one dead and dozens 
injured.  The GOV staged its own march of hundreds of 
thousands on February 28 to protest U.S. intervention in 
Venezuelan affairs.  Speaking to the crowd, President Chavez 
delivered an unusually ferocious attack against the USG, in 
which he repeatedly attacked President Bush, claiming he had 
evidence of U.S. invasion plans.  The President promised to 
meet any blockade or invasion by cutting off oil to the U.S.; 
any actions against Venezuelan companies in the U.S. would be 
reciprocated against U.S. companies in Venezuela.  The 
National Electoral Council (CNE) did not/not report the 
preliminary results of the presidential recall signature 
drive on February 29 as planned and plans to meet on March 1 
to come to an agreement.  The CNE approved instructions for 
the five-day challenge period for the referendum petition 
signatures and asked for comments from the parties.  End 
summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Three Days of Conflict 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) In the wake of the GOV\'s quelling of the opposition\'s 
march on February 27, small opposition groups staged protests 
throughout Venezuela on February 28 and 29.  Protesters 
blocked roads, burning tires and trash day and night, 
throughout the eastern part of Caracas.  GOV security forces 
made little effort to clear protests and open roads.  Similar 
incidents were reported in the states of Zulia, Carabobo, 
Lara, Anzoategui, and Tachira.  Some protesters claimed to be 
acting under Article 350 of the constitution, which obligates 
citizens to reject a government that strays from democratic 
rule or violates human rights.  Graffiti around Caracas says: 
\"RR or 350\" (Recall Referendum or Article 350 of the 
Constitution). 
 
3. (U) In Caracas, the main conflict February 29 occurred at 
Plaza Francia in the pro-opposition area of Altamira, where 
dozens of National Guard clashed with more than a hundred 
protesters.  Eight protesters were wounded by gunshots and 
more than 100 suffered from tear gas, according to Chacao 
Mayor Leopoldo Lopez. 
 
4. (U) An opposition group of about 120 people demonstrated 
support for the USG at the Embassy on February 29.  The 
demonstration was peaceful and without incident. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOV Rallies March Against Imperialism 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOV organized a mass march on February 29 with 
participants from all over the country.  The theme was 
rejection of U.S. intervention in Venezuela and of electoral 
fraud by the opposition.  Foreign press reports said more 
than 100,000 people attended the march, which ended on the 
Francisco Fajardo highway.  Private media reports showed more 
than a hundred buses used to transport many march 
participants from outside Caracas.  Poloff observed about 300 
pro-government marchers heading toward the march\'s beginning 
point under escort by five armed men in plain clothes on 
motorcycle.  The marchers appeared to be from the states of 
Cojedes and Anzoategui and carried anti-U.S. signs.  DCM 
observed marchers arriving from eastern Caracas.  The class 
and racial differences between these marchers and the 
anti-GOV marchers were striking.  Most marchers were 
organized (e.g., by participation in Plan Ribas, Plan 
Robinson, Diosdado Cabello supporters) and identified by 
T-shirts.  The demonstrations were enthusiastic. 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
Chavez Alleges U.S. Invasion Plans 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) During his two-and-a-half-hour speech to march 
participants, obligatorily broadcast on all Venezuelan 
television and radio stations, President Chavez railed 
against the United States for alleged imperialism and 
intervention throughout the world.  He claimed to have radio 
intercepts from February 28 proving that U.S. warships were 
preparing to invade Venezuela.  Chavez threatened to cut off 
oil shipments to the U.S. if the USG moved to blockade or 
invade Venezuela.  Chavez also vowed to reciprocate any 
actions against Venezuelan assets in the United States with 
actions against U.S. investments in Venezuela.  Chavez 
offered a bet to President Bush that he, Chavez, would remain 
in officer longer.  He also made a racially-charged reference 
to Secretary Powell\'s decision not to run for president in 
1996 for fear of being assassinated.  He insulted the 
President, twice calling him a \"pendejo\" (literally a pubic 
hair, colloquially a derogatory term for idiot). 
 
---------------------------------- 
CNE Puts Off Decision One More Day 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) director Jorge 
Rodriguez (pro-GOV) announced late on February 29 that the 
CNE board would release preliminary results of the 
verification of signatures collected in support of a recall 
referendum against President Chavez 24 hours later on March 
1.  The CNE worked over the weekend without the two 
opposition directors, Ezequiel Zamora and Sobella Mejias.  In 
their absence, the CNE board approved instructions for the 
five-day challenge process to affirm or contest signatures 
tossed out during the verification process.  Rodriguez said 
the parties to the signature drive could \"evaluate the 
appropriateness\" of the instructions before the preliminary 
results are released.  Zamora said publicly that the 
instructions as approved would make the referendum not 
feasible. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Having reached the boiling point, the political 
situation is only going to be made more tense by the CNE\'s 
decision.  It is doubtful the CNE is going to reach a 
mutually favorable decision on the five-day challenge process 
and the number of signatures subject to it.  Though he was 
clearly playing it up for the occasion, Chavez\'s speech was 
the most severe anti-American rhetoric in the past two years. 
 He has marked the United States as the intellectual masters 
of the opposition, equating an electoral solution with a coup 
and, now, with an invasion.  While Chavez\'s charges against 
us are laughable, the capacity for his supporters to listen 
to him crying wolf, and believe him, seems infinite.

REF: 2003 CARACAS 4142 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES S. SHAPIRO; REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez_ announced February 19 
the award of Block 3 of the off-shore Deltana Platform 
natural gas project to ChevronTexaco.  Despite the fact that 
ChevronTexaco was the only bidder for the block in December 
2003, ChevronTexaco de Venezuela President Ali Moshiri said 
he was pleased but surprised.  The project was apparently 
kept on track as a result of representations to Chavez by 
Ramirez_ and PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez despite current 
political tensions over the recall referendum on Chavez\'s 
presidency.  Moshiri confirmed press reports that 
ChevronTexaco expects to begin its drilling program in Block 
2 in August and stated bluntly that he believes the Deltana 
Platform project is significantly ahead of the Mariscal Sucre 
project, the supposed keystone of natural gas development in 
Venezuela.  A Colombia-Venezuela gas pipeline remains stalled 
as a result of GOV military concerns about energy integration 
with its neighbor.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Deltana Platform is located in waters contiguous 
with Venezuela,s maritime border with Trinidad and consists 
of 27,000 square kilometers with estimated proven gas 
reserves of 20-30 trillion cubic feet.  The first two of five 
planned blocks in the project were awarded in February 2003 
to ChevronTexaco and Norway,s Statoil (Blocks 2 and 4 
respectively), in a widely criticized bidding process. 
Critics disputed the transparency of a process in which the 
GOV designated a short list of preferred bidders.  Blocks 3 
and 5 were subsequently re-opened for an international 
bidding process in September 2003 in which 13 companies 
bought bid packages.  In early December 2003, ChevronTexaco 
was the sole bidder, on Block 3 only, pledging a $5 million 
bonus for the block.  Block 1 is still outside the bidding 
process with the GOV holding talks with BP, which operates 
the Kapok field in contiguous Trinidadian waters.  Guillermo 
Quintero, President of BP Venezuela Holdings, recently told 
econoff that progress is being made in this dialogue. 
 
3. (C) The requirements for the first Deltana Platform 
bidding round required the winners to take on a minority 
partner within 60 days of winning the bid.  ChevronTexaco 
took on ConocoPhillips (which Moshiri describes as a \"passive 
partner\") as its partner in Block 2.  Despite the 
requirement, Statoil to date has not taken on a partner for 
Block 4.  Moshiri speculated that Statoil cannot find a 
perspective partner willing to take on a share of the $40 
million bid price.  According to the terms and conditions of 
the Block 2 bidding process, PDVSA may take anywhere from a 1 
percent to a 30 percent share of the block once commerciality 
is declared.  The terms and conditions for the second Deltana 
Platform bid round did not require the winner to take on a 
partner and Moshiri told econoff in December that 
ChevronTexaco would probably plan to operate Block 3 itself. 
 
 
------------------------- 
AWARD A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In a February 23 meeting, ChevronTexaco de Venezuela 
President Ali Moshiri told econoff he was pleased but 
surprised the award had been made.  Moshiri underlined that 
he had not sought to communicate with the Ministry about the 
bid during the three-month wait \"in order to preserve the 
transparency of the process.\"  Another ChevronTexaco employee 
confided to econoff February 22 that Moshiri had told him 
that Minister Rafael Ramirez_ and PDVSA President Ali 
Rodriguez had urged President Chavez to approve the award to 
ChevronTexaco despite the current tension in the bilateral 
relations between the U.S. and Venezuela.  Both Ramirez_ and 
Rodriguez are reported to have said that ChevronTexaco has 
 
been scrupulously apolitical. 
 
5. (C) Moshiri confirmed press reports that ChevronTexaco 
expects to begin its drilling program in Block 2 in August. 
In fact, ChevronTexaco and Statoil will meet the week of 
March 1 to discuss sharing a drilling rig.  Blocks 2 and 3 
will be united into a single operational area which will 
benefit from the proximity of the Manatee Field in contiguous 
Trinidadian waters in which ChevronTexaco and British Gas 
(BG) both have 50 percent equity.  Moshiri revealed that 
ChevronTexaco has just completed negotiations with BG to take 
over operation of the Manatee Field.  Moshiri said he 
believes the prospects for Block 3 are as good as those for 
Block 4 for which Statoil paid $40 million so, laughed 
Moshiri, it was cheap at $5 million. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
DISARRAY IN DEVELOPMENT OF VENEZUELA\'S OTHER NATURAL GAS 
RESOURCES 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOV has planned that the keystone project in the 
development of Venezuela,s offshore natural gas resources 
would be the so-called Mariscal Sucre project.  This project, 
which has gone through a number of incarnations over more 
than ten years, envisions the construction of a $2 billion 
liquefied natural gas plant in Guiria on Venezuela,s Paria 
Peninsula.  Despite the signature of an MOU by project 
partners PDVSA, Shell and Mitsubishi in 2002, progress has 
been slow.   Although Shell Venezuela President Joaquin 
Moreno told econoff on January 28 that he expects a joint 
venture agreement will finally be signed in August, other 
industry sources in Caracas are skeptical.  The financing for 
the project may also be problematic.  The GOV decided in 2001 
that PDVSA would take a 60 percent share in the project. 
Given the company\'s current problems, industry sources have 
questioned whether it could come up with the money.  The 
Venezuelans have offered Qatar a nine percent share of the 
project but a local attorney now providing legal services to 
PDVSA has told econoff he doubts Qatar will ultimately decide 
to come into the project.  (Note:  In fact, Ali Moshiri told 
econoff that, in a February 19 meeting with Minister Ramirez_, 
the Minister had delicately asked him if ChevronTexaco would 
consider taking Qatar on as a partner in Block 3 of the 
Deltana Platform.  End Note)  Shell has also informed econoff 
that it has not yet begun lining up the financing for the 
multi-billion dollar project. 
 
7. (C) Ali Moshiri stated bluntly to econoff that he believes 
the Deltana Platform project is significantly ahead of the 
Mariscal Sucre project.  Noting that the Mariscal Sucre 
partners have an MOU spelling out the broad outlines of the 
business model but no license, Moshiri said that 
ChevronTexaco now has a license as well as a development plan 
spelling out how it will manage the exploration project and 
cost recovery as well as how it will pay sunk costs.  \"As 
soon as we find gas, we can move ahead,\" he said.  When 
econoff asked whether the company has the option to take the 
gas out through Trinidad, he responded that the parties must 
mutually agree to do so.  The GOV, he posited, would not 
agree.  ChevronTexaco itself would move ahead to build the 
Guiria facility, he said, \"if there is enough gas.\" 
 
8. (C) Turning to a discussion of his competitors, Moshiri 
said the Ministry is disappointed with Shell and Statoil. 
Commenting that the Ministry of Energy and Mines \"is as much 
a political as an energy ministry,\" Moshiri noted that former 
PDVSA President Luis Giusti is on the Shell Board and thus 
the current GOV believes Shell is meddling in Venezuelan 
politics behind the scenes.  Moshiri said the Minister of 
Energy and Mines has also been disappointed that Statoil had 
not lived up to promises it made when it came into the 
Venezuelan market. 
 
-------------------------------- 
OTHER NATURAL GAS OPTIONS COMING 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Ministry of Energy and Mines has announced that it 
will  moved ahead this year with a bid round on additional 
off-shore exploratory areas in the Gulf of Venezuela and West 
Falcon in western Venezuela.  Moshiri confirmed that 
 
ChevronTexaco will also take a close look at these blocks, 
particularly as they are located close to the company\'s 
Venezuelan home base in Maracaibo. 
 
------------------------------- 
COLOMBIA-VENEZUELA GAS PIPELINE 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Moshiri said he expects to meet with Colombian 
President Uribe and Colombian Energy Minister Luis Ernesto 
during their visit to Caracas for the G-15 Summit.  Moshiri, 
whose regional responsibilities also cover Colombia, is 
trying to push ahead on an MOU between Venezuela and Colombia 
to allow development of a cross border gas pipeline to carry 
Colombian gas to Venezuela.  Despite the fact that the gas is 
desperately needed in western Venezuela for injection into 
oil wells as well as commercial and other industrial uses, 
Moshiri said ideology is driving the business and the 
Venezuelan military is saying \"no\" to the pipeline.  Finally, 
Moshiri noted that both Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael 
Ramirez_ and Colombian Minister Luis Ernesto have told him 
they are proud of what they have done to stop the leakage of 
subsidized Venezuelan gasoline into Colombia. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (C) ChevronTexaco was the only bidder on Block 3 and it 
would, perhaps, have been embarrassing for the GOV to reject 
the bid.  But the bottom line is that, through deft handling, 
ChevronTexaco has managed to maintain an excellent 
relationship with the GOV and is expanding its opportunities 
in Venezuela.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The rise in political tensions over the 
revocatory referendum on Chavez\'s tenure in office and 
attendant violence is beginning to spill over into the 
economy.  The parallel market bolivar/dollar rate has spiked 
as has the spread on Venezuelan bonds.  It appears, however, 
that a planned bond issue will go forward.  In the face of 
rumors of a possible US embargo on Venezuelan oil, state oil 
company PDVSA President made soothing noises, only to be 
undercut by inflammatory comments by President Chavez.  Food 
sector businesses are reviewing their emergency supply plans, 
although they see no imminent crisis.  There are no problems 
with the electrical supply.  Some gasoline stations are 
closed, causing concerns about supply.  Flights at Caracas\'s 
international airport are proceeding as scheduled, although 
with many cancellations, presumably because of uncertainties 
regarding ground transportation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Financial Indicators  --  Currency and Country Risk 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (U)  Even prior to the street protests, political 
tensions had taken a toll on international markets\' 
confidence in Venezuela.  In the period following the 
February 5 devaluation of the official rate from 1600/dollar 
to 1920/dollar, the parallel rate (implicit rate between 
CANTV American Depositary Receipts trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange and CANTV ordinary shares trading on the 
Caracas Stock Exchange) was stable around 3050/dollar. 
However, as the prospects for the referendum have grown more 
dubious it has moved sharply upward, trading upwards of 3250. 
 As of March 1, the CANTV rate was at 3303/dollar.  By 
another measure, that of quasi-legal trading in dollars by 
stock market operators, the dollar is trading even higher, at 
3450/dollar. 
 
3.  (U)  Similarly, Venezuelan country risk, measured as the 
spread between its benchmark Global 27 bond and the 30 U.S. 
treasury bond, has increased.  This spread, which had been 
562 basis points (1 basis point = .01 percent) on February 6, 
had risen to 619 basis points on February 20 and 635 basis 
points on February 27.  We understand that as of mid-day 
March 2, the spread had climbed to over 700 basis points. 
 
 
----------------------- 
Bond Sale to Go Forward 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  In the light of the turbulence in currency and 
bond markets there have been questions raised about whether 
the GOV will hold off on a long-planned large bond issue 
which would roll over existing locally denominated debt into 
a mixture of foreign and domestic obligations with longer 
maturities.  As was the case with previous issues, this one 
would have as its principal attraction for buyers the 
immediate exchangeability of purchased bonds for dollars at 
the official rate.  Econcouns asked Ali Lenin Aguilera, 
senior advisor to Finmin Nobrega, if the transaction, rumored 
to be going forward in the next few days would be delayed 
given that the higher interest rate which would have to be 
paid.  Aguilera responded that the Ministry had consulted 
with its investment banker, and would be going forward.  Once 
the numbers were run, it was clear that the losses from the 
higher interest rate would be made up by the fact that 
devaluation meant that the GOV would be paying fewer dollars 
for the same amount of bolivars on the rollover of locally 
denominated debt. 
 
----------------------- 
Oil Production Comments 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  With Chavez\'s increasing effort to paint the 
 
current political crisis in terms of USG interference in 
domestic politics, rumors of a U.S. embargo on Venezuelan oil 
exports (the U.S. counts for 57 pct of Venezuela\'s crude 
exports) have circulated.  On February 28, PDVSA President 
Ali Rodriguez publicly discounted any rupture in 
U.S.-Venezuela energy relations, asserting that \"nothing is 
heading in that direction,\" and that \"the concern of U.S. 
authorities is to maintain normality in these relations.\" 
However, Rodriguez\'s calm words were overtaken by President 
Chavez\'s fiery remarks in his February 29 speech at which he 
suggested that in a crisis the USG might seize CITGO, 
Venezuela\'s downstream chain in the U.S. or otherwise 
\"blockade Venezuela, but in that case \"not a drop of oil 
would arrive from Venezuela\" and that the U.S. should 
remember that it has \"plenty of installations here\" (that 
could be seized in retaliation.  (See septel for reporting on 
U.S. oil firms\' reactions to Chavez\'s comments.) 
 
-------------------------- 
Key Services:  Food Supply 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  Agricultural specialists queried representatives 
of the National Supermarket\'s Association (ANSA) and the 
Venezuela Food Producers\' Chamber (CAVIDEA) regarding 
possible disruptions to food supply as a result of the street 
protests.  (Note:  Some supermarkets were shut down on March 
1.  Econoff saw long lines in front of some supermarkets on 
March 2.  End note.)  According to the representatives of the 
trade associations, a contingency plan for assuring food 
supplies is under review, and could be activated within the 
next 24-48 hours.  Supermarkets may operate under limited 
hours, as they did during the December 2002-February 2003 
general strike.  Although supportive of the political aims of 
the opposition strikers, the food sector is concerned about 
\"effervescence in the street,\" which can easily turn into 
sackings of supermarkets.  At the wholesale level, there are 
adequate food stocks for three months, they advised. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Key Services: Gasoline 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  As of March 2, there were reports (including from 
embassy staff) of some difficulties obtaining gasoline, as a 
result of filling stations being closed in areas near to 
roadblocks, either because managers felt it was unsafe to 
open or because they had run out of fuel to sell and had not 
received replacement supplies. (Note:  Running gas trucks 
near areas where burning barricades are up would be obviously 
unsafe.  End note.)  There are, however, other reports of 
open gasoline stations, without long lines.  A ChevronTexaco 
downstream manager told energy officer that the distribution 
plant in Guatire, which services Caracas, and the plant 
serving northern Valencia are indeed having problems in 
delivering fuel.  The Texaco station in Las Mercedes (used by 
the Embassy) has already run out of unleaded fuel.  State oil 
corporation PDVSA has assured ChevronTexaco that all 
refineries are operating normally and that the only gasoline 
problems lie in distribution. 
 
-------------------------- 
Key Services:  Electricity 
-------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU)  A check with a manager at \"Electricidad de 
Caracas,\" the utility serving the capital, revealed the 
situation to be normal, with electrical power fully 
available.  Some of the firm\'s offices, however, had been 
closed or had reduced staffing because of transportation 
problems.  A report that the company\'s sub-station in 
Altamira, the site of some of the most severe street 
protests, was false, although there had been some damage to 
street lamps.  \"Electricidad de Caracas\" is majority owned by 
U.S. power holding company AES, and Chavez\'s comments about 
the possible seizure of U.S. industry in Venezuela in a 
crisis had not been well-received. 
 
---------------------- 
 
 
Key Services: Aviation 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU)  Executives of U.S. air carriers flying out of 
Caracas\'s international airport advised that flights are 
proceeding normally, and that air crews who normally 
overnight at hotels near the airport, are having no trouble 
getting to their planes.  However, there have many 
cancellations, apparently the result of passenger concerns 
about their ability to get to the airport because of problems 
on the streets.  Taxi drivers are reportedly charging double 
or triple their normal airport fares.  An official of the 
National Institute of Civil Aviation (FAA-equivalent) told 
econ specialist that on March 1 there had been some 
rock-throwing incidents and temporary blockages of at least 
one of the tunnels on the airport highway, but these had been 
promptly stopped by police. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  A few days of snarled traffic in Caracas is not 
in and of itself likely to provoke any serious economic 
crisis.  But the fact remains that at its best Venezuela\'s 
economy, severely damaged by last year\'s strike and the only 
minimal recovery since then, is vulnerable to even modest 
shocks.  If street violence is prolonged, many people, from 
Wall Street bond traders to Caracas food shoppers, could 
start to panic, affecting the price and supply of both money 
and products.

Summary

1. (C) The Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC) is 
negotiating with National Electoral Council (CNE) Director 
Jorge Rodriguez to design a workable appeals process 
(\"reparo\") for regaining the signatures petitioning a 
presidential recall referendum not initially accepted by the 
CNE.  The DCC wants to have full international observer 
presence, expand the time period to at least three days, 
ensure the computer system is capable and fraud-proof, and 
restore signatures that were rejected for missing signature 
forms and tally sheets.  The DCC is also fighting to maintain 
internal agreement on whether even to negotiate with the CNE, 
with NGOs and Henrique Salas Romer the notable holdouts.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------ 
DCC Negotiating With CNE 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Poloff met on March 3 with Democratic Coordinating 
Committee (DCC) representatives Enrique Naime, Amado Dounias, 
and Daniel Thiman, who are operational officials for the DCC. 
 Naime, who is the principal opposition witness for the 
signature verification process, confirmed that Miranda State 
Governor Enrique Mendoza and Movement to Socialism (MAS) 
party chief Felipe Mujica met twice with CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez on March 3 to negotiate a feasible process to 
re-affirm or challenge the signatures in support of a 
presidential recall (ref a).  Naime, MAS party official 
Nelson Rampersaad, and OAS and Carter Center representatives 
also attend the negotiations.  Naime said the DCC is 
dedicated to maintaining the \"democratic route\" to the 
referendum.  Rodriguez confirmed publicly on March 3 that the 
conversations had been \"very positive\" and will continue over 
the next few days. 
 
3. (C) Opposition advisor Ana Julia Jartar had a more 
negative assesment of the the negotiations, claiming that 
Rodriguez would not change &anything8 concerning previously 
announced rules and regulations governing the reparo.  The 
Ambassador told her to recognize this as a standard hard-line 
opening position in negotiations that should not defer the 
opposition from negotiating. 
 
4. (C) The CNE announced preliminary results of the signature 
count on March 2 in which the opposition fell some 600,000 
signatures short of the 2.4 million threshold required by the 
constitution.  Rodriguez publicly offered the opposition on 
March 2 an opportunity to discuss the design of the appeals 
process (\"proceso de reparos\" in Spanish).  Naime said that 
opposition spokespersons Julio Borges and Antonio Ledezma 
failed to give the DCC\'s consensus opinion that the 
opposition wanted a couple of days to study the CNE\'s 
preliminary decision before agreeing to negotiate. 
 
5. (C) Dounias said the DCC asked the CNE for a database of 
the preliminary results for study.  The DCC will request that 
signatures that were voided due to missing forms or lost 
tally sheets be reintegrated into the count of valid 
signatures.  Also, they will insist that all signatures go to 
the appeals process regardless of the reason for exclusion. 
Dounias said the DCC will ask for more technical 
specifications on how the computer system used to register 
appeals will work, which will determine how many days -- they 
would like at least three days for now though the rules 
dictate five -- or centers are needed to ensure the appeals 
process offers a chance at victory.  (Note: The Carter Center 
told the Ambassador on March 3 that the opposition and CNE 
Director Rodriguez would meet on March 5 to discuss the 
statistical results.  The opposition submitted 3.4 million 
signatures; the figure announced March 2 by CNE President 
 
Carrasquero totals 3.1 million.) 
 
6. (C) Opposition advisor Fernando Martinez Mottola told the 
Ambassador March 3 that 10,000 computers would be needed, not 
the 2,700 currently planned for. He also lamented possible 
logistical problems for the computers: power source, computer 
paper, Internet access, and the hardware itself.  The 
Ambassador added that Carter Center representatives told him 
March 2 that there was not enough time to secure and load the 
proper software. 
 
----------------------------- 
Internal Conflicts Plague DCC 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Naime acknowledged that the DCC is split on whether to 
negotiate with the CNE after its unfair treatment of the 
forms with similar handwriting (\"planillas planas\" in 
Spanish).  Naime said that Gente de Petroleo leader Juan 
Fernandez had \"gone crazy\" with his refusal to negotiate with 
the CNE.  The three representatives agreed that the NGOs in 
the DCC are most opposed to negotiating with the GOV, 
convinced the GOV is readying a trap that will cause the 
opposition to fail.  Political parties largely favor 
negotiations.  AD Secretary General Henry Ramos, said Naime, 
has agreed to participate in the appeals process if the DCC 
negotiates a \"feasible\" process. 
 
8. (C) Thiman noted that the conflict of opinion within the 
DCC reflects that of Venezuelan society over the CNE 
decision.  The representatives denied they were coordinating 
street demonstrations throughout Venezuela, insisting the 
protests are spontaneous.  Thiman said Saturday\'s march to 
the CNE headquarters is an attempt to channel frustration 
among their supporters. 
 
9. (C) Martinez told the Ambassador that the internal reparo 
debate has significantly stressed opposition unity, both 
within the CD and the individual parties that make up the CD. 
 He said a divide exists in the CD between people who want to 
abandon the recall process our of principle and those that 
wish to continue negotiating to gain international favor and 
bolster their democratic credentials.  Both sides have no 
illusions about the recall process: Chavez will not allow it 
happen.  The disagreement is over how to proceed.  According 
to Martinez, the negotiators are led by Enrique Mendoza, 
COPEI, and MAS.  Primero Justicia is supporting negotiations 
reluctantly, AD is split, and Projecto Venezuela is opposed 
to negotiating further.  Sumate staff  look at the process 
through a technical, practical perspective, in which 
continuing with a failed process is illogical.  The reparo 
&puts us in a position where we are against our own people 
that see the reparo as technically impossible,8 Martinez 
said. 
 
----------------- 
Enter Salas Romer 
----------------- 
 
10. (C) Proyecto Venezuela head Henrique Salas Romer, they 
said, is acting \"reborn\" with his call for civil disobedience 
on March 3.  They described Salas as a \"populist\" (Mendoza as 
a \"statesman\") who hopes the DCC will fail so that people 
support a military solution.  Naime believes Salas is 
positioning himself to take over the opposition if the 
Mendoza and the DCC fail.  (Salas told the PolCoun and 
Ambassador on March 2 that if the Coordinadora accepts a bad 
mechanism for going to reparos it will destroy the 
Coordinadora.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) The pragmatists in the DCC are trying to reach a 
workable solution to keep the referendum process alive.  We 
expect the CNE will meet some of the opposition\'s demands, 
but will try to make the process so onerous that they are 
unable to \"repair\" enough signatures to activate the recall. 
The rifts within the DCC will diminish if a feasible solution 
 
is reached.  Salas\' distancing himself from the DCC is 
opportunistic but not surprising.  He perceives the DCC as a 
vehicle for Mendoza and therefore an obstacle to his 
ambitions.  Our message to Salas, to Mendoza, to Borges, and 
to other opposition leaders has been and continues to be that 
they must negotiate the best deal possible and then make it 
work.

SUBJECT: HOW REAL IS CHAVEZ\'S OIL THREAT? 
 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES SHAPIRO; REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) On February 29, President Chavez threatened to cut off 
Venezuelan oil supplies to the U.S. or to nationalize U.S. 
company assets if the U.S. were to seek to \"blockade\" or 
impose sanctions against Venezuela.  The U.S. majors in 
Venezuela dismiss his words as bluster but do not totally 
discount some action on his part.  Chavez has sought, largely 
unsuccessfully, to diversify Venezuela\'s oil sales away from 
the U.S. in the past.  Weighing against a sudden cut-off is 
the fact that it would be enormously costly and time 
consuming for Venezuela to seek out new markets to replace 
its sales to the U.S. where specialty refineries are tooled 
to handle Venezuelan heavy crudes.  However, Chavez\'s brutal 
restructuring of PDVSA after the general strike of December 
2002-February 2003, and his draconian exchange control system 
show that on economic matters a purely political logic often 
prevails for him.  On a much smaller scale, he has used oil 
as a political tool with his action against the Dominican 
Republic in 2003.  While we believe such a high risk action 
is not imminent, Chavez\'s character, revolutionary ideology, 
and ignorance of how international markets function mean it 
cannot be ruled out completely.  Chavez may believe that his 
threat, against the backdrop of U.S. domestic politics, may 
cause the USG to back off.  And, of course, it serves to fire 
up his supporters and to burnish his revolutionary 
credentials.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
STINGING WORDS 
-------------- 
 
2. (C) On February 29, President Chavez threatened that \"not 
a drop of oil would arrive from Venezuela\" if the U.S. were 
to seize CITGO or otherwise \"blockade Venezuela.\"  He went on 
to add that the U.S. should remember that it has \"plenty of 
installations here\" (that could be seized in retaliation). 
Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. Bernardo Alvarez minimized 
the remarks in a press conference the next day saying that 
\"that message was intended for the Venezuelan people and not 
the North American Government.\"  Inquiring about our reaction 
to President Chavez\'s remarks, Juan Fernandez, President of 
\"Gente de Petroleo\" (Petroleum People), an opposition civil 
society group consisting of former PDVSA staff, commented to 
PolCouns March 4 that Chavez\'s comments should not be 
dismissed off-hand.  As a PDVSA executive, he recalled, he 
had had discussions with PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez about 
contracts being canceled capriciously.  Rodriguez told him, 
Fernandez said, that he had to understand that the decisions 
were matters of state, not business. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
U.S. COMPANY REACTIONS TO NATIONALIZATION THREAT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (C) We canvassed the U.S. majors (ChevronTexaco, 
ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil) operating in Venezuela for 
their reactions to Chavez\'s threat of nationalization.  They 
were united in dismissing his words as bluster.  However, 
ChevronTexaco de Venezuela President Ali Moshiri commented to 
econoff on March 2 that he believes the GOV is watching the 
U.S. companies closely.  He added that he has a \"gut feeling\" 
there could be some action taken if a company were to \"step 
outside the boundaries.\"  Mark Ward of ExxonMobil, which 
besides operating in Venezuela, has a long-term purchase 
contract for Venezuelan crude, remarked that PDVSA would be 
hit by a blizzard of law suits.  All three local company 
presidents pledged to let the Embassy know immediately of any 
operational changes. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
A STABLE SUPPLIER LOOKS TO DIVERSIFY MARKETS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In the past, senior Chavez administration officials 
have repeatedly reminded U.S. policymakers that Venezuela has 
never suspended oil shipments to the U.S and assured them 
 
that Venezuela would continue to be a stable supplier of oil. 
 Nonetheless, announcements of PDVSA\'s attempts to develop 
other markets have been a hallmark of the Chavez years. 
While it is normal for any business to seek to expand its 
markets, we have long felt that Chavez\'s ideology was such 
that he would prefer other customers rather than the U.S.  In 
reality, however, the process of building new markets in the 
oil business can be a slow, costly one.  In 2001, PDVSA was 
ordered by the Ministry of Energy and Mines to cultivate a 
market in India and signed a contract with Indian firm 
Reliance Petroleum.  We understand that contract proved 
unprofitable and was allowed to lapse in 2002. 
 
---------------------------- 
A CUT-OFF WOULD BE COSTLY... 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Moving out of the U.S. market would be very painful 
for Venezuela.  Venezuela exports 1.4-1.6 million b/d to the 
U.S.  The majority of these exports are heavy, sour (i.e., 
high sulfur) crudes bound for so-called deep conversion 
refineries that have been tooled to handle them.  PDVSA\'s 
U.S. affiliate CITGO operates several of these refineries and 
others are operated by ventures that have long-term purchase 
agreements with PDVSA.  Admittedly, there would be an impact, 
possibly serious, on the U.S. in terms of refinery economics, 
etc., if Chavez were to stop these exports.  But the U.S. 
would have the whole world to turn to for alternative 
supplies, either crude or refined, and, as a Washington-based 
oil analyst told the Ambassador, the option of drawing upon 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be available to calm 
markets.  We very much doubt whether Chavez is weighing these 
factors at all in making his threats.  Nor does he appear to 
be considering the fact that in the event of such a cut-off 
PDVSA and thus Venezuela could be grievously harmed.  India 
and Brazil have been mentioned to econoff as possible markets 
for these Venezuelan crudes.  The local stringer for industry 
publication \"Petroleum Argus,\" however, has informed us that 
Brazil has little of the hydrotreating and coking capacity 
needed to handle the crudes while India\'s Reliance Petroleum 
could only handle 150-200,000 b/d of heavy crude based on its 
current desulfurization capacity. 
 
6. (C) He adds that most European and Asian refiners could 
not run these Venezuelan crudes straight through their 
facilities, but would instead have to blend them with a 
light, sweet crude to meet refinery specifications.  While 
this is possible, Venezuela would have to offer a significant 
price cut (\"next to nothing a barrel,\" according to our 
expert) in order to induce refineries to accept the crudes. 
Venezuela would also have to undercut other sellers into 
these markets such as Russian oil sales to Europe.  In sum, 
given the realities of refinery operations, it would be more 
likely that Venezuela would have to make small scale deals 
with small countries to start with and suffer through a long 
process of market development. 
 
7. (C) A bigger risk to the U.S. might lie in a decision by 
Venezuela to divert to other markets the approximately 
400,000 b/d of light crude controlled by PDVSA.  But here 
again Venezuela would take a price hit and the shipping 
market would also be another barrier.  Venezuela would be 
forced to hire tankers that normally operate in other areas, 
for instance the West Africa to Asia routes.  Many of these 
long range tankers could not enter Venezuelan ports -- only 
Jose can accommodate a tanker holding more 500,000 barrels. 
These transport costs would place further pressure on the 
price of Venezuelan crudes. 
 
8. (C) In the area of products, we understand there are now a 
few long distance product runs between Venezuela and Europe, 
primarily in jet fuel.  Venezuela might be able to expand 
this market.  Venezuela could export more fuel oil and gas 
oil to Asia which could affect power and heating oil prices 
in the U.S.  But here again, Venezuela would probably have to 
offer deep discounts to attract non-traditional buyers and 
the shipping costs might be prohibitive.  The U.S. gasoline 
market has already been affected by problems in Venezuela\'s 
refineries resulting from the 2002-2003 oil strike.  It 
appears that the market is already likely to be more severely 
affected in 2004.  Several sources reported to econoff on 
 
March 4 that Venezuela itself is now importing over 100,000 
b/d of unleaded gasoline to the Amuay refinery to compensate 
for problems at the neighboring Cardon refinery. 
 
9. (C) Finally, the experience of the 2002-2003 strike 
demonstrated that Venezuela has limited storage capacity. 
The strike demonstrated that if the export stream of a 
million or more barrels a day is stopped, production will 
have to be shut in in as little as 48 hours in some fields. 
We see no evidence that PDVSA had taken any steps to increase 
storage.  Also, the capabilities of PDVSA\'s current marketing 
personnel would probably not be up to the task of placing 
over a million barrels of oil a day onto the spot market. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
...BUT PRAGMATISM NOT NECESSARILY THE REVOLUTIONARY WAY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
10. (C) While PDVSA management know the damage that a cut-off 
of oil to the U.S. could do to the company, the new PDVSA is 
staffed by fervent supporters of the \"revolution\" or by 
opportunists who would be unwilling to lose their access to 
the spoils of corruption.  The recent decision to stop the 
development of the market for orimulsion, the oil-water blend 
designed to replace coal in electricity plants, could be 
illustrative.  Canada\'s New Brunswick Power has recently sued 
Bitor, PDVSA\'s orimulsion affiliate, alleging breach of an 
agreement to supply orimulsion.  New Brunswick went ahead to 
install additional generation capacity based on signature of 
a Letter of Intent with PDVSA only to have PDVSA announce its 
decision to supply existing contracts only.  Chavez himself 
is reported to have blocked signature of the agreement with 
the Canadians.  It appears the decision was made to forego 
the development of a relatively small but growing market for 
a product developed from Venezuela\'s ample supplies of extra 
heavy crude to produce a higher yield blend.  Thus, market 
development was sacrificed to short-term financial gains, at 
a time when the GOV needs lots of ready cash for spending to 
maintain its political standing with its low-income voter 
base. 
 
---------------- 
OIL AND POLITICS 
---------------- 
 
11. (C) Chavez also showed his willingness to use oil as a 
political weapon in September 2003 when he suspended oil 
shipments to the Dominican Republic in protest against 
supposed coup-mongering by former Venezuelan President Carlos 
Andres Perez.  Although Chavez has since publicly announced 
that shipments under the San Jose Accord would be resumed, a 
shipping industry contact tells us that what Venezuelan oil 
is going to the DR is moving through traders and not 
directly.  Chavez\'s restructuring of PDVSA, laying off 20,000 
employees following their participation in the general strike 
aimed at his ouster, is another indication of his willingness 
to put political considerations above economic ones in 
dealing with oil-related issues. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C) Chavez\'s priority is regime survival.  Stopping oil 
sales to the U.S., and taking what could be an enormous 
revenue loss does not on its face appear to be a recipe for 
ensuring the economic stability he presumably needs. 
However, Chavez may believe that, in a crisis, the short-term 
pain inflicted on the U.S. would be enough to cause the USG 
to back off from some action against him or that by raising 
it now he makes such action less likely.  Chavez\'s 
combination of an oil embargo threat with insulting remarks 
about President Bush also send a message to supporters that, 
not to worry, he can deal with USG pressure on the 
referendum.  With at best limited understanding of how 
international oil markets function, Chavez may also be 
over-estimating Venezuela\'s power in such a confrontation. 
He probably does understand that a sudden cut-off of sales to 
the U.S. would be a momentous decision.  Such a decision is 
by no means imminent; for now it is useful to fire up his 
supporters and to divert attention from the referendum 
 
process.  But for the first time, he has laid on the table 
the use of Venezuela\'s \"oil weapon,\" such as it is, which 
must be considered a new and somewhat ominous development. 
Ironically, such a threat completely cuts against Venezuela\'s 
effort to attract new international hydrocarbons investment, 
such as the Deltana Platform natural gas project for which 
ChevronTexaco has been awarded a concession or a giant 
petrochemical plant which Exxonmobil is considering, but 
clearly Chavez\'s main concerns lie elsewhere.

1. (C) OPPOSITION LEADERS BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH NATIONAL 
ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) JORGE RODRIGUEZ ON MARCH 3 TO WORK 
OUT A FORMULA FOR THE REFERENDUM SIGNATURES APPEALS PROCESS. 
IN ADDITION TO NEGOTIATING WITH THE CNE, THE OPPOSITION

THEIR FAMILIES), TOLD POLCOUNS MARCH 4 HE BELIEVES IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO PURSUE THE REFERENDUM PROCESS TO THE END.  HE 
NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE DCC MUST COME UP WITH A FORMULA THAT 
    TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE STRONG FEELING THAT MANY VENEZUELANS 
HAVE ABOUT BEING DEFRAUDED BY THE CNE DECISION.  HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS NO EASY SOLUTION TO THAT DILEMMA. 
AS OF MARCH 4, FERNANDEZ WAS UNCERTAIN THAT HE COULD FULLY 
SUPPORT THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE APPEALS PROCESS, BUT HE WOULD 
NOT BLOCK THEM. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
13. (C) WE HAVE STRESSED TO OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES THE 
IMPORTANCE OF PURSUING THE REFERENDUM PROCESS TO THE END, 
INCLUDING COMING TO THE TABLE WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO 
NEGOTIATE ON THE SIGNATURE APPEALS PROCESS (REPAROS).  WE 
HAVE NOTED THAT WE ARE NOT MERELY ADVISING THAT THE 
OPPOSITION STICK WITH THE PROCESS AND NEGOTIATE ON THE 
APPEALS PROCESS BECAUSE IT IS JUST ONE MORE BOX TO CHECK OFF. 
 ANOTHER POINT WE HAVE MADE IS THAT THE GOV HAS THE UPPER 
HAND BECAUSE THE CNE HAS CREATED THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING 
MADE A PROPER DECISION, WITHIN ITS AUTHORITY, AND THE 
OPPOSITION IS NOT WITHOUT LEGAL RECOURSE.  WE HAVE ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHILE THE OPPOSITION FACES THE DILEMMA OF 
\"NEGOTIATING AWAY\" THE SIGNATURES, OR OF VIOLATING PRINCIPLES 
BY \"VALIDATING\" THE WRONGS COMMITTED BY THE CNE TO DATE, 
BEING MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABORTING THE REFERENDUM PROCESS 
WOULD HURT THE OPPOSITION AND HAND CHAVEZ A JUICIER VICTORY. 
 
 
14.  (C) THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE APPEALS PROCESS BY THE 
    OPPOSITION AT-LARGE WILL DEPEND ON THE TERMS OF THE DEAL 
BROKERED WITH THE CNE.  WE BELIEVE THAT IF A REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT IS REACHED, MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE OPPOSITION 
GROUPS WILL GO ALONG.  SALAS MAY EVEN PARTICIPATE IF HE IS 
ABLE TO DO SO WHILE RETAINING HIS PURIST IMAGE.  MAINTAINING

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Hugo Chavez repudiated international 
criticisms against the GOV for human rights violations and 
undemocratic practices, speaking to the diplomatic corps 
March 5.  DCM attending on behalf of the Ambassador, walked 
out after Chavez reasserted allegations, made most recently 
February 29 that the USG was responsible for the events of 
April 11, 2002, and continues to finance subversive groups in 
Venezuela.  Chavez worked through the figures from the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) that he alleged demonstrated 
his theory of \"megafraud\" carried out by the opposition.  The 
two-and-a-half hour speech, carried on all broadcast media 
(cadena), is Chavez\'s attempt to discredit the opposition on 
the on the eve of its major march on March 6, and to counter 
the poor image the GOV has created overseas.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Chavez Lashes Out At USG 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez convened the diplomatic corps 
March 5 for a two-and-a-half hour speech to \"clear up 
confusion\" that other countries might have had regarding the 
political situation in Venezuela.  The address was nationally 
broadcast obligatorily on all Venezuelan television and radio 
stations.  Chavez began with renewed accusations that the USG 
planned the April 2002 alleged coup attempt.  He reiterated 
allegations that the U.S. had warships at the ready and 
attack helicopters at the airport to carry out the coup, 
similar, he said, to what happened to Haitian President 
Aristide.  Chavez said the USG is financing \"terrorist\" 
groups in Venezuela seeking to destabilize the GOV.  He 
played scenes from the pro-Chavez documentary \"The Revolution 
Will Not Be Televised\" to make his point.  How long, he 
queried the ambassadors, must we endure this type of 
intervention. 
 
3. (C) After Chavez\'s wild accusations on February 29 in 
which he said the U.S. is preparing an invasion or blockade 
of Venezuela and threatened to cut off oil, the Ambassador 
chose not to attend and instead sent the DCM with 
instructions to leave if appropriate.  After Chavez attacked 
the U.S., Chavez asserted that the U.S. was currently 
supporting and financing coup plotters.  The DCM stood up, 
looked Chavez in the eye, and walked out without comment. 
 
------------------------------- 
Opposition Are The Violent Ones 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Chavez showed photos from the February 27 march and 
subsequent demonstrations showing demonstrators throwing 
rocks and holding slingshots.  He said they also had machine 
guns and heavy weapons, though did not show images of them. 
He accused the opposition of attempting to sabotage the Group 
of 15 Summit on February 27.  After February 27, the 
President charged, the opposition engaged in \"foquismo,\" 
trying to incite an uprising through localized 
demonstrations. 
 
5. (U) Chavez also accused the press of an international 
campaign to discredit Venezuela\'s human rights\' record.  He 
said those in the opposition are coup-plotters dressing up 
like supporters of democracy and human rights.  Chavez 
defended GOV security forces for \"fulfilling the role of the 
state in maintaining public order.\"  He blamed the four 
leading Venezuelan television stations and CNN as accomplices 
in a plot to promote \"urban subversion and terrorism.\"  He 
described what he believed international reaction would be 
when (not if) he closed one or more news media, and then 
lamented he would have to take this step. 
 
------------------- 
 
 
Fraud is Everywhere 
------------------- 
 
6. (U) Chavez poured over the National Electoral Council\'s 
(CNE) preliminary results of the opposition\'s signature drive 
in support of a recall referendum against him.  He showed 
television spots from the CNE and the NGO Sumate that, he 
said, made clear that all signers must have filled out their 
personal data on the signature forms (Note:  The CNE placed 
876,017 \"in observation\" for these supposed irregularity.) 
Chavez showed several examples of irregularities in the forms 
such as signatures by minors, foreigners, deceased, and 
errors in filling out the forms.  The President challenged 
the opposition to go to the requisite appeals process, saying 
that he would agree to three days and 2,700 centers for the 
process.  He said he welcomed all international observers to 
watch the appeals, subject to rules laid down by the CNE. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez continued the anti-U.S. message that he took to 
new levels February 29.  His statement about closing 
opposition media coincides with the editorial line of GOV 
daily \"Vea,\" and should be taken as a serious threat.  The 
audio-visual components of the session made this more like 
his weekly television address \"Alo, Presidente\" rather than 
an address to the diplomatic corps.  Chavez gave his side of 
the story fully, but in doing so it is unlikely he won over 
many members of the diplomatic community.  More likely, by 
maintaining and broadcasting his tough attitude, he is 
signaling that he will not cede on the signatures appeals 
process.  He is also telling all Venezuelans that he will not 
back off from the measures he has been taking against their 
protests.  That said, we believe Chavez remarks reflect 
concern that Venezuela\'s international reputation has 
declined in the last week.  Chavez may also be worried the 
opposition will gain momentum from the outpouring of 
condemnation for violating human rights and democratic 
practices by international human rights groups and foreign 
press.

SUMMARY

1. (U) Growing violence since February 27 has produced a 
sharp rise in the number and types of human rights violations 
throughout Venezuela.  Several local human rights 
organizations,  Amnesty International, and the Inter-American 
Human Rights Commission issued statements condemning the 
violence and calling on the GOV to fulfill its duty to 
guarantee security and protect the rights of all citizens.

demonstrators participate in opposition marches but 
acknowledges that it does not control the actions of those 
involved in spontaneous acts of civil disobedience. End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
JUMP IN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ALLEGATIONS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Growing violence since February 27 has produced a 
sharp rise in the number and types of human rights violations 
throughout Venezuela.  Democratic Coordinator (CD) 
spokesperson Rafael Narvaez said in a March 3 press briefing 
that nearly 400 opposition demonstrators, some as young as 
14, have been jailed without due process, 36 of them in 
Caracas.  The detainees, Narvaez said, have been beaten and 
tortured with electric shocks,  burning, and 
near-suffocation.  Lisette Behrens, a CD legal advisor, told 
poloff March 2 she is helping represent six youths detained 
and, she said, subsequently tortured by the National Guard 
(GN) February 29.  According to Behrens, the youths were 
observing protests in the Altamira neighborhood of Caracas 
when they were arrested.  Many detainees have been released 
and have given accounts of their detentions to the media, 
often accompanied by pictures of their alleged signs of 
torture.  Three judges who had been ordering the release of 
detainees for lack of credible charges against them were 
fired on March 2, according to media and opposition sources. 
 
3. (U) The director of the Venezuela Symphonic Orchestra, 
Carlos Eduardo Izcaray, was also taken and tortured by the GN 
March 1 while observing the events in Altamira, according to 
an email circulated by his father.  Many other demonstrators 
and onlookers have been seriously injured by tear gas, and 
rubber and metal bullets, according to the CD and human 
rights groups.  Fourteen journalists have been injured or 
attacked by security forces or GOV supporters while covering 
political disturbances since February 27, according to 
several media groups.   COFAVIC, a human rights NGO, 
confirmed March 4 that nine people have died from injuries 
inflicted by security forces.  Media and opposition reports 
list a small but growing number of people (seven) as 
\"disappeared.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD? 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (U) On March 1, several local human rights organizations 
and Amnesty International (AI) issued strongly worded 
statements condemning the use of violence by any party and 
reminding the government of its responsibility to ensure 
security and protect the rights of all citizens, particularly 
the due process rights of detainees.  The Inter-American 
Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) followed with a statement on 
March 3 expressing concern for the \"serious violence\" that 
has occurred during demonstrations due to the use of 
\"excessive force\" by security forces.  The IAHRC called on 
the GOV to preserve the rights of demonstrators, detainees, 
and the media, and to maintain public order strictly within 
the framework of human rights agreements.  On March 4, AI 
activated its worldwide urgent action alert network, asking 
network members to remind Venezuelan authorities not to use 
excessive force and to respect the right to peaceful 
demonstration.  The statement reiterated AI\'s condemnation of 
violence and called on all parties to refrain from violent 
actions. 
 
5. (C) The CD\'s Lisette Behrens told poloff March 2 that 
opposition marchers are always unarmed so as not to 
invalidate constitutional protections for peaceful 
demonstrators or give the GOV a chance to blame the 
opposition if violence breaks out.  (Comment: We believe some 
marchers have carried weapons, and possibly used them.)  But 
she admits that the street barricades and other random acts 
of civil disobedience that have erupted in Caracas and other 
cities are not under the CD\'s control.  Her clear implication 
was that such protests are spontaneous expressions of deep 
anger and frustration which can lead to violence, regardless 
of the opposition\'s policy of peaceful protest. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Our assessment is that the GOV was unprepared for the 
length, breadth, and intensity of the demonstrations.  In the 
GOV mindset, there should not be large anti-GOV 
demonstrations, since supposedly only a small group opposes 
the GOV.  In particular, the GOV has been clumsy in 
responding to real or perceived opposition violence, and 
clearly has, in many cases, not controlled its forces 
sufficiently.  We also believe that some in the opposition 
are seeking to provoke GOV violence in the hopes that the 
military or the international community will step in.  While 
we cannot certify all the allegations of abuse, the patterns 
and trends are worrisome in terms of human rights and 
political dialogue.

Summary

1. (C) Diego Acevedo, aide to CNE Director Sobella Mejias, 
claimed even if the presidential referendum signature appeals 
process overcomes significant technical hurdles, it will 
nonetheless be vulnerable to pro-Chavez sabotage from the 
overseeing officials.  He claimed all of the CNE\'s regional 
offices have been purged of opposition-sympathetic directors. 
 Acevedo and other National Electoral Council (CNE) employees 
told poloff a combination of leadership purges and staff 
coercion are detrimentally changing the CNE\'s composition and 
conduct.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Reparo Just Another Chavista Trap 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Venezuela\'s National Electoral Council (CNE) decided 
March 2 to send \"suspect\" signatures collected to convoke a 
recall referendum on President Hugo Chavez to a verification 
process (reparo).  Under CNE regulations, signers have five 
days to re-affirm or challenge their signatures. The CNE 
approved 1.8 million signatures, 600,000 signatures shy of 
the 2.4 million threshold needed to trigger the recall (ref 
a).  The opposition turned in 3.4 million signatures in 
December.  Thamara Escalona, CNE\'s Chief of Transcription, 
told poloff February 25 that 2.1 million signatures had 
passed quality control, matching what opposition sources have 
claimed, but not the 1.8 million figure announced by CNE 
President Francisco Carrasquero March 2. 
 
3. (C) Diego Acevedo, aide to CNE Director Sobella Mejias, 
told poloff March 3 that CNE efforts to reach an appeals 
process would be futile considering the massive amount of 
signatures and the short time to prepare for the event. 
Escalona, too, said it would be technically difficult to 
conduct the appeals process.  She warned not to make time 
comparisons with the signature drive, because \"this is a more 
complicated process.\"  Even if there is agreement on the 
appeals process, and it is technically feasible, Acevedo 
argued CNE officials would sabotage the process.  He claimed 
all 24 CNE regional heads were Chavistas and that the 
majority of the 2,700 CNE employees would be temporary 
workers, not regular employees.  He said a new pro-Chavez CNE 
union would likely pick the temps. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Acevedo: Purges Continuing, Nothing New 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Acevedo argued that pro-Chavez CNE directors are not 
concerned with the negative publicity generated by a staff 
purge, as evidenced by the March 2 firing of Ana Mercedes 
Gia, the head of the Political Participation Commission.  He 
claimed Director Jorge Rodriguez dismissed her for the vague 
reason that the \"opposition had corrupted her.\"  He asserted 
that Rodriguez and the two other Chavez-leaning directors 
fire and hire employees at will, knowing that they can 
override objections from the two opposition-leaning 
directors. Although he conceded Chavistas were sending 
employees on vacations to increase pro-GOV influence, Acevedo 
argued it is normal and legal to make employees use leave. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Semi-Permanent Vacations: Staff Purges Delay Process 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (C) Escalona reported 35 employees had been sent on 
ordered vacation and replaced by Chavistas, including all 
opposition-aligned regional heads.  CNE Electoral Information 
Section employees Rommel Hernandez and Melania Diaz told 
poloff February 12 that CNE directors are packing the CNE 
with Chavez sympathizers who will delay the recall process 
either intentionally or because they are technically 
incompetent.  \"They want people they can depend on to do 
nothing,\" said Hernandez.  \"All their talk about the 
 
constitution and laws is just talk... Chavez is their 
religion and that\'s all they care about.\"  Hernandez, a labor 
representative for the CNE\'s main 1,900-member union, said a 
rival pro-Chavez union proposes new hires for the directors 
to rubber stamp.  About 180 employees of the CNE\'s 2,200 
regular workforce are members in the rapidly growing upstart 
union. 
 
------------------------------------- 
It\'s Not Easy Being a CNE Employee... 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) All four CNE employees told poloff that morale is at 
an all-time low for opposition-sympathetic employees who feel 
like tools of the GOV, forced to implement rules and 
procedures with which they do not agree.  Hernandez and Diaz 
claimed about 70 percent of the regular employees were still 
opposition aligned.  Acevedo, however, said a GOV policy of 
blackmail and political pressure, combined with replacements 
and new hires, had increased the proportion of GOV influence 
to about 55 percent.  Acevedo explained Chavista bosses often 
ask employees if \"they are with the process\" and try to 
pressure employees with vague threats about job security. 
Some employees are simply finding it easier to be Chavistas, 
he asserted. 
 
----------------------------- 
GOV Tightening Control of CNE 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The 90 CNE Employees assigned to the Superior 
Technical Committee work in 45 pairs according to Acevedo, 
ostensibly one opposition and one Chavista.  However, the 
selection process often assigns employees without regard to 
their actual political inclinations.  Acevedo and Escalona 
agreed that the process mainly favors the GOV by miscasting 
Chavistas as opposition representatives.  Escalona claimed 
only 24 of the 250 employees involved in the quality control 
process are regular CNE employees.  She estimated most of the 
rest are the same Chavista temporary workers employed for the 
physical verification process, and accused them of 
fraudulently revalidating rejected signatures for referendums 
of opposition deputies. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) In December Acevedo spoke glowingly about the ability 
of the CNE to come to a recall decision before February and 
all employees claim to have held the institution in high 
regard before the recall signature drives.  But the 
increasing lack of confidence these CNE employees have in the 
ability and will of the institution to conduct the signature 
appeals raises serious doubts that the recall process, 
already caught up in negotiations, will ever be resolved.  It 
also castes doubts on the ability of the CNE to manage the 
August regional elections in a fair, transparent, and 
efficient manner.  One of the only things keeping a lid on 
massive defections appears to be the fear of losing a decent 
job in an economy with greater than 15 percent unemployment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV and the opposition continue to negotiate the 
appeals process (\"reparos\") that will determine the fate of 
the signatures presidential referendum against President Hugo 
Chavez.  The National Electoral Council (CNE) March 7 
delivered its computerized version of the results of the 
verification of the signatures to the opposition, which 
classified it as a \"disaster.\"  An OAS observer confirmed 
this assessment, noting that the CNE\'s handling of the 
signatures has been incompetent at best.  The opposition must 
strike a balance between bringing pressure against the CNE 
for its shoddy work and keeping the institution functional to 
reach the appeals process.  As is, the dates for the appeals 
process may slip to mid-April.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
GOV And DCC Negotiations 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) delivered a 
computerized version of the results of the verification of 
the presidential recall referendum signatures to the 
opposition on March 7.  The turnover of the data is part of 
the negotiations to design an appeals process (\"reparos\") for 
the signatures.  Representatives of the Democratic 
Coordinating Committee (DCC) told poloff March 8 that the 
database was a \"disaster\" of disorganized information.  OAS 
observer Marcelo Alvarez told polcouns on March 9 that the 
CNE\'s arbitrary application of the verification norms to the 
opposition signatures indicates either an intentional effort 
to scuttle the referendum or, at best, complete ineptitude at 
the CNE.  The CNE, Alvarez noted, still has \"a mountain of 
work\" to finalize the tally, but he did not expect the CNE\'s 
count to change by much from what had already been announced. 
 Alvarez said he feared the opposition might make so much 
political hay of the CNE\'s dubious work that the CNE board 
would go into crisis before an appeals process can be held. 
 
3. (C) The opposition plans to take a few days to analyze the 
CNE data.  Alvarez said that if the opposition can resist the 
temptation to blast the CNE over the multitude of errors they 
are likely to uncover, they may be able to use the 
information to get the CNE to agree to a longer appeals 
process with more signatures up for grabs.  The two sides, 
Alvarez said, are bound by an agreement that gives them 15 
days to prepare for the appeals process once they come to 
agreement on the parameters.  Alvarez expressed concern that 
the appeals process would be further delayed by Holy Week 
(April 4-11), thus pushing the process off to mid-April. 
 
4. (C) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez said publicly March 8 
that, with the database delivered, the opposition must decide 
to go to the appeals process before the end of the week or 
the CNE would proceed with its original plan for the appeals 
process.  (Note:  Opposition negotiators rejected the CNE\'s 
initial proposal as not feasible.  The NGO Sumate and 
international observers also agree that this proposal would 
not be viable.)  The opposition is analyzing the data to 
determine how the appeals process should work for it to 
bridge the difference between the approximately 1.8 million 
signatures validated by the CNE and 2.4 million minimum 
required. 
 
5. (C) Alvarez commented that the Carter Center is taking the 
lead in facilitating the negotiations at the CNE.  The OAS 
prefers to maintain its role as observers, he said, but still 
consults closely with the Carter Center for the negotiations. 
 Alvarez said CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez is the only member 
of the CNE board participating in the negotiations.  He said 
 
Rodriguez is combative, applying the rules when it suits him, 
ignoring them when they do not.  Miranda State Governor 
Enrique Mendoza and Movement to Socialism (MAS) President 
Felipe Mujica continue to negotiate for the opposition.  The 
DCC representatives have told us the GOV is represented by 
Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) National Assembly Deputy 
Willian Lara and Podemos Deputy Ismael Garcia.

6. (C) DCC representatives expect the next two weeks to 
determine the fate of the referendum.  Unity among the 
opposition has improved since the March 2 CNE announcement of 
the preliminary results, they said, with most groups 
realizing that negotiations with the CNE is the only 
practical alternative.  The massive march on March 6 
demonstrated, they said, the desire of the opposition to 
continue the peaceful and democratic route of the appeals 
process.  Some sectors of the opposition, however, most 
notably Henrique Salas Romer, have accused the opposition of 
\"negotiating away\" the signatures.  The DCC has denied this 
publicly, but is in fact negotiating the numbers of valid 
signatures and how many will go to the appeals process 
(currently 1.1 million) and how long the process will be 
(currently two days).  The DCC representatives said the 
opposition would focus its media campaign on the CNE\'s need 
to respect the will of the signers and to reach an 
accommodation on the appeals process.

7. (C) The CNE\'s best defense may be that the opposition 
cannot afford to discredit it so much as to damage the CNE\'s 
ability to mount the appeals process.  The opposition is 
feeling somewhat heady with the swing of public opinion 
(national and international) going its way.  But we believe 
scenarios that envision Chavez backing down and granting all 
concessions for the appeals process to work to be too 
optimistic.  We also note while the sides quibble over the 
design of the appeals process, time is frittering away:  a 
referendum should be called by mid-May if it is to be held 
before August 19, when a recalled Chavez can still be 
replaced via an election.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Chavez pointedly lowered his anti-U.S. 
rhetoric in a March 9 ceremony hurriedly organized by the GOV 
to recognize the award to ChevronTexaco (CTX) of an 
exploration license for an off-shore natural gas block. 
While agreeing that Chavez had sought to send a message to 
the USG, senior CTX executives felt it likely that the larger 
message was aimed at calming the markets, and particularly 
would-be investors.  We believe Chavez is seeking to adopt a 
strategy from his mentor Fidel Castro and will attempt to use 
the petroleum industry to try to influence U.S. policy 
towards Venezuela.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
CHEVRONTEXACO EVENT PROVIDES A VEHICLE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) As reported reftel, on February 19 the GOV announced 
the award of Block 3 of the off-shore Deltana Platform 
natural gas project to ChevronTexaco (CTX), the sole bidder 
on the block.  CTX Latin America President Ali Moshiri 
contacted the Ambassador late on March 5 with the news that 
the GOV had contacted him to say the license would be granted 
in a ceremony at Miraflores Palace on March 8.  Econoff 
ultimately attended the ceremony representing the Ambassador. 
 
------------ 
ATMOSPHERICS 
------------ 
 
3. (C) While it is normal for the Minister of Energy and 
Mines and PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez to attend such 
events, a panoply of other senior GOV officals attended. 
Virtually the entire economic cabinet was there (Ministers of 
Finance, Production and Commerce, and Planning and 
Development) as well as Foreign Minister Jesus Perez and Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel.  Ali Rodriguez was accompanied 
by numerous senior PDVSA officials (including CITGO President 
Luis Marin who reportedly had met with President Chavez upon 
his arrival in Venezuela the day before).  (Note:  So many, 
in fact, that econoff believed Chavez would make a 
long-expected announcement about changes in PDVSA\'s Board in 
his speech.) 
 
---------- 
THE SPEECH 
---------- 
 
4. (C) Chavez spoke for about an hour in a speech broadcast 
by GOV mandate nationally on all radio and television 
channels.  In an early reference to CTX, he said pointedly 
\"we recognize ..the presence of these brothers from the U.S. 
who come not to attack us nor to show a lack of respect, but 
come to unite with us...\"  Leading with,\"our relationship 
with the U.S. is historic and profound,\" Chavez then launched 
into a lengthy discourse on the role of Venezuelan 
independence leader Francisco de Miranda in the U.S. War of 
Independence.  He also spoke of Presidents Roosevelt and 
Kennedy, the Marshall Plan and Alliance for Progress, and 
noted that Roosevelt, had be lived now, would have been 
accused of being a \"chavista.\"  Chavez also comparied 
President Kennedy and Senator John Kerry.  He underlined that 
Venezuela has been a stable supplier of oil to the U.S. 
during the five years of his presidency, except for two 
occasions in April and December 2002 when supply disruptions 
had been caused by his opposition.  Chavez pointed to the 
overall importance of the U.S. as a commercial partner to 
Venezuela and finally ended with a reference to Walt 
Whitman\'s \"Leaves of Grass.\" 
 
5. (C) In his one off-message moment, Chavez slipped in a 
reference to the capital of Trinidad and Tobago as Port of 
Prince.  After an aide handed him a note, he apologized to 
the Trinidadian Ambassador who was present in the audience 
 
 
and corrected himself, saying he had been thinking about Port 
of Prince a great deal recently and that \"part of his soul\" 
was there. 
 
---------- 
CTX\'S TAKE 
---------- 
 
6. (C) In a subsequent meeting with the Ambassador, Ali 
Moshiri, accompanied by Alan Kleiman, Vice President for 
Exploration and Production of ChevronTexaco International, 
agreed that the ceremony had been arranged with suspicious 
speed.  He added that the award of an exploration block 
hardly merits such treatment -- and particularly a block for 
which CTX had only made a $5 million bonus bid.  The CTX 
executives laughed over the impression Chavez had created in 
his speech that CTX had won the block in competition against 
15 other bidders rather than being the sole bidder.  They 
agreed the GOV had staged the event to provide a 
counterbalance to Chavez\'s harsh comments about cutting off 
oil sales to the U.S. the week before.  But, while agreeing 
that Chavez sought to send a message to the USG, Moshiri felt 
it likely that the larger message was aimed at calming the 
markets, and particularly would-be investors.  Moshiri added 
that, if there had been another non-U.S. bidder, the GOV 
would have found some way to award the block to that bidder 
and reiterated his belief (reported reftel) that Minister of 
Energy and Mines Ramirez_ and PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez 
had worked hard to convince Chavez to award the block to a 
U.S. company. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) It is clear that Chavez had deliberatedly sought a 
venue in which he could pitch a different message to U.S. 
majors after his threats to cut off oil supplies the week 
before which were coupled with vulgar abuse of President 
Bush.  We believe Chavez is seeking to adopt a strategy from 
his mentor Fidel Castro.  Just as Fidel has tried to use 
potential food sales to Cuba to turn U.S. agribusinesses into 
lobbyists for him, we believe Chavez may attempt to use 
energy companies to shield him from U.S. political criticism. 
 Ultimately, Chavez believes that oil is all that matters to 
the U.S. in Venezuela and that, so long as the oil flows 
uninterrupted, we should leave him alone. 
 
8. (C) We expect Chavez quickly to resume his U.S. bashing.

SUMMARY:

1. (C) Recently fired chief prosecutor Ramon Medina told 
poloff March 9 that the Attorney General\'s Office is 
increasingly focused on solidifying Chavez\'s hold on domestic 
institutions.  Medina, a long-time contact of the Embassy\'s 
LegAtt and PAS offices, said he was dismissed because he 
resisted GoV pressures to dismiss cases or bring charges 
against Chavez\'s political enemies.  One of the three trial 
judges dismissed by the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) for 
ordering some detained anti-GoV protestors released told 
poloff March 10 that the court system was becoming more 
corrupt and open to manipulation by political pressure or 
threat.  The recent dismissals of prosecutors and judges 
signal greater GoV manipulation of the justice system and 
further centralization of power in the executive.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Top Prosecutor Fired For Resisting GOV Manipulation 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C) During a March 9 meeting with poloff, recently fired 
prosecutor Ramon Medina said he had received indirect 
warnings to change his political \"attitude,\" warnings he 
regarded as blatant attempts to manipulate his decisions to 
support the Chavez regime\'s domestic political agenda. 
Medina was dismissed in late February from his position as an 
office director in the Office of the Attorney General 
(Fiscalia), where he supervised over 500 prosecutors, or over 
70 percent of the nation\'s public prosecutors.  (Note: Medina 
is a long-time contact of the Embassy\'s Legatt and 
participated  in a PAS-sponsored Voluntary Visitors program 
in 2003 in which representatives of several Venezuelan law 
enforcement offices traveled to the U.S. for meetings with 
counterparts to review practices for establishing an 
inter-agency anti-terrorism force.  End Note.)  The Attorney 
General\'s office also dismissed Director of Procedural Action 
Carmen Alguindigue and Human Rights Division director Magaly 
Malpica (reftel).  Medina and Alguindigue were fired 
outright.  Malpica was allowed to retire early. 
 
3. (C) Medina said Venezuelan Attorney General Attorney 
General Isias Rodriguez, applied pressure to dismiss cases, 
disqualify certain prosecutors, or bring specific charges 
against Chavez\'s political targets.  Medina said he himself 
was finally targeted because he would did not cooperate. 
When he saw the writing on the wall, Medina offered to resign 
his position as an office director, but instead he was fired 
completely.  Attorney General Rodriguez himself made the 
final decision.  Medina charged that the Attorney General\'s 
Office is now focused entirely on solidifying Chavez\'s hold 
on domestic institutions and eliminating any perceived 
domestic political threat.  Contacts with foreign governments 
are being reduced, hampering cooperation on issues such as 
international terrorism.  The Attorney General\'s Office, he 
said, is \"armoring\" itself from any influence from the 
outside. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Politics Dictates Charges, Stymies HR Investigations 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (C) Medina said there are no formal criteria regarding 
charges to prosecute opposition protestors detained during 
the unrest stretching from February 27 through March 6. 
Instead, prosecutors are using their own judgment to bring 
charges such as disrupting public order or environmental 
(non-criminal) offenses for setting up burning street 
barricades.  Charges for civil rebellion, he said, are rarely 
supported by actions during street demonstrations and 
therefore are obviously politically-motivated. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
 
Judges Dismissed with Pressure from Executive 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) On March 10 Judge Maria del Carmen Trastory Hombre 
provided poloff with a copy of the order signed by TSJ Chief 
Justice Ivan Rincondismissing her from her position as a 
Caracas criminal judge.  Trastory is one of three trial 
judges dismissed by the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) March 
2 for ordering some detained anti-GoV protestors released. 
Miguel Angel Luna, another of the dismissed judges, told 
poloff March 10 that speaking with a USG official could ruin 
his chances of getting his job back and woudl not agree to 
meet.  Petra Jimenez, the third dismissed judge, was 
unavailable. 
 
6. (C) Trastory said she ordered six detained opposition 
demonstrators released March 2 because the GoV had provided 
insufficient evidence to support the detentions.  Some 
detainees were arrested on charges of creating a \"danger of a 
catastrophe,\" but the facts presented did not indicate any 
significant public danger.  Others were arrested for 
\"resisting authorities,\" but the facts alleged only that the 
demonstrators were running away from GoV troops.  Trastory 
said this was insufficient under the law to support such a 
charge, and not nearly strong enough to overcome the 
citizens\' right to demonstrate guaranteed under Articles 68, 
219 and 221 of the Venezuelan constitution.  Trastory also 
recalled that the detainees in question showed evidence of 
having been beaten by authorities after arrest.  One victim 
was severely bruised on his back from his neck down the 
length of his spine.  Trastory said she remains confident in 
her decision based on her fourteen years of criminal law 
experience (nine years as a prosecutor and her five years as 
a criminal judge). 
 
------------------------------------- 
Political Moves Against the Judiciary 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Trastory said that, as is the case in the U.S., when a 
prosecutor does not agree with a judge\'s ruling, the normal 
procedure is to file a motion to stay the order with a higher 
court pending a judicial appeal of the ruling.  In this 
instance, however, GoV officials resorted to a political 
move, dismissing the judges rather than going through legal 
channels to appeal the decisions. 
 
8. (C) The odd manner in which the decision was made makes 
Trastory sure the decision to dismiss her is politically 
motivated.  While the TSJ\'s Chief Justice signed the order, 
Trastory is sure the order came from a Chavez ally in the GoV 
executive branch such as Vice President Jose Vincente Rangel 
or Minister of Infrastructure Diosdado Cabello.  She noted 
that her court is located in Sucre State, where the local 
mayor is Jose Vincente Rangel Avalos, the Vice President\'s 
son.  She also said she signed the petition seeking the 
recall of Chavez in December 2003 and had since been targeted 
by Rangel and pro-Chavez activists seeking to purge the 
court. 
 
9. (C) Trastory asserted that the court system was becoming 
more and more corrupt and open to manipulation by political 
pressure.  Many corrupt judges, she said, were willing to 
received political favors or payments, or succumbed to 
threats, to rule in a manner preferred by the GoV.  The 
shrinking number of independent judges, she said, are 
increasingly afraid of retribution. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) Keeping a lid on trial judges and prosecutors will 
strengthen Chavez\'s hand as he tries to punish opposition 
demonstrators and discourage further protests by 
strengthening the public perception that GoV security forces 
can attack or imprison demonstrators with impunity.   Chavez 
clearly hopes this will make opposition activists think twice 
before challenging GoV forces in the streets.  Perhaps of 
greater concern, the recent dismissals of prosecutors and 
 
judges signal greater GoV manipulation of the justice system, 
willingness to force out officials who refuse to support the 
chavista political agenda, and centralization of power in the 
executive.

Classified By: Abelardo A. Arias, Political Counselor, for 
Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The NGO Sumate presented to the diplomatic corps on 
March 11 its initial impressions of the signature 
verification data given to the opposition by the National 
Electoral Council\'s (CNE).  The CNE\'s work is full of errors 
that, in Sumate\'s opinion, imply an intentional effort to 
ruin the chances of a recall referendum against President 
Hugo Chavez.  In addition to the CNE\'s alleged bad faith in 
processing the signatures, Sumate sees fundamental logistical 
problems that will make a successful appeals process 
unlikely.  While Sumate\'s analysis may strengthen the 
opposition\'s hand somewhat in negotiating the appeals 
process, the GOV more than likely hold to these numbers.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Sumate:  CNE Contradicts Its Own Numbers 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD, \"Democratic 
Coordinating Committee\") invited the diplomatic corps to a 
briefing March 11, which the Ambassador attended, to present 
an analysis of signature verification results supplied by the 
National Electoral Council (CNE).  Miranda State Governor 
Enrique Mendoza made introductory comments about the CNE\'s 
data, which was given to the opposition on March 7 as part of 
the negotiations for an appeals process.  Mendoza showed how 
errors in transcription of identity numbers at the CNE 
resulted in the inclusion of 80 active duty military officers 
in the opposition\'s signature list, which the Ministry of 
Defense cited as fraud on the part of the opposition. 
Mendoza showed copies of the original signature forms with 
the correct identity numbers as evidence that the officers 
had not been fraudulently included, but rather altered during 
transcription at the CNE (Note: A DCC representative 
estimated to poloff that some 120,000 identity numbers had 
been altered in this manner.). 
 
3. (SBU) Enrique Palacios of the NGO Sumate gave an overview 
of the CNE\'s data, noting that the data received on March 7 
did not/not match the figures announced by CNE President 
Francisco Carrasquero on March 2.  For example, Carrasquero 
declared that 1,832,493 of the signatures were valid, but the 
new data gave the figure as 1,788,523, nearly 44,000 less. 
Carrasquero also said 876,017 signature forms were \"under 
observation\" for having similar handwriting (\"planas\" in 
Venezuelan Spanish).  The new data says 893,466 forms, a 
difference of some 140,000 signatures. 
 
------------------------ 
Logical Anomalies Abound 
------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) Palacios noted that the CNE applied 38 different 
reasons for rejecting (or placing \"in observation\") the 
signatures, though the rules only specify five.  The reasons, 
he said, have the appearance of being created as the work 
proceeded:  some fingerprints were rejected for having \"light 
fingerprints\" and others for an undefined \"error in 
fingerprint.\"  Reason number \"0,\" which invalidated nearly 
300,000 signatures, was simply listed as \"to be explained.\" 
Other reasons included \"lack of information,\" \"torn signature 
form,\" and \"in physical search.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Palacios said Carrasquero announced that 7,297 forms 
had been returned unused or blank, which Sumate disputes.  In 
any event, Palacios noted that 321 signatures had been 
credited to forms that were officially designated as \"blank.\" 
 He said the CNE had found 8,526 signatures ruled out because 
of \"similar handwriting\" criterion when there was no other 
similar handwriting on the form, creating the logical fallacy 
of how only one signature line on a form could be singled out 
for looking like another.  Though the forms only had ten 
signature lines, 112 signature forms have more than 10 
 
signatures each credited to them (one form supposedly 
contained 37 signatures). 
 
6. (SBU) Perhaps most confusing was that the 38 reasons were 
not evenly applied to the final disposition of the 
signatures.  For example, reason number \"1,\" described simply 
as \"annulled,\" resulted in 78,995 signatures sent to the 
appeals process and 191,479 that were rejected completely. 
Palacios questioned how the same criteria could have two 
different outcomes. 
 
---------------------------- 
Location, Location, Location 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Palacios gave a state-by-state breakdown of the 
rejected signatures and those subject to appeal, claiming 
some states showed unusually high rates of rejection/appeal. 
Palacios showed a map of Caracas, in which hundreds of 
centers in the poorer western part of the city had 50 percent 
rejection/appeal rates, though rates of five percent 
prevailed in the opposition strongholds in the east. 
Palacios claimed this as evidence of an intent to force the 
opposition to mount the appeals process in pro-Chavez areas, 
where security risks for signers are higher. 
 
---------------------------- 
Appeals Process Not Feasible 
---------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Palacios raised two key issues for making an appeals 
process work.  First, how to inform those who need to go to 
the appeals centers.  Palacios said the CNE\'s answer of 
publishing the identity numbers in a national newspaper, 
coupled with internet and other methods, could only reach 
about 500,000 people (the opposition needs a net gain of 
about 600,000 signatures).  Second, how does one appeal the 
signature?  The one-computer-per-center scheme offered by the 
CNE, in Sumate\'s opinion, would only allow 700,000 signatures 
to be processed (assuming only two days of appeals, which the 
GOV has said could be expanded to three days).  Palacios 
suggested that the best solution was for all signers to 
affirm their signatures in the appeals process, replace 
computers with a simple electoral \"book\" that can be signed, 
and allow up to ten lines per center.  Palacios said the 
opposition might need until mid-April just to get organized 
to make the process work. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) While we did not expect the CNE\'s work to be 
error-free, the Sumate presentation reinforces our belief 
that the CNE has not been acting in good faith.  Per Sumate, 
the CNE has twisted the signature count to match President 
Chavez\'s assertions that an opposition-perpetrated 
\"megafraud\" has been afoot.  The incongruities between CNE\'s 
data and the opposition\'s may vindicate the opposition 
assertions, but it will not change the reality that the GOV 
continues to push them into an appeals process that will not 
work.  Public discontent over the CNE\'s ineptitude and/or 
duplicity might give the opposition some negotiating chits, 
but Chavez still controls the board for this next round of 
the referendum process.

------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s crude and refined product exports to Cuba 
have been increased by an additional 25,000 b/d for an 
official total of 78,000 b/d, according to a maritime 
industry contact.  Another Embassy source asserts that Cuba 
is now paying a larger portion of its debt to Venezuela with 
bonds emitted by the National Bank of Cuba.  End Summary. 
------------------- 
OIL SALES INCREASED 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) On March 8, a maritime industry contact passed to 
econoff a copy of an internal PDVSA memo dated February 25, 
2005 and signed by PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez, which 
authorizes delivery of an additional 25,000 barrels per day 
of crude and refined products to Cuba for the month of March 
2004.  Despite the fact that the one sentence memo authorizes 
\"the delivery of an additional 25,000 b/d, between crude and 
products, for the month of March 2004 to Cupet (the Cuban 
state petroleum enterprise),\" our contact believes this will 
be a permanent increase to 78,000 b/d instead of the 53,000 
b/d stipulated in the Caracas Energy Accord of October 2002. 
Given that Venezuela\'s deliveries to Cuba averaged some 
30,000 b/d over the 53,000 b/d ceiling in August-October 2003 
(see reftel), econoff asked if future sales to Cuba would now 
likely exceed 100,000 b/d to which our contact responded 
\"yes.\"  He also confirmed that Cuba\'s debt with Venezuela is 
nearing US$1 billion. 
 
-------------------------------- 
CUBA CONTINUES TO PAY WITH BONDS 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Another source, formerly a highly-placed PDVSA 
executive, passed the text of another Cuba-related PDVSA 
document bearing Ali Rodriguez\'s signature to econoff.  This 
document, translated informally in Para. 4 below, marks the 
formal transfer of approximately US$251 million in National 
Bank of Cuba bonds from PDVSA to the Venezuelan treasury and 
states that this represents part of PDVSA\'s dividend payments 
to the GOV.  Then PDVSA President General Guaicapuro Lameda 
informed econoff in early 2002 that he had instituted this 
practice of assigning the Cuban bonds to the treasury so that 
the central government could bear the risk of non-payment 
rather than PDVSA.  The source who passed the document to us, 
however, added that Cuba had previously been expected to pay 
at least some portion of the short term portion of its debt 
in cash not bonds.  He asserted, although we cannot confirm 
this, that Cuba is now paying the entire debt with bonds. 
 
4. (C) An informal translation follows below: 
 
In the city of Caracas, on the 27th of January 2004, citizen 
Ali Rodriguez Araque in his position as President of 
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A, and under the powers conferred by 
the Statutory Document of the corporation, in this Act 
delivers six payments emitted by the National Bank of Cuba, 
on the basis of the sales contract signed by PDVSA Petroleo 
S.A, affiliate of (Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.) with the 
Cuban Petroleum Union (CUPET) under the framework of the 
Integral Cooperation Convention, celebrated by the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela with the Republic of Cuba on 30 October 
2000, identified with the numbers 1/12, 4/12, 5/12, 6/12, 
8/12 and 12/12 for an amount of US$251,248,523.11 equivalent 
to Bs. 401,997,636,976 calculated at an exchange rate fixed 
for the sale of these reserves by the Central Bank of 
Venezuela at (1,600 bs) for each dollar, to citizen Carmen 
Teresa Melendez, National Treasurer, representing the 
Ministry of Finance, to receive the above mentioned quantity 
as part of the payment to the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela of dividends by PDVSA, according to that agreed in 
the first annual Ordinary Assembly of the Board of Petroleos 
de Venezuela, on 16 December 2003.

COMMENT

5. (C) Maintaining subsidized oil sales to Cuba is likely to 
remain a high priority for Chavez, despite his own pressing 
need for cash.  Word of additional sales to Cuba (assuming 
the 25,000 barrels are indeed new oil) has not yet hit the 
public but, with the Cuban debt climbing, it would 
undoubtedly be a hot button issue for the opposition.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Nearly a dozen Venezuelans died, 1,758 were wounded or 
injured, and 410 were detained during disturbances in the 
country from February 27 to March 5, according to the 
opposition Democratic Coordinating Committee (DCC).  Amid the 
claims of government human rights abuses, the GOV has mounted 
its own campaign, highlighting injuries among the security 
forces and blaming the opposition itself for the alleged 
rights abuses.  Human rights organizations acknowledge 
certain governmental actions that assist victims, but they 
maintain nevertheless that the GOV bears the greater 
responsibility for human rights abuses.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
ADDING UP THE VICTIMS 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) Nearly a dozen Venezuelans died, 1,758 were wounded or 
injured, and 410 were detained during disturbances in the 
country from February 27 to March 5, according to a March 9 
statement from the broad opposition umbrella group Democratic 
Coordinating Committee (DCC).  In addition, DCC spokesman 
Jesus Torrealba claimed March 9 that eight anti-GOV 
protesters are unaccounted for (Note: one has been accounted 
for since then), and that there are nine accusations against 
security forces of torture and use of excessive force, 
especially by the National Guard (GN).  Human rights NGO 
PROVEA verified 9 dead and 103 \"deprivations of personal 
integrity,\" a catch-all description that includes injuries, 
detentions, and torture.  Opposition London-based NGO 
Pro-Venezuela Organization (ProVeO) listed 12 dead, 8 
missing, and 180 political prisoners as of March 11 on their 
Web site (www.proveo.org). 
 
------------------------------- 
PRO-GOV CIVILIAN GROUPS ACCUSED 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Torrealba asserted that the political police (DISIP) 
and \"armed irregulars\" participated in the alleged March 3 
killing of Jose Luis Ricaurte Blanco.  Merida student leader 
Nixon Moreno told poloff March 11 that Argenis Dugarte was 
killed by members of the pro-Chavez student group Utopia on 
March 2 and that pro-Chavez groups attacked several students 
and opposition groups March 3, including an armed assault on 
the student government headquarters (ref b).  Merida\'s 
student government reported the student medical clinic 
treated 22 protest-related injuries March 3 and 4. 
 
------------------------ 
TRYING TO FIND THE TRUTH 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Human rights NGOs are gathering information on alleged 
human rights violations through personal and phone interviews 
primarily.  Marino Alvarado, NGO PROVEA\'s Human Rights 
Education Coordinator, told poloff March 11 that human rights 
NGOs are reluctant to comment on exact numbers until they 
verify the cases reported to them and release formal reports 
-- a process that would not be completed any time soon. 
Carlos Correa, PROVEA\'s General Coordinator, told poloff 
March 8 that PROVEA also gathers information from official 
sources,  the media, and other human rights organizations and 
then compares those numbers with its own. 
 
5. (C) Correa remarked that convincing people to make 
official complaints with the authorities has been 
particularly difficult, and that the lack of an official 
complaint limits the range of actions the NGO can take. 
Alvarado added that many victims wish to remain anonymous due 
to reprisal fears, creating a dilemma for the NGO that must 
choose to include them in their report with annotations, 
report them separately, or reject them altogether.  Un Solo 
Pueblo Media Director Adriana Sanoja told poloff March 10 she 
 
knows of two attacks unreported to government or NGOs that 
occurred near the party headquarters.  She claimed local 
police assisting a pro-Chavez group in an attack on an 
opposition barricade shot a women in the head, grazing but 
not penetrating the skull.  Pro-Chavez neighbors warned the 
wounded woman not report the incident and destroyed a 
visiting friend\'s car to drive the point home, according to 
Sanoja.  Alvarado said PROVEA was having particular trouble 
tracking prisoners because of releases and new cases, 
something he suspected accounts for apparently overstated 
numbers in media reports.  However, Alvarado cautioned 
against \"obsessing over the numbers\" when the GOV\'s use of 
violent repression was clear. 
 
6. (C) Jose Gregorio Guarenas, Director of the Catholic 
Church\'s Human Rights Office (Vicaria), told poloff March 10 
that his staff gathers documentation of the alleged 
violation, such as medical reports, pictures of injuries, and 
witness statements.  The staff member then accompanies the 
alleged victim to the Attorney General\'s Office to file the 
complaint, supported by the documentation.  According to 
Guarenas, the Vicaria works closely with COFAVIC, another 
human rights NGO. 
 
7. (C) Guarenas and Correa both acknowledged the importance 
of making the official complaint, and Guarenas thought it was 
a good sign that Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez had 
announced the opening of investigations into 11 torture 
cases.  Guarenas told poloff, however, that the Attorney 
General\'s Office was clearly acting on behalf of the GOV when 
it released ballistics results on the Jose Vilas shooting 
without first informing his family.  Guarenas also asserted 
that GN officers were definitely the shooters in the Vilas 
case, based on witness and video evidence. 
 
8. (U) Carlos Nieto, General Coordinator of the prison 
watchdog group \"A Window to Liberty\" said in a March 10 press 
statement that nine detainees in La Planta prison were being 
treated well and were being kept in an area away from the 
general prison population.  However, based on his interviews 
of the detainees, Nieto said they had been \"savagely and 
inhumanely tortured by the National Guard\" before being 
transferred to the prison. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SELLING THE IMAGE: FULL COURT PRESS 
----------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Amid the allegations of human rights abuses, the GOV 
has mounted its own campaign, not only to blame the 
opposition for injuries among the security forces, but also 
for the alleged abuses suffered by the opposition.  One day 
after the March 1 shooting of opposition protester Jose 
Vilas, the Attorney General\'s Office released ballistics 
results purporting to prove that the GN could not have shot 
the protester, though eye witnesses disagree.  Interior and 
Justice Minister Lucas Rincon and Scientific and 
Investigative Police (CICPC) Chief Commissioner Marcos Chavez 
said in a March 9 joint press conference that none of the 
deaths since February 27 can be attributed to the GN, 
claiming that the type of bullet, weapon, or both are not GN 
standard issue.  Information and Communication Minister Jesse 
Chacon charged that the private media instigated the 
violence. 
 
10. (C) Alejandro Carrillo, Director of Inter-Institutional 
Affairs for the Ombudsman, told poloff March 9 that the 
opposition has been engaging in violence since February 27, 
which gives the GOV the right and duty to respond with force. 
 Carrillo claimed the Ombudsman has pictures of demonstrators 
carrying guns and molotov cocktails during the February 27 
march to the G-15 meeting and asserted that burning garbage 
in the streets is \"a type of violence.\"  \"The National 
Guard,\" he said, \"is permitted by law to respond to any 
violent demonstration with tear gas and plastic bullets,\" and 
he denied that the GN had used metal bullets or other 
excessive force. 
 
11. (C) After asserting that the GOV has the right to defend 
itself against a violent opposition, Carillo then admitted to 
poloff that the Ombudsman couldn\'t really say with certainty 
that opposition marchers had instigated violence.  He said 
 
the opposition paid contract killers (sicarios) to shoot 
demonstrators and create \"chaos and anarchy\" but offered no 
proof.  He declined to comment on opposition allegations of 
torture and arrest without due process, saying only that they 
are criminal matters under the Attorney General\'s 
jurisdiction.  The Ombudsman\'s only role in such matters, he 
explained, is to take statements from the alleged victims and 
pass them to the Attorney General. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C) The magnitude and credibility of witnessQnd video 
accounts of human rights abuses contrasts sharply with the 
GOV\'s attempt to blame the opposition for its own violent 
acts.  Alvarado\'s point is well taken: we should not allow 
ourselves to become overly preoccupied with bean counting or 
allow lack of firm statistical data to prevent us from 
recognizing the obvious.  The GOV started crossing a 
discernible line between applying legitimate and appropriate 
force in crowd control and indiscriminately attacking 
protesters on February 27 and sprinted past it in the ensuing 
days.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (U) The Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice 
(TSJ), issued a ruling March 15 ordering the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) to include more than 800,000 
presidential referendum signatures among the valid signatures 
that will be subject to the appeals process (reparo). In 
theory, the decision gives the opposition enough signatures 
to schedule a presidential recall referendum.  Caracas Mayor 
Freddy Bernal (MVR) called the decision illegal and said they 
would take the matter to the Constitutional Chamber.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Electoral Chamber Storms Back, Rules for the Opposition 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. (U) Justice Alberto Martini, president of the Electoral 
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ), announced a 
ruling March 15 ordering the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
to include more than 800,000 presidential referendum 
signatures among the valid signatures that will be suject to 
the appeals process (reparo).  The CNE had placed the 
signatures in question in an \"under observation\" category 
because some corresponding data on the petition forms was 
written in the same handwriting.  An opposition suit claims 
the CNE never published guidelines directing signers to fill 
in all information with separate handwriting, and therefore 
alleges the CNE\'s failure to certify the signatures is 
illegal (septel). 
 
3. (U) The Electoral Chamber\'s decision came after legal 
motions lodged by the opposing sides, and a March 11 
declaration by the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber that 
purported to take jurisdiction on the case away from the 
Electoral Chamber.  In his announcement, Martini questioned 
TSJ Constitutional Chamber President Ivan Rincon\'s motivation 
 
SIPDIS 
for issuing what he described as an invalid and illegal 
ruling assuming jurisdiction.  Martini emphasized that the 
Electoral Chamber holds primary authority for all electoral 
issues, and suggested the Constitutional Chamber issued its 
decision without a valid quorum of justices. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Constitutional Court Reiterates Legitimacy 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) Within two hours of the Electoral Chamber\'s 
announcement, Constitutinal Chamber president Ivan Rincon 
issued a statement defending the March 11 decision claiming 
jurisdiction.  The statement said that four of the 
Constitutional Chamber\'s five justices were present, forming 
a valid quorum, and refused to give ground on the Electoral 
Chamber\'s claims of exclusive purview over matters having to 
do with the CNE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
GoV Quick to Criticize; More Legal Moves Coming 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (U) Freddy Bernal, the mayor of Caracas\' Libertador 
Municipality and a member of Chavez\'s ruling Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) party, responded immediately to the Electoral 
Chamber\'s decision on behalf of the GoV.  Bernal called the 
decision illegal and in violation of the Constitutional 
Chamber\'s jurisdiction.  Bernal said the MVR national 
directorate would shortly appeal the decision to the TSJ\'s 
Constitutional Chamber.  (Note: There was no explanation 
offered for why Bernal was teh spokesman for this legal 
issue.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Opposition Buoyed, But Not Counting Its Chickens 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
6. (C) Jose Luis Mejias of the opposition Premero Justicia 
party, told poloff March 15 he expects the Electoral Chamber 
decision to be challenged in the Constitutional Chamber. 
Nevertheless, Mejias said the decision may give the 
opposition another two or three days of breathing room to 
negotiate a better deal for an appeals process. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
7. (C) Today\'s court announcement is merely another move in 
the continuing legal contest between the parties.  In theory, 
the Electoral Chamber\'s decision adds 800,000 to the 1.8 
million signatures the CNE has already verified, bringing the 
total to 2.6 million, more than the 2.4 million minimum 
necessary to schedule a presidential recall referendum.  But 
the TSJ\'s wrestling match over control of election issues may 
not be settled soon.  Both sides say a majority of justices 
in the Electoral Chamber are pro-opposition, while a majority 
in the Constitutional Chamber are pro-Chavez.  Under Court 
rules, if two chambers of the TSJ issue conflicting rulings, 
the decision could be thrown to the whole TSJ sitting en 
banc, where court-watchers believe the tribunal is deadlocked 
ten to ten.  But an outright victory is not necessary. 
Pro-Chavez justices may delay a final decision on the 
question, effectively allowing the CNE to operate 
independently.  If a final resolution is reached, it will 
likely result from a political deal rather than from a clear 
legal pronouncement.

SUMMARY: 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela Supreme Court\'s (TSJ) Constitutional Chamber 
declared March 11 that it alone is the appropriate forum to 
hear cases regarding the National Electoral Council (CNE) and 
the proposed presidential recall referendum.  Constitutional 
Chamber president Ivan Rincon told the Ambassador March 12 
that such cases had to be removed from the Electoral Chamber 
to save the country and to take the decision out of \"the 
opposition\'s Chamber.\"  News of the Constitutional Chamber\'s 
decision came shortly after the TSJ Electoral Chamber 
rejected pro-Chavez and opposition motions to recuse its 
justices from cases regarding the CNE.  The Constitutional 
Chamber\'s action, questioned because a decision has yet to be 
published and taken without the required quorum, aims to kill 
a suit filed by opposition allies challenging the CNE\'s 
decision to refuse to certify more than one million 
signatures from the presidential referendum signature drive. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Background on Court Moves 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) This cable provides background on the legal moves in 
the Supreme Court (TSJ) prior to the Electoral Chamber\'s 
March 15 decision, in which the Chamber instructed the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) to include more than 800,000 
signatures, previously relegated to \"observation,\" in the 
appeals process (reftel). 
 
------------------------------------ 
Dueling Court Chambers Trade Rulings 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) After a flurry of legal maneuvering March 11, the 
TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber declared that it alone is the 
 
SIPDIS 
appropriate forum to hear cases regarding the CNE and the 
proposed presidential recall referendum.   The Constitutional 
Chamber, acting on a request presented by pro-GoV legislator 
Ismael Garcia (PODEMOS), made its declaration hours after the 
TSJ Electoral Chamber seemed to hand the opposition a victory 
 
SIPDIS 
when it declared itself competent to decide cases regarding 
the CNE. 
 
4. (U) The Electoral Chamber\'s ruling rejected motions 
seeking to recuse each of the Chamber\'s members.  Garcia, who 
is also a member of Chavez\'s election movement (Comando 
Ayacucho), filed a motion seeking to remove Justices Alberto 
Martini and Rafael Hernandez, alleging they were both 
prejudiced against President Chavez.  Garcia and other 
pro-GoV legislators publicly called Martini a traitor for 
allegedly seeking protection from the U.S. Ambassador and now 
taking orders from the USG. 
 
5. (U) Under court procedures, such a motion brought against 
the Chamber president would normally be decided by the 
Chamber vice president.  Opposition legislator Gerardo Blyde 
(Primero Justicia), however, filed a motion to recuse the 
Chamber VP.  The additional motion threw the decision to the 
whole three-judge panel, which ruled that all recusal motions 
were untimely and without sufficient legal basis. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Chief Justice Feared Decision of Electoral Chamber 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (C) In March 12 meeting, TSJ Chief Justice Ivan Rincon, 
who also serves as the president of court\'s Constitutional 
Chamber, told the Ambassador that he had to take the case 
away from the Electoral Chamber to keep the country from 
\"going up on flames.\"  Rincon dismissed the Electoral Chamber 
as an instrument of the opposition, and alleged that that 
 
Chamber was poised to declare a referendum without regard for 
the CNE-mandated appeals process.  Letting the Electoral 
Chamber rule on the case, said Rincon, would be akin to 
permitting a \"coup d\'etat by magistrates.\"  Rincon agreed 
that allegations that Electoral Chamber president Martini was 
taking orders from the USG were baseless.  However, Rincon 
said opposition leaders such as Juan Fernandez and Henry 
Ramos were \"close\" to Martini.  Rincon said he suspects there 
are as many as 300,000 false signatures filed by the 
opposition, and complained that the media had interposed 
itself in the process instead of acting as an observer. 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador told Rincon several times that the 
international perception of the CNE\'s verification of the 
presidential referendum signatures is that it was arbitrary, 
and that by rejecting 50% of the signatures because the 
personal data were allegedly entered by the same hand the CNE 
altered the outcome of the petition drive.  He urged the 
Venezuelan justice to do what he could to ensure that the 
appeals system being developed for the sugnatures was 
transparent and workable, and that the universe of signatures 
to be considered in the appeals process be as large as 
possible.  Rincon agreed it should be transparent and 
workable. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Opposition Law Suit Could Force a Referendum 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) The central case before the Supreme Court, filed by 
Blyde and opposition allies, challenges the CNE\'s rejection 
of some 1.3 million signatures from the recent Presidential 
referendum signature drive.  The CNE threw out many of the 
rejected signatures because some corresponding data on the 
petition forms was written in the same hand.  The opposition 
suit claims the CNE never published guidelines directing 
signers to fill in all information with separate handwriting, 
and therefore alleges that failure to certify the 1.3 million 
signatures is illegal. 
 
9.  (U) Noted constitutional expert Tulio Alvarez, speaking 
to reporters, questioned the validity of the Constitutional 
Chamber\'s decision -- no decision has been published and 
there was no quorum in the Constitutional Chamber.  The 
Constitutional Chamber, he asserted, cannot make a decision 
infringing on the jurisdiction of the Court\'s other chambers. 
 Alvarez also noted that accepting that one Chamber of the 
court can usurp the jurisdiction of another would signal the 
complete emasculation of the judiciary. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
10. (C) Court-watchers expect these rulings to be only the 
first round of decisions in several competing legal actions 
that could impact on a decision to schedule a presidential 
recall referendum.  Under court rules, the TSJ\'s 
Constitutional and Electoral Chambers enjoy co-ordinate 
jurisdiction on some electoral matters.  Recognizing this, 
opposition lawyers had hoped to push their case through the 
Electoral Chamber.  Because the recall referendum is a matter 
stemming from a constitutional provision, however, Chavez 
supporters saw an opening to transfer the case to the 
Constitutional Chamber.  For now, these moves in the 
referendum legal chess match appear to kill the opposition\'s 
central case.  Rincon is convinced that allowing a referendum 
without first having a CNE-run appeals process first is 
unworkable.  Nevertheless, he appears open to discuss 
options.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C/NF) Jesus Arnaldo Perez became Venezuela\'s Minister of 
Foreign Relations on February 13, 2004.  Having served as 
Ambassador to France (2002-2004) and to Algeria (2001-2002), 
Perez replaced outgoing Minister Roy Chaderton, who will 
replace Perez as Ambassador to France once the GOV receives 
agrement and the National Assembly approves the nomination. 
Perez is reportedly a childhood friend of President Hugo 
Chavez and rumors abound that he is in fact the President\'s 
illegitimate half brother.  Perez has spent many years living 
in France, where he was educated and later taught university. 
 He has a doctorate in geography and previously served as 
President Chavez\'s Minister of Environment and Natural 
Resources during 1999-2000.  Perez champions Chavez\'s call 
for an International Humanitarian Fund to help lesser 
developed countries.  His arrival coincides with several 
rumored dismissals at the foreign ministry, suggesting Perez 
will purge his ministry of anti-revolutionary sentiment. 
This cable responds in part to Department\'s information 
request regarding Perez (reftel).  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Professional Experience 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) Jesus Arnaldo Perez was sworn in as Minister of 
Foreign Relations on February 13, 2004.  He returns from his 
assignment as Ambassador to France (June 2002 to February 
2004) to replace outgoing Minister Roy Chaderton, who will 
reportedly replace Perez in Paris.  While in Paris, Perez was 
also the Venezuelan PermRep to UNESCO.  Perez previously 
served as Ambassador to Algeria (2001-2002) and as Minister 
of Environment and Natural Resources (1999-2000).  According 
to his official biography, he was an independent 
environmental consultant in the Venezuelan petroleum sector 
from 1996 to 1998.  Prior to that, he taught classes in 
agriculture and geography at various universities in France. 
 
------------------- 
Academic Background 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) Minister Perez earned a doctorate in geography 
(emphasis in rural development) in 1994 from Toulouse 
University II in Toulouse, France.  He received master\'s 
degrees from the University of Paris (1985) and Bordeaux 
University (1983) and a bachelor\'s degree in geography (1982) 
from the University of Toulouse.  He is the author of several 
technical articles on agriculture and the environment. 
 
------------- 
Personal Data 
------------- 
 
4. (C) Perez was born on November 11, 1953 in Veguita, 
Barinas State, close to the birthplace of President Hugo 
Chavez.  Chavez mentioned during Perez\'s swearing-in ceremony 
that the two had attended school together in Barinas.  It 
widely rumored that Perez and Chavez are half brothers, 
having the same father.  Perez is married to Lylia de Perez, 
a Moroccan of French descent.  According to a senior MFA 
official, Perez\'s three children do not speak Spanish but 
rather French.  Perez describes his time spent in France as a 
\"voluntary exile\" from Venezuela. 
 
------------- 
Policy Agenda 
------------- 
 
 
5. (C) At his swearing-in, Perez blamed an increase in world 
poverty on globalization and the leaders of the North.  He 
makes frequent mention of President Chavez\'s proposal for an 
International Humanitarian Fund to help lesser developed 
countries eradicate poverty.  According to press interviews, 
Perez sees the U.S.-Venezuela relation as \"love-hate,\" like a 
married couple that \"loves each other, but has their 
differences.\"  He has demanded that the USG respond to 
Chavez\'s allegations that it was involved in the events of 
April 2002 in Venezuela.  Perez said he does not foresee a 
formal break in relations with the U.S. despite President 
Chavez\'s hardened rhetoric. 
 
----------------------- 
Institutional Cleansing 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) One of Perez\'s mandates reportedly is to ensure that 
the Foreign Ministry is primarily loyal to President Chavez. 
Perez denies there is an ideological purge coming, but rather 
a restructuring the MFA to be more flexible and \"truly 
democratic.\"  A senior MFA official told the Ambassador that 
22 MFA employees were suspended from work just before the 
February 27 G-15 Summit for having signed for the 
presidential recall referendum.  (Note:  Although there is no 
direct link between the suspensions and Perez, the 
circumstances have given the impression of a purge.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) We see the appointment of Perez as Chavez\'s desire to 
surround himself with people who are loyal above all.  Perez 
is neither a convincing orator nor seems to possess a great 
intellect.  While he appears amiable and purports to want 
cordial relations with us, we do not expect him to challenge 
Chavez or to offer him particularly useful advice on the U.S. 
and bilateral relations.  We do not expect Perez to be a 
heavy hitter in the cabinet.  Perez seems to be fully with 
the revolutionary agenda.  We see a distinct possibility that 
Perez will attempt to bring revolutionary change to a 
Venezuelan diplomatic corps that has been resilient to such 
efforts thus far.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The U.S.-based company Smartmatic (Boca Raton, 
Florida) is the managing partner of the SBC Consortium that 
recently won the contract to provide automated electoral 
equipment and services for Venezuela\'s August 1 regional 
elections (and a presidential referendum if necessary).  The 
consortium will provide the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
with 20,000 touch-screen voting machines for 4,500 centers, 
and an encrypted telecommunications infrastructure for 
tallying the votes.  Smartmatic claims the US$60 million 
payment for the new equipment will pay for itself in savings 
after three elections.  Venezuelan electoral law calls for 
the automation of elections to the maximum extent possible. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CNE Sought New, Secure Electoral System 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Venezuelan electoral law requires elections to be 
automated when possible.  The Spanish firm Indra had provided 
technical services for electoral processes since 2000, 
including maintenance of 7,600 optical reader machines 
purchased by the National Electoral Council (CNE) that year. 
The CNE, claiming budgetary shortfalls, had fallen behind in 
payments to Indra for the maintenance of the machines. 
Before leaving office in September 2003, the previous CNE 
board approved the extension of Indra\'s contract to provide 
services for the August 1, 2004, regional elections. 
 
3. (C) The new CNE board annulled Indra\'s contract in 
September, citing the \"onerous\" costs of maintenance and 
out-of-date technology.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez, head 
of the National Electoral Board, announced a new bidding 
process the autumn of 2003.  Rodriguez criticized the 
previous system that left Indra in charge of the computer 
programs that tallies votes.  Rodriguez argued that the CNE 
should own the technology, including software codes, involved 
in counting ballots.  Based on these criteria, a CNE 
technical committee on February 16 selected the SBC 
Consortium led by Smartmatic.  Rodriguez was also skeptical 
of the firms ES&S, which provided the software for the old 
machines.  He reportedly believed that ES&S worked with the 
Central Intelligence Agency and therefore could not be 
trusted. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
U.S.-Led Consortium Will Provide Automation 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Representatives of the SBC Consortium gave a 
presentation to poloffs on March 9 on the electoral 
automation services they will provide to the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) for the August 1 elections for 
governors and mayors.  SBC Consortium is comprised of the 
Smartmatic Corporation (of Boca Raton, Florida), CANTV (the 
Venezuelan telecommunications operator, partially-owned by 
Verizon), and Bista Software (a local Venezuelan firm). 
 
5. (SBU) Smartmatic is managing the project and will provide 
the technology, equipment, and software.  Started by 
Venezuelans, Smartmatic incorporated in the State of Delaware 
several years ago and has moved its headquarters in Boca 
Raton, Florida.  It has an office in Mexico and maintains its 
research and development office (about 30 people) in 
Venezuela.  This is the first time Smartmatic has tried to 
apply its secure network technology to an electoral process, 
and it has contracted a team of electoral experts to 
implement the project. 
 
6. (SBU) Within the consortium, CANTV is to transport 
equipment to, and establish a network for, 4,500 electoral 
 
 
sites throughout Venezuela (which will cover 95 percent of 
the electorate), connecting them to municipal, regional, and 
national vote-tallying centers.  Bista will design the 
Venezuela-specific tallying software.  The contract between 
the CNE and the Consortium encompasses the purchase of US$60 
million in software and equipment and US$30 million for 
electoral services such as logistics and consulting (about 
US$30 million in U.S. exports and services).  An additional 
US$27 million will be added to the contract should the CNE 
hold a presidential recall referendum. 
 
------------------------- 
A New Touch-Screen Design 
------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) With this change, the CNE leaps to touch-screen 
technology from the optical ballot readers used for several 
previous elections with error rates of up to 15 percent. 
Smartmatic will import 20,000 voting machines from Italy, in 
essence, re-engineered lottery machines.  Smaller than a cash 
register, each machines has a six-inch screen and an 
integrated printer that emits a receipt for each vote as well 
as the closing tally sheet.  Each machine will be assigned to 
a specific electoral table (an electoral center has several 
tables according to size) and will only accept the maximum 
votes designated for that specific table. 
 
----------------------------- 
The \"Secure\" Voting Procedure 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) To vote, the person will present his or her national 
identity card to election workers, and sign and place a 
fingerprint in the electoral register.  The head of the 
electoral table then unlocks the voting machine by remote 
control.  After the voter makes his or her choices by 
pressing the corresponding square on the membrane and then 
presses the touch-screen to lock in the votes.  The machine 
prints a receipt record of the vote, which is assigned a 
random serial number.  The voter deposits the receipt in a 
ballot box and collects his or her national identity card. 
At the end of the day, the machine produces a paper tally 
sheet that is signed by poll workers and returned with the 
paper receipts to the CNE.  Once the tally sheet is produced, 
the machine transmits its data to the tallying center. 
 
9. (SBU) Smartmatic representatives claim the process is 
totally error-free in that the voter no longer fills out the 
ballot by hand.  Each vote is registered seven ways (five 
electronically, two manually), making fraud less likely.  The 
machines contain fixed flash memory as well as removable 
memory cards.  The machines work with special security paper 
bearing the CNE watermark.  The use of random serial numbers, 
they assert, ensures privacy by making it impossible to match 
the voting results with its corresponding electoral register. 
 The data transmission uses 128-bit encryption with 
public-private keys. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The Smartmatic system is impressive at first blush, 
though we wonder whether Venezuela\'s volatile electoral 
landscape provides the best venue for its premiere 
performance.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez, who heads the 
National Electoral Board, pressed ahead with this project 
despite the crushing workload of the signature verification 
process for the presidential recall referendum.  Putting this 
system on line now aids the GOV\'s strategy to use the 
regional elections to distract attention from the recall 
vote.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV appears to be engaged in a broad effort to 
ensure loyalty and punish opposition using the list of 
persons who signed the recall petition against President Hugo 
Chavez.  Since the beginning of March, reports have emerged 
of GOV offices and state enterprises using signature data 
from the National Electoral Council (CNE), accessible by 
internet, to vet employees, new hires, and beneficiaries of 
various government services such as identity cards.  Threats 
of dismissal against public employees are rife, though 
specific cases are difficult to confirm.  Labor 
representatives are protesting loudly but hold out little 
hope that the Attorney General and Human Rights Ombudsman 
will intervene.  The new push appears aimed at intimidating 
people into retracting their signatures, reinforce the GOV\'s 
theory of \"megafraud,\" and, in the long run, cleanse the 
bureaucracy of those who do not support President Chavez\'s 
political agenda.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
The Threat Is Mightier Than the Pen 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) President Hugo Chavez made clear in October 2003 that 
those who signed the opposition\'s petition to recall him 
would be remembered \"for 100 generations\" and would have to 
face the consequences of their actions.  Reports abounded 
during the November 28 - December 1 signature drive of 
threats against public sector workers who intended to sign. 
With the prospect of a signature appeals process on the 
horizon, during which people can retract their signatures, 
the GOV seems to be throwing out all the stops to force 
signers to recant.  Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy and 
member of the pro-GOV campaign committee Willian Lara 
reportedly urged party loyalists to \"locate, counsel, 
convince, organize, and transport to appeals centers\" at 
least 200,000 petition signers.  This so-called \"Victory 
Plan\" would be carried out by GOV vice ministers and other 
high-level officials on the national, state, and local level. 
 
 
3. (U) MVR Deputy Luis Tascon has posted the National 
Electoral Council\'s (CNE) signature data on his website, 
www.luistascon.com, purportedly for people to lodge fraud 
complaints against the opposition.  The website, however, has 
become a ready resource for Chavistas to check the loyalty of 
government workers and recipients of government benefits. 
Another source for the petition data is the pro-Chavez weekly 
tabloid \"Temas.\" The newspaper has published supplements over 
the past four weeks containing the more than three million 
identity card numbers of persons who signed. 
 
-------------------- 
The Wages of Signing 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Poloff met on March 17 with a group of labor leaders 
of the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) and 
Unapetrol, comprised of ex-PDVSA workers, to hear an array of 
complaints of threats and dismissals related to the 
presidential recall referendum signatures.  The labor 
representatives showed poloff a list of several hundred 
workers of the Guyana Corporation of Venezuela (CVG) that is 
reportedly being used by a new office in the state-run 
corporation charged with identifying petition signers.  CTV 
Executive Secretary Antonio Suarez told of a new hire at the 
Ministry of Education who was told she could not begin work 
until she went to the personnel office to file a complaint 
against the opposition for allegedly \"stealing\" her 
signature.  A hospital director in Falcon State reported that 
the GOV had circulated a list of health workers and their 
family members who had signed the petition.  The labor 
repreasentatives also linked the dismissal of some 17 
 
professionals of the Vargas State development corporation to 
the signing of the petition.  Workers unwilling to recant, 
they assert, have also been denied vacations, food stipends, 
and scholarships for their children as well.  A March 15 
press report also alleges that 200 Caracas Metro workers have 
been fired. 
 
5. (C) Unapetrol President Horacio Medina said threats had 
been renewed against PDVSA employees who signed.  PDVSA 
President Ali Rodriguez said during a press interview on 
March 15 it \"could not be discounted\" that a persecution 
campaign was underway in that state-owned oil company. 
Medina said a list at one PDVSA site in Caracas identifies 
employees who signed as \"traitors to the nation.\"  Some 834 
active employees and 1,200 contractors have been identified. 
Medina said they knew of 34 employees who have gone to the 
Attorney General\'s office to complain.  The lists reportedly 
identify some 5,000 retired PDVSA workers, whose continued 
pension payments have been threatened, according to the labor 
representatives. 
 
6. (C) The harassment is not limited to the GOV and state 
enterprises.  Pro-Chavez western Venezuela regional daily 
\"Diario Panorama\" Human Resources Manager Francisco Ferrer 
(protect), whose family has minority shares in Panorama, told 
IO March 13 that the GOV had asked Panorama to provide it 
with a list of Panorama employees and to cross-check the list 
with the list of presidential referendum recall petitioners. 
Francisco found that about 75 percent of Panorama\'s employees 
signed the petition.  He fears that the GOV will press 
Panorama to \"convince\" its employees to recant their 
signature or face unemployment.   While Panorama President 
Esteban Pineda is openly pro-Chavez (most interlocutors, 
including Ferrer, think Pineda\'s loyalty is driven by 
monetary interests, not by ideology), Ferrer opposes the 
Chavez government. 
 
---------------------------- 
Litmus Test For GOV Services 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The labor representatives cited several additional 
examples of pressure tactics in government services.  They 
said, for example, identity cards, which are necessary to 
vote, are often inexplicably delayed for people that signed 
the recall petition.  Foreigners, they claimed, were 
receiving express naturalization on the condition they not 
participate in a presidential referendum.  They said the 
enrollees in the GOV\'s unemployment program \"Mision Vuelvan 
Caras\" (\"Mission About Face\") are routinely cross-checked 
against the Tascon website.  The wife of a driver in the 
Embassy was told she was not eligible for a slot in a public 
university because she had signed the petition.  There have 
been allegations in the press that passports are also being 
withheld from signers, but anecdotal evidence indicates this 
problem is routinely circumvented by paying higher prices to 
facilitators. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Labor Groups Make Symbolic Stand 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The labor representatives noted that Labor Minister 
Maria Cristina Iglesias turned the table on them during the 
signature drive, arguing that anti-Chavez private companies 
threatened their employees into signing.  This latest round 
of threats, the labor representatives said, has primarily 
targeted contractors and untenured workers, who have been 
ostensibly fired due to \"restructuring.\"  Organized labor\'s 
response has thus far been limited to public denunciations. 
They hope to bring some cases before the Attorney General and 
Human Rights Ombudsman, though they believe that both 
institutions are subordinated to GOV politics and will not 
intervene. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) These firings and harassments complement the large 
fines assessed this week against opposition media, and the 
arrest warrant for opposition Baruta mayor Enrique Capriles. 
To be effective, the GOV\'s intimidation campaign needs to cow 
enough signers while not drawing a backlash of resentment 
during the appeals process.  We think it is likely, 
therefore, that the firings of mostly small pockets of 
workers will continue.  Obsessed with regime survival and 
willing to trample labor rights, the GOV may achieve some 
short-term goals with its strategy.  First, forcing recanters 
to file complaints with prosecutors supports President 
Chavez\'s allegations that the opposition fraudulently 
collected the signatures.  Second, the GOV will need to erase 
as many signatures from the opposition\'s petition as possible 
if there is an appeals process.  Third, it will make the 
bureaucracy more loyal, and more pliable, in the long run.

REF: CARACAS 00923 AND PREVIOUS 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (U) The Supreme Court (TSJ) Constitutional Chamber ordered 
the Electoral Chamber to stop all activity related to the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) March 17.  In a March 18 
letter, the Electoral Chamber reaffirmed its jurisdiction in 
the matter and refused to give up its files.  For its part, 
the CNE appealed the Electoral Chamber\'s March 15 injunction 
regarding the presidential recall referendum signatures in 
the in the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber March 17, alleging 
that order violated CNE autonomy as a separate governmental 
power.  CNE vice president Ezequiel Zamora, part of the 
opposition minority, said March 18 the CNE was obligated to 
follow the Electoral Chamber\'s order and schedule a 
presidential recall referendum.  Pro-GoV CNE director Jorge 
Rodriguez was hospitalized March 18 for hypertension. 
Justice Luis Martinez, the vice president of the TSJ 
Electoral Chamber, issued a public statement March 18 
denouncing the March 15 ruling, and attacking his fellow 
Electoral Chamber justices as politically motivated.  The 
apparent deadlock in the court now leaves little room for a 
legal solution that can satisfy the parties.  In the 
meanwhile, the presidential recall referendum is stalled. 
 
---------------------- 
Dueling Court Chambers 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) The feud between Chambers of the Supreme Court of 
Justice (TSJ) continued March 17, as three justices from the 
court\'s Constitutional Chamber ordered the Electoral Chamber 
to stop all activity on legal actions related to the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) and signatures seeking a presidential 
recall referendum (reftel).  As authority, the Constitutional 
Chamber cited its own opinion, issued in December 2001 in a 
separate case, in which it declared itself competent to hear 
cases having to do with the CNE.  The March 17 pronouncement 
also ordered the TSJ\'s Electoral Chamber to transfer files 
having to do with the CNE case.  In a March 18 letter sent to 
the Constitutional Chamber, Justice Alberto Martini, the 
president of the Electoral Chamber, reaffirmed his Chamber\'s 
legal authority to settle electoral matters and refused to 
transfer any files in the pending CNE case.  Martini also 
questioned the legitimacy of the Constitutional Chamber\'s 
March 17 order, saying it was signed by only three members of 
the five-judge chamber when four are required under court 
rules to form a quorum. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CNE: We\'ll Follow All Court Orders, But... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) The CNE filed an appeal in the TSJ\'s Constitutional 
Chamber March 17, alleging that the Electoral Chamber\'s March 
15 order regarding signatures for a presidential recall 
referendum violated CNE autonomy as a separate governmental 
power.  In a public announcement, Francisco Carrasquero the 
CNE\'s pro-GoV president, said the legal action was necessary 
to ensure the CNE remains the \"final authority for all 
electoral issues.\"  Carrasquero tempered his earlier comments 
regarding the March 15 ruling, by saying he was a \"man of 
laws\" and would therefore follow all orders of the court.  He 
insisted, however, that the Constitutional Chamber was the 
appropriate forum for any questions regarding the CNE. 
(Note: Carrasquero did not address the arguments raised by 
the Electoral Chamber, the opposition and by constitutional 
scholars, who point to Article 298 of the Venezuelan 
constitution, which says all questions regarding the CNE will 
be settled in the TSJ\'s Electoral Chamber.  End Note.) 
Carrasquero also denied that the referendum process was being 
delayed, saying \"nothing is paralyzed.\"  Carrasquero said he 
expects the process will continue once the Constitutional 
Court issues a final ruling. 
 
4. (U) Ezequiel Zamora, the CNE pro-opposition vice 
 
president, responded March 18, saying the CNE was obligated 
to follow the March 15 order of the TSJ\'s Electoral Chamber, 
add the more than 870,000 signatures at issue to the total 
verified, and schedule a presidential recall referendum. 
Zamora said he and CNE director Sobella Mejias did not agree 
with Carrasquero\'s decision to appeal the Electoral Chamber 
March 15 ruling.  Zamora also hinted he may take the place of 
pro-GoV CNE director Jorge Rodriguez at a March 19 meeting 
with opposition leaders scheduled to negotiate the terms of 
an appeals process.  Rodriguez was hospitalized March 18 for 
treatment of hypertension. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Dissenting Electoral Justice Lashes Out 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Justice Luis Martinez, the pro-GoV vice president of 
the TSJ Electoral Chamber, issued a public statement March 18 
denouncing the Electoral Chamber\'s March 15 ruling regarding 
signatures for a recall referendum, and attacking his fellow 
Electoral Chamber justices as politically motivated. 
Martinez\'s statement was carried as a paid, full-page 
advertisement in the major Caracas daily newspaper El 
Universal and in the pro-GoV daily tabloid Vea.  (Note:  El 
Universal sources told the Embassy press section that such an 
advertisement cost over 18 million bolivares, or 
approximately $9,000 usd.  End note.) 
 
6. (U) Martinez did not refer to any legal basis for his 
argument, but instead leveled a personal attack on his 
colleague Justice Alberto Martini, the Electoral Chamber 
president.  Martini, he said, had written a \"disgraceful\" 
decision, filled with \"serious falsehoods\" designed to 
support his personal political preferences.  Martinez\'s paid 
announcement said Martini\'s decision was beneath the dignity 
of a court chamber president, and could qualify as \"serious 
and criminal behavior.\"  Martini also set out his alternative 
policy argument, suggesting that the CNE was correct to send 
more than 870,000 signatures for additional consideration 
rather than validating them. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
7. (U) The GoV is pulling out the stops to obscure the legal 
issues and to raise questions of propriety in regard to rival 
sections of the Supreme Court.  It is worth noting that each 
argument raised by GoV operatives is a mirror of complaints 
lodged by opposition lawyers against the GoV.  When the smoke 
clears, the GoV still enjoys a narrow majority in the CNE, 
the TSJ\'s Constitutional Chamber, and the National Assembly, 
and will likely be able to block any opposition appeal in the 
TSJ sitting en banc.  Any eventual solution, therefore, will 
 
SIPDIS 
need to be the result of a political agreement rather than 
from a judicial decree.  In the meanwhile, the presidential 
recall referendum is stalled.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Carmen Alguindigue, the former number three prosecutor 
in the Attorney General\'s Office, said March 17 she was fired 
for refusing to support the Chavez political agenda.  The 
increasing number of politically-motivated firings in 
government will further weaken the nation\'s institutions, she 
said.  She said Vice President Jose Vincente Rangel \"was 
lying\" March 16 when he declared that no human rights 
complaints had been lodged with law enforcement groups, but 
she understands that prosecutors have taken little or no 
action to look into the allegations of human rights abuses. 
Alguindigue\'s firing is an example of further weakened 
Venezuelan institutions, and the GoV consolidating power 
throught non-executive branch institutions.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Prosecutor Pushed Out For Resisting Chavez Line 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C) Carmen Alguindigue, former Chief of Procedural Action 
for the Attorney General\'s Office (Fiscalia), and a long-time 
contact of the Embassy\'s NAS, PAS and Legatt sections, told 
poloff March 17 that she was fired February 18 as part of a 
sweep against top Fiscalia managers who resisted policy 
decisions supporting the Chavez political agenda (reftels). 
Alguindigue, who held the number three slot in the Attorney 
General\'s Office, said she had been warned personally by 
Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez to \"find ways to cooperate\" 
with GoV directives, and Rodriguez routinely called to press 
her to make decisions on cases effecting GoV interests. 
While she didn\'t confront Rodriguez, or defy him outright, 
she said it became more and more obvious that she was not 
following his instructions.  The decision to dismiss her, she 
said, was obviously politically motivated.  Rodriguez made 
the decision, but Alguindigue is sure there was pressure from 
GoV officials like Vice President Rangel. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Political Firings Weaken Institutions 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Alguindigue worked as a prosecutor for six years, 
including during the events of April 2002.  She viewed 
herself as part of a new group of prosecutors who recognized 
their institutional role in the government, and who worked to 
keep the institution transparent, independent and responsible 
under the law.  She asserted that the increasing number of 
politically-motivated firings in government will further 
weaken the nation\'s institutions, which are already weak 
under Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Few Human Rights Investigations Due to GoV Pressure 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (C) Alguindigue also was in charge of overseeing 
investigations into alleged GoV human rights abuses.  She 
said Vice President Jose Vincente Rangel \"was lying\" March 16 
when he declared that no human rights complaints had been 
lodged.  She noted that Rangel\'s list of law enforcement 
agencies did not include the Attorney General\'s Office, which 
is the central authority for human rights investigations. 
Nevertheless, she understands from her contacts in the 
Attorney General\'s Office that prosecutors have taken little 
to no action to look into the many human rights abuses.  The 
GoV, she said, has effectively closed the investigating 
institutions. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
 
 
-------- 
 
5. (C) Alguindigue\'s departure from the Attorney General\'s 
Office is yet another brush stroke in the bleak portrait 
being painted of weakened Venezuelan institutions and a GoV 
increasingly consolidating power in the executive.  Her 
absence is likely to reduce the chances of opening 
investigations into alleged human rights abuses and their 
effective prosecution.

LEADERS HOPE TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO A PLEBISCITE AGAINST 
CHAVEZ, THOUGH IN-FIGHTING IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PRESENT 
A BROAD FRONT AGAINST THE GOV.  IF THE PRESIDENTIAL RECALL 
REFERENDUM GOES FORWARD IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD, THE 
OPPOSITION WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AGAINST PRO-CHAVEZ 
CANDIDATES, AND VICE VERSA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
REGIONAL ELECTIONS AUGUST 1 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) ELECTIONS FOR VENEZUELA\'S GOVERNORS (23 STATES PLUS 
THE CARACAS FEDERAL DISTRICT MAYOR) AND MAYORS (335 
    MUNICIPALITIES) ARE SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE AUGUST 1. 
REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATES BEGAN MARCH 16 AND ENDS MARCH 30 
(CANDIDATES MUST FILE BY MARCH 23).  THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL 
COUNCIL (CNE) ANNOUNCED MARCH 16 THAT INCUMBENTS RUNNING FOR 
RE-ELECTION WOULD NOT NEED TO RESIGN THEIR POSITIONS TO 
CAMPAIGN, THOUGH MINISTERS OR ELECTED OFFICIALS RUNNING FOR A 
DIFFERENT OFFICE MUST RESIGN UPON ANNOUNCING THEIR 
CANDIDACIES.  THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) IS 
PRESSING FORWARD WITH THE ELECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE 
PENDING PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM, WHICH THE OPPOSITION 
HOPES THE CNE WILL CONVENE BEFORE AUGUST. 
 
------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION UNITY INTACT FOR NOW 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) OPPOSITION GROUPS HAD BEEN SPLIT OVER WHETHER EVEN TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE REGIONAL ELECTIONS GIVEN THE CNE\'S 
QUESTIONABLE HANDLING OF THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS. 
THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA (CD) ANNOUNCED MARCH 18, 
HOWEVER, THAT OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. 
THE NOTICEABLE HOLDOUTS REMAIN PROYECTO VENEZUELA (PV), 
HEADED BY HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER, AND PRIMERO JUSTICIA (PJ). 
MOVEMENT TO SOCIALISM (MAS) PRESIDENT FELIPE MUJICA TOLD 
POLOFF MARCH 18 HE SAW BOTH PARTIES COMING AROUND TOWARD 
PARTICIPATION.  CAUSA R LEADER ANDRES VELASQUEZ TOLD POLOFF 
MARCH 19 IT WOULD NOT BE LOGICAL FOR ONLY ONE PARTY TO 
BOYCOTT, ESPECIALLY PJ, WHICH WOULD LOSE THE KEY MAYORSHIPS 
OF CHACAO AND BARUTA IN METROPOLITAN CARACAS. 
 
4. (C) MUJICA SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS A CHANCE 
    TO TURN THE REGIONAL ELECTIONS INTO A PLEBISCITE AGAINST THE 
GOV.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE OPPOSITION WOULD NEED TO 
FIELD SINGLE CANDIDATES IN EACH RACE TO OPPOSE THE PRO-CHAVEZ 
CANDIDATE.  HE SAID THE OPPOSITION IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING 
A \"SERIOUS ERROR\" BY PERMITTING SEVERAL OPPOSITION PARTIES TO 
REGISTER CANDIDATES.  HE SAID THAT SALAS ROMER WILL NOT 
COORDINATE CANDIDACIES WITH OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND PJ, 
TRYING TO MAINTAIN ITS IMAGE AS A NON-TRADITIONAL PARTY, HAS 
RESISTED COLLABORATING THE CD ON THIS POINT.  HE BELIEVES 
PJ\'S DEARTH OF CANDIDATES AROUND THE COUNTRY, HOWEVER, WILL 
MINIMIZE HOW THE DIFFERENCES ARE RESOLVED. 
 
5. (C) VELASQUEZ SAID IT WAS \"CRAZINESS\" FOR OPPOSITION 
POLITICIANS TO ACT ON PERSONAL AMBITION WHEN PRO-CHAVEZ 
CANDIDATES COUNT ON AT LEAST 30 PERCENT SUPPORT NATIONWIDE. 
FOR THIS REASON, VELASQUEZ, WHO IS A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
DEPUTY, SAID HE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF 
ANZOATEGUI OR BOLIVAR, WHERE HE SAYS HE HAS GOOD SUPPORT. 
MUJICA SAID THE PROBLEM OF IN-FIGHTING IS WORSE AT THE 
MAYORAL LEVEL, PREDICTING THAT, AT THE GUBERNATORIAL LEVEL, 
THE OPPOSITION WOULD WIN 18 OF 24 STATES. 
 
------------------------ 
 
CARACAS 00000949  002 OF 002 
 
OF THE CNE WAS NOT 
A REASONABLE EXCUSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS. 
 FRAUD OR MISHANDLING OF THE ELECTIONS, HE SAID, IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT IF IT OCCURS. 
PRIVATELY, MUJICA BELIEVES THE CNE IS COMPLETELY BIASED 
TOWARD THE GOV AND FURTHER DOUBTS THE CNE WILL BE ABLE TO 
ADMINISTER FAIR ELECTIONS.  VELASQUEZ REPORTED THAT HIS 
SOURCES WITHIN THE CNE SAID THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITY HAD 
CONSIDERED POSTPONING THE ELECTIONS UNTIL DECEMBER TO ALLOW 
MORE PREPARATION TIME.  CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE 
INSTITUTION REFUSED BECAUSE, VELASQUEZ ASSERTS, THE GOV WANTS 
THE ELECTIONS TO COINCIDE WITH THE REFERENDUM WITH THE HOPE 
OF DISTRACTING THE ELECTORATE. 
 
---------------------------- 
REGIONALS AND THE REFERENDUM 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) BOTH MUJICA AND VELASQUEZ AGREED THAT THE OPPOSITION 
STILL GIVES TOP PRIORITY TO THE REFERENDUM AND IS SQUARELY 
UNIFIED BEHIND IT.  BOTH AGREED THAT IF THE REFERENDUM DOES 
NOT GO FORWARD, IT WILL NEGATIVELY EFFECT THE OPPOSITION\'S 
    CHANCES IN GUBERNATORIAL AND MAYORAL RACES, ESPECIALLY IF 
PEOPLE BLAME THE OPPOSITION FOR THE RECALL\'S DEMISE. 
CONVERSELY, SAID VELASQUEZ IF A REFERENDUM IS HELD AND CHAVEZ 
IS RECALLED, THE CNE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO POSTPONE 
REGIONAL ELECTIONS UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS 
ARRANGED. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C)  THE OPPOSITION NEEDS WINS IN THE GUBERNATORIAL AND 
MAYORAL ARENA IF THE FIGHT WITH CHAVEZ DRAGS OUT TO 2006.  WE 
EXPECT THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO 
JOCKEY FOR CANDIDACIES, WITH THE LIKELY RESULT THAT THE 
OPPOSITION VOTE IN SOME RACES WILL BE SPLIT TO THE CHAVISTAS\' 
ADVANTAGE.  THE GOV IS HOPING THE OPPOSITION\'S INTERNAL 
CONFLICTS WILL LEAD TO A DECISIVE ELECTORAL BLOW AGAINST 
THEIR POLITICAL CAPITAL.  WE ALSO SEE THE CNE\'S LACK OF 
FAIRNESS IN THE VERIFICATION PROCESS AS A BAD OMEN FOR THE 
EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE REGIONAL ELECTIONS.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles Radonsky said March 18 
he will not present himself to the court as summoned until 
after he sees the case file alleging his involvement with a 
violent protest at the Cuban Embassy April 12, 2002.  The 
court has refused Capriles\' lawyers access to the case file 
and issued an arrest warrant for him March 16.  Although 
Capriles\' case predates the most recent opposition protests, 
he may be the first elected opposition leader to face charges 
in their aftermath.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Come Out With Your Hands Tied: Mayor Leery of GOV Justice 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (U) Prosecutor Danilo Anderson successfully petitioned for 
an arrest warrant March 16 for Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles 
Radonsky.  Capriles is accused of alleged criminal acts such 
as \"violating international principles, private violence and 
abuse of office\" during mob protests at the Cuban Embassy 
April 12, 2002.  Anderson argued that Capriles\' failure to 
respond to three summons issued November 28, 2002, January 6, 
2003, and March 7, 2003 made him a flight risk.  Judge Jose 
Ramon Flores (40th Control Court) granted the warrant later 
on March 16 and assigned it to the National Investigative 
Police (CICPC). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Good Cop/Bad Cop Prosecutor Plays Keep Away With Case File 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3. (U) Anderson outlined the alleged offenses to reporters 
March 17.  He denied Capriles was a political target and said 
the Mayor\'s attorneys should have access to his file to 
understand the charges.  He said the judge would bring 
representatives of the defense and prosecution together to 
determine if the charges were serious enough to detail 
Capriles pending trial.  Anderson later warned Capriles to 
turn himself in, and stated he didn\'t need to show Capriles\' 
attorneys his file before Capriles presented himself to the 
court. 
 
------------------------------- 
Mayor: Not Without My Case File 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Capriles told PolFSN March 17 that his attorney went 
the courthouse at 8 p.m. March 16 to inquire about the 
warrant, but the court was closed.  Capriles said he was 
waiting to hear what the charges against him are and that his 
attorneys were denied access to his file March 17.  Capriles 
attorney Arturo Lopez said March 18 that Capriles would 
present himself only after his legal team had complete access 
to his file.  \"We can\'t go to court with our eyes closed.\" 
Capriles called the case proof of \"the political persecution 
against those who do not share the government\'s vision\" and 
blasted Anderson as a political lackey of the GOV.  Justice 
First president Julio Borges told reporters March 17 the case 
is baseless and an attempt by the GOV to divert attention 
from the presidential recall referendum process. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Was the Mayor Peacemaker or Instigator? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) During the events of April 11-14, when President 
Chavez briefly lost power, an angry crowd gathered in front 
the Cuban Embassy in Baruta looking for a pro-GOV leaders 
suspected of hiding inside.  The crowd damaged embassy 
vehicles and cut electricity and water lines.  Mayor Capriles 
told PolFSN he entered the Embassy to restore calm and 
disperse the crowd, but has been portrayed as instigating 
violence by the GOV-run television channel.  Newspapers at 
 
 
the time reported that Capriles, Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, 
and former Chief of the Metropolitan Police Henry Vivas went 
to the Cuban Embassy to determine if GOV officials were 
seeking asylum. 
 
6. (U) The Cuban Embassy in Caracas released a statement 
supporting the investigation and denying Borges\' contention 
that Cuban Ambassador German Sanchez Otero asked Capriles to 
mediate April 12, 2002, and had praised him for doing so.  It 
also asserted that \"terrorist and fascist groups\" vandalized 
the Embassy while Capriles\' police watched, under orders not 
to interfere.  Capriles responded to the Cuban note saying 
the Ambassador lacked \"the honesty to say what really 
happened.\"  Capriles contended he was only guilty of having 
differences with the GOV. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The GOV has long had Capriles in its sights.  In the 
Capriles case, Anderson is in his mettle as GOV hatchet man 
(refs).  If the case he is pressing against 24 residents of 
Merida who also have not had access to their files for civil 
rebellion charges is any indication, a prompt resolution to 
the Capriles case is not the offing.  In the meantime, it 
serves the GOV to have a new high-profile \"fugitive from 
justice\" against whom to rail.  The investigations against 
opposition leaders, regardless of when the alleged misdeeds 
occurred, also fits into the GOV\'s strategy of blaming the 
opposition for violence. 
 
8. (C) That said, we do not have sufficient information at 
this time to evaluate the GOV and Cuban allegations against 
Capriles. 
 
-------------------- 
Ambassador\'s Comment 
-------------------- 
 
9. (C) Anderson may have done Mayor Capriles a favor by 
making him a hero.  If he were to turn himself in to 
\"Bolivarian justice,\" Capriles\' political future would be 
assured and the opposition would have a cause celebre.  That 
said, Venezuelan jails are miserable and one would be crazy 
not to hesitate before turning oneself in.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) A new, expanded Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) board 
was announced on March 12.  The change is not likely to have 
any near term effect upon operations.  The board, the ninth 
named in the five years of the Chavez government, will 
continue to be led by Ali Rodriguez and will have three vice 
presidents with specific corporate responsibilities, two 
internal directors and three external directors.  One of the 
three newly-named board members is Jose Rojas, a 
well-respected former Finance Minister and Venezuelan 
representative to the Inter-American Development Bank.  In 
other PDVSA news, there are reports that the photos of 
company personnel who signed in favor of a referendum on the 
Chavez presidency will be posted as \"enemies of the 
revolution.\"  Some senior employees may be fired while others 
will be denied bonuses or raises unless they repudiate their 
signatures, according to a former senior PDVSA official 
aligned with the opposition.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
YET ANOTHER NEW BOARD 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) On March 12, Minister of Energy and Mines Rafael 
Ramirez announced the appointment of yet another new board 
for Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela,s state-owned 
oil company.  The board, the ninth named in the five years of 
the Chavez government, has been expanded to ten members and 
will now include:  Ali Rodriguez, President; Vice Presidents 
Jose Rojas, Felix Rodriguez and Ivan Hernandez; internal 
directors Dester Rodriguez and Nelson Martinez; and external 
directors Luis Vierma, Nelson Nunez, Rafael Rosales and 
Victor Alvarez_. 
 
3. (U) Jose Rojas, Ivan Hernandez and Victor Alvarez_ are the 
new members of the Board.  Jose Rojas served as Finance 
Minister from 1999-2001 and then served for two years as the 
Venezuelan representative to the Inter-American Development 
Bank.  Ivan Hernandez is currently General Manager of the 
Paraguana Refining Complex.  Hernandez had previously retired 
from that post and was requested to return during the 
December 2002 strike to lead the effort to re-start 
Venezuela\'s largest refinery complex.  Victor Alvarez_ 
formerly held positions as Vice Minister of Industry and 
President of the state-owned Foreign Commerce Bank.  He has 
also served as the Venezuelan representative to the FTAA 
negotiations.  We do not yet know if this appointment will 
affect that assignment. 
 
4. (U) In what has been announced as yet another 
reorganization of PDVSA ) but is, in fact, virtually a 
return to the corporate structure in place in December 2002 
) the three Vice Presidents will have specific corporate as 
opposed to regional management responsibilities.  Jose Rojas 
will manage finance; Hernandez will manage national and 
international refining; and Felix Rodriguez, originally 
appointed to the board in 2003 as manager of the so-called 
western production area, will now manage national exploration 
and production. 
 
----------------------------- 
BUT UNREST CONTINUES IN PDVSA 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) In other PDVSA news, Jorge Kamkoff, PDVSA\'s Senior 
Vice President at the time of the December 2002 oil strike, 
informed econoff that 33 percent of current PDVSA staff in 
Caracas, 65 percent in the western operational area, and 48 
percent in the east are reported to have signed petitions in 
support of the referendum on Chavez\'s presidency.  According 
to Kamkoff, any senior executives who signed may well be 
dismissed from the company but the number of lower ranked 
signatories is too large to warrant dismissal.  Instead, 
PDVSA personnel have been told that they will not receive a 
planned March bonus or a salary increase due to go into 
 
effect in April unless they repudiate their signatures.  In a 
more activist mode, we have been told that members of the 
\"Bolivarian circles\" are posted outside PDVSA,s Caracas 
headquarters with copies of the signature list.  Kamkoff 
added that there are reports that photos of people who signed 
will also be posted around PDVSA and named as \"enemies of the 
revolution.\"  Kamkoff characterized this as the continuing 
effort by lower lever PDVSA true believers to get rid of 
personnel who have not shown sufficient revolutionary fervor. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) There have been rumors of changes in the PDVSA board 
for some time now.  In fact, given that these rumors included 
speculation that representatives of the Ministries of 
Infrastructure and Planning and Development would be put on 
the board, the announced changes are somewhat better than we 
had expected.  While the board retains military and union 
representations, the only non-oil industry additions are 
finance professionals.  Jose Rojas, in particular is well 
thought of and has ample financial experience.  This may lead 
to much needed improvements in the financial controls of the 
company.  On the other hand to the extent that the board has 
oil sector professionals in it, they are men who are invested 
in the political objectives of the Chavez \"revolution.  This 
is not a board that is likely to spur expansion of PDVSA\'s 
own production.  In the end, political control is more 
important than unleashing the industry.  PDVSA is 
increasingly an off-budget cash cow for various GOV \"social\" 
(read electoral) missions.  Over the next six months, at a 
minimum, we think this is likely to be a top priority for 
Chavez, and that this board will give him what he wants. 
Finding the money may be the task of the finance 
professionals now on the board. 
 
7.  (C)  We would also note that PDVSA remains uncomfortably 
placed as Chavez threatens the use of an \"oil weapon\" in any 
confrontation with the USG.  After first raising it in his 
February 27 speech ref (a), he sounded a milder note in the 
signing ceremony for the award of the Deltana Platform 
natural gas concession to ChevronTexaco (ref b).  However, in 
a March 13 interview with the New York Times, he stressed 
that he would not accept any effort to remove him by force 
and that this would lead to the price of oil rising to $50 
dollars per barrel.  While Chavez may be uncomfortable with 
Venezuela\'s close oil ties to the U.S., there is no near to 
middle term alternative for Venezuela.  Indeed, according to 
press reports, Ministry of Energy and Mines Vice Minister for 
Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma (an old PDVSA hand) while in 
Wshington spoke of deepening the bilateral energy 
relationship and of increasing Venezuela\'s refining capacity 
in the U.S.  Amidst these contradictory signals, and with the 
current priority being for PDVSA to produce short-term 
revenue at the expense of new investment either in Venezuela 
or elsewhere, we see the new board as incapable of 
undertaking major new managerial initiatives to put the 
troubled giant back on its feet.

SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CLOSE-UP: DETENTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (B 
) AND (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The GOV has detained hundreds of individuals since 
February 27 on charges ranging from \"violent behavior\" to 
civil rebellion.  The detentions share certain 
characteristics, including little concern with the detainee\'s 
relation to the alleged charges, beatings and torture while 
in National Guard (GN) custody, denial of medical attention, 
denial of due process, and forcing detainees to sign 
statements absolving the GN of allegations of mistreatment, 
all of which violate rights guaranteed in the Venezuelan 
Constitution.  In spite of the number of violations confirmed 
by human rights NGOs, the GOV maintains that it has not 
committed human rights violations.  Examples of specific 
violations are at paragraph 9.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Article 44: Personal Freedom is inviolable. 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) According to statistics from the Democratic 
Coordinator (CD), security forces detained nationwide 410 
people associated with the opposition during the February 
27-March 5 period.  Of those 410, approximately 195 were 
still being held as of March 17, according to composite lists 
drawn from the CD, the media, and NGOs.  According to the 
human rights NGO PROVEA, many of the detentions share certain 
characteristics, including little concern with the detainee\'s 
relation to the alleged charges, beatings and torture while 
in National Guard (GN) custody, denial of medical attention, 
denial of due process, and forcing detainees to sign 
statements absolving the GN of allegations of mistreatment, 
all of which violate rights guaranteed in the Venezuelan 
Constitution. (Note: We believe that PROVEA, which initially 
supported the Chavez Government but which over time has 
distanced itself from the GOV, has shown itself to be an 
independent minded, principled organization.  Like other 
serious human rights groups, it laboriously documents cases 
through interviews, collection of any physical evidence, and 
cross-checking data with other human rights NGOs.  It also 
assists victims in filing an official complaint of the 
alleged abuse.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The Real Charge?  Presumed Opposition to Chavez 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (U) A variety of sources, including NGOs, the media, and 
anecdotal accounts circulating via internet, suggest that the 
link between the detainee and the charge on which the 
detention is based is usually tenuous at best.  Detainees 
have been demonstrators, spectators, and individuals 
unrelated to any opposition event.  Opposition sources admit 
that some demonstrators are armed, but NGO records show no 
general trend of arresting demonstrators for illegal use of a 
weapon.  According to PROVEA, charges range from engaging in 
violent behavior to civil rebellion, and some detainees have 
been held and released without charges. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Article 46: Entitlement to respect for physical, mental, and 
moral integrity. 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (U) In a majority of detentions, Venezuelan authorities, 
principally the GN, allegedly beat and tortured persons in 
custody.  While human rights NGOs are documenting the alleged 
abuses, PROVEA has confirmed 103 cases of torture and/or use 
of excessive force as of March 12.  Specific alleged actions 
include punching, kicking, beating with helmets and weapons, 
electric shock torture, burning, forced inhalation of tear 
gas, humiliation, and death threats.  On March 17, the Forum 
for Life, an umbrella group for human rights NGOs, publicly 
condemned alleged abuses by the security forces, and strongly 
criticized President Chavez for praising the work of the GN. 
Congratulating such behavior while failing to denounce human 
rights violations, the group said, will only increase future 
violations and cement the GOV\'s culpability for them.  Human 
 
rights organizations also note that in addition to 
allegations of torture and mistreatment, injured detainees 
were at times denied medical attention. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Article 49: Right to due process. 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Detainees and their representatives have consistently 
accused the GOV of failing to ensure that due process rights 
are observed.  They allege that the authorities do not ensure 
the right to notify others of the detention, nor the right to 
legal counsel.  They also charge that special protections for 
minors were disregarded in some cases.  Authorities also 
frequently demanded that detainees sign statements absolving 
the GN of allegations of mistreatment.  By doing so, the 
detainee cedes his right to a fair hearing of his case. 
According to PROVEA, this occurred at the time of release and 
even as the detention continues. 
 
----------------------------- 
Violations?  What Violations? 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Despite NGO documentation of serious human rights 
abuses since February 27, Vice President Rangel asserted that 
\"there are no human rights violations, there are no 
disappearances, no torture cases,\" during a March 16 press 
conference.  Rangel recognized only nine deaths in political 
disturbances (the opposition claims 14) and insisted that 
none of the nine died at the hands of the National Guard. 
(Note: VP Rangel may be correct about Guard involvement.  The 
fact is, however, that military and political police (DISIP) 
forces, as well as armed civilians loyal to President Chavez, 
confronted demonstrators.)  He also maintained that no one 
had made an official complaint regarding any of the 
detentions. 
 
-------------------- 
Oh, THOSE Violations 
-------------------- 
 
7. (U) Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez announced the 
opening of 11 abuse complaint investigations (nine in 
Caracas, two in Zulia State) March 9 and denied accusations 
that his office was not addressing the complaints seriously. 
He said that some alleged victims had not yet formulated and 
filed their complaints. 
 
8. (C) Diego Urdaneta told poloff March 17 that he filed an 
abuse complaint with the Attorney General\'s Office March 4, 
alleging that he was beaten by the National Guard.  During 
the process, he made an official statement and reported to 
the state police (CICPC) forensics specialist for a medical 
examination.  The physician examined him and took notes but 
did not photograph his injuries nor ask what caused them. 
The employee who took Urdaneta\'s statement urged him to admit 
uncertainty about the identity of his attackers, even though 
he had seen clearly the GN logo on their vehicle and 
uniforms.  Urdaneta\'s case was assigned to prosecutor 
Gilberto Venere.  Venere\'s secretary told Urdaneta that his 
complaint was the 12th received so far, but that no further 
complaints were to be accepted.  A few days later, the 
secretary told Urdaneta that some prosecutors had been fired 
 
SIPDIS 
because they had accepted complaints after the cut-off date. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
Examples of Alleged Violations 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (U) Carlos Eduardo Izcaray, cellist and conductor with the 
Venezuela Symphony Orchestra, was arrested March 1 while 
observing demonstrations in the Altamira neighborhood of 
Caracas.  Izcaray said the GN beat and tortured him with 
electricity, then threatened to kill him. 
 
- Reverend Dorindo Burgo was swept up with other 
demonstrators in Altamira February 29, even though his most 
provocative behavior appears to have been reading from the 
constitution to the National Guard.  He was beaten, then 
asked to sign a statement absolving the GN of responsibility 
for beating him as the condition for his release.  Burgo 
 
claims he initially refused to sign, then changed his mind 
due to the \"lack of value for signatures\" in Venezuela. 
 
- David Rubio, an opposition spokesperson, was intercepted by 
state police in San Cristobal, Tachira State the evening of 
February 29 while driving home with companions.  He was kept 
incommunicado throughout the night.  He was permitted to 
contact his lawyers the next morning, but authorities did not 
inform the lawyers of the charges against him until the 
following day.  He is charged with civil rebellion and 
obstructing a public thoroughfare, though he was uninvolved 
in any opposition event at the time of his detention. 
 
- Diego Urdaneta, son of a US citizen, told poloff that on 
March 1, the GN kicked and beat him with batons and other 
weapons and also threatened to kill him, then let him go. 
 
- Pedro Martin claims the GN shot him with a plastic bullet 
February 27, then waited four hours before sending him to a 
hospital. 
 
- National Guardsmen in Carabobo State shot demonstrator 
Pedro Jose Sanchez March 4, then took him to the local GN 
headquarters, rather than to a hospital.  Sanchez died from 
lack of medical attention. 
 
- Alejandro Valera was beaten and shot by the GN on February 
27, then placed in a \"cage\" for four hours. 
 
- On March 1, 17 demonstrators were detained in Yaracuy 
State, including five minors.  The state children\'s rights 
officer filed a negligence complaint against the case 
prosecutor for failing to order medical exams for the minors 
who were allegedly tortured by the GN. 
 
- In Zulia State, demonstrator Pedro Rodriguez was detained 
and beaten by the GN, then required to sign a statement that 
negated the beating.

COMMENT

9. (C) Brutality at the hands of the National Guard and other 
security forces is not new in Venezuela.  The Chavez 
Government will likely continue playing down the alleged 
abuses, even while claiming to be the most democratic regime 
in Venezuelan history.  Human rights organizations, however, 
are keeping track.  Probably one of the most difficult tasks 
they face -- beyond even getting the government to 
acknowledge the cases -- is helping the victims document 
their cases.  They are making some headway, but impediments 
such as the limitations placed by the Attorney General\'s 
Office will continue to make things difficult.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The violence that hit Venezuela February 27 to March 
4 unmasked the radical bent of President Hugo Chavez\'s 
revolution, Caracas Mayor Alfredo Pena and Governors David De 
Lima (Anzoategui) and Luis Lippa (Apure) told the Ambassador 
March 16.  They noted the influence of Cubans in the 
Venezuelan security forces institutionally and in De Lima\'s 
case, in the violence aimed at the opposition.  The three 
also acknowledged the difficulties the opposition faces 
entering the regional elections, especially competing 
candidacies and possible government harassment using 
prosecutions.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) The Ambassador hosted the most recent of his periodic 
dinners with Venezuelan Governors March 16.  Caracas Mayor 
Alfredo Pena and Governors David De Lima (Anzoategui) and 
Luis Lippa (Apure) attended. The three Chavista governors 
regretted (no surprise there).  The smaller group meant that 
Pena was more expansive than usual.  PolCouns and Conoff 
accompanied Ambassador. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Demonstrations February 27-March 4 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador asked about their perspective of the 
demonstrations that occurred February 27-March 4.  The three 
guests said they believed that the disturbances revealed the 
radical bent of President Hugo Chavez\'s revolution.  Lippa 
said Apure had been relatively quiet during those days.  The 
governor attributed this to his having coordinated with the 
local National Guard commander.  One anomaly, Lippa noted, 
was that some of the National Guard troops he encountered on 
duty did not appear to be from Apure.  He confirmed that the 
government had had to move troops around the country to cover 
needs, and a contingent had been sent from Apure to Caracas. 
 
4.  (C) De Lima said the GoV had not moved troops from 
Anzoategui because they had been needed there.  The state is 
too much of a problem for Chavez, De Lima said.  The greatest 
problem in Anzoategui had been the government\'s use of armed 
civilians against demonstrators (ref A), the governor 
asserted.  He said the Anzoategui police has identified 470 
members of these armed groups.  They receive weapons and 
tactical training from Cubans, De Lima asserted.  He also 
charged that the Cubans lead some of the groups which 
attacked middle-class neighborhoods in Anzoategui cities (not 
further specified). 
 
5.  (C) Metropolitan Caracas Mayor Pena recounted that prior 
to the February 27 opposition March, the Minister of Interior 
had asked him to contribute Metropolitan police forces to 
help control the demonstrators if needed.  Pena said he 
refused because, under the GoV plan, the MP would have formed 
the first line of confrontation.  He had issued the permit 
for the march to end at Plaza Morales, so how, he asked, 
could he use his own police to stop the march short of that 
goal?  He told the group that the GoV had wanted to repeat an 
April 2002 scenario so that when violence erupted, the 
Metropolitan Police would be blamed for deaths.  Pena said he 
instead chose to deploy the Metropolitan Police along the 
march route to protect the opposition demonstrators. 
 
------------------------ 
Revolutionary Commitment 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) De Lima and Lippa commented on the changes in 
attitude they had witnessed in Venezuela\'s authorities.  De 
Lima illustrated recounting an incident which occurred when 
his daughter was stopped by National Guardsmen while driving 
 
 
with a friend in early March.  Anzoategui State police 
attempted to resolve the matter, but could not.  The Governor 
went to the location to intervene, and after some verbal 
wrangling, which the Governor said he exploited because a 
friendly crowd had gathered, he attempted to move the vehicle 
himself.  The Guardsmen reacted by aiming their loaded 
weapons at him, and reiterating that only on orders from 
their General would they let him pass.  De Lima said he was 
impressed by their animosity, contempt for him and their 
overt commitment to Chavez\'s revolution.  Both he and Lippa 
commented that the new attitude is the result of Cuban 
training aimed at making the first and second lieutenants 
identify \"with the process.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Opposition Unity and Regional Elections 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Opposition governors are now meeting regularly, the 
three reported.  The principal topics for the week\'s meeting, 
they said, was what to do about competing opposition 
candidacies as the deadline for filing (March 23) approaches. 
 The three concurred that the biggest concern was the 
possible impact of going into the races with various 
candidates for an individual position.  Lippa noted that his 
old party, Democratic Action (AD), continued to function as 
in the past, attempting to control candidacies from Caracas. 
He said, for example, they were still supporting candidacies 
of persons with little popular support, including his rival 
in Apure, because of their history with the party.  The three 
also concurred that the opposition eventually would come to 
agreement on the majority of the candidacies.  (Note: AD has, 
in fact, inscribed a candidate in Apure to run against Lippa 
and the MVR candidate.) 
 
8.  (C) Lippa noted that another obstacle the opposition 
faces in proceeding with the candidacies for the regional 
elections is GoV intimidation using the threat of criminal 
charges.  (On March 15, Caracas newspapers reported that that 
the Comptroller\'s Office had begun investigations into 
alleged malfeasance by Lippa, Pena and a number of other 
elected opposition officials.)  As they discussed the issue, 
Pena received a call advising him that a detention order had 
been issued for Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles (ref B).  The 
three asserted that the GoV\'s intent was to disqualify them 
legally, and politically. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The news of the opposition governors meeting 
regularly, and having a forum where to discuss relevant 
issues, is welcome.  The need for such a mechanism had been 
among the topics of discussion in earlier governors\' dinners 
with us.  The focus on the on the violence during the 
demonstrations on this occasion reflected how the theme 
dominated discussions among Venezuelans in the wake of events 
that have left more than a dozen dead, numerous injured and 
detained, and a black mark on the GoV\'s human record. 
 
10.  (C) The opposition governors and mayors are, in fact, 
important factors in resisting President Chavez\'s ideas for 
controlling all Venezuelan institutions.  It is difficult to 
imagine what Venezuela would be like today if mayors and 
governors were still appointed, as was the case prior to 
1989.  We are adjusting our AID and PAS activities to put 
more emphasis on federalism and decentralization.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV attempted to supersede negative international 
media and NGO reports about alleged human rights violations 
by speaking directly to the international community in 
Caracas March 14 and 16.  Among the efforts, President Hugo 
Chavez called together Ambassadors to Venezuela March 5 and 
then European Union Ambassadors March 18 to refute the human 
rights allegations and to criticize the opposition\'s 
signature drive to unseat him.  International organizations 
and NGOs criticized the GOV\'s handling of a proposed 
presidential recall referendum before GOV security forces 
clashed with protesters from February 27 to March 5.  Most 
recently, the differences aired with a letter from the OAS 
regarding National Electoral Council (CNE) assertions of 
international bias.  Other criticism emanated from the EU and 
regional human rights organizations (see para 8).  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
GOV Counterattacks International Critics 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On March 16, the GOV responded to alleged &big lies8 
of GOV human rights abuses and unfair manipulation of the 
presidential recall process with a briefing for the 
international community headed by Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel.  \"There is not one violation of human rights in this 
government,8 Rangel asserted.  \"We would be the first to 
denounce it (human rights abuses), not the hypocrites and 
liars who always violated human rights in the past,\" Rangel 
said.  He blamed armed civilians for the deaths of nine (vice 
12) protesters and claimed that the accounts of high 
casualties, missing protesters, and GOV torture are a media 
invention.  The purpose of the meeting, Rangel asserted, was 
to counter alleged media and NGO misinformation because \"we 
are certain one of our problems is how information is 
disseminated internationally.\"  He later admitted the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights\' (IACHR) &campaign 
against the government8 is having an effect on international 
opinion and blasted Human Rights Watch as clueless 
bureaucrats. 
 
3. (C) Appearing with Rangel, National Assembly Deputy Luis 
Tascon explained the opposition\'s alleged &mega-fraud8 in 
the process to convoke a recall referendum on President Hugo 
Chavez.  He claimed the pro-GOV observers were not allowed to 
do their jobs during the opposition\'s signature drive, 
resulting in large numbers of signatures being forged.  He 
said the proof of fraud would &fill this room,8 but 
presented only a handful of examples.  Rangel later assured 
the GOV would allow a recall, but not under conditions of 
opposition trickery or violence.  Any attempt to overthrow 
Chavez &illegally8 would fail, he said, because the GOV is 
more powerful and organized than April 11, 2002, when Chavez 
was briefly deposed. 
 
4. (U) During his weekly televised program, March 14, Chavez 
also denied that the government had abused human rights and 
accused members of the opposition for protest-related deaths. 
 \"There is no proof (of human rights violations), and if 
there was, you know that my government would investigate.\" 
Chavez said that his government \"was forced to act to defend 
the Constitution, the law, and about all, public safety.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Redirecting Blame to a Familiar Target: U.S. 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Chavez blamed the U.S. for Venezuela\'s problems during 
a March 5 address to the Diplomatic Corps, prompting DCM to 
walk out.  The harangue was a repeat of his February 29 
speech to a demonstration of his followers. In response to 
the March 11 EU Parliament resolution on Venezuela, Chavez 
 
 
summoned the European Union Ambassadors on March 18.  A Dutch 
diplomat told PolCouns that President Chavez verbally 
attacked the Ambassadors.  The diplomats thought they were 
going to have an opportunity to discuss the recent events 
with the President when Chavez dismissed the press a few 
minutes after the meeting began.  Chavez, however, then began 
a multi-hour monologue, criticizing European attitudes as 
fascist and warning the Ambassadors that if their countries 
were going to behave like the U.S. they could expect similar 
treatment.  One key element in both events was Chavez 
exhorting the ambassadors to tell their foreign ministries 
the truth, i.e. the Chavista version of events in Venezuela. 
 
6. (U) Chavez had previously attacked domestic human rights 
NGOs during his February 15 weekly televised program.  Chavez 
accused three prominent and respected Venezuelan human rights 
NGOs (Cofavic, Provea, and Red de Apoyo) of collaborating 
with the Washington-based Center for Justice and 
International Law to \"threaten a legitimately established 
government.\"  He claimed the NGOs received funds from the US 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which he accused of 
being a tool for USG meddling in Venezuelan politics. 
Cofavic and two other Venezuelan organizations denounced 
Chavez\'s statements as \"a threat to the work of human rights 
organizations in Venezuela.\"  Amnesty International agreed in 
its February 18 statement and demanded Chavez retract the 
allegations. 
 
------------------------------------- 
International Criticism: Human Rights 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) --The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
(IACHR) released a report March 18 that covers events up to 
October 2003.  It identified a \"clear weakness\" in 
institutions, criminal impunity, and a growing concentration 
of power in the executive. 
 
--Human Rights Watch criticized the GOV\'s denial of human 
rights violations March 14, stating that testimony and 
evidence collected by group prove National Guardsmen are 
\"unquestionably\" guilty of torture, including electrocutions 
and burnings.  Jose Miguel Vivanco also blamed \"agents of the 
state\" for nine deaths and warned the Chavez administration 
that it was \"grave danger\" of losing its democratic 
legitimacy.  He added that the majority of the detained were 
set free and denied any knowledge of \"forced disappearances.\" 
 
--On March 12 the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) 
accused the GOV of systematic violations of freedom of 
expression and press and of attacking any media that \"doesn\'t 
bend to his (Chavez\'s) conditions,\" which provokes attacks 
from Chavez supporters.  It also denounced the GOV\'s 
noncompliance with a \"constitutional, democratic and 
electoral solution\" to Venezuela\'s political crisis and 
expressed concern about recent Supreme Court statements 
discounting the authority of international institutions and 
the \"absolute right\" of freedom of expression. 
 
--The IACHR included Venezuela in a list of five American 
countries with serious human rights concerns March 12.  It 
reiterated concerns about protest related deaths, injuries, 
and detentions. 
 
--On March 8, Reporters Without Borders requested the 
government condemn attacks on journalists and order an 
investigation of 10 alleged attacks on journalists by GOV 
forces since February 27. 
 
--On March 6, the International Society for Human Rights and 
the Andrei Sakharov Foundation, two prominent European NGOs, 
issued a communique criticizing the GOV for \"subterfuges and 
false arguments ... historically used by other despots that 
ended up killing millions of human being with the sole 
purpose of perpetuating themselves in power.\"  The statement 
calls for international public opinion to \"categorically 
reject\" the GOV\'s human rights abuses. 
 
--Human Rights Watch March 5 urged \"a thorough investigation 
into allegations that state security forces have beaten and 
abused detained protesters.\"  The statement also raised 
concerns about opposition vandalism and violence and urged 
 
 
both sides to pursue peaceful avenues of reconciliation. 
 
--On March 3, Reporters Without Borders protested the failure 
of the GOV to prevent attacks on about a dozen journalists 
since February 27, implying that GOV security forces were to 
blame.  \"If the media take sides against President Chavez, on 
occasion outrageously, this can still never justify the use 
of force against their reports.\" 
 
--A March 4 statement from Amnesty International criticized 
the GOV for \"excessive use of force and detentions.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
International Criticism: Recall Referendum 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8. (U) --OAS Observer Mission Chief Fernando Jaramillo 
released a letter March 19 responding to March 18 comments 
from National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero criticizing the OAS and Carter Center electoral 
observers as biased toward the opposition.  The letter 
outlined the OAS observer mission based on the May 29 
agreement, the OAS\'s objective and successful history 
observing electoral processes, and the GOV\'s invitation to 
observe the petition campaign and the verification process. 
Jaramillo asked the CNE President to share proof of OAS bias 
and state that the OAS observation delegation would leave 
Venezuela if asked to do so by the CNE. (Note: On March 23 
Jaramillo met with the CNE for a very tense two hours.  The 
CNE majority said the OAS/TCC were biased by applying 
independent criteria to the verification process. They did 
not, however, ask the OAS/TCC observers to leave.) 
 
--On March 15, the Group of Friends of Venezuela released a 
communique to express its concern about delays in the recall 
process.  They released a similar statement March 5. 
 
--The European Union March 4 lamented the protest violence 
and expressing solidarity with the OAS\'s March 2 opinion that 
the CNE was using technicalities to force signatures into a 
revalidation process. 
 
--The OAS and Carter Center released a joint statement March 
2 expressing disagreement with the CNE\'s decision to send 
over 800,000 recall signatures to a revalidation process. 
 
--The European Union expressed its concern over the delay of 
the signature authentication process February 23.  In a 
statement, the EU welcomed the CNE\'s February 28 deadline for 
completing the process and emphasized \"the will of the 
signers must be respected.\" 
 
---------- 
Conclusion 
---------- 
 
9. (C) The GOV is struggling to repair significant damage to 
its international human rights reputation.  The GOV\'s 
wholesale denial of guilt amidst a plethora of charges makes 
it look ludicrous and disdainful.  The occasional handful of 
\"mega-fraud\" examples thrown out by Chavez and Tascon are 
mega-insignificant and are often errors the opposition admits 
to and included in its internal audit.  The GOV\'s blaming of 
the opposition for \"attacking itself\" and allegedly forging 
870,000 signatures, only worked to unite a recently fractious 
network of domestic human rights NGOs.  Complete text of many 
of the referenced statements from NGOs and international 
organizations can be found at the Caracas SIPRNet site:

1.  (C)  Information Officer traveled March 10-14 to 
Barquisimeto, Lara state to seek private media views on 
freedom of expression and on the state\'s economic and 
political landscape.  Most private media owners and 
managers maintain a low profile and present both pro- 
Venezuelan government (GOV) and opposition views in this 
nominally pro-Chavez state.  Many media outlets avoid 
confrontation because they rely on government advertising 
to keep afloat, and attacks on journalists and media 
installations are less frequent than in Caracas.  In spite 
of Barquisimeto\'s relatively tranquil facade, its residents 
are not immune to political confrontations, high 
unemployment from business failures, and threats that they 
will lose their jobs if they do not toe the Bolivarian 
revolutionary line.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
The Who\'s Who of Lara Media 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Information Officer (IO) traveled March 10-14 to 
Barquisimeto, the capital of Lara state, to meet with 
private print and broadcast media and solicit their views 
on freedom of expression and on the economic and political 
landscape.  Most private media owners and managers told IO 
that, because both Governor Luis Reyes Reyes and 
Barquisimeto Mayor Henri Falcon are MVR activists and 
Chavez confidants, they maintain a low profile and present 
both pro-GOV and opposition views on their pages and in 
their programs.  While some media owners and editors 
asserted they provide balanced coverage based on sound 
journalistic principles, others admitted that economic 
interests drive their decision.  They noted that private 
advertising had plummeted following the failure of hundreds 
of local businesses and industries and many media outlets 
relied on city, state and central government advertising to 
keep afloat. 
 
3.  (C)  Of Barquisimeto\'s three leading dailies, the 
largest and oldest is hundred-year-old \"El Impulso,\" with a 
declared circulation around 60,000.  Its owners are the 
Carmona family.  Juan Manuel Carmona senior is President 
and his son Juan Manuel Carmona, with whom IO met, is 
Executive Vice President and an architecture professor at 
the Universidad Central (UCV) branch in Barquisimeto.  The 
family is related to Pedro Carmona, who proclaimed himself 
President in April 2002.  In part because \"El Impulso\" has 
other business ventures that subsidize lost advertising 
revenues, the paper regularly challenges the Chavez 
government in its editorials and general coverage. 
However, the paper takes a softer approach towards the 
governor and mayor, courting them to obtain state and city 
advertising, he explained. 
 
4.  (C)  The opposition-leaning Sigala and Gomez Tamayo 
families own the second oldest paper, \"El Informador.\" 
Founded in 1967, its declared circulation is 35,000.  The 
paper prides itself in remaining out of the political fray, 
likely helped in part by Information Director Altidoro 
Gimenez, who is pro-Chavez, and according to one 
interlocutor, the leader of one of the city\'s Bolivarian 
Circles.  Gimenez said the paper focuses on local news of 
social and economic interest.  In response to IO\'s 
provision of information on Embassy Caracas and Department 
web sites and other USG materials, he expressed particular 
interest in receiving material on health, education, 
economic, and sports topics, as well as anything on visa 
application procedures. 
 
5.  (C)  Nine-year-old tabloid daily \"Diario Hoy\'s\" owners 
are the Montes de Oca (father of President Rafael Montes de 
Oca is Pepe Monte de Oca, a former interior minister during 
the Luis Herrera Campins presidency) and Gimenez families. 
Its declared circulation is 35,000.  The families also own 
regional television channel Telecentro (para 7).  The 
paper, which targets C, D, and E socio-economic classes 
(working class, poor, and extreme poor), prides itself for 
its objective, balanced reporting, as evidenced, Rafael 
 
Montes de Oca asserted, by one page each dedicated to pro- 
GOV and opposition views.  There are no \"Talibanes\" 
(radicals) in our paper or television station, he asserted. 
Largely steering clear of contentious political debate, the 
paper features sports, lottery results, and criminal 
incidents.  National, state, and local ads were 
commonplace, the bread and butter of the paper, explained 
Montes de Oca. 
 
------------------------------- 
Regional TV Seeks a Local Niche 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Of Lara\'s two prominent regional television 
stations, Promar, which maintains a close news-sharing 
affiliation with national 24-hour news station Globovision, 
has suffered the most from attacks by GOV sympathizers, 
according to Promar President Jorge Kossowsky.  In December 
2002, armed Chavez sympathizers attacked Promar facilities 
with three explosive devices and several volleys of 
ammunition (IO observed a number of bullet holes in 
Promar\'s the front windows).  Since then, Promar had 
constructed a bunker-like steel-plated facility in front of 
its installations to buffer any future attacks.  According 
to Kossowsky, Promar had determined a \"fifteen-minute 
rule,\" whereby the television station needed to defend 
itself from an attack for fifteen minutes before security 
forces could arrive on the scene.  Despite the occasional 
run-ins with the government, Promar gets some government 
advertising; Governor Reyes and Mayor Falcon appear on 
Promar programs and the channel covers their events. 
Kossowski expressed interest in increasing the Promar\'s use 
of USG programming and suggested that a 24-hour USG channel 
would be beneficial for Promar and other regional stations. 
 
7.  (C)  Lara\'s second largest television station, 
Telecentro, which is owned by \"Diario Hoy\'s\" Montes de Oca 
and Gimenez families, covers Lara, Yaracuy, Portuguesa, 
Cojedes states and parts of Falcon and Trujillo.  The 
owners pride themselves in the station\'s balanced 
reporting.  Governor Reyes Reyes, pro-opposition Yaracuy 
Governor Lapi, and Mayor Falcon have weekly programs on 
Telecentro.  Daily program, \"Contrapunto\" (counterpoint), 
includes the views of pro-GOV and opposition participants. 
State and local government ads are ample.  UNICEF recently 
awarded a prize to the station for its excellent children\'s 
programs, said Montes de Oca.  The worst enemy of the 
opposition had been the biased national private media, 
whose extreme stance against Chavez had served to fuel his 
regime rather than discredit it, opined Montes de Oca 
senior.  The media should focus on the facts and restrict 
its opinion to its editorial columns, he added. 
Telecentro\'s biggest challenge was monetary; the channel 
found the cost of access to international news feeds, such 
as CNN, Reuters, or BBC too expensive for its budget.  IO 
gave the station details on access to Worldnet and AETN 
channels. 
 
-------------------------- 
The Challenges of Cable TV 
-------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Media firm Intercable, with 70 percent U.S. 
investment (Hicks News) and the remaining investment 
primarily Argentine and Israeli, is struggling to survive 
in the state as it expands its operations in Caracas and 
other parts of Venezuela.  Intercable President Mario 
Seijas (who is also president of the National Radio and 
Television Chamber and former Vice Minister of Agriculture 
during the Ramon Velasquez government) noted that 
Intercable\'s primary challenges are to obtain dollars from 
the GOV exchange control agency, CADIVI, to pay its debt 
and to compete with local and foreign cable firms, about 
220 who operate illegally and who are not subject to 
stringent U.S. IPR and other laws.  (Note: Seijas claimed 
that Colombian narco-dollars funded many of these illegal 
firms.  End Note.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
Frank Discussion with Radio Chamber 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  In IO\'s meeting with thirteen members of the Lara- 
Yaracuy Radio Chamber, including President Victor Ferrer 
 
(O.K. FM 101.5), the members explained that representatives 
from 33 of 36 licensed radio stations in the two states 
belong to the Chamber.  The 17 illegal stations and three 
licensed pro-Chavez stations members did not participate, 
explained Ferrer.  An ironic touch was that, while licensed 
stations were forced to broadcast President Chavez\'s and 
other GOV nationally televised \"cadenas,\" the illegal 
stations, most of which were pro-Chavez were not.  Illegal 
stations were also exempt from paying taxes and licensing 
fees, he added.  Typical programming on some of the illegal 
\"community\" stations, many which Ferrer alleged received 
support from telecom regulatory agency CONATEL, included 
instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails and to seize 
a company\'s installations. 
 
10.  (C)  Chamber members highlighted their frustration in 
maintaining good relations with Governor Reyes Reyes. 
Ferrer noted that during the only meeting the Chamber had 
held with the Governor, Reyes Reyes had taken the 
opportunity to blame the media for the rise in crime and 
kidnappings and for provoking political violence. 
(Comment: Intercable President Seijas told IO that the rash 
of kidnappings in Lara had abated late last year after five 
kidnappers were killed during the rescue of the daughter of 
a wealthy rancher.  Among the dead were two policemen, who 
were reportedly the ringleaders and had a list of targeted 
ranchers and their families, alleged Seijas.  End Comment.) 
Though attacks on radio stations were rare, two incidents 
occurred in December 2002, one on FM 106 and the other on a 
station in Lara\'s second largest city, El Tocuyo.  To date, 
the authorities had not investigated these cases.  Ferrer 
added that the lack of access to dollars through CADIVI 
posed another challenge, but despite these threats and 
limitations, the radio stations were determined to operate.

The CNP Keeps an Eye on Freedom of Expression 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  According to Colegio Nacional de Periodistas 
(CNP) Lara branch President Nolberto Herrera, a confessed 
ex- Chavez militant, most Lara media outlets avoid direct 
confrontation with the state and city governments, largely 
out of monetary interests, as state and local governments 
are the primary advertisers.  Even so, occasionally the 
state and local government would accuse private media of 
waging a disinformation campaign against the Chavez regime 
and his state and local government supporters in Lara. 
That said, journalists usually had regular access to the 
governor\'s and mayor\'s events, which enabled the media to 
provide more balanced reporting.  Threats against 
journalists were more sporadic and less aggressive, e.g., 
graffiti against journalists or brief detentions and 
inspections at police and military checkpoints, than those 
occurring in Caracas, with a few exceptions (paras 6 and 
8).  In response to the state and local government\'s 
passive-aggressive approach to local media, many 
journalists wore bulletproof vests and practiced self- 
censorship to avoid outright confrontation with the 
government, explained Herrera. 
 
12.  (C)  According to Herrera, government administrative 
actions against the media were also less common in Lara 
than in Caracas.  The one prominent legal case was Lara 
former state security chief (Ret.) Major Arnaldo Certain\'s 
2002 defamation suit against \"El Impulso\'s\" managing 
editor, Jose Angel Ocanto.  During the March 11 meeting 
with the CNP, news arrived of the local court\'s ruling in 
favor of Ocanto for lack of evidence.  \"El Impulso\'s\" 
Carmona told IO that Ocanto had not accused Certain of 
corruption and that he had merely compiled information from 
a number of sources that linked Certain with acts of 
corruption when Certain was director of Maiquetia 
International Airport. 
 
------------- 
A Bit on Lara 
------------- 
 
13.  (C)  Located in central-northwest Venezuela and with a 
population of around 800,000, Barquisimeto is the fourth 
largest city in Venezuela.  With a total population of over 
1.5 million (according to 2001 census; current estimates 
 
range from 1.8 million to over 2 million), Lara is the 
fifth most populated state in the country.  Lara serves as 
a commercial, communications, transportation, and migration 
crossroads for central and western Venezuela.  Its economic 
activities include small and medium manufacturing 
industries, agriculture, and meat and dairy production. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Commercial, Industrial and Unemployment Woes 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  Barquisimeto\'s wholesale foodstuffs center, 
MERCABAR, serves as a distribution hub for western and 
central Venezuela.  Its industrial base has not been so 
fortunate, however. Once a thriving center for small and 
medium industries, the city\'s three industrial zones were 
now on the verge of collapse, according to Chamber of 
Commerce president Lino Palencia.  He said that Lara\'s 
unemployment was over 20 percent, and 40 percent of the 
employed work in the informal sector.  With the closing of 
over 65 percent of the companies, many laborers had moved 
to the informal sector to eke out a living.  Others were 
still working in the formal sector but only part time, he 
explained.  According to Radio Chamber members, high 
unemployment and underemployment levels were exacerbated by 
the government\'s hiring of thousands of temporary laborers 
and teachers, who received no benefits and whose employment 
continuity depended on their loyalty to the national, 
state, and municipal governments.  Workers were told that 
if they signed the presidential recall petition, they would 
lose their jobs, alleged Ferrer. 
 
15.  (C)  The owner of a once-thriving foundry told IO that 
he had reduced his employee pool from 45 workers to 10 in 
the past two years.  Yet he was fortunate to have an 
industry that had survived; about two thirds of the firms 
in his industrial park (Industrial Zone 1) had shut down, 
he said.  He described the zone as a ghost town, roads were 
so rutted that the only access was by four-wheel drive; 
electrical service was sporadic and one of the most 
expensive in Venezuela.  Leading U.S. firms, including 
Nabisco and Proctor and Gamble, were also downsizing, 
according to Chamber of Commerce board members.  Proctor 
and Gamble had reduced its presence and Nabisco was down to 
half-day operations in comparison to three full shifts a 
few years ago. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Lara: Laboratory for the Revolution 
----------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C)  A large number of Lara residents traditionally 
supported leftist ideologies, according to \"El Impulso\'s\" 
Carmona; thus initial support for Chavez was 
understandable.  With its governor and all nine mayors 
belonging to pro-Chavez parties, Lara had become one of the 
Chavez revolution\'s principal laboratories, opined Carmona, 
a view echoed by a number of the other media interlocutors. 
Over 350 Lara residents had already returned from social 
worker training in Cuba; another 120 had recently departed 
for Cuba, he said.  Flights departed from the air base to 
and from Cuba on a daily basis; the governor traveled 
regularly to Havana.  According to Carmona and Seijas, 
about 3,500 Cubans were present in Lara; the Cubans worked 
as medical practitioners, sports trainers, social workers, 
and security advisers. 
 
17.  (C)  FM radio station owner Gelly Del Moral, whose 
daughter is married to one of Governor Reye\'s assistants, 
and who had a particularly contentious interview with then 
President-elect Chavez in December 1998, recounted an 
incident that sheds light on the complexity of Lara\'s 
political loyalties and affiliations.  Police detained and 
then jailed former Social Movement Party (MAS) Mayor 
Macario Gonzalez for his participation in an anti-GOV 
demonstration in early March.  He told Del Moral that, 
contrary to his fears the other prisoners would attack and 
perhaps try to kill him, they welcomed him with open arms, 
urging him to continue his fight against the Chavez regime. 
Meanwhile, as Del Moral attempted to persuade the police to 
release Gonazlez, several of the officers, even some with 
\"the stern semblance of chavistas,\" approached her and 
confided that they opposed Chavez and respected her 
journalistic efforts to challenge the government. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Political Inclinations 
---------------------- 
 
18.  (C)  Despite the prominence of Chavez loyalists in the 
state and local governments, media owner Kossowski opined 
that only about 10 to 12 percent of Lara\'s population was 
die-hard pro-Chavez.  He estimated that an additional 20 to 
25 percent supported Chavez out of self-interest. 
Unequivocal opposition support was probably less then 20 
percent; the remainder of the population favored a regime 
change but it was not convinced that the formal opposition 
under the Democratic Coordinator (CD) had either the 
leadership or the agenda to offer the population a viable 
alternative that was neither chavista nor elitist.  \"El 
Impulso\'s\" Carmona decried the passive stance of most of 
Lara\'s opposition, commenting that their idea of 
participating in a march was at home seated comfortably in 
front of a television, glass of scotch in hand. 
 
19.  (C)  Local support for Governor Reyes Reyes had also 
declined, according to Carmona; only around 44 percent of 
the population favored the governor.  Mayor Falcon\'s 
support was around 68 percent, estimated Carmona, largely 
because the mayor had beautified Barquisimeto; mere 
cosmetic touches, but visible to the public eye.  (Comment: 
A July 2003 University Fermin Toro poll (1,470 respondents; 
3.5 percent margin of error) conducted in the greater 
Barquisimeto area, produced similar results to Carmona\'s 
assertions.  Almost 60 percent of the respondents said they 
would vote against President Chavez in a recall referendum; 
31 percent would support Chavez; and 9 percent were 
undecided.  About 59 percent either did not support or had 
nothing positive to comment on Governor Reyes Reyes.  Over 
70 percent of the respondents either supported or had no 
negative comment on Mayor Henri Falcon.  End Note.) 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Students - A New Force to Reckon With 
------------------------------------- 
 
20.  (C)  According to a number of interlocutors, almost 20 
percent of Barquisimeto residents are students at one of 
the city\'s eleven institutions of higher learning. 
Barquisimeto has surpassed Merida as the country\'s leading 
university city.  (Note: Merida\'s Binational Center 
Director estimates that about 26,000 students study at 
Merida\'s principal university, the University of the Andes 
(ULA) and that the city of Merida\'s population is about 
250,000.  End Note.)  \"El Impulso\'s\" Carmona and Promar\'s 
Kossowsky underscored what they termed the reawakening of 
the city\'s university population following the late 
February early March opposition and student demonstrations 
and the especially brutal crackdown -- including assault, 
unlawful detentions, torture, and murder -- on students in 
Caracas and in Carabobo, Merida, Tachira, Zulia, and other 
states.  Following these incidents, students approached the 
local media and requested a forum to express to views 
against alleged GOV brutality.  According to Carmona, 
Kossowsky, and other media owners, media outlets were now 
printing student articles and interviewing student leaders 
on talk shows.  \"El Impulso\'s\" March 8 editorial was 
titled, \"Youth\'s Triumphant Return,\" in recognition of 
student protests against the National Electoral Council\'s 
(CNE) alleged theft of the Venezuelan people\'s right to 
conduct a recall referendum against President Chavez. 
Venezuelan university student participation in Venezuela\'s 
political process would turn the tide in favor of the 
opposition, predicted Carmona. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
21.  (C)  Notwithstanding its relatively tranquil facade, 
Lara\'s media and other sectors have not been immune to 
political confrontations and tensions.  On March 15, 
Molotov cocktails were lobbed at pro-opposition Democratic 
Action Party (AD) headquarters in Barquisimeto. 
Retaliatory threats against government workers who signed 
the presidential recall petition are also commonplace. 
According to the Radio Chamber, Reyes Reyes has threatened 
 
 
to fire 18 state-run electrical company (ENELBAR) mid and 
upper-management employees, who had signed the recall 
petition unless they retract their signatures.  Though 
nominally a pro-Chavez state, much of the loyalty in Lara 
appears to be merely \"employment-deep,\" driven in part by 
economic interests rather than a commitment to Chavez\'s 
Bolivarian revolution.  With a large and increasingly 
active university student population, recently awakened to 
the country\'s political crisis and by the targeting of 
students by GOV security forces, student partnership with 
the private media suggests Lara\'s days of relative calm may 
be numbered.  End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Opposition and pro-government candidates are 
registered for the August 1 regional elections as the 
registration period closed March 25.  At stake are 23 
governors, the high mayor of the metropolitan Caracas 
district, 336 mayors, and hundreds of municipal council 
positions -- in sum, the last part of state administration 
not totally controlled by President Hugo Chavez.  The 
National Elections Council (CNE) has already appointed some 
190,000 poll workers to support the 10,580 election tables. 
The CNE next publishes the candidate lists and rules on 
objections to candidate applications by May 5.  Given the 
CNE\'s track record on the presidential recall referendum, 
whether a fair and transparent electoral process is possible 
is a prime question for the opposition.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
609 Elected Positions Up For Grabs 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Political parties are engrossed in the candidate 
selection process for the August 1 elections for governors, 
mayors, and other state and municipal officials.  In all, 609 
elected positions will be filled:  23 governors, the mayor of 
the Caracas federal district, 336 mayors, and 269 state and 
federal district council members.  Governors and mayors are 
elected by plurality to a four-year term and may be 
re-elected once.  The seven- to fifteen-member state 
\"legislative councils,\" which have limited legislative powers 
and budgetary oversight, are elected to four-year terms 
through both direct and proportional elections.  The Caracas 
federal district also elects a 13-member council.  States 
with indigenous populations are required to have one 
indigenous person on their respective councils. 
 
3. (C) The CNE plans to mount 8,344 voting centers throughout 
Venezuela (see ref b).  These centers will represent 10,580 
tables, 7,689 of which will be automated using 19,000 
election machines.  Jorge Tirado, whose U.S.-based company 
Smartmatic is helping the CNE organize the elections, told 
poloff March 24 that the CNE will try to consolidate tables 
so that some will use up to three machines.  About 90,000 
poll workers will be selected for election duties, Tirado 
said, with six or more workers assigned to a table, depending 
on size. 
 
4. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) reported on March 
26 it had received applications from 140 gubernatorial 
candidates and thousands of mayoral candidates.  After a 
period for objections and appeals, the CNE will finalize the 
candidate list on May 5.  Currently, the CNE plans to print 
the ballots on June 15, according to Tirado  (Note: 
Electoral laws do not specify a date by which a gubernatorial 
or mayoral candidate may withdraw.  Presumably, candidates 
who plan to pull out and throw their support to another would 
have to do so prior to June 15 to withdraw their names from 
the ballot.).  Election laws limit the campaign period from 
60 days before the election (in this case, June 2) to 48 
hours before the opening of the polls on August 1. 
 
-------------------------- 
On International Observers 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The CNE has not announced publicly whether they will 
invite international observers for the regional elections. 
Accion Democratica (AD) official Luis Emilio Rondon told 
poloff March 24 the opposition will request the presence of 
observers.  OAS Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo told the 
Ambassador on March 24 that Rodriguez wants OAS/TCC as well 
 
as UN observers for the regional elections. 
 
---------------- 
CNE Working Hard 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Rodriquez described the candidate registration process 
to reporters as \"absolutely normal\" with no reports of 
irregularities in the registration process.  Smartmatic\'s 
Tirado claimed to poloff that his consortium is \"running\" all 
aspects of the election.  Tirado asserted that he regularly 
advises Rodriguez on the elections, though he admitted 
Rodriguez does not always follow the advice.  (Note: Tirado 
mentioned he plans an election simulation for June 27.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The GOV is focusing on regional elections not so much 
as an alternative to the referendum, but rather to 
consolidate its power in the one area where it still lacks 
full control.  We expect the CNE, therefore, to dedicate its 
full attention to organizing the regional elections.  We also 
expect the CNE to show the same kind of pro-GOV biases during 
these elections as it has demonstrated with the referendum. 
International observation will be critical to ensuring a 
reasonably fair and transparent election. 
 
8. (C) Regional elections are linked to national issues, but 
local conditions intervene as well.  For the opposition, the 
key questions are can they winnow out competing opposition 
candidates to truly contest Chavez\'s candidates, and will the 
CNE play fair.  The MVR\'s challenges are the strength of some 
of the opposition candidates, and the extent to which Chavez 
can transfer his strength to the candidates, many of whom are 
old military colleagues.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Opposition political parties have registered their 
candidates for the August 1 gubernatorial and mayoral 
elections (ref b) despite criticism from opposition NGOs that 
see the elections as a distraction from the recall referendum 
against President Hugo Chavez.  Opposition parties largely 
portray their participation in the elections as a plebiscite 
against Chavez, asserting that defeat of the pro-Chavez 
candidate will be their priority.  The opposition reached 
agreement on 10 of 23 gubernatorial candidates, and 
opposition representatives expect front-runners, behind which 
opposition forces will coalesce, will emerge in most races 
once the campaigns begin.  A win for the opposition in these 
races would set the stage for the 2005 National Assembly 
elections, and, of course, for the 2006 presidential 
elections.  For the opposition, the key questions are can 
they winnow out competing opposition candidates to truly 
contest Chavez\'s candidates, and will the CNE play fair.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Referendum As Campaign Issue 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The candidate registration process for the August 1 
gubernatorial and mayoral elections strained opposition 
unity.  NGOs within the Coordinadora Democratica (CD), most 
notably Gente de Petroleo, disagreed with the parties\' 
decision to present candidates, according to CD 
representative Daniel Thiman.  The NGOs argued that the 
elections would distract the opposition from the recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  Parties countered 
that the opposition could not risk surrendering the field to 
Chavistas in state and local governments, which are valuable 
assets to any political or electoral activities.  The parties 
registered their candidates despite serious reservations 
about the ability or good faith of the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) to administer the elections in light of the 
CNE\'s handling of the recall referendum. 
 
3. (C) Accion Democratica political secretary Luis Emilio 
Rondon told poloff March 24 that opposition parties were 
given no choice by the GOV but to move forward on the 
regional elections.  He said the opposition will continue to 
push for the referendum, noting that a recalled Chavez would 
damage the chances of pro-Chavez candidates.  Thiman told 
poloff March 25 the opposition would ramp up its referendum 
efforts shortly, though he did not have details on how the 
opposition would do this.  CD Spokesperson Pompeyo Marquez 
told reporters \"the referendum is to revoke Chavez and the 
regional elections are to defeat Chavismo.\" 
 
----------------------- 
All Politics Is Loyalty 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) Rondon asserted that the deciding factor in the 
regional elections would not be good governance or 
competency, but rather by devotion or opposition to Chavez. 
If opposition groups are able to make the elections about 
Chavez\'s administration, Rondon reasoned, it could be a 
powerful plebiscite against his rule.  He predicted the 
opposition could see a net gain in the number of governors 
and mayors.  Pro-Chavez Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy 
Ibrain Velazquez agreed the GOV could lose the regional 
elections in light of growing opposition strength in the 
states. 
 
------------------- 
 
 
Electoral Darwinism 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) Movement to Socialism (MAS) Secretary General Leopoldo 
Puchi told poloff March 26 the opposition had agreed on 
common candidates in ten states.  Puchi said even in states 
where the CD had negotiated common candidates, additional 
candidates registered to run.  Union President Francisco 
Arias, for example, registered for the governorship of Zulia 
state, where the opposition has backed sitting Governor 
Manuel Rosales.  Surprisingly, Union\'s board of directors 
withheld support from their party president (and founder) in 
the name of unity.  Gossip columns are replete with 
intimations that Arias is running at the behest of Chavez in 
order to divide the opposition vote.  Thiman said the CD 
expects the competition between opposition candidates will be 
short-lived as the campaigns gear up.  Venezuelan political 
culture does not favor underdogs, he said, and voters will 
rally behind the opposition front-runners against the 
pro-Chavez candidate. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Key Races:  Metropolitan Caracas A Must Win 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) One of the most important races for the opposition is 
the metropolitan Caracas mayoralty, currently held by former 
Chavez ally Alfredo Pena.  Rondon noted the importance of 
winning the Metropolitan Mayoralty as it controls the 
Metropolitan Police and grants permits for opposition 
marches.  Pena has the CD\'s support for a second term, though 
AD\'s Claudio Fermin is also running.  With the MVR candidate, 
National Assembly Deputy Juan Barreto, reportedly polling 30 
percent (he says 43 percent), having two opposition 
candidates weakens the opposition\'s chances. 
 
7. (C) Rondon calculated that a victory for the opposition 
would be measured in a net gain of governorships.  He 
highlighted Miranda State, where Governor Enrique Mendoza 
will face former Minister of Infrastructure Diosdado Cabello 
(who stepped down March 23 to run for office as dictated by 
election laws).  Carabobo is also key, where Henrique Salas 
Feo is taking on former National Guard Gen. Luis Felipe 
Acosta Carles.  Rondon was pessimistic over the opposition\'s 
chances in Aragua state east of Caracas, where moderate 
Chavista Didalco Bolivar enjoys substantial popularity. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The opposition political parties are behaving like 
political parties in their enthusiasm over the regional 
elections.  For them, the referendum and the regional 
elections are not mutually exclusive goals.  In fact, the 
referendum -- or lack of one -- will be a prime issue.  The 
major concern, of course, is whether the CNE, that for the 
opposition has shown it cannot be trusted, will be able to 
conduct a free and fair contest.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER PEREZ: RELATIONS COULD NOT GET 
WORSE 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Abelardo A. Arias for Reason 1.4(d) 
 
-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (C) In a March 23 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign 
Minister Jesus Perez said the relationship between the U.S. 
and Venezuela could not get worse.  Perez said there was a 
lot of fear in the GoV that the USG was planning to overthrow 
the Chavez regime.  The Ambassador told him that there is no 
USG plan to topple Chavez, but noted that relations could 
indeed get much worse unless Chavez tempers his anti-U.S. 
remarks, personal insults and invective.  The Ambassador said 
it was in the GoV\'s interest to speak with the USG so that we 
can understand their point of view.  The Ambassador 
reiterated that U.S. policy seeks a democratic solution and 
noted our concern that the GoV was slowly taking control of 
public institutions.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Could Relations Be Worse? 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On March 23, the Ambassador met with newly-installed 
Foreign Minister Jesus Perez for a frank and open exchange of 
views on U.S.- Venezuela relations.  The Ambassador brought 
up an interview with Perez published March 21 in the Caracas 
daily El Universal, in which Perez said the relationship 
between Venezuela and the U.S. \"could not be worse.\"  The 
Ambassador noted with surprise that this article included a 
version of the Ambassador\'s last conversation with Perez. 
The Ambassador stressed that diplomatic conversations are 
confidential.  He told the Foreign Minister that contrary to 
 
SIPDIS 
what Perez had told the reporter, bilateral relations could 
indeed get worse.  Relations, he continued, are bad because 
President Chavez appeared determined to use the U.S. as a 
foil to build his own domestic support. 
 
3. (C) Perez responded that he wanted to be transparent and 
honest and hoped to compliment the Ambassador by calling him 
disciplined.  He then backtracked somewhat and said the 
article misquoted him and distorted what he had told the 
reporter.  Perez said he hoped that he and the Ambassador 
could be \"sincere\" and solve whatever problems in the 
bilateral relationship the Ambassador saw needed improvement. 
 He recalled telling a colleague that the relationships 
between our governments are \"tense,\" but that he could \"speak 
to Shapiro as a man,\" not just as a government 
representative.  Perez noted that the rhetoric between 
Presidents Bush and Chavez was \"very hot,\" but the Ambassador 
and FM could speak with mutual respect.  Perez said his job 
was to work with the Ambassador to see ways in which they 
could improve matters between their countries. 
 
---------------- 
Fear of the U.S. 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) Perez said there was a lot of fear in the GoV that the 
USG was planning to overthrow the Chavez regime.  He pointed 
to Haiti, and said remarks by POTUS at the recent Summit in 
Monterey had not helped.  The Ambassador responded that there 
is no USG plan to topple Chavez, and that such rumors were 
only the product of a vivid imagination.  On the other hand, 
the personal insults and invectives hurled at the USG by 
Chavez in regular broadcasts are from the highest levels of 
the GoV.  The Ambassador listed personal attacks against 
President Bush, the Secretary and the National Security 
Advisor, insults that contained elements of racial slurs, or 
profanity, and suggestions that the Bush administration 
represented the activity behind the assassinations of Martin 
Luther King and President John F. Kennedy.  Perez said he 
thought relations could improve if the two presidents were to 
meet.  The Ambassador replied that it is most unlikely that 
President Bush would meet with someone who regularly insults 
him. 
 
 
5. (C) Perez distanced himself from Chavez\'s remarks, noting 
that he had been trained in Europe and was therefore 
unaccustomed to engaging in such displays.  Perez said that 
while he trusted Chavez implicitly, he recognized that Chavez 
was a military man who held the \"people in his heart.\"  Perez 
said it was his assignment, and that of the Ambassador, to 
communicate with their respective presidents and eliminate 
such excess language.  Perez said he believed in a stronger 
relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela in the future. 
But it was difficult now because the USG speaks with the 
opposition.  Perez also asserted that the U.S. is unpopular 
because of its international policies.  If the U.S. can talk 
with Libya, he added, then surely Venezuela and the U.S. can 
talk.  We have to solve this, said Perez, and not allow the 
press to invent problems between the two countries. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador told Perez the USG speaks with 
representatives of both sides and would continue to do so to 
gain a thorough understanding of the country.  The Ambassador 
noted that few from Chavez\'s ruling MVR party would speak 
with emboffs, but that was in spite of the USG continuing to 
extend invitations.  The Ambassador said it was in the GoV\'s 
interest to maintain contact with the Embassy so that we can 
understand their point of view.  If one reporting overly 
represents the views of the opposition it is because the GoV 
has ordered its officials and supporters to have to contact 
with the Embassy.  Perez acknowledged that the GoV has 
embargoed the Embassy. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Dynamics of the Bilateral Relation 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador said the press had not invented 
problems between the USG and the GoV.  Diosdad Cabello and 
A/S Noriega had agreed to avoid \"microphone diplomacy.\" 
Nonetheless, the GoV had almost immediately implemented a 
public relations campaign about alleged U.S. intervention in 
Venezuela.  The USG does not publicly respond to insults by 
Chavez because the issue is not a bilateral one, but a 
problem between Chavez and his Venezuelan opposition.  The 
USG policy is to support OAS Resolution 833, i.e., to find a 
peaceful, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution 
to the on-going crisis, and to support the on-going efforts 
by the OAS and the Carter Center in their roles as observers 
and facilitators. 
 
-------------------------- 
Democracy With an Asterisk 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The Ambassador concluded that our hope is that 
Venezuela will prosper in peace and democracy with an 
improving economy.  But this cannot be a democracy with an 
asterisk, where the GoV slowly takes control of public 
institutions, or where GoV officials including Chavez say 
that signing a petition permitted under the constitution is 
considered the equivalent of conspiring against the 
government.  Perez conceded that the GoV had overreacted and 
had in fact gone beyond the constitution.  But he justified 
those actions as the result of April 2002.  Just as the U.S. 
responded to September 11 by infringing somewhat on citizens\' 
rights, so too had the GoV responded to the \"coup\" of 2002 
and the \"economic sabotage\" of 2003. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Update on Approval for New Ambassador 
------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Ambassador asked for an update on the pending 
request for agreement for the new Ambassador.  Perez 
apologized for any delay and said the ministry bureaucracy 
had been very busy, but hoped the paperwork would be done in 
a week or so.  The Ambassador explained the internal process 
in the U.S. to confirm a nominated ambassador through the 
Senate, and noted that during an election year, the 
legislature would be out of session sooner than normal. 
Accordingly, getting the approval from Venezuela would be 
 
 
particularly helpful.  Perez agreed to look into it. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
10. (C) Perez speaks in platitudes and shows little 
understanding of the complexities of the U.S.-Venezuela 
governmental relationship.  He largely built his life in 
France, and peppers his conversation with references to his 
experience there, having little regional experience from 
which to draw.  He demonstrates a fundamental lack of 
understanding of the United States government and culture. 
He is, however, smooth, and so serves the GoV as a 
shock-absorber in the wake of the tough Chavez statements. 
It is doubtful that Perez will be a useful conduit to Chavez. 
 He has some access to Chavez-- he is said to be Chavez\'s 
half-brother or, if not, a childhood friend.  But it is 
unclear that Chavez will listen to him.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  National tax collection agency SENIAT has ordered 
Venezuela\'s four leading television channels to pay SENIAT 
almost USD 3.3 million in taxes for allegedly donated spots 
during the December 2002-February 2003 opposition-sponsored 
national strike.  Globovision, RCTV, Venevision, and Televen 
owners and legal executives assert that their respective 
channels have paid all required taxes and that the Venezuelan 
government (GOV) is punishing the media for criticizing the 
GOV.  The stations will appeal the SENIAT orders based on 
legal arguments that the spots were public service 
announcements, not donations, and thus exempt from taxes on 
donations.  Some business and media executives believe SENIAT 
probably has a case.  That said, everyone understands that 
the GOV is both punishing the opposition private media and 
issuing them a warning.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Fair Tax, or a Tax on Freedom of Expression? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)   On March 19, Venezuela\'s national tax collection 
agency, SENIAT, ordered Venezuela\'s four leading television 
channels to pay SENIAT almost USD 3.3 million in taxes 
(exchange rate BS 1,920 per USD).  SENIAT claims that these 
new taxes are for a number of  spots the channels donated to 
the opposition during the December 2002-February 2003 
opposition-sponsored national strike.  SENIAT is taxing 
national 24-hour news channel Globovision the equivalent of 
USD 1.1 million; Radio Caracas TV (RCTV) USD 1.0 million; 
Venevision USD 781,000; and Televen USD 302,000. 
 
3.  (C)  Globovision, RCTV, Televen, and Venevision 
executives assert that SENIAT\'s motives are political, a 
response to direct orders from President Chavez and 
Communication Minister Jesse Chacon to bankrupt these 
opposition-leaning stations if they refuse to toe the 
Venezuelan government\'s revolutionary line.  On March 19, 
RCTV President Marcel Granier accused the GOV of attempting 
to quash freedom of expression through the imposition of 
illegal and unfair taxes.  RCTV Legal Vice President Oswaldo 
Quintana told IO on March 22 that the GOV was trying to 
impose a non-existent tax against political pluralism, 
specifically to discourage any messages against the Chavez 
government.  Globovision manager Edith Ruiz opined that the 
SENIAT order was a tax on the freedom of expression. 
Televen\'s Corporate Vice President Enrique Alvarado blasted 
the SENIAT decision, terming it an unabashed political 
maneuver directed at pressuring the private media to stop 
supporting the opposition.  Venevision\'s Legal Vice 
President, Maria Ines Loscher, echoed Quintana\'s assertion, 
adding that this was the GOV inquisition\'s latest step 
against the media. 
 
4.  (C)  All four stations will appeal the SENIAT orders. 
According to Loscher and Quintana, the spots the channels 
provided were public service announcements, not donations, 
and therefore exempt from taxes on donations.  Further, if 
SENIAT were to insist that the spots were donations, while 
donations of material goods are subject to additional 
taxation in accordance with Venezuela\'s 1999 Law on 
Inheritance and Donations, donations of services are not 
taxable.  Even in the worst-case scenario, in which SENIAT 
persisted in terming the spots donations, and it ignored the 
fact that the spots were services rather than goods or 
property, according to the 1999 law, the recipients, not the 
donors, are expected to pay taxes on donations received, 
argued Quintana.  (Comment:  Quintana also acknowledged, 
however, that the donor must pay the donation tax if the 
beneficiary cannot pay it.  End Comment.) 
 
5.  (C)  According to Quintana and Loscher, SENIAT employees 
had started investigating the four channels about eight 
months ago, so this latest GOV maneuver did not come as a 
surprise.  Loescher explained that these spots had no 
commercial value.  Venevision granted the airtime in large 
part because few companies placed paid ads on TV during the 
strike.  Following SENIAT logic, announcements calling for 
blood or medicine donations would also be subject to 
taxation, opined Alvarado.  Further, to the station 
 
executives\' knowledge, SENIAT was not applying the same tax 
guidelines on state television stations Venezolana de 
Television (VTV) and VIVE TV; more reason to believe SENIAT\'s 
motives were political. 
 
6.  (C)  Globovision executive Edith Ruiz noted that the 
channels had also provided hundreds of hours of airtime for 
the GOV\'s public service announcements.  These included spots 
on the constitutional and constituent assembly referendum 
processes; for the national children\'s Foundations (Fundacion 
del Nino); national vaccination campaigns; Ministry of 
Defense social programs, among others.  SENIAT had not 
imposed a donation tax on any of these pro-GOV spots, claimed 
Ruiz.  To Quintana, it was clear that the GOV was exclusively 
targeting public service that it considered pro-opposition, 
including an hour-long December 2002 Mass for Peace during 
the height of the national strike. 
 
------------------- 
Another Perspective 
------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Though television owners and executives were 
unequivocal in their assertions that these spots were public 
service announcements, not donations, and that there was no 
law that imposed a tax on public service announcements, 
national phone company CANTV President and former Education 
Minister Gustavo Roosen told Ambassador March 19 that if he 
were SENIAT director, he would go after media owners for the 
value added tax (IVA) on the donated ads because the law is 
quite clear on this point, and has been since he was a 
minister some 15 years ago.  Owner of national daily \"El 
Universal,\" Andres Mata told Ambassador sometime after the 
national labor strike ended in February 2003 that that he had 
been careful to pay the IVA on ads he had given to the CD 
because it is the law.  He also noted that many of his fellow 
media owners were not doing the same and he told Ambassador 
that it was a mistake that would open them up to legal action 
since it quite clearly was the law.  \"El Universal\" editors 
told IO March 24 
that the TV channels were skating on thin legal ice, 
especially in light of the current government\'s campaign to 
find whatever means to subject the private media to its 
revolution.  Though the papers, including \"El Universal,\" 
were less likely than broadcast media to provide free space, 
when \"El Universal\" did so, as a precautiona>1#:QfJo 
appeal.  Even with an appeal, however, the channels could be 
subject to fines of up to 100 percent of the quoted tax 
value, plus interest.  In Venevision\'s case, the total 
\"damage\" could reach almost USD 2 million.  Even worse, if 
the channels lose their appeals and pay, it will set a 
dangerous, unaffordable precedent because the GOV is sure to 
then impose taxes on the channels for all free or donated 
spots over the past five years of the government.  Further, 
the GOV could apply the same tax regime on regional 
television channels, private radio stations, and print media, 
and  ultimately, Venezuela\'s Organic Tax Law would permit the 
GOV to seize the assets of delinquent channels, warned 
Alvarado. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  While the lawyers argue over the legality of this 
tax bill, it is clear that the GOV perceives these four 
channels as part of what they term a \"conspiracy\" against the 
government, and the GOV will use every means possible to try 
to intimidate these channels.  So far the GOV has stopped 
short of censorship or talking the channels off the air. 
These tax bills are warnings. For now, this most recent 
threat appears to have made station owners and executives 
even more determined to continue allowing ample space for the 
opposition\'s views.

1. (U) The human rights NGO \"Committee of the Relatives of

18 for not appropriately addressing alleged human rights 
abuses during the February 27-March 4 period.  The COFAVIC

devoted to attacks on journalists.  COFAVIC recommends the 
GOV ensure the proper conduct of investigations, appropriate 
training of security forces, passage of comprehensive 
legislation that protects rights and sanctions abuses, and 
creation of a truth commission with a mandate to investigate 
events from April 2002 to the present.  The GOV acknowledges 
some use of excessive force but continues to insist that it 
is not responsible for most of the alleged human rights 
violations.  End Summary.

Human Rights Watchdog 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) The human rights NGO \"Committee of the Relatives of 
Victims of February 1989\" (COFAVIC) formed in response to 
government violations of human rights committed during riots 
in February 1989.  The NGO has established a reputation as a 
fierce critic of governmental abuse of human rights.  Like 
other serious human rights groups, it laboriously documents 
cases through interviews, collection of any physical 
evidence, and cross-checking data with other human rights 
NGOs.  It also assists victims in filing official complaints 
of alleged abuses. 
 
3. (U) COFAVIC issued a report March 18 detailing its 
investigations of human rights abuses during February 
27-March 4.  The report confirms 14 deaths; 261 incidents of 
violence against individuals, including nine cases of 
torture; and 25 cases of physical threats to journalists, 
including three detained.  In addition, the report claims 
that the holding of detainees incommunicado, even for only a 
few hours, qualifies as \"forced disappearance.\"  The report 
mentions eight cases of alleged missing protesters but 
acknowledges that they could not be confirmed. 
 
--------------------- 
Governmental Failures 
--------------------- 
 
4. (U) In addition to providing case figures and examples, 
COFAVIC forcefully condemns the lack of appropriate GOV 
action to prevent abuses or punish those responsible. 
COFAVIC accuses the Attorney General of dereliction of duty, 
partiality and incompetence.  The report enumerates cases in 
which officials known for their knowledge and experience in 
prosecuting human rights violations have been shut out of 
investigations in favor of others with dubious claims to 
either professional competence or impartiality.  The Human 
Rights Ombudsman is criticized for its failure to make a 
single statement regarding the deaths, injuries, and 
detentions during the political disturbances.  (Note: 
Ombudsman German Mundarain issued a statement March 26 
acknowledging some use of excessive force, but he rejected 
claims of \"disappeared\" protesters and political prisoners 
and denied GOV culpability for fatalities.) 
 
5. (U) COFAVIC castigated the Judicial branch for acting with 
transparently political motives.  According to the report, 
some judges with a vested interest in supporting the 
government have decided \"political cases\" rather than 
recusing themselves, while other judges were fired after 
ruling against GOV interests.  COFAVIC also criticized the 
Scientific and Investigative Police (CICPC), part of the 
Executive Branch, for its overall inability to conduct 
independent investigations that meet international standards. 
 
 
6. (C) COFAVIC Director Liliana Ortega told Poloff March 24, 
 
\"If Venezuelan institutions are unable to meet minimum legal 
standards in criminal investigations, then the cases should 
be submitted to international organizations.  Otherwise, it 
is impossible to have any degree of confidence in the case 
result.\"  Ortega also explained that the figures in the 
report are low because a high percentage of victims are too 
afraid to report their experience even to a human rights NGO. 
 
------------------------------- 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Ortega asserts in a March 21 BBC interview that recent 
human rights abuses show a definite pattern.  The same 
techniques of crowd control, detention and torture have been 
reported throughout the country, indicating centralized 
planning and training in those techniques.  At the same time, 
she said, nine out of ten abuse complaints are not pursued by 
authorities because of a mixture of political reasons and 
incompetence.  For these reasons, COFAVIC makes a series of 
recommendations regarding the proper conduct of 
investigations, training of security forces, need for 
comprehensive legislation that protects rights and sanctions 
abuses, and creation of a truth commission with a mandate to 
investigate events from April 2002 to the present. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) COFAVIC enjoys high credibility as a human rights 
watchdog.  Its report means that the government has some 
explaining to do.  This may be why the Human Rights Ombudsman 
became the first GOV official to acknowledge some wrongdoing 
on the part of security forces.  Even though the government 
still denies responsibility for the majority of the abuses, 
Ortega and her staff are very patient, determined, and 
persistent.  They waited 15 years to see the GOV make 
restitution for violations committed in February 1989 and 
show no signs of slackening their vigilance now.

Summary:

1. (C) National Guard troops detained Carlos Izcaray, first 
cellist with the National Symphony Orchestra, March 1 while 
he was observing demonstrations in Caracas.  Guardsmen beat 
him, subjected him to electrical shocks, forced him to inhale 
tear gas in an enclosed space, and burned tear gas powder in 
his hair.  On March 2, he was released and went to the 
hospital, where staff photographed his injuries.  Izcaray 
filed a complaint with the Attorney General\'s Office 
(Fiscalia) on March 5, and was examined by a doctor from the 
GoV scientific investigative police (CICPC) on March 8.  By 
March 17, the prosecutor assigned to his case, Danilo Jaimes, 
had not read Izcaray\'s statement, and did not have the photos 
of his injuries in the file.  Izcaray\'s report to human 
rights NGO COFAVIC resulted in media coverage, but 
information the prosecutor\'s office has given the press is 
often false.  Izcaray\'s case is another example of physical 
abuse at the hands of GoV security forces and the Attorney 
General Office\'s refusal or inability to properly document 
and investigate allegations of torture and human rights 
abuses.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Surprise Detention 
------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) During a meeting with poloff March 26, Carlos 
Izcaray described his mistreatment at the hands of National 
Guard troops and his subsequent efforts to report what 
happened and seek redress from GoV authorities.  Izcaray, who 
is the First Cellist with Venezuela\'s National Symphony 
Orchestra, was observing demonstrations in Plaza Francia in 
Caracas on March 1.  When the National Guard began detaining 
people, he did not run because he believed it was apparent he 
was not a demonstrator and therefore would not be seized. 
Troops threw Izcaray into a truck with about ten to fifteen 
other people, however, and took him to National Guard Station 
51 in the capital\'s Paraiso district. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Torture with Guns, Helmets, Electricity and Gas 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (SBU) During the night, guardsmen beat him repeatedly with 
guns and helmets, tortured him with electrical shocks, and 
forced him to inhale tear gas in an enclosed space.  He 
alleges his attackers sprinkled tear gas power on his hair, 
lit it with a match, and let it burn for a few moments before 
blowing it out.  He was also humiliated and insulted, and he 
believes he was singled out for especially bad treatment 
because his skin was lighter than the other detainees with 
him.  He was released on March 2 after being warned not to 
tell anyone what happened if he wanted to live.  He was 
immediately hospitalized until March 3.  Hospital staff 
photographed his injuries. 
 
4. (SBU) Izcaray went to the Attorney General\'s Office 
(Fiscalia) on March 5 to file an official complaint. 
Although he had heard prosecutors were refusing Human Rights 
reports, a friend advised that a \"competent\" prosecutor was 
on duty that day to receive the complaint and ensure that it 
was handled properly.  Izcaray received a medical examination 
from forensic specialist from the GoV scientific 
investigative police (CICPC) on March 8.  The CICPC doctor 
did not take any new photos, but accepted Izcaray\'s pictures 
taken at the hospital.  Izcaray returned to the Attorney 
General\'s Office on March 17 with two witnesses to support 
his testimony.  The prosecutor assigned to his case, Danilo 
Jaimes, did not ask what happened to him and had not read 
Izcaray\'s prior statement.  In addition, Jaimes said the 
photos Izcaray left with the CICPC doctor were not in the 
prosecutor\'s file.  Izcaray gave the prosecutor another set 
of the photos, but concluded that his case is not being taken 
seriously. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Reporting Abuse Outside GoV Circles 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Because of the death threat he received at the 
National Guard station, Izcaray agonized before finally 
deciding to report his experience to human rights NGO 
COFAVIC.  Since he went to COFAVIC, his case has received 
significant media coverage, but information the prosecutor\'s 
office has given the media is often false.  For example, 
although the prosecutor never contacted Izcaray about any 
additional medical examinations, he saw a newspaper article 
on March 26 in which the prosecutor claimed to have ordered 
another medical exam to determine the nature of his injuries. 
 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
6. (C) Izcaray\'s case is another example of physical abuse at 
the hands of GoV security forces and the Attorney General 
Office\'s refusal or inability to properly document and 
investigate allegations of torture and human rights abuses. 
President Hugo Chavez and other GoV authorities have 
repeatedly declared in national broadcasts that no human 
rights complaints have been filed with police, and accused 
various international human rights NGOs of \"conspiring\" to 
push him from power in a coup d\'etat.  The courage of victims 
like Izcaray to report their stories will be key to inform 
the human rights community and set the GoV\'s record straight.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) claims its figures 
on human rights violations are the most accurate in 
Venezuela, though they are higher than those reported by the 
media and NGOs.  DCC Judicial Advisor D\'lsa Solorzano told 
poloff March 23 that even DCC numbers, do not portray the 
true magnitude of human rights violations because 70 percent 
of the victims fail to report them.  Human rights NGO COFAVIC 
concurred.  One such victim told poloff March 26 that his 
attackers threatened to kill him if he talked.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Political Group: Defends Its Human Rights Figures 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (C) Coordinadora Democratica (CD) Judicial Advisor D\'lsa 
Solorzano told poloff March 23 that the opposition umbrella 
group\'s human rights abuse figures are larger than GOV, NGO, 
or media estimates because it allows victims to remain 
anonymous.  For instance, she said as of March 23 the DCC 
documented 13 missing opposition sympathizers, compared with 
seven missing people tracked by the media.  Likewise, the DCC 
knows of 26 politically motivated deaths since February 27, 
eleven more deaths than commonly reported by media and NGOs. 
The DCC alleges there are 135 political prisoners, 33 in 
Caracas alone, according to Solorzano, although Caracas daily 
El Universal listed 72 as of March 18. 
 
3. (C) Adriana Sanoja, Media Director of Un Solo Pueblo 
(USP), told poloff March 25 that many victims preferred to 
report crimes to the DCC, rather than official sources they 
don\'t trust or human rights NGOs they are unfamiliar with, 
because \"everyone knows someone in the DCC.\"  She said some 
opposition sympathizers may trust the openly political DCC 
more then more neutral human rights NGOs, suspecting the 
groups may share information with counterparts in the GOV. 
She also claimed the DCC did a good job publicizing itself as 
a complaint center in the wake of the post February 27 
protests. 
 
4. (C) Sanoja lamented that her party is having trouble 
getting citizens to denounce attacks by armed Chavistas or 
the Sucre municipality\'s pro-GOV police force publicly.  She 
claimed that people found the formal legal process 
intimidating and threats from neighbors and local MVR leaders 
ensure silence.  \"Why should they talk?,\" asked Sanoja 
rhetorically.  \"They have a choice between complaining to a 
justice system that will not help them and the possibility 
that they could lose benefits or even get hurt.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Most Cases Unreported, Especially in Barrios 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Solorzano asserted that even the DCC figures 
underrepresented the magnitude of the human rights problem in 
Venezuela because only about 30 percent of attacks, whether 
committed by civilian groups or uniformed security forces, 
are reported to GOV institutions or NGOs because of 
retaliation fears from \"Chavista authorities.\"  Liliana 
Ortega, head of Venezuelan human rights NGO COFAVIC, told 
poloff March 24 that Solorzano\'s estimate of underreported 
attacks is likely correct and that many victims do not report 
the crimes to COFAVIC or any other NGOs due to reprisal 
fears. 
 
------------------------------- 
Student Fears Reporting Assault 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Student David Gamez (please protect) told poloff March 
26 that he was attacked by plainclothes off-duty police March 
4 in the Libertador municipality.  Gamez was walking to his 
parent\'s apartment shortly after 10:30 p.m. when an unmarked 
 
 
car pulled up to the curb in front of him.  Four men in 
civilian clothes emerged and demanded to see his 
identification.  The men told him his identification card was 
a forgery and asked for more identification.  Gamez presented 
his student identification, which they also rejected as fake. 
 They then asked him for his wallet and attacked him when he 
refused to hand it over. 
 
7. (C) According to Gamez the men pistol-whipped him and 
kicked him while calling him \"golpista\" and \"esqualido\" 
(literally \"coup-monger\" and \"squalid one,\" these are 
pejoratives Chavistas use to describe upper-class opposition 
supporters).  As they tried to handcuff him and push him into 
the car, Gamez\'s friend, who was walking with him, approached 
the scuffle and yelled at the men.  The four then beat 
Gamez\'s friend for a few minutes, threw Gamez\'s wallet back 
to him, and appeared to be leaving.  Gamez asked the men to 
return 15,000 Bolivares in his wallet, which prompted another 
beating before they departed. 
 
8. (C) Gamez suspected the men were either off-duty 
Libertador Police or Political Police (DISIP) because they 
wore yellow badges around their necks and referred to the 
older man as commissioner.  They never identified themselves 
and warned not to report the incident \"if you know what is 
good for you.\"  Gamez decided not to report the attack to 
official sources or human rights NGOs on the advise of 
National Guard and police classmates.  His mother, however, 
complained to the Libertador Police without his permission. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) As a political organization, the DCC may not be the 
most objective source for human rights violations, but it is 
doing a significant job collecting information.  Solorzano 
and Sanoja make a strong case for why DCC figures only seem 
inflated and are actually low.  There are surely victims who 
have not and will not report human rights violations, a fact 
that will continue to bear on the issue as the GOV plays to 
minimize the dimension of the issue.

Summary

1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) documented 210 
assaults on opposition supporters by civilians or 
plainclothes security forces between February 27 and March 5. 
 National Assembly Deputy Pedro Diaz Blum (Proyecto 
Venezuela) told poloff March 17 that National Guard troops 
allowed armed Chavistas to fire at opposition crowds during 
Caracas, Merida, and Valencia protests.  Opposition and GOV 
leaders argued whether the murder of two opposition activists 
taken from a Caracas mini-bus was politically motivated or 
drug related.  GOV leaders assert armed criminals or 
opposition provocateurs are responsible for protest deaths, 
not security forces or pro-GOV civilians. End Summary.

CD: 210 Attacks by Civilians/Plainclothes Police 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (C) Coordinadora Democratica (CD) Judicial Advisor D\'lsa 
Solorzano told poloff March 23 that the CD has documented 210 
politically-motivated assaults on opposition supporters by 
groups in civilian cloths between February 27 and March 5. 
Determining how many of the attackers are civilians is 
difficult, Solorzano acknowledged, because the CD figures 
include plainclothes security forces and civilian groups 
mixed with off-duty and/or undercover security forces. 
Solorzano said  the assailants could be armed fanatics of 
President Hugo Chavez (Chavistas), more organized pro-Chavez 
Bolivarian Circle members, pro-Chavez criminal gangs, GOV 
security forces in plainclothes, or any combination of the 
groups.  Still, she asserted armed Chavista civilians were to 
blame for most of the cases. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Chavistas Attack/Kidnap Demonstrators February 27 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (C) Solorzano claimed about 10 civilian Chavistas attacked 
her and other marchers on a side street after the National 
Guard broke up the February 27 march in Caracas.  She said 
the group used National Guard issue rifles and tear gas bombs 
and were protected by a National Guard motorcyclists.  One of 
her escorts was beaten and she received a minor blow to her 
leg.  Solorzano claimed armed Chavistas attacked other 
marchers on side streets, while the National Guard clashed 
with the head of the march \"where the media was focused.\" 
Seven protesters, now listed as missing, were forced into a 
van by civilians February 27, according to Solorzano. 
 
4. (C) National Assembly Deputy Pedro Diaz Blum (Proyecto 
Venezuela) told poloff March 17 that National Guard troops in 
Valencia \"didn\'t have to\" fire at opposition protesters 
because armed civilians did it for them.  Diaz Blum said 
relatives in Valencia saw armed Chavistas February 27 firing 
weapons at opposition crowds from behind National Guard 
troops, resulting in one death.  Although he conceded 
determining the degree of Guard cooperation with armed 
civilians is difficult, Diaz Blum suspected civilians or 
off-duty soldiers provide National Guard commanders 
deniability for casualties and allow them to skip asking rank 
and file to fire on crowds.  He claimed violent Chavista 
groups also used soldiers for cover and/or protection in 
Caracas and Merida.  Chavista civilians are more organized, 
armed, and integrated with security forces since Chavez\'s 
brief ouster April 11, 2002, Diaz Blum asserted.  He claimed 
a GOV source told him 200,000 Venezuelans have visited Cuba 
for political training that included civil defense courses, 
now being used to combat protesters. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Chavistas Responded to Merida Governor\'s Battle Cry 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) Consular Agent Michele Lee told poloff March 24 that 
 
 
Merida Governor Florencio Porras called on Chavistas \"to take 
back the streets\" March 3, after days of student-led 
protests.  After nightfall, Chavista civilians responded and 
dispersed several small opposition protests by shooting into 
the air, at burning tires, at apartment buildings, and at a 
student government building, according to Lee and student 
leader Nixon Moreno (ref).  Moreno brought testimony to 
poloff March 11 about the March 2 shooting of Argenis 
Dugarte, allegedly by the pro-Chavez student group Utopia. 
Dugarte died early on March 3. 
 
6. (C) MVR Deputy Luis Velazquez told poloff March 24 that an 
alleged Chavista attack on a student government building in 
Merida March 3 \"simply did not occur\" and that investigators 
would expose it as an elaborate opposition hoax, despite 
CICPC comments that the shooters meant to kill.  Velazquez 
refused to talk about details of this or any case, 
purportedly due to the ongoing nature of the investigations. 
He claimed armed opposition infiltrators were responsible for 
dead and injured protesters. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Mini-Bus Murders: Blaming the Victims 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Two of the deaths that occurred during the February 27 
- March 4 confrontations blurred political/criminal lines. 
Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) activist Gustavo Farias told 
poloff March 19 that a pro-Chavez gang/political party called 
the Tupamaros killed two opposition leaders (Dictor Damas and 
Jose Luis Ricaurte Blanco) the night of March 3.  Farias said 
a group of opposition leaders in the 23 of January barrio 
decided to cancel a protest after Tupamaros staked out the 
publicized location.  Four of the leaders were later accosted 
in a mini-bus and taken to the El Calvario neighborhood by 
armed, masked civilians, where each was shot twice in the 
head, two fatally, according to Farias and press reports.  He 
worked with the four men in the sports promotion office of 
Caracas Metropolitan Mayor Alfredo Pena. 
 
8. (C) Farias said one of survivors (Hebert Eduardo Vela) was 
transferred to a hospital at an undisclosed private hospital 
in Miranda, with help of Miranda Governor Enrique Mendoza and 
Pena.  Tupamaros allegedly cased the first hospital and have 
been spreading pamphlets with death threats for helping the 
survivors or implicating the group.  Farias claimed the other 
survivor, Dimas Marcano, told him he was grazed by one bullet 
and another missed him entirely.  Farias suspects Marcano, 
who abandoned the Tupamaros for the opposition six months 
ago, was either spared by his former colleagues or may be 
Tupamaro plant. 
 
9. (C) Although National Investigative Police (CICPC) have 
kept Marcano\'s identity a secret, daily El Universal 
published a complete list of victims March 16, based on 
charges made by the Tupamaros that all four were drug 
dealers.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said that he 
would wait for the investigation to comment, but then noted 
he also had heard the victims were drug dealers.  Mayor Pena 
defended his employees, and characterized the murder as 
politically motivated. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOV Blames Armed Opposition Civilians 
------------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) At a meeting with diplomats March 16, Vice President 
Rangel implicitly denied GOV complicity with armed civilians. 
 In addition, he said the National Guard can not be 
responsible for any shootings because they are not authorized 
to use \"arms of war\" in crowd control and, in any event, the 
bullets are the wrong caliber.  (Note: opposition contacts 
reported security forces using non-standard weapons to 
conceal their involvement.)  Rangel blamed the opposition for 
being \"excessive\" by using Molotov cocktails and firing on 
security forces, supposedly proven by numerous bullet marks 
on National Guard tanks. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
11. (C) The GOV\'s denial of an armed pro-GOV civilian 
presence during the February 27 to March 5 protests 
contradicts video evidence of armed groups in civilian 
clothes walking the streets and attacking protesters.  Post 
finds it much likelier that these groups are Chavistas than 
opposition agent provocateurs.  Even if some were undercover 
security forces, they would still be illegally using \"weapons 
of war.\"

Summary:

1. (C) The Electoral Chamber of Venezuela\'s Supreme Court 
(TSJ) March 29 confirmed its jurisdiction in matters 
concerning the National Electoral Council (CNE) and urged the 
TSJ en banc to decide the jurisdictional dispute between the 
 
SIPDIS 
court\'s Electoral and Constitutional chambers (reftels). 
Citing the continuing dispute, pro-GoV CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez said March 30 that the CNE will delay its 
announcement regarding an appeals process (reparo), but will 
announce final figures for signatures soon.  The Electoral 
Chamber also exhorted CNE, the opposition and the GoV to find 
a political solution.  In the end, it is perhaps the most 
realistic hope for scheduling a presidential referendum.  End 
summary.

Electoral Chamber Says It\'s Good Enough 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Electoral Chamber of Venezuela\'s Supreme Court 
(TSJ) batted the ball back March 29 when it confirmed its 
jurisdiction in matters concerning the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) and suggested that the TSJ should meet en banc 
to decide the growing dispute between the court\'s Electoral 
and Constitutional chambers.  The statement is the most 
recent salvo in a series of competing pronouncements coming 
from the rival court chambers since March 15, when the 
Electoral Chamber first instructed the CNE to include over 
870,000 signatures in the count towards a presidential 
referendum (reftels).  The TSJ Constitutional Chamber had 
issued a decision March 23 purporting to nullify the 
Electoral Chamber\'s March 15 decision (reftel B). 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Statement Asks Court and Parties to Settle the Matter 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3. (U) The Electoral Chamber\'s March 29 statement rebutted 
point-by-point the Constitutional Chamber\'s recent 
pronouncement, arguing that the Electoral Chamber was not a 
subordinate tribunal as the Constitutional Chamber\'s March 23 
ruling suggested.  The Electoral Chamber also referred to 
Article 297 of the Venezuela constitution, which assigns the 
Electoral Chamber purview over issues regarding the CNE.  The 
Electoral Chamber also urged the entire TSJ to meet en banc 
to settle the growing \"dispute on court authority.\"  In 
addition, the Electoral Chamber called on the litigants in 
the subject case, the CNE, the opposition and the GoV, to 
craft an agreement on the appeals process \"in the spirit of 
conciliation\" to avoid further delays in the courts. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CNE GoV Rep: I Told You This Would Hurt 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Pro-GoV CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez said March 30 
that, in response to the Electoral Chamber announcement, the 
CNE will delay its decision on an appeals process (reparo). 
Rodriguez said the CNE had planned to issue final signature 
figures for the presidential recall March 30, but he will 
delay the announcement because the TSJ Electoral Chamber said 
the CNE should speak further with the opposition.  Rodriguez 
reiterated that while the CNE will only comply with TSJ 
decisions from Constitutional Chamber, he said the advice of 
the Electoral Chamber was \"very prudent\" and the CNE has 
therefore decided to incorporate all parties-- including GoV 
and opposition representatives-- in the discussion to design 
an appeals process.  Rodriguez also scolded the opposition 
for pursuing a court action, recalling he had warned that the 
judicial route would only slow the process.  Rodriguez said 
the CNE decision to delay the announcement of signature 
 
figures proves his warning was correct. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Carter Center Pleased with Electoral Chamber Announcement 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5. (U) Carter Center representative Jennifer McCoy, visiting 
in Caracas March 30, said she was \"pleased\" with the content 
of the Electoral Chamber\'s March 29 statement, noting its 
call for continued discussions regarding an appeals process. 
McCoy said the Carter Center would await the CNE\'s announced 
results, which she expected would come out by April 2.  She 
also praised her CNE colleagues, and called on all parties to 
guarantee the rights of all Venezuelan citizens. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
6. (C) The Electoral Chamber\'s announcement, as expected, 
reaffirmed its role as the opposition\'s champion in the TSJ 
contests against the pro-GoV Constitutional Chamber.  Because 
pro-GoV TSJ president Ivan Rincon controls several key 
procedural mechanisms, it is unlikely that the case will be 
taken up by the full TSJ.  Stalling the issue in the sticky 
web of TSJ procedures is effectively a Chavez victory.  The 
Electoral Chamber\'s exhortation to the parties to find a 
political solution is, in the end, the most realistic hope 
for scheduling a presidential referendum.

Chavez Receives Evo 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) Leftist Bolivian legislator Evo Morales joined 
President Hugo Chavez in Caracas March 30 to announce plans 
to stage international demonstrations marking the events of 
April 2002, when Chavez was temporarily removed from power, 
only to return.  Morales and Chavez said they would sponsor 
marches in various cities on \"the continent\" to commemorate 
what they called a failed coup d\'etat, and to support 
Chavez\'s \"Bolivarian revolution.\"  Other Latin American 
leftist organizations such as Barrios de Pie (Argentina), 
Movimiento Pachakutec (Bolivia); Farabundo Marti Liberation 
Front (El Salvador); Sandinista Front (Nicaragua); the Cuban 
Communist Party (Cuba); and the Amplio Front (Uruguay) are 
also in Caracas for the annual Bolivarian People\'s Congress. 
 
3. (U) Chavez said coordinated April events will condemn U.S. 
intervention, and recalled that he was swept back into power 
in April 2002 by a counteroffensive that he said took \"the 
hawks of the CIA and pentagon\" by surprise.  Chavez said the 
U.S. did not count on the people rising up to throw off the 
tyranny and the military refusing their \"bastard orders.\" 
 
4. (U) Morales arrived in Caracas March 29 for several days 
of meetings, including discussion on foreign aid for Bolivia 
rumored to involve asphalt for Bolivian roads and $50 
million.  He said the results of those discussions would be 
announced soon in La Paz.  Morales also thanked Chavez for 
his support in Bolivian efforts to reclaim a passage to the 
sea through Chilean territory.  Morales told reports he will 
travel to Spain the week of April 5 to meet with 
newly-elected Prime Minister Zapatero. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Victims Accuse Chavez in the International Criminal Court 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5. (U) Members of the Venezuelan human rights NGO Venezuelan 
Victims of Political Violence (VIVE) filed formal accusations 
under the Rome Statute against President Hugo Chavez in the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) March 31.  VIVE\'s 
accusation lists instances of murder, torture, unlawful 
detention, and sexual abuse it alleges Chavez security forces 
and agents carried out since July 2002.  The accusation terms 
the collected human rights abuses as \"crimes against 
humanity\" perpetrated in a systematic manner as part of GoV 
policy.  VIVE charges that an appeal to the international 
body is required because the Attorney General\'s Office, the 
Ombudsman, and the courts in Venezuela have neglected to 
conduct lawful investigations and to take action to protect 
the citizenry from GoV abuse.  VIVE also requested a 
preliminary declaration from the ICC because the GoV has 
started a criminal investigation against them for having 
brought an earlier ICC complaint. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Ex-Ambassadors Appeal to UN SYG 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Five former Venezuelan ambassadors to the United 
Nations, Simon Alberto Consalvi, Ramon Escovar Salom, Diego 
Arria, Adolpho Raul Taylhardat, and Milos Alcalay, sent a 
letter March 23 to UN SYG Kofi Annan condemning the GoV for 
human rights abuses and for preventing the citizens from 
exercising their constitutional rights to have a presidential 
referendum.  The ambassadors complained of GoV efforts to 
avoid or confuse orders issued by the Supreme Court (TSJ) 
Electoral Chamber regarding the referendum, and detailed GoV 
attempts to remove or disqualify TSJ justices through actions 
in the National Assembly and investigations by the offices of 
the Attorney General and the Ombudsman.  The result of these 
GoV efforts, said the ambassadors, was to impede the people\'s 
rights to an electoral solution to the current political 
impasse.  The ambassadors invited SYG Annon to visit 
Venezuela and hoped that he would use his \"voice of 
authority\" to call for a referendum and an end to GoV abuse.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) A preliminary report by the International Labor 
Organization\'s (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association 
determined that Venezuela\'s December 2002 - February 2003 
work stoppage was tantamount to a general strike.  The 
Committee deplored the mass dismissal of more than 18,000 
PDVSA workers without due process and encouraged the GOV to 
negotiate a solution with the oil workers\' union.  President 
Hugo Chavez scorned the ILO report and swore the oil workers, 
\"guilty of terrorism and sabotage,\" would never be rehired. 
Separately, Ministry of Labor officials noted that the report 
is preliminary and sides at times with the GOV position. 
Anti-Chavez unions hailed the report as a victory.  We do not 
expect the GOV to heed the ILO recommendations, yet another 
repudiation from the international community of Chavez\'s 
administration.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
ILO Body Chides GOV 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) The International Labor Organization\'s (ILO) Committee 
on Freedom of Association (CFA) released a report in late 
March cataloging the status of a host of complaints against 
the GOV lodged by labor groups.  The CFA report treats 
in-depth the complaints brought by ex-PDVSA workers over the 
GOV\'s dismissal of more than 18,000 oil workers after the 
December 2002 - February 2003 strike.  UNAPETROL, a union 
formed in 2003 by PDVSA managers and workers, and FEDEUNEP, 
the public sector workers union aligned with the anti-Chavez 
Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) took the 
complaints to the ILO.  In addition to the complaints about 
the mass dismissals, UNAPETROL complained about the Ministry 
of Labor\'s rejection of UNAPETROL\'s registration as a union, 
the forced evictions of fired workers from PDVSA housing, and 
denial of education in schools belonging to the state oil 
company, PDVSA, to the children of these workers (ref a). 
 
----------------------------- 
Mass PDVSA Firings An \"Abuse\" 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The CFA deplored the GOV\'s \"hasty and 
disproportionate\" nature of the mass dismissals that are 
\"tantamount to abuses and destroy labor regulations.\"  The 
work stoppage was similar to, in the view of the Committee, a 
generalized strike.  The GOV argued in its response that the 
national work stoppage, led in part by senior and middle 
class PDVSA managers, had as its goal the overthrow of 
President Chavez and was not, therefore, a labor action.  The 
workers left their positions for more than 60 days, the GOV 
argued, which legally permitted PDVSA to fire them without 
Ministry of Labor approval.  The GOV also admitted that 
faulty computer systems at the time caused them to fire 1,032 
employees who were on sick or maternity leave, an error that, 
the GOV claims, was subsequently rectified.  The CFA 
concluded that the dismissal of more than 18,000 workers 
suggests the strike cannot be attributed solely to senior and 
middle managers.  The CFA recommended that the Governing Body 
of the ILO request the GOV to engage in negotiations with the 
most representative trade union to find a solution to the 
mass firings (Note:  The report does not order the GOV to 
rehire the workers, as some media reports suggested).  Though 
recommending the GOV consult with workers over denial of 
benefits such as education and housing, the CFA accepted the 
GOV\'s arguments that it had given ample time for the workers 
to make other arrangements. 
 
4. (U) The Ministry of Labor denied UNAPETROL\'s application 
 
for recognition as a union on the grounds that the proposed 
union was to be composed of both managers and employees (ref 
b), violating the \"purity principle\" of union formation.  The 
CFA accepted this argument, but criticized the GOV for 
unnecessary administrative delays in processing the 
application, and encouraged the GOV to work directly with 
UNAPETROL to find a feasible solution to this objection. 
 
------------------- 
Chavez Responds ILO 
------------------- 
 
5. (U)  In his weekly television program on March 28, Chavez 
responded to the ILO, calling the organization an accomplice 
in an international campaign to discredit his government.  He 
told the ILO that the fired oil workers are \"coup-plotters, 
terrorists, and saboteurs\" who would never return to their 
jobs.  He told the ILO to \"fry monkeys\" (best translated as 
\"take a hike\").  He attacked the ILO as \"hypocritical 
Pharisees\" for recognizing the stridently anti-Chavez CTV as 
representatives of Venezuela\'s labor movement.  He called the 
national work stoppage \"sabotage,\" not a general strike as 
the CFA concluded. 
 
6. (U) Ministry of Labor officials minimized the importance 
of the report, claiming that it contains only preliminary 
recommendations.   Vice Minister of Labor Ricardo Dorado told 
reporters that, despite Chavez\'s comments, Venezuela has no 
intention of withdrawing from the ILO.  A pro-GOV group of 
petroleum workers spoke from the presidential palace on March 
30 denouncing the fired workers who \"abandoned their posts\" 
in an attempt to topple the Chavez government.  The 
spokesperson for the group said if the ILO\'s Committee for 
Freedom of Association does not respect the will of 
Venezuela\'s workers, then the worker class does not have the 
duty to respect the ILO\'s resolutions. 
 
---------------- 
Labor Celebrates 
---------------- 
 
7. (U) UNAPETROL President Horacio Medina told reporters 
March 29 the ILO\'s report is an important first victory for 
the fired petroleum employees.  The report, he asserted, 
lends credibility to his organization\'s claims of GOV 
violations of labor rights.  He added he had already sent a 
letter to Minister of Labor Maria Cristina Iglesias to 
request a meeting on the points raised by the CFA.  Medina 
said he doubted the Minister would grant the meeting, however. 
 
----------------- 
Nest Steps at ILO 
----------------- 
 
8. (SBU) We understand that CFA recommendations are discussed 
but seldom altered by the Governing Body.  The CFA will meet 
again May 27-28 to produce another report, probably including 
recommendations on the charges against CTV President Carlos 
Ortega, currently in exile in Costa Rica.  The Governing Body 
will meet June 1-17, during which time it will approve the 
CFA report.  The March 2004 report references a total of 12 
complaints, but the GOV either did not respond or did not 
send comments until the day before the CFA convened.  (Note: 
The full report may be accessed at 
http://www.ilo.org/public/english/ standards/relm/gb/docs/ 
gb289/pdf/lils-3/pdf.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The fired oil workers\' alleged treason against 
Chavez\'s revolution is orthodoxy in the Bolivarian catechism; 
the GOV will not change its position based on an ILO report. 
Still, a rebuke from international organized labor tarnishes 
the GOV\'s desired image as a champion of the poor.  We expect 
the GOV to start damage control activities now against the 
possible results of the ILO\'s June meeting.  The report, 
 
which has boosted the morale of Venezuelan organized labor, 
is also another log on the fire of international opinion 
against the Chavez government.  Yet no matter how hard the 
ILO hits the GOV in a report, the moribund CTV seems 
incapable at this time of mobilizing workers.  It has 
glaringly, for example, failed to use classic labor actions 
such as stoppages, walkouts, or slowdowns to protest the 
current dismissals and intimidation of public sector workers 
who signed the petition for a referendum to recall President 
Chavez.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Pro-Chavez political parties registered their 
candidates in March in anticipation of the August 1 elections 
for governors and mayors.  As with the opposition, the 
Chavistas see the regional elections as a referendum of sorts 
on President Hugo Chavez.  They also see the elections as an 
opportunity to extend the Bolivarian Revolution further into 
the state and local level.  Chavez\'s campaign committee 
imposed discipline over the candidate selection process, 
which resulted in consensus candidates in most races. 
Chavez\'s personal selection of many gubernatorial candidates, 
many of whom are ex-military officers, rankled some 
supporters.  Chavistas, wanting to distract from the 
presidential recall referendum, have already accused the USG 
of meddling in the regional elections.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
The De Facto Referendum 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Pro-Chavez political parties, under the leadership of 
a campaign committee called the \"Comando Ayacucho,\" finished 
registering their candidates in March for regional elections 
for governors, mayors, and other state and municipal 
officials (ref a).  For Chavez supporters, the regional 
elections represent the political battleground of 2004. 
Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) National Director of Ideology 
Elias Jaua told DCM and poloff March 30 that the elections 
will serve as a type of referendum on President Chavez, in 
which races will be decided by candidates\' devotion to 
Chavez\'s so-called Bolivarian Revolution.  The elections are 
a more stable vehicle for expressing popular will, Jaua 
argued, than the proposed presidential recall referendum. 
Jaua asserted that Chavez would win such a vote, but that the 
opposition, unable to accept the bitter truth of defeat, 
would plunge Venezuela into a Colombia-like conflict. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Elections Strengthen the Revolution 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) A propaganda booklet on the elections written by Jaua 
in February emphasizes the importance of the regional 
elections to the revolutionary process.  The booklet says the 
fate of the revolution will be determined by the elections. 
\"Hegemony in macro-social spaces\" is not enough, says the 
booklet, for ensuring the revolution succeeds.  State and 
local positions are closer to the daily life of \"the people\" 
and are vital to \"decentralizing democracy,\" the literature 
says.  Surrendering even one of these spaces to the 
opposition, claims the propaganda, will permit them to plan 
\"coups, regicides, and sabotage\" against the revolution.  The 
booklet also points out that a Chavista electoral win will 
demonstrate to the world that the GOV has the support of the 
majority of Venezuelans, which will help the revolutionary 
government in its international efforts to alleviate poverty, 
achieve regional integration, and defeat the Free Trade Area 
of the Americas.

Strategy:  Gains and Punishment 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Comando Ayacucho leader Willian Lara (MVR) told 
reporters March 26 the principal objective of the pro-Chavez 
parties is to hold on to and add to the 16 of 23 
governorships and 126 of 335 mayoralties already held by 
Chavistas.  Lara highlighted the need to \"recapture\" the 
positions lost to \"traitors,\" those who have defected from 
 
 
Chavismo, specifically, the governors of Anzoategui and 
Bolivar, and the metropolitan mayor of Caracas.  The MVR 
electoral booklet discusses important issues for the 
campaign.  Most emphasized are Chavez\'s social programs aimed 
at the poor, such as Mission Robinson (literacy), Barrio 
Adentro (health), and Mission Ribas (education).  On the 
\"tough issues\" of unemployment, crime, corruption, and 
political violence, members are encouraged to remind voters 
that the Bolivarian movement is best equipped to deal with 
these problems, but has been hindered thus far by \"sabotage\" 
from the opposition. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Candidate Selection: Chavez\'s Big Finger 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Jaua said the Comando Ayacucho had succeeded in single 
candidates in every state except Trujillo, where a rogue MVR 
candidate registered against the consensus candidate (Note: 
The press reported several conflicts among pro-Chavez 
candidates, most of which were resolved by the time the 
candidate registration period closed on March 25).  Jaua said 
this was much improved over the last elections, when multiple 
pro-Chavez candidates faced off in several key contests.  The 
Comando Ayacucho\'s technique included public warnings to any 
maverick candidates that they would be \"automatically 
excluded\" from their respective party if they went against 
the decision of the Comando. 
 
6. (C) MVR National Assembly Deputy Ibrain Velazquez shared 
his frustration over candidate selection with poloff on March 
26.  Velazquez, who was reportedly snubbed by Chavez for the 
candidacy of his state of Nueva Esparta, predicted that the 
Comando\'s heavy hand would result in unexpected electoral 
upsets (see para 7).  Velazquez said bluntly that there was 
no candidate selection process, saying that \"Chavez is the 
only one who decides.\"  Chavez, in fact, has announced many 
of the candidacies personally, often surprising those not 
selected -- and some who are.  Chavez picks are often 
ex-military officials.  One columnist pointed out that, if 
the GOV candidates sweep the elections, ten states would be 
governed by former military officials. 
 
-------------- 
Critical Races 
-------------- 
 
7. (C) The disgruntled Velazquez asserted that opposition 
strength is growing.  He thought it possible the Chavistas 
could lose the races in the states of Nueva Esparta, , 
Cojedes, Zulia, Bolivar, and Vargas.  He was more sure of 
victories in the states of Aragua and Carabobo.  Jaua 
admitted the Chavistas would face an uphill battle in 
Miranda, where former Minister of Infrastructure Diosdado 
Cabello is running against Governor Enrique Mendoza, the head 
of the opposition\'s Coordinadora Democratica.  Jaua believes 
Acosta Carles stands a better than even chance at beating 
Henrique Salas Feo in Carabobo.  Both Jaua and Velazquez were 
confident of a win in Caracas, where a three-cornered contest 
may give the win to MVR\'s Juan Barreto.  Jaua said the 
opposition was favored in the states of Zulia, Apure, and 
Yaracuy.

Running Against the U.S. 
------------------------ 
 
8. (U) Jorge Albornoz, Secretary General of the pro-Chavez 
Patria Para Todos (PPT) told reporters March 26 that the USG 
is coordinating the opposition\'s electoral strategy. 
Albornoz accused the USG of imposing the candidacies of 
Enrique Mendoza and Henrique Salas Feo on the opposition. 
The MVR electoral booklet also claims that the opposition, 
having lost the fight domestically, has gone to its 
international \"masters\" to beg for intervention in the 
country. 
 
------- 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) As Chavez is apparently convinced that the nationalist 
card has some value, we expect Chavez and his followers to 
step up the anti-U.S. rhetoric to divert attention from the 
dreary Venezuelan political and social conditions, hardly 
improved after five years of Chavez rule. (In fact, recent 
polling shared with the Ambassador indicates that Chavez 
supporters do not approve of the anti-U.S. posture.) 
Regional elections also distract the public and political 
parties from the presidential recall vote, which poses 
significantly greater political risk to the revolution.  The 
elections, as both sides have suggested to us, may size up to 
be a referendum on President Chavez.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Pro-Chavez political parties registered their 
candidates in March in anticipation of the August 1 elections 
for governors and mayors.  As with the opposition, the 
Chavistas see the regional elections as a referendum of sorts 
on President Hugo Chavez.  They also see the elections as an 
opportunity to extend the Bolivarian Revolution further into 
the state and local level.  Chavez\'s campaign committee 
imposed discipline over the candidate selection process, 
which resulted in consensus candidates in most races. 
Chavez\'s personal selection of many gubernatorial candidates, 
many of whom are ex-military officers, rankled some 
supporters.  Chavistas, wanting to distract from the 
presidential recall referendum, have already accused the USG 
of meddling in the regional elections.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
The De Facto Referendum 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Pro-Chavez political parties, under the leadership of 
a campaign committee called the \"Comando Ayacucho,\" finished 
registering their candidates in March for regional elections 
for governors, mayors, and other state and municipal 
officials (ref a).  For Chavez supporters, the regional 
elections represent the political battleground of 2004. 
Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) National Director of Ideology 
Elias Jaua told DCM and poloff March 30 that the elections 
will serve as a type of referendum on President Chavez, in 
which races will be decided by candidates\' devotion to 
Chavez\'s so-called Bolivarian Revolution.  The elections are 
a more stable vehicle for expressing popular will, Jaua 
argued, than the proposed presidential recall referendum. 
Jaua asserted that Chavez would win such a vote, but that the 
opposition, unable to accept the bitter truth of defeat, 
would plunge Venezuela into a Colombia-like conflict. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Elections Strengthen the Revolution 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) A propaganda booklet on the elections written by Jaua 
in February emphasizes the importance of the regional 
elections to the revolutionary process.  The booklet says the 
fate of the revolution will be determined by the elections. 
\"Hegemony in macro-social spaces\" is not enough, says the 
booklet, for ensuring the revolution succeeds.  State and 
local positions are closer to the daily life of \"the people\" 
and are vital to \"decentralizing democracy,\" the literature

Summary

1. (U) The Criminal Chamber of Venezuela\'s Supreme Court 
(TSJ) dismissed on procedural ground the order to detain 
Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles April 1, and ordered the case 
sent to a new court.  Supporters of President Hugo Chavez 
objected to the possibility National Electoral Council (CNE) 
alternate director Miriam Kornblith assuming the role CNE 
Vice President out on medical leave.  The National Assembly 
(NA) fired its chief economic advisor, Francisco Rodriguez, 
after he publicly accused NA President Francisco Ameliach of 
unduly pressuring the semi-autonomous analysis economic 
analysis.  The Episcopal Council of Venezuela (CEV) denounced 
the GOV for blocking the \"democratic and peaceful\" path of 
the presidential recall referendum and for violating human 
rights.  End Summary.

TSJ Annuls Capriles Detention Order 
 
SIPDIS 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On April 1, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court 
(TSJ) struck down the order to detain Baruta Mayor Henrique 
Capriles for alleged crimes perpetrated during the April 2002 
siege of the Cuban Embassy in Caracas (ref).  The Chamber, in 
a 2-1 decision, annulled the March 16 order, saying it did 
not adequately specify the nature of the crimes, among other 
procedural flaws.  The Chamber ordered the case be reassigned 
to a new court and, addressing one of the principal stumbling 
blocks in the case, instructed the lower court to give 
Capriles\' lawyers access to the investigation file.  Capriles 
appeared publicly for the first time since the warrant was 
issued the same evening to declare that \"justice is not lost 
in Venezuela.\"  Capriles condemned the GOV for using public 
institutions to intimidate political opponents.  Minister of 
Communication Jesse Chacon decried the decision as engineered 
by magistrates with ties to opposition parties and asked why 
Capriles received \"privileged\" treatment by the Chamber when 
thousands of Venezuelans were awaiting trials. 
 
--------------------- 
CNE Alternate Opposed 
--------------------- 
 
3. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) Vice President 
Ezequiel Zamora (pro-opposition) requested a medical leave of 
absence for 15 days from the CNE on March 29 (rumored to be a 
controllable type of cancer).  Zamora requested that his 
alternate, Miriam Kornblith, replace him on the board during 
his temporary absence, according to press reports.  CNE 
Director Jorge Rodriguez immediately assailed Kornblith, who 
has been an outspoken critic of the GOV\'s handling of the 
referendum, saying her political statements disqualified her 
from serving on the board.  Chavez\'s campaign committee, the 
\"Comando Ayacucho,\" requested that the Constitutional Chamber 
of the Supreme Court (TSJ) name a new alternate.  The Chavez 
supporters cited Kornblith\'s links to a project carried out 
by the NGO Sumate, and funded by the National Endowment for 
Democracy, as evidence of her political bias.  Kornblith 
attempted to attend a CNE meeting April 1 to insist she be 
allowed to substitute for Zamora, but the other members of 
the CNE reportedly refused to receive her. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
National Assembly Economic Advisor Sacked 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The National Assembly (NA) its chief economic advisor, 
Francisco Rodriguez, after he publicly accused NA President 
Francisco Ameliach of denying the Assembly\'s Office of 
Economic and Finance Counsel (OEAF) its budget for four 
months and of withholding financial information.  Rodriguez 
claimed that the OEAF, a semi-autonomous economic analysis 
shop within the Assembly, is being persecuted because it has 
 
 
warned the NA\'s Finance Committee of imprudent spending 
within the budget.  Rodriguez was suspended on March 29 for 
\"questioning the honor of the President of the National 
Assembly.\"  The pro-GOV majority voted on March 30 to dismiss 
Rodriguez along with his deputy and six other economists. 
The debate turned blatantly political as pro-Chavez deputies 
accused Rodriguez of working for the opposition and 
supporting the April 2002 \"coup\" against President Hugo 
Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Catholic Bishops Call For Referendum, No Repression 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (U) The Episcopal Council of Venezuela (CEV), composed of 
Venezuela\'s Catholic bishops, held an extraordinary session 
to discuss the political crisis and recent allegations of 
human rights abuses.  The CEV released a statement April 1 
supporting the presidential recall referendum.  CEV President 
Baltazar Porras told reporters that the referendum was the 
\"peaceful and democratic\" path out of Venezuela\'s political 
crisis.  If that path is closed, he said, violence will 
result.  The CEV denounced violence whatever its cause, and 
specifically criticized the GOV for a disproportionate 
response to opposition demonstrations.  The CEV also 
condemned polarizing rhetoric that classifies people either 
as \"patriots\" or \"coup-plotters.\"

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV has been using a range of legal actions, 
administrative procedures, and illicit activities to punish 
and harass opponents.  Tax investigations, broadcasting 
private phone conversations, and blacklisting signers of a 
presidential recall petition from GOV services or employment 
are among the measures the GOV is employing.  The political 
intimidation stretches to the National Assembly, which 
attempted to remove three Supreme Court justices as 
punishment for a March 15 decision favoring a presidential 
recall.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Be Chavista Or Be Fired 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following protests February 27 to March 5, the GOV has 
accelerated efforts to screen signers of a presidential 
recall petition for employment, services, and benefits (ref 
a).  The opposition umbrella group Coordinadora Democratica 
(CD) denounced about 8,000 public employee firings March 27, 
not including more than 18,000 state oil company employees 
previously fired for \"abandoning\" their jobs during the 
2002-2003 national strike.  Embassy contacts, including a 
student leader, an IV grant nominee, and an opposition mayor, 
claim they have been refused passports for signing.  The GOV 
is also allegedly using the signature database to deny 
petition signers ID cards, marriage certificates, and access 
to dollar exchanges,  according to Embassy contacts and media 
reports. 
 
3. (C) National Assembly (AN) Deputy Ernesto Alvarenga 
(Solidaridad) told poloff February 18 that the list is being 
used to pressure people to recant their signatures in 
exchange for employment in PDVSA, as a condition for state 
bank loans, and to avoid delay in receiving retirement 
benefits.  He called it Venezuela\'s \"Schindler\'s list.\" 
Rojelio Serpa, assistant to Tachira Attorney General Doris 
Gandica, told poloff March 3 that his boss screens all 
requests and job applicants and \"does nothing for people who 
signed.\"  Max Vasquez, editor of Daily La Nacion, told poloff 
February 26 that a friend applied for a state job in Tachira 
and was screened using the same process.  Vasquez\'s friend 
decided \"the job was more important than participating in a 
futile process\" and recanted at the local CNE office. 
 
4. (U) After denying persistent blacklisting rumors, GOV 
officials began in March to concede limited firings had 
occurred, but hinted of more.  Foreign Minister Jesus Perez 
said March 30 that all ambassadors and general directors who 
signed the petition would lose their jobs.  \"Someone who is 
against the president ... cannot represent him,\" said Perez. 
Venezuelan Education Minister Aristobulo Isturiz_ denied 
allegations that his Ministry is harassing or firing 
employees that signed, but insisted they key posts cannot be 
occupied by \"officials who oppose the government.\"  Health 
Minister Roger Capella said March 20 that state employed 
doctors and nurses who signed should expect to be fired 
because they \"agreed with violence and conspiracy.\"  Franklin 
Rondon, head of the pro-Chavez federation of public sector 
unions, told poloff March 25 it is \"inconceivable\" that 
directors and vice ministers who signed against Chavez be 
allowed to remain in place. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Sowing the seeds of an Orwellian State 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOV is now open about its use of surveillance to 
intimidate opponents and stifle criticism.  Private phone 
conversations are tapped, edited, and packaged on 
GOV-operated TV and radio with increasing regularity and 
 
without regard for privacy rights.  The latest target was 
daily Tal Cual Editor Teodoro Petkoff, whose conversation 
with constitutional lawyer Tulio Alvarez_ was aired early in 
March.  AN Deputy William Lara requested March 17 that the 
Supreme Court remove Petkoff from an advisory board to the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) based on the illegally taped 
conversion.  \"The objective is no longer to convince nor to 
win minds, but to instill terror,\" wrote Petkoff, who denied 
any difference between his public and private statements. 
Other targets in the last six months included Venezuelan 
Workers\' Confederation leaders Carlos Ortega and Manual Cova, 
former Fedecamaras President Carlos Fernandez, and former 
Attorney General Ramon Escovar Salom.  Pro-Chavez Legislator 
Iris Varela admitted openly to reporters in Spain that the 
GOV taps Embassy phones and is justified in doing so because 
of U.S. hostility to the Bolivarian revolution. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Using the Tax Man to Audit Political Dissent 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Government opponents also see as harassment the GOV 
order for four private television stations to pay more than 
U.S. $3.3 million in taxes for airing pro-opposition spots 
during the December 2002-February 2003 national strike (ref 
b).  Although the technical merits of the tax are debatable 
(some media owners told the Ambassador the GOV was in the 
right), media owners insist the GOV is applying it 
inconsistently as political punishment for criticizing the 
GOV.  Opposition leaders claim the GOV\'s tax office, SENIAT, 
is politically targeting businesses, a claim SENIAT denies. 
Government opponents cite SENIAT\'s high profile \"zero 
evasion\" plan, which closed some of Venezuela\'s major retail 
chains for days during the lucrative Christmas shopping 
season (ref c).  SENIAT launched a major public relations 
campaign at the same time depicting it heroically closing 
stores and businesses. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NA Committee Demands Dismissal of \"Corrupt\" Judges 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7. (C) Pro-GOV AN Deputy Luis Velazquez Alvaray (MVR) told 
poloff March 24 that the AN\'s Judicial Branch Crisis 
Committee is trying to remove three Supreme Court justices 
for a March 15 decision favoring a presidential recall.  The 
committee, composed only of pro-GOV legislators, condemned 
the three Electoral Chamber justices to the Moral Council (a 
constitutionally mandated body consisting of the heads of the 
Public Defender, Attorney General, and Comptroller General, 
where impeachment proceedings against justices begin) for 
their \"obviously partial\" March 15 ruling accepting 876,000 
contested signatures.  Velazquez said his committee compiled 
complaints on about 500 judges during the last year, 
including five Supreme Court justices.   He claimed the 
signature decision was the \"final insult,\" calling Electoral 
Chamber Chief Alberto Martini \"the most corrupt justice in 
Supreme Court history.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The GOV\'s tightening grip on institutions has two 
simple goals: staying in power and political 
advantage/retribution.  It seems increasingly comfortable 
with its actions as it sheds vestiges of transparency, 
fairness, constitutional liberalism, and democracy for a more 
Machiavellian reality in which citizens are either with the 
Bolivarian revolution or are traitors.  Most (but 
interestingly, not all) GOV contacts do not seem especially 
troubled by allegations of their political bias.  Chavistas 
regularly describe the political world as a war and all who 
do not share their fervor as enemies.  The recent harassment 
fits with Chavez\'s strategy to use the state against 
political enemies to wear down resistance.

1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) Director Jorge 
Rodriguez announced April 5 that talks between the opposition 
and the GOV are \"well advanced\" on an agreement over the 
appeals process for the signatures collected in support of a 
recall vote on President Hugo Chavez.  Rodriguez said the CNE 
would consider, as a sign of good faith, delaying elections 
for governors and mayors to September 19, to permit a 
possible presidential referendum as early as August 8 (The 
date would conflict with the August 1 date envisioned for the 
regional elections).  Opposition negotiators expressed their 
willingness to go to the appeals process if it is transparent 
and practical.  The situation, however, is quite fluid.  End 
Summary.

CNE: Progress on Talks, Willing to Delay Regional Elections 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) Director Jorge 
Rodriguez announced on April 5 that talks between the 
opposition and the pro-GOV parties (the \"Comando Ayacucho\") 
are \"well advanced\" toward an agreement over the appeals 
process (\"reparos\") for the signatures collected to petition 
for a recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez. 
Rodriguez also said the CNE is considering postponing 
regional elections for governors and mayors to September 19 
as \"a sign of good faith\" that the CNE is trying to address 
opposition concerns.  Rodriguez admitted the original 
regional elections date of August 1 would complicate the 
logistics of a possible referendum, which Rodriguez suggested 
could be August 8.  Rodriguez noted that the postponement 
still needs the approval of the CNE board (Note:  Four of the 
five directors must agree on decisions affecting dates of 
elections.).  Rodriguez said he hoped to conclude talks with 
both the opposition and the pro-GOV parties on April 5. 
 
--------------------------------- 
The Opposition\'s Three Conditions 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Opposition representatives told to Polcouns April 2 
that talks indeed are advancing.  Opposition negotiator 
Enrique Naime said the number of signatures the CNE could 
consider valid would increase above 1.8 million, though Naime 
claimed the CNE was tinkering with the numbers on the 
municipal level to give the GOV the advantage.  Naime said 
they had compared CNE data, and found that the number of 
invalid signatures had increased by more than 100 percent in 
states where Chavez enjoys greater sympathy.  The opposition 
would thus face greater difficulty in revalidating signatures 
there.  Ambassador confirmed progress on the talks with 
Carter Center representative Francisco Diez on April 4, who 
said the two sides were still see-sawing on final details of 
the appeals process.  Press reports, though varied, say that 
the sticking points are closing certifications, tallying 
process, number of tables in each center, and the presence of 
witnesses and international observers. 
 
4. (U) Opposition negotiators held a press conference on 
April 5 giving three conditions to going to the appeals 
process.  First, the process must be transparent, with clear 
rules and auditable results.  International observers should 
be able to take \"quick counts\" as well, opposition leaders 
said.  Second, the process must be efficient, with an 
infrastructure sufficient to avoid bottlenecks.  Results 
should be released daily.  The opposition negotiators added 
that they had demanded that the referendum take place at the 
beginning of August, before the appeals process for the 
pro-GOV signature drive against National Assembly deputies. 
 
(Note:  August 19 marks the beginning of the final two years 
of Chavez\'s term, after which a recalled Chavez would be 
replaced by the vice president instead via new elections.) 
 
------------------------------ 
Comando Ayacucho Opposes Delay 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy Willian Lara, 
speaking on behalf of the Comando Ayacucho, subsequently 
denounced Rodriguez\'s proposal to delay the regional 
elections.  Lara said the CNE\'s decision to do so would 
unconstitutionally lengthen the terms of mayors and 
governors.  Lara complained that the CNE was giving favorable 
treatment to the presidential referendum at the expense of 
the Comando Ayacucho\'s recall referendum against opposition 
deputies. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Rodriguez\'s announcement is part of the negotiating 
process and is therefore subject to revision.  We take it as 
a sign that talks are progressing.  As Venezuela is headed 
into a four-day weekend for Holy Week, time is running out to 
get agreement on the appeals process before then.  The best 
case scenario of holding the presidential referendum by 
August 8, we note, still carries a risk of delays beyond 
August 19 -- and Chavez could find a way to make that happen.

SUBJECT: PDVSA PRESIDENT RODRIGUEZ COUNSELS PRAGMATISM 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen McFarland; for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) In an April 2 meeting with the Ambassador, Petroleos 
de Venezuela (PDVSA) President Ali Rodriguez counseled a 
\"dose of pragmatism\" for U.S. relations with Venezuela.  He 
defended the recent OPEC decision to reduce production but 
said Venezuela would be able to supply gasoline to the U.S. 
this summer.  He confirmed that Venezuela will swap gas oil 
and fuel oil for Argentine agricultural products, and 
disputed press reports that PDVSA may dismiss employees who 
signed the petitions for a presidential recall referendum. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On April 2, the Ambassador met Ali Rodriguez, the 
President of Venezuela\'s state-owned oil concern PDVSA, to 
discuss issues relating to energy policy and U.S. bilateral 
relations with Venezuela.  The meeting was held at the DCM\'s 
residence as Rodriguez had said he did not want to receive 
the Ambassador at PDVSA or wish to be seen at the Embassy or 
the  Residence.  The DCM and Petroleum Attache also 
participated. 
 
-------------- 
OPEC QUOTA CUT 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Rodriguez defended the recent OPEC output cut, saying 
OPEC Ministers had simply ratified the decision taken at the 
last OPEC meeting.  Rodriguez said global crude oil 
production and demand are balanced but, if anything, supply 
exceeds demand.  In fact, Rodriguez added, he expects that 
demand and prices will drop in the second quarter.  In 
response to a question about how Venezuela will take a cut in 
its quota, Rodriguez laughed and said that Venezuela is 
usually accused of quota busting.  In the current situation, 
with production, he said, exceeding the number quoted by more 
non-PDVSA sources (i.e., more than 2.5 million b/d), 
Venezuela will not face these accusations.  Rodriguez added 
that PDVSA itself will take the necessary production cuts 
although this will, of course, take time to implement.  He 
deflected a question about the possibility of foreign 
producers sharing in the burden of quota-related production 
cuts, by saying this would be difficult to implement because 
of the different contractual terms applying to the foreign 
operated fields.  (Note:  Rodriguez\'s comment that PDVSA 
itself will take the OPEC quota cut is notable.  If 
Venezuela\'s production exceeded the 2.7 million b/d OPEC 
quota level, PDVSA would be likely to request that the 
foreign operators take cuts.  Foreign operators operate 
fields acquired in three investment rounds in the 1990\'s. 
The so-called \"Third Round\" contracts have terms that 
obligate them to take OPEC quota cuts.  These terms were last 
applied in early 2002.  In August 2002, PDVSA requested 
companies to increase production to the maximum which, at 
that time, was believed to be an indication that PDVSA was 
having problems maintaining its own production.  End Note.) 
 
----------------------- 
REFINERIES AND GASOLINE 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador then asked Rodriguez about gasoline 
exports to the U.S. this summer.  Rodriguez maintained that 
Venezuela\'s refineries will export finished gasoline ) not 
blending components ) to the United States.  He added that 
PDVSA\'s senior management will participate in two meetings in 
April to discuss the company\'s business plans.  An April 
14-16 meeting will include a detailed study of the U.S. 
refinery sector and the gasoline market and a discussion of 
the investments needed to improve PDVSA\'s refinery capacity 
at home and abroad.  Rodriguez repeated that PDVSA will 
invest $5 billion in 2004, although 80 percent of this will 
be targeted at exploration and production. 
 
-------------------------------- 
OIL FOR FOOD SWAP WITH ARGENTINA 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The DCM also questioned Rodriguez about his recent 
 
trip to the Southern Cone in which he signed an agreement to 
swap oil for food with Argentina.  Rodriguez confirmed that 
Venezuela plans to ship gas oil and fuel oil to Argentina for 
use in the power sector that has been badly hit by a lack of 
investment.  He added that an Argentine team would visit 
Venezuela on April 5 to confirm the details of the swap in 
which, starting as early as May, Venezuela would receive 
seeds and other agricultural products in addition to meat. 
 
 
------------------- 
NO FIRINGS IN PDVSA 
------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador raised local press reports that have 
held that as  many as 7,000 PDVSA employees who signed the 
petitions for a presidential recall referendum might lose 
their jobs.  Rodriguez dismissed these reports and said that 
only about 900 PDVSA employees had signed.  He refuted claims 
that employees would be terminated due to their signatures 
and said, \"people are leaving for normal reasons.\"  He added, 
however, that he believes there are still instances of 
\"sabotage\" within the company.  He related a story about a 
worker in Zulia who had changed welding materials without 
telling anyone.  The result, he said, could have been a grave 
accident.  \"For me,\" Rodriguez said, \"this is sabotage.\"  In 
other comments about PDVSA staffing, Rodriguez said the 
appointment of the latest PDVSA Board had given him a bigger 
team and taken some of the pressure off him.  Asked about the 
possible move of CITGO\'s corporate offices to Houston, he 
responded that that would depend on whatever enticements are 
offered by the state of Texas.  He noted the logic of CITGO\'s 
being located in the capital of the U.S. petroleum industry. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DYNAMICS OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Turning to a discussion of the bilateral political 
relationship, the Ambassador noted recent verbal attacks 
against president Bush, the Secretary and the National 
Security Advisor by President Chavez as well as threats to 
suspend oil shipments to the U.S.  Rodriguez responded that 
Chavez\'s comments had been intended for a domestic audience. 
The Ambassador questioned this, stating that Chavez had 
repeated his allegations against the U.S. to the Caracas 
diplomatic corps, whom he had summoned for that purpose. 
Rodriguez then pointed to a meeting between A/S Noriega and 
Diosdado Cabello in which they had agreed to avoid public 
comments.  After that agreement, said Rodriguez, the GOV had 
been surprised by comments made by the USG.  The Ambassador 
responded that the USG had also been surprised when National 
Assembly member Nicolas Maduro had made groundless 
allegations against the U.S. within days of that agreement. 
 
8. (C) Noting that Venezuela supplies about 15 percent of 
U.S. oil import, Rodriguez counseled a &dose of pragmatism8 
in U.S. relations with Venezuela.  The Ambassador responded 
that Washington avoided responding to Venezuelan provocations 
and has tried to lower tensions.  Rodriguez then pointed to 
the events of April and December 2002, saying that these 
events and the reaction to them in Washington, had had a 
profound effect on this government.  In recent meetings in 
Washington, he said, he had felt that he had had a positive 
dialogue with the Department of Energy while in meetings with 
the Department of State the tone of that dialogue had 
changed. 
 
9. (C) The Ambassador said Washington is concerned about 
events in Venezuela.  In a democracy, he said, elections can 
serve as an escape valve.  Rodriguez responded that the 
Venezuelan opposition doesn,t have a policy but an 
obsession, i.e., getting rid of Chavez.  Other than this 
obsession, it has nothing - no oil policy, no poverty 
program, etc. - and thus there is no dialogue.  Venezuela has 
many problems and the two sides should be attacking them 
together.  Rodriguez said Venezuela needed to develop new 
models for its economic, political and social life and get 
rid of institutions that are worth nothing.  Efforts such as 
diversifying the economy would, however, take time. 
Rodriguez added that he saw the need to develop a \"culture of 
work\" in Venezuela to replace a culture that expects handouts 
 
of oil wealth from the state.  The Ambassador noted his 
concern that the GOV has become more authoritarian. 
Government functions, such as the granting of contracts and 
documents such as passports, are no longer transparent. 
Rodriguez responded that only selected people had previously 
had access to the state.  He acknowledged the need for a new 
ethic but said, \"even in the U.S. you can have an Enron.\"  He 
also acknowledged, however, that the government has made some 
mistakes and is in too much of a hurry; he observed that the 
GOV was making some of the same mistakes the guerrillas (of 
which he was a member) had made in the 1960\'s and 1970\'s. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C)  This meeting may have been an attempt to convince 
the USG that it should take a more pragmatic approach to the 
Chavez government despite the aggressive and insulting tone 
of the dialogue -- at least on the energy front.  Despite 
Rodriguez\'s claims to the contrary, we are skeptical that 
Venezuela will have to cut production in order to maintain 
its 2.7 million b/d quota.  We are also doubtful about 
Venezuela\'s ability to export finished gasoline products to 
the United States.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) has pressed forward, 
negotiating with the National Electoral Council (CNE) a 
process for verifying petition signatures for a presidential 
recall referendum (CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez announced 
April 6 that the sides were close to agreement).  There are 
dissident voices among the Chavez opponents, chief among them 
Proyecto Venezuela, which has taken a hard line against 
negotiations.  Many CD party leaders privately object to 
pushing for an appeals process, viewing it as a means for 
Chavez to legitimize his rule with the opposition\'s tacit 
endorsement, though they insist, paradoxically, that a 
referendum is the only way to solve Venezuela\'s crisis.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
People Will Blame CD for Inevitable Reparo Failure 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (C) Gente de Pueblo (GP) strategist and pollster Shelby 
Cabezas believes the appeals process (reparo) for the 
signatures presented to petition for a presidential recall 
referendum will fail and bring anyone endorsing the process 
down with it.  Cabezas claimed his polling information 
indicates that the broad opposition umbrella group 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD) is losing popular support in 
lockstep with the \"Chavez controlled\" CNE.  He claimed 
private polling data from mid-March showed 48 percent of the 
public had no faith in the CNE and 45 percent had no faith in 
the CD (down 20 percent since mid-February). 
 
3. (C) Cabezas postulated that the CD is increasingly viewed 
as collaborating in a sham process that will result in the 
legitimization of the Chavez regime.  Cabezas claimed 
negotiating for political objective, such as currying 
international support or obtaining favorable terms for 
regional elections, are lost on the \"common people.\" He 
asserted that the public is losing confidence in CD 
leadership, and \"when August comes and there is still no 
recall, people will be mad not at Chavez, but at the CD.\" 
Henrique Salas Romer, he told poloff, will appear sage-like 
in the aftermath and his Proyecto Venezuela (PV) party will 
reap the electoral rewards.  Salas\' support has risen 12 
percent following his decision not to negotiate, according to 
Cabezas, who speculated that Alianza Bravo Pueblo, Primero 
Justicia, and small movements like GP will eventually abandon 
the reparo process. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Proyecto Venezuela: Reparo is a Trap 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Proyecto Venezuela Deputy Pedro Diaz Blum told poloff 
March 17 that PV\'s hard line against negotiating the appeals 
is risky, but he believes they will be justified when the 
process is revealed as a trap.   He asserted that, based on 
figures released by the CNE March 2, the opposition would 
need a 70 percent turnout to trigger a recall referendum, 
\"impossible in any electoral event.\"  He criticized the OAS 
for continuing negotiations \"after they admitted the process 
was fraudulent,\" legitimizing Chavez and delegitimizing 
themselves. 
 
5. (C) Diaz Blum lambasted the CD for cutting PV out of 
previous negotiations and claimed it exists to promote 
Miranda Governor Enrique Mendoza\'s presidential aspirations. 
He asserted that criticism that PV\'s intransigence is hurting 
the CD\'s negotiating strength is overblown.  Just because PV 
wants to distance itself from old, discredited political 
parties and does not endorse Mendoza, Diaz Blum explained, 
does not mean it will stop working with the CD to get rid of 
Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Construyendo Pais: Going Along, For Now 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) National Assembly Deputy Leopoldo Martinez 
(Construyendo Pais) told poloff March 10 he did not want to 
endorse the appeals process, but he does not want to destroy 
the CD either, as he claimed Salas Romer was trying to do. 
Staying in negotiations may be the only game in town, 
Martinez explained, but it is not without a cost: the 
confidence of the people.  The CD, he said, risks giving 
Chavez legitimacy if it blunders the appeals.  Martinez also 
suspected CD leaders might be using the negotiations to angle 
for favorable conditions for regional elections. 
 
7. (C) Martinez lamented that CD leaders fail to understand 
that Chavez wants the appeals process to \"prove\" the 
signatures are fakes and legitimize his rule.  He claimed 
pressure on signers to recant by screening them for GOV 
employment and benefits is working (ref).  As people 
increasing view the recall as futile, Martinez postulated, 
they may decide not to risk publicly demonstrating their 
opposition to Chavez.  He said Chavistas are also hoping to 
invalidate some 400,000 approved signatures by pressuring GOV 
employees, job applicants, and beneficiaries. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Primero Justicia Divided Over Appeals Process 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) National Assembly Deputy Carlos Ocariz told poloff 
April 1 that the appeals process has created ruptures in PJ 
between those who want to quit negotiating and those, like 
himself, who view continued negotiations as the only way to 
expose the GOV\'s \"fraudulent CNE.\"  Ocariz admitted that a 
failed appeals process might make negotiators \"guilty by 
association\" with the CNE, but walking away, he asserted, 
would only cede legitimacy to Chavez, who would claim the 
opposition rejected a reasonable, legal process.  \"This may 
be a trap we have to walk into.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Un Solo Pueblo: CD Unity Trumps Reparo Doubts 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Un Solo Pueblo Media Director Adriana Sanoja told 
poloff March 26 that although USP has little doubt the 
appeals process will fail, it is going along with 
negotiations.  She said Salas Romer invited USP and other CD 
members to a meeting to gain support for a hard line against 
the appeals process.  Sanoja claimed the effort backfired and 
helped unify them, albeit grudgingly, behind the negotiation 
strategy.  \"He wants to kill the CD, we can\'t be part of 
this,\" she said. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) We continue to promote negotiations to reach 
agreement on an appeals process with both opposition and GOV 
contacts, although we remain aware of the undercurrents 
opposed to doing so.  While many opposition voices have 
condemned Salas Romer\'s refusal to negotiate, other voices in 
the CD correctly point out that embracing negotiation is also 
not without risks.  Negotiation proponents in the CD will 
need to better explain their strategy, particularly to the 
\"common people\" that Cabezas accuses of not comprehending the 
finer points of negotiation, if they want to ensure the 
highest possible participation when, and if, an agreement to 
go forward is reached.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Two chambers of the Venezuelan Supreme Court (TSJ) 
issued conflicting decisions on April 12 regarding the recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  The Electoral 
Chamber issued its definitive decision nullifying the 
National Electoral Council\'s (CNE) disqualification of 
876,000 signatures in support of the recall for similar 
handwriting (\"planillas planas\").  The Constitutional Chamber 
issued on the same day its decision that it is the only 
chamber competent to rule on the referendum.  Opposition 
negotiators had asked the Court to delay the decisions 
because of possible interference with the talks at the CNE 
and are close to an agreement on the process for appealing 
individual signatures (\"reparos\").  CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez said April 6 that if an agreement can be reached by 
April 17, the appeals process could take place as early as 
May 13.  While deadlines never have much bearing in 
Venezuelan politics, we believe that if talks collapse this 
time, the chances of a referendum by August 19 are greatly 
reduced. End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Supreme Court Zig Zags 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) On April 12, the Electoral Chamber issued renewed its 
order to the National Electoral Council (CNE) to validate 
876,000 signatures collected in support of the presidential 
recall referendum that the CNE had originally sent to the 
appeals process due to similar handwriting on the signature 
forms (\"planillas planas\").  The Electoral Chamber gave the 
CNE five days to comply with the decision.  Just hours 
before, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court (TSJ) 
affirmed its earlier declaration that it is the only chamber 
competent to hear cases related to the CNE because it relates 
to the constitutional question of the roles of separation of 
powers.  Constitutional expert Tulio Alvarez told poloff 
April 13 the stage is now set for the two chambers to square 
off in the Plenary Chamber, which consists of all justices 
from the TSJ\'s five chambers.  Tulio Alvarez said it could 
take two months for the Plenary Chamber to make a decision. 
 
3. (C) The CNE released a statement on April 13 saying that 
the Constitutional Chamber\'s decision effectively nullifies 
that of the Electoral Chamber, which the CNE accused of 
attempting to \"co-administrate\" electoral matters with the 
CNE.  Speaking to reporters, CNE Counsel Andres Brito 
rejected the Electoral Chamber\'s authority, saying the CNE is 
an independent branch of government.  Movement to Socialism 
(MAS) President and opposition negotiator Felipe Mujica told 
poloff April 13 that the opposition had asked the TSJ 
chambers last week not to issue their decisions because an 
agreement was forthcoming.  Mujica blamed TSJ President Ivan 
Rincon for ignoring the opposition and moving ahead with the 
Constitutional Chamber\'s decision.  Mujica noted Primero 
Justicia President Julio Borges\' comment that it is now clear 
the judicial path will remain blocked and that the opposition 
now had to finish the negotiations with the CNE. 
 
----------------------------------- 
CNE Talks Reach Make-or-Break Point 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) Director Jorge 
Rodriguez announced on April 6 that if the CNE and the 
opposition can agree by April 17 on an appeals process 
(\"reparos\") for the signatures collected in support of a 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez, it can be 
 
held as early as May 13.  Chief OAS observer Marcelo Alvarez 
told poloff April 12 that it would be impossible to hold the 
presidential referendum before August 19 if an agreement is 
not reached in the next few days.  Rodriguez stated publicly 
that if an agreement is forthcoming, the presidential 
referendum might be held by August 8.  Alvarez warned, 
however, that \"nothing is fixed\" and that Rodriguez\'s 
comments were negotiating tactics. 
 
5. (C) Mujica said the negotiations are like trying to 
\"disarm a time bomb\" due to the risk for the opposition of 
going to the appeals process.  Negotiating the appeals 
process amidst so many uncertainties, he said, is like not 
knowing whether to cut the \"blue wire or red wire on a bomb.\" 
 He predicted that the opposition would go through a wave of 
convulsions as each opposition group expresses their opinion 
once a decision is reached.  This would be the greatest test 
of opposition unity, he said.  Mujica predicted that only 
Proyecto Venezuela (Henrique Salas Romer) would not 
participate in the reparos, if the final agreement is 
workable. 
 
------------------------ 
GOV Negotiating Position 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Alvarez said that CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez is 
under intense pressure from the pro-GOV campaign committee, 
the \"Comando Ayacucho,\" not to yield to the opposition. 
Comando Ayacucho members routinely remark to the press their 
dissatisfaction with the CNE\'s alleged conciliatory attitude. 
 Mujica dismissed this as pure theater, suggesting that 
Rodriguez is taking orders directly from Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel.  Mujica said the GOV\'s tactic is to reach an 
appeals process that is contentious enough to divide the 
opposition over whether to participate.  Mujica predicted the 
GOV would underestimate the opposition\'s cohesion and 
therefore give more concessions than they ought. 
 
-------------------- 
Devil in the Details 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) Alvarez criticized opposition negotiators for 
soft-pedaling on the numbers of signatures eligible for 
appeals.  Mujica said the opposition hoped the CNE would 
declare 1.96 million signatures valid and that 1.3 million 
would go to the appeals process (leaving some 500,000 
signatures to be validated by appeal to reach the 2.4 million 
threshold).  Mujica also said the CNE had agreed to 2,700 
centers for \"five days,\" as stated in the rules, though the 
first and last days would be devoted to set-up and 
dismantling the centers.  The sticking point is the number of 
tables at each center:  some centers would require only one 
while others more than five.  The opposition would like to 
have a formula based on the number of signatures to be 
appealed, but the CNE has in the past imposed a fixed number. 
 
 
8. (C) Alfredo Lazarrabal, of the NGO Sumate, highlighted how 
the numbers are being manipulated by electoral districts. 
When the CNE gave the opposition a revised database of the 
signatures, some 250,000 signatures had been shifted out of 
opposition strongholds in Caracas to remote states where 
Chavez has more support.  Lazarrabal said there is no logical 
reason for the shift other than a concerted effort by the GOV 
to increase the challenge of the appeals process.  Opposition 
negotiator Enrique Naime told PolCouns April 2 that he had 
brought the apparent shift in where rejected signatures 
occurred to CNE Director Rodriguez.  The review of the 
numbers, he said, indicated that the CNE had upped the number 
of invalid signatures by more than 200 percent in some states 
while decreasing them by nearly 50 percent in the capital. 
Naime later noted that the alleged manipulation of the 
numbers, more problematically, was being done at the 
municipal level. 
 
------- 
Comment 
 
------- 
 
9. (C) These are not win-win negotiations.  Each side is 
hoping the other will miscalculate what it will take to win 
or lose the appeals process.  The opposition is convinced 
this will be their final attempt to salvage the presidential 
referendum.  While deadlines never have much bearing in 
Venezuelan politics, we believe that if talks collapse this 
time, the chances of a referendum by August 19 are greatly 
reduced.  If an agreement is struck, we will need to continue 
pressing the various opposition groups to keep working toward 
the referendum.

Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (D 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) A poll and a focus group study on Venezuelan 
politics published at the end of March highlighted President 
Hugo Chavez\' job approval rating falling from 44% to 36%. The 
poll suggests that the National Electoral Council,s handling 
of the signature verification process for the Presidential 
recall referendum may be costing Chavez support. The focus 
group study shows growing frustration with the opposition 
leaders, and a desire on all sides for a more inclusive 
politics, aimed at forging national unity, solving future 
problems, and preventing instability. The poll was done by an 
American consulting firm for a group of Chavez opponents. An 
Argentine consultant, working under the auspices of the 
National Democratic Institute, did the focus groups. END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------- 
Chavez losing support 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) U.S. consultants Greenberg, Quinlan and Rosner 
Research, working for a group of Venezuelans opposed to 
President Hugo Chavez, polled 1,000 likely voters in the 
middle of March. Mark Feierstien briefed the Ambassador on 
the results of the poll on March 27. PolOff obtained 
additional poll information reported here separately on the 
condition it not be disseminated broadly. (Please protect.) 
 
3.  (C) The poll shows that President Chavez, approval 
numbers have declined from 51% opposed-44% in favor in 
October to 60% opposed-36% in favor now. Additionally, the 
percentage of the population willing to vote in favor of a 
presidential recall has risen from 52% in October to 62% now, 
while those who would vote against has dropped from 42% to 
31%. 52% of those polled declared they had voted for Chavez 
in 2000. March,s negative numbers closely resemble those of 
summer 2003, when Chavez, support was at its lowest. 62% of 
respondents disapprove of how Chavez is handling the economy, 
while 37% approve. In the government,s handling of crime, 
71% disapprove and 27% approve. This is significant, as 57% 
of respondent\'s said unemployment was one of their top 
concerns, and 34% put crime at the top, both far above any 
other factor. 
 
--------------------- 
CNE line backfiring? 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Overall support for the CNE has also declined since 
October from 63% to 40%, with disapproval rising from 24% to 
56%. When asked why the CNE had ruled against the validity of 
so many signatures, 64% of those polled said it was for 
political reasons, while 31% said it was for technical 
reasons. There is a strong correlation between respondent,s 
evaluation of the nature of the CNE,s decision, and their 
intention to vote in a recall referendum. This suggests 
Chavez, perceived intervention in the process may be 
alienating voters. 
 
---------------------------- 
Referendum still has support 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Greenberg poll shows 60% of respondents continue 
to favor the recall process, while 30% think Venezuelans 
should give up. A close correlation exists with the 58% who 
fear the failure of the process will lead to violence and 
instability, and the 30% who think things will settle down if 
the process fails. The OAS and Carter Center enjoy the 
support of 69% of those polled, while 25% disapprove. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Little support for anti-US rhetoric 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) 70% of those polled blamed the Venezuelan government 
for the poor state of U.S.-Venezuelan relations, while 76% 
disagreed with President Chavez\' threat not to sell oil to 
the U.S. General attitudes about the U.S. were divided, 
 
according to a part of the poll that measured feelings 
towards various institutions and leaders. The lowest levels 
of support were for members of the government such as Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel, CNE President Francisco 
Carrasquero, Supreme Court Ivan Justice Rincon, and former 
Infrastructure Minister Diosdado Cabello. 
 
--------------------------- 
Shift in political culture? 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Caracas daily El Universal reported April 4 the 
results of Graciela Romer & Associates focus group study 
conducted in February 2003. (Romer has been conducting the 
focus groups under the auspices of the National Democratic 
Institute) The study shows signs of an easing of political 
tensions, and demands for a more inclusive politics, capable 
of bringing the nation together, and solving problems. There 
was a recognition that the present government,s anti-poverty 
agenda was legitimate, and worth saving, and a recognition 
that whatever the outcome of the referendum process, the 
Chavistas are here to stay. 
 
8.  (U) Those questioned seemed increasingly worried, as the 
prospect of an actual referendum grew, of the likely 
long-term result. They stressed the need for the next 
government to have real solutions to the problems of the 
country, and for there to be some way of including the 
political losers of the process in the future political 
consensus. The zero sum game of pro or anti Chavez politics 
is seen by many participants as a dangerous fantasy, which 
fails to account for he fact that both positions have 
entrenched supporters. 
 
9.  (SBU) The Romer study indicates there may be a political 
center space in public opinion that is currently not 
represented in the political leadership of the opposition, 
the government, or the media. (In the poll, 44% of 
respondents identified with no political party.) Opposition 
supporters and independents recognized the value of some of 
the government,s anti-poverty programs, and its political 
mobilization of the country. Meanwhile supporters of the 
President acknowledge corruption and intolerance in the 
government. The study points to an increasing desire for 
national unity, and a tolerant inclusive dialogue on both 
parts. 
 
10.  (U) The focus groups saw the referendum as an 
opportunity to resolve the political impasse peacefully . The 
referendum was not, however, seen as a panacea. Many viewed 
the opposition with suspicion, as having too many links to 
the past, and being unable to present any vision of the 
future beyond getting rid of Chavez. The danger of the 
referendum simply reversing the roles of the opposition and 
the Chavistas, but not stabilizing the political situation, 
worried many of the focus group participants on both sides of 
the political divide. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) The two studies reinforce one another. The GQR study 
indicates Chavez is being punished for undermining the 
referendum and exacerbating polarization since the signature 
verification process started. The Romer study suggests that 
the opposition is failing to generate strong positive support 
among the public, due to its inability to produce a unified 
positive and inclusive message, and the dominant position of 
political holdovers from the pre-Chavez era. The two studies 
are the only measures of public opinion we\'ve seen so far 
this year. They present an important snapshot of the 
political situation as Venezuelans continue to toil to find a 
peaceful solution to the country\'s political impasse.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  Current efforts to ensure loyalty within Venezuelan 
government institutions by using the list of persons who 
signed the recall petition against President Chavez, take 
place against the backdrop of a longer history of politically 
motivated firings and personnel shuffling aimed at cementing 
the administration\'s control over the bureaucracy.  Emboffs 
have received numerous reports of technicians, particularly 
in the economic and trade ministries, being replaced by 
officials who have closer military, party or personal ties to 
Chavez and/or his top advisors.  This trend, which includes 
the October 2003 appointment of a former military officer as 
Minister of Production and Trade, has already begun to have 
significant effects on Venezuela\'s foreign as well as 
domestic economic policies.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
GETTING RID OF THE TECHNICIANS 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C)  Former Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Wilmar Castro, a 
participant in President Hugo Chavez\'s 1992 coup attempt, 
replaced Minister for Production and Trade Ramon Rosales in 
October 2003 (ref A).    This marked a trend within the 
economic ministries of replacing technically sophisticated 
officials at the ministerial and vice-ministerial level with 
persons whose political connections outweighed their 
experience in their new fields.  (Rosales, an academic 
specialist on international trade was a rabid opponent of 
\"globalization\" but was regarded by business as a 
knowledgeable and somewhat sympathetic interlocutor in 
specific issues.)  Since then, we have received other reports 
of politically motivated personnel shifts, reaching 
considerably further down into the ranks of civil servants. 
In December 2003, Eduardo Porcarelli, former Director for the 
Office of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Production and 
Trade (MPC), told econoffs he had resigned from his position 
in September 2003 because he had been increasingly 
marginalized within the Ministry.  Roberto Arias, a trade 
specialist in the same MPC office, also described his 
transfer to a different government job as politically 
motivated and illegal.  Arias told econoff that four people 
in the office had been transferred or resigned within a two 
month period. 
 
3. (C)  Arias and Porcarelli noted the importance of their 
former office to the development and promotion of Chavez\'s 
international economic policies.  Their replacements, who are 
for the most part, political appointees with little 
international trade experience, are now managing preparations 
for WTO negotiations and Venezuela\'s upcoming association 
with MERCOSUR (ref B).  Porcarelli and Arias confirmed the 
accounts of others in MPC, the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Lands, and the Ministry of Planning and Development, that 
technical experts are being sidelined on critical issues. 
 
4. (C)  Jorge Szeplaki, Superintendent of Venezuela\'s 
anti-trust agency (PROCOMPETENCIA), told econoffs his 
organization had been stripped of its traditional role as one 
of the technical advisors in the preparations for FTAA 
negotiations.  According to Szeplaki, the Presidential 
Commission now managing Venezuelan FTAA policy is made up of 
ideologues who have close relationships with Chavez.  The 
President of the Commission, former Vice Minister of 
Industry, and now a board member of Petroleos de Venezuela 
(PDVSA), Victor Alvarez, told econcouns in August 2003 that 
the GOV would lobby to postpone FTAA negotiations until all 
the countries involved had reached \"economic parity\" (ref C). 
 Alvarez is a self-proclaimed opponent of laissez-faire 
economics and the government\'s chief proponent of a Latin 
American-led regional alternative to the FTAA.  The Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, according to Amb. Oscar Hernandez, 
 
Director for International Economic Affairs and former 
permrep to the WTO in Geneva, is completely sidelined on 
international trade negotiations. 
 
5. (C)  Jose Fermin, a career civil servant and former top 
legal advisor in the Venezuelan Patent and Copyright Agency 
(SAPI), told econoffs in January he was one of many dismissed 
from the agency for political reasons.  Fermin said his 
January 2004 removal was ordered by SAPI director Eduardo 
Saman because he refused to fall in with Saman\'s politically 
influenced policies.  Industry contacts confirm that several 
career civil servants with significant technical expertise 
have been dismissed from SAPI as a result of which patent 
applications have been stalled.  Saman is on record as an 
opponent of expanded IPR protection for international 
pharmaceuticals which he views as potentially detrimental to 
Venezuela\'s health care system (ref D).  (Note: When Fermin 
met with econoffs, Saman was in Cuba to discuss the 
implementation of part of the 2000 Venezuela-Cuba Agreement 
(ref E) which calls for cooperation on IPR issues.) 
 
6. (C)  Under Saman\'s influence, SAPI has decreased the 
number of new patents awarded to pharmaceutical products, the 
GOV has instituted a policy of approving domestic copies of 
internationally patented pharmaceutical products for sale in 
Venezuela, and the National Assembly is considering changes 
to the new Industrial Property Bill which would worsen the 
legal framework for protection of intellectual property. 
(Comment: Saman was himself briefly removed from office last 
year by former Minister of Production and Trade Rosales, but 
was returned to his position once Rosales was removed. 
Industry sources say Saman\'s close relationship to Chavez 
facilitated his quick return to SAPI and Rosales\' ouster.) 
 
7. (SBU)  The technical experts in the food sector also 
appear to be targets.  Ministry of Agriculture and Lands 
(MAT) sources tell emboffs that former Vice Minister Oswaldo 
Carnevalli, a respected figure in the industry, was fired in 
June 2003 because he publicly noted the need to raise food 
prices, a realistic assessment which was perceived by his 
superiors as \"counter-revolutionary.\"  His position was 
filled by General Rafael Oropeza.  Former MAT Director of 
Marketing Carlos Abello told emboffs he was pressured to 
resign because he would no longer manipulate the issuance of 
import licenses.  Abello was ultimately replaced by an 
unknown, Irahil Mendez.  Industry sources say costs per ton 
for corn import licenses have recently increased and at least 
one U.S.-affiliated company has not been able to get licenses 
since September 2003. 
 
------------------------------ 
CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME 
------------------------------ 
 
8. (C)  Current MPC Assistant Director of Foreign Trade Nilsa 
Mujica told econoffs the trend of transferring and dismissing 
civil servants could be justified under Venezuela\'s November 
2001 Public Authority Law, which provides the legal framework 
for hiring and firing government employees.  In her words, 
\"the new law makes it easier to remove unproductive personnel 
and decreases labor liability\".  Article 98 of the law 
provides for dismissal of career civil servants if 
administrative changes, office closures, or personnel 
downsizing are required and previously approved by the office 
of the President.  \"Participating in strikes that do not meet 
legal requirements\" is another reason for dismissal of public 
servants under the law. 
 
9. (C)  Mujica complained to econoff that the 2001 law had 
revoked previous safeguards for career employees making them 
almost as vulnerable to abrupt dismissal as political 
appointees.  The situation for public servants was worsened 
by the October 2003 dismantling of Venezuela\'s First Court 
for Contentious Administrative Matters.  The Supreme Court 
called this action necessary to deal more efficiently with a 
high case load, however, the court has yet to be replaced 
with an equivalent court.  The First Court heard cases 
dealing with alleged illegal government actions and acted as 
a court of appeals for illegally dismissed public employees 
(ref F).  According to Mujica, the court almost always found 
in favor of employees in those cases.  She suggested to 
econoff that the absence of any avenue for appeal has had a 
chilling effect on employees who might have considered 
protesting what they see as a trend of politically motivated 
transfers and firings in the economic ministries. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C)  Politically motivated firings and harassment within 
the public sector have become more visible as the GOV targets 
people who signed the recall petition against President 
Chavez.  A longer pattern of replacing non-partisan figures 
in the economic ministries with Chavez loyalists exists.  As 
Chavez seeks to keep his approval ratings up, the importance 
of the ministries that oversee significant domestic 
\"development\" funds as well as overall economic policy, also 
increases.  The GOV is likely to continue to pursue a 
strategy which gives the President more control over the 
bureaucracy and more secure access to funds that could boost 
his popularity.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The Democratic Coordinating Committee (CD) announced 
March 9 that eight opposition protesters had disappeared 
during the February 27-March 5 political disturbances. 
Subsequently, one of the eight reappeared, and the GOV denied 
that the remaining seven were missing, citing the lack of 
complaints by their relatives.  Opposition sources maintain 
that something happened to the seven but lack firm 
information.  Human rights organizations have been unable to 
confirm the status of the allegedly missing individuals, who 
are likely no longer missing but too frightened to come 
forward.  In addition to these seven, the disappearance of 
Dario Gonzales on March 5 was reported by his mother and 
publicized in the press March 30.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Democratic Coordinating Committee (CD) announced 
March 9 that eight opposition protesters had disappeared 
during the February 27-March 5 political disturbances. 
Miguel Pacheco, a Democratic Action party activist, was 
detained March 3 in Cumana, Sucre State.  Since security 
forces failed to notify his family of his detention, he was 
listed as disappeared.  Pacheco reappeared March 10 in Puerto 
Ordaz, Bolivar State with signs of torture, according to the 
human rights NGO COFAVIC. 
 
3. (U) The whereabouts of the remaining seven protesters 
(Omar Morales, Juan Perez, Juan Sanchez, Andres Bastidas, 
Jose Rodriguez, Eduardo Miranda, and Julio Gomez) is still a 
matter of dispute.  Abdel Naime, president of the Freedom 
Commandos (linked to the radical Democratic Bloc), told the 
CD that the seven, all members of the Freedom Commandos, had 
been protesting in or near the central highway of Caracas 
when they were detained by the National Guard and Military 
Police.  Naime told the CD he believed all seven had been 
killed.  D\'lsa Solorzano, head of the CD Judicial Commission, 
told reporters April 10 that the CD released the names to the 
media in an attempt to find out what happened to them. 
 
4. (U) German Mundarain, Human Rights Ombudsman, issued a 
statement March 29 denying that the seven men were missing. 
He noted that the CD had called on their families to provide 
more information and to make formal complaints of the 
disappearances, but none had done so to date.  The lack of 
complaints, Mundarain implied, indicated that no one was 
missing.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel similarly 
discounted the allegations. 
 
5. (C) Lisette Behrens of the CD\'s Judicial Commission told 
poloff April 6 that she has serious doubts regarding the 
reliability of the information provided by Abdel Naime. 
Behrens says she has known Naime for several years and 
described him as \"radical and crazy.\"  In addition, she finds 
it strange that the families of the missing men have 
completely refused to provide any information to the CD.  She 
believes the most plausible explanation is that the men were 
detained and later released, and they and their families are 
now too frightened to come forward with complaints or even 
the news that the missing persons have been found.  Her 
theory is somewhat bolstered by the opposite actions taken in 
another disappearance reported by the daily TalCual March 30. 
 Dario Gonzalez left his home March 5 and never returned, 
according to his mother.  Besides taking her son\'s 
disappearance to the press, Mrs. Gonzalez filed a missing 
persons report with the authorities. 
 
6. (U) COFAVIC investigated the cases of the seven men 
reported missing by Abdel Naime but was unable to discover 
their fate or confirm anything at all regarding what happened 
to them, according to a report issued March 18. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) It is probably true that the opposition released the 
names of missing people in the hope of obtaining information 
on their whereabouts, as the CD\'s D\'lsa Solorzano says. 
 
Reports of disappeared protesters, however, have been used by 
the opposition as a political weapon against the GOV with 
little apparent regard for the reliability of the 
information.  The explanation suggested by Lisette Behrens, 
that frightened families are keeping silent to protect the 
former detainees, seems likely.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Leading Venezuelan national dailies, \"El Universal\" 
and \"El Nacional,\" printed articles April 3 and 4 that 
distort parts of General James Hill\'s March 24 and April 1 
statements on Venezuela to the U.S. House and Senate Armed 
Forces Committees.  Both newspapers\' articles were based on 
an article that ran in the Bogota newspaper \"El Tiempo.\"  The 
Venezuelan version had General Hill saying things about 
Venezuela and President Chavez, which in fact, he did not 
say.  President Chavez then decried USG interference in 
Venezuela\'s sovereignty and Vice President Rangel issued a 
scathing statement condemning Hill\'s alleged statements.  IO 
met with the papers April 12 to clarify General Hill\'s 
remarks.  The next day \"El Universal\" published a 
clarification of the article, noting the inaccuracies of the 
article.  The media appears to have embellished Hill\'s 
statements to discredit Chavez.  The fact that the Venezuelan 
Embassy has a copy of Hill\'s actual remarks and the GOV did 
not check the veracity of the articles with us suggest that 
GOV officials took advantage of the media\'s distorted 
statements to condemn U.S.G. intentions towards Venezuela. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Private Print Media Take the Low Road 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Leading Venezuelan liberal pro-opposition daily \"El 
Nacional\" (circulation around 120,000) and leading 
conservative daily \"El Universal\" (circulation about 130,000) 
printed on April 3 and 4, respectively, articles that clearly 
distorted parts of General Hill\'s March 24 and April 1 
statements before the U.S. House and Senate Armed Forces 
Committees.  Both articles referred to an April 2 article on 
Hill\'s hearings that appeared in Bogota paper \"El Tiempo.\" 
However, the two Venezuelan dailies modified parts of the \"El 
Tiempo\" article, making it appear that General Hill had made 
certain comments about Venezuela and President Chavez that 
were not attributed as such in \"El Tiempo.\" 
 
3.  (C)  The \"El Nacional\" headline read, \"General Hill 
Accused Chavez of Decimating Citizens\' Rights.\"  The El 
Universal\" headline blared, \"General Hill Accused Chavez of 
Being a Radical Populist.\"  Both headlines were inaccurate; 
General Hill did not/not make specific reference to Venezuela 
or its president when he commented on the loss in citizens\' 
rights or the phenomenon of radical populism in some of the 
region\'s nations.  (Comment:  Though one could conclude that 
Venezuela and Chavez, along with some other countries and 
their leaders were on General Hill\'s mind when he made these 
remarks, these two pro-opposition papers appeared to have 
embellished Hill\'s words to fit the papers\' and the 
opposition\'s apparent interests to discredit Chavez and drive 
an even bigger contentious wedge between the U.S. and 
Venezuelan governments.  End Comment.)

What Hill Said 
-------------- 
 
4.  (U)  March 24 House Hearing: 
 
--The security picture in Latin America and the Caribbean has 
grown more complex over the past year.  Colombia\'s 
considerable progress in the battle against narcoterrorism is 
offset by negative developments elsewhere in the region, 
particularly in Haiti, Bolivia, and Venezuela. 
 
--These traditional threats are now complemented by an 
emerging threat best described as radical populism, in which 
the democratic process is undermined to decrease rather than 
protect individual rights.  Some leaders in the region are 
tapping in deep-seated frustrations of the failure of 
democratic reforms to deliver expected goods and services. 
By tapping into these frustrations, which run concurrently 
with frustrations caused by social and economic inequality, 
the leaders are at the same time able to reinforce their 
radical positions by inflaming anti-U.S. sentiment.  (Note: 
This segment of General Hill\'s remarks does not/not make 
direct reference to either Venezuela or President Chavez. 
End Note.) 
 
--Venezuela remains an oil-rich nation that provides some 13 
percent of oil imported into the United States.  The domestic 
 
 
political situation continues to be exceedingly complex, and 
the prospects of the presidential recall referendum are still 
in considerable doubt.  Venezuelan society is deeply 
polarized and will continue to be so, as long as the 
government of Venezuela continues along an authoritarian 
path.  Well-organized street protests numbering in the 
hundreds of thousands occurred on a frequent basis over the 
past year.  (Note: El Universal and El Nacional reported 
accurately on this segment. End Note.) 
 
5.  (U)  April 1 Senate Hearing: 
 
--The security picture in Latin American and the Caribbean 
has indeed grown more complex over the past year, as events 
in Haiti, Bolivia, and Venezuela amply illustrate. 
Deep-seated frustrations over the failure of democratic and 
free-market reforms to improve the standard of living for all 
citizens are significantly challenging many of the region\'s 
governments.  This frustration is exacerbated by endemic 
corruption and by the insidious impact of society of the 
threats I addressed last year -narcoterrorism, urban gangs 
and other illegal armed groups, arms and human trafficking, 
and support to international terrorism. 
 
--Question (Senator Bill Nelson):  Does this committee need 
to take note of any of the terrorist and narcotrafficking 
that is going on in Colombia that might be seeping into 
Venezuela? 
 
--Response (General Hill):  The borders of all the countries 
that border Colombia are porous.  The most porous of those 
borders is the Venezuelan border.  An the Colombians have let 
it be known in strong terms at the presidential level and at 
the military level that the Venezuelans need to do more on 
the other side of the border, and they need to. 
 
--Question (Senator Bill Nelson):  Are we seeing any of the 
kidnapping that has been in Colombia start moving over into 
Venezuela?  Response (General Hill):  Sir, there\'s always 
been not only FARC but ELN and AUC presence in the Venezuelan 
side of the border, and they go back and forth with 
essentially impunity into Colombia.  And kidnapping does, in 
fact, take place on both sides of the border. 
 
--Question (Senator Bill Nelson):  In these upcoming 
elections in the Dominican Republic that we\'re worried about 
some questions of honesty in the elections, do you have a 
force structure that you can call on if chaos were to erupt 
there, or, for example, in Venezuela, where the interests of 
Americans were suddenly threatened, that you would be able to 
get your hands of the assets to respond to that? 
 
--Response (General Hill):  We very quickly put in a Marine 
fast team into the embassy in Haiti, in a matter of hours, to 
bolster the Marine force defending the embassy in Haiti.  We 
were able to put in marines and follow-on forces from the 
French and the Chileans within a matter of 24 hours into 
Haiti.  There\'s no doubt in my mind that we can respond in 
may area in the United States administration wants to do 
that.  (Note/Comment:  Neither the GOV nor the Venezuelan 
media appear to have picked up on this potentially explosive 
question and response.  The Chavez government could easily 
distort General Hill\'s response and claim that Hill\'s message 
confirms Chavez\'s accusations that the U.S. is considering a 
military intervention in Venezuela.   It is possible the GOV 
is keeping it under its sleeve for a more opportune moment. 
End Note/Comment.) 
 
--------------- 
GOV Lashes Back 
--------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Though President Chavez did not enter into the 
details of General Hill\'s most recent statements, he 
lambasted Hill during his April 4 \"Alo Presidente\" program 
for once again interfering in the internal affairs of 
sovereign Venezuela in a manner that was not only improper, 
but also demonstrated Hill\'s ignorance of Venezuela.  The 
same day, Vice President Rangel, who appears to have \"bought\" 
the opposition-leaning papers\' versions of what Hill said, 
issued a scathing statement condemning Hill\'s alleged 
statements.  Rangel\'s main points: 
 
--Hill has a militarized vision of the region, drawn from the 
School of the Americas\' - the bastion of the U.S. national 
security doctrine and a center that forms military dictators 
and torturers - concept of Latin America. 
 
--Hill told the U.S. Senate that Chavez \"uses his position 
 
 
and support to gradually decimate the rights of Venezuelan 
citizens.  This degrades democracy.\"  (Note: Hill did not 
refer specifically to Venezuela or Chavez when he made this 
comment.  End Note.) 
 
--Hill\'s lack of knowledge of the region led him to confuse 
the region\'s struggle for social change with what Hill terms 
\"a radical populism that is becoming a danger to hemispheric 
security.\" 
 
--According to Hill, the popular outcry for a better form of 
life and the search for solutions to the crisis, which is 
caused by unjust political, social, and economics systems, is 
an attempt against hemispheric security.  This is the old 
language of the cold war; the characterization as subversive 
any social change the U.S. cannot handle. 
 
--The capricious definition of populism, which is nothing 
other than profound social change, a new economic model, and 
popular participation, leads to the typical demonizing of 
neo-liberal ideology, whose anachronistic leaders are the 
heart of the power in Washington. 
 
--The GOV does not have an authoritarian bone in its body and 
these remarks constitute an unacceptable insolence on the 
part of a foreign military chief against Hugo Chavez, an 
impeccably, democratically elected leader, which contrasts 
with the origin of President Bush\'s mandate. 
 
--The GOV\'s actions do not degrade democracy; rather the 
irrational opposition\'s systematic acts of terror and attacks 
against the Constitution indeed degrade democracy.  Further, 
the U.S. President\'s aggressive international policies and 
absolute disdain for the United Nations are the object of 
outright world rejection. 
 
-------------- 
Embassy Action 
-------------- 
 
7.  (C)  On April 6, IO wrote to the editors of the papers, 
clarifying what Hill had indeed said and urging the editors 
to confirm with the U.S. Embassy USG officials\' statements. 
IO then met with \"El Nacional\" editor Patricia Spadero and 
\"El Universal\" Vice President Alcides Rojas April 12 to 
convey our concern over the papers\' misrepresentation of a 
USG official\'s statements and to note that this 
misrepresentation could serve to boost the GOV\'s assertions 
that the pro-opposition media distort the truth to dupe the 
populace.  Both papers agreed that parts of their articles 
were inaccurate.  Rojas pointed out, however, that the 
coversheet list of \"El Tiempo\" articles that Reuters wire 
service had sent to El Universal had titled the article in 
question, \"Populismo Venezolano Amenaza la Region:  Estados 
Unidos,\" (\"Venezuelan Populism Threatens the Region\"), while 
the title of the article itself was \"Populism Amenaza la 
Region: Estados Unidos,\" with no specific mention of 
Venezuela or any other country. 
 
8.  (U)  On April 12, El Universal published a clarification 
of its previous article on General Hill, recognizing that 
parts of the article were inaccurate.  Also on April 12, an 
official from Venezuelan Embassy\'s press section called our 
press office to inquire whether the U.S. Embassy had issued a 
clarification that \"El Universal\" had used.  In response to 
our press assistant\'s reply that we had not issued a 
statement and her offer to send the Venezuelan Embassy 
General Hill\'s remarks, the Venezuelan press officer said 
that the Embassy already had a copy. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  The pro-opposition media fell into the temptation of 
discrediting President Chavez by manipulating the words of a 
senior USG official.  Similarly, the GOV, rather than 
attempting to verify the accuracy of the papers\' articles on 
General Hill\'s remarks with the U.S. Embassy, GOV officials 
deliberately took advantage of the papers\' distorted 
statements to once again condemn U.S. government intentions 
towards Venezuela.  The fact that the Venezuelan Embassy 
alleges it has General Hill\'s words, supports this 
assessment.  In Venezuela\'s polarized society, where the 
political stakes are rising by the day, we can expect more of 
this behavior.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) said on April 21 
it will hold the appeals process May 27-31 for signatures 
collected in support of the presidential recall referendum. 
The CNE board approved regulations governing the appeals 
(\"reparos\") but did not immediately release the text.  The 
CNE declared 1.9 million of the signatures collected in 
November 2003 valid, rejected 375,241, and put another 1.19 
under \"observation.\"  The Coordinadora Democratica is waiting 
for the CNE to deliver a definitive database of the signature 
results, expected by April 23, before deciding the 
feasibility of the proposed appeals process.  Several 
opposition figures, however, have already criticized the 
agreement.  Depending on what else the CNE tells the 
opposition later this week, Julio Borges believes the 
opposition would have at best a 50/50 chance of winning 
enough signatures.  The GOV will likely raise new obstacles. 
End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CNE Makes Another Preliminary Announcement 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE), just after 
midnight on April 21, announced that it had approved 
regulations for the process to appeal the results of the 
signature drive in support of a recall referendum against 
President Hugo Chavez.  CNE President Francisco Carrasquero 
announced adjusted totals for the signature drive:  1,919,965 
valid (short of the 2.4 million needed); 375,241 rejected 
(not in the electoral registry); and 1,192,914 eligible for 
the appeals process. (Note:  All signatures except for those 
not in the electoral registry may be appealed, including 
signatures of those who claim they did not sign or wish to 
recant.)  Carrasquero said the appeals process (\"reparos\") 
would take place May 27-31.  The first and last days are for 
set-up and break down.  Carrasquero said these dates would 
allow a presidential referendum to take place on August 8 if 
the opposition meets the legal threshold.  (The appeals 
process for deputies will take place May 21-23, he added.) 
 
3. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters there 
would be 2,659 centers established for appeals.  The centers 
will be open for twelve hours each day and may remain open on 
the last day as long as there is a line.  Centers will be 
equipped with between one and three tables based on the 
number of potential signers, and staffed by more than 23,000 
workers and alternates. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Negotiators Wait For Smoke To Clear 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Coordinadora Democratica (CD) negotiators Felipe 
Mujica and Alberto Quiros told poloff April 21 they had 
reached the agreement the day before with Rodriguez, who then 
had to submit the appeals regulations to the CNE board. 
Minor changes had been made, Quiros said, though the approved 
draft had not yet been circulated.  Quiros believes the 
opposition can win the appeals process, though he admitted it 
would be difficult.  For example, he noted the opposition 
will have to collect 500,000 signatures in states controlled 
by pro-Chavez parties. 
 
5. (C) Mujica predicted the opposition would not come to a 
decision regarding the appeals process until the week of 
April 26, after it had had a chance to analyze the CNE\'s data 
base.  Rodriguez said the CNE will deliver to the opposition 
on April 23 the official data base of signatures for the 
 
 
appeals process.  Mujica said that Henrique Salas Romer\'s 
party, Proyecto Venezuela (PV), is likely not to support the 
CD.  Diez said he had spoken with Primero Justicia (PJ) 
leaders, who said they wanted to study the details before 
giving an opinion.  Quiros also noted that the NGO Sumate 
believes the appeals process as proposed is not viable.  The 
OAS chief observer Marcelo Alvarez_ and Diez told the 
opposition negotiators they believed the process is feasible 
for the opposition. 
 
--------------------------- 
Judicial Avenue a Dead End? 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Mujica said several opposition groups still hold out 
hope that the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court (TSJ) 
will prevail upon the CNE to force the referendum.  Mujica 
described the motives of these groups as a mix of political 
calculations (Proyecto Venezuela) and principled stands 
(civil society groups).  Mujica argued publicly April 21 that 
the political avenue does not preclude the judicial route, 
though he does not believe the latter will succeed.  Mujica 
urged the opposition not to lose the opportunity of the 
appeals process for hope of a judicial resolution. 
 
------------------------------------ 
International Observers At The Ready 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) The Carter Center\'s Diez said he had already spoken 
with Rodriguez about providing an audit for the appeals 
process.  Alvarez_ said the OAS would bring some 30 observers 
if the appeals process takes place.  Both representatives 
said their organizations would avoid public statements over 
the next few days as the details of the appeals process are 
analyzed.  Rodriguez told reporters the CNE planned to invite 
the OAS and TCC, in addition to the UNDP, the head of the 
Uruguayan electoral authority, and a number of prestigious 
individuals. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) On its face, the proposed appeals process appears 
workable, but it does not bring the opposition as close as 
they would like to a formula for getting the number of 
signatures needed to activate the referendum.  Reaching the 
more than 2.4 million signature threshold will not come 
without difficulty -- PJ President Julio Borges told DCM 
(septel) the opposition would have only a 50/50 chance even 
if the GOV played fair, which it will not.  The CNE has 
proven its ability to manipulate this process (ref a), and 
there are a number of as-yet-undefined points that could 
whittle the opposition\'s ability to revalidate signatures 
even further.  The decision moves the ball down the field and 
now puts pressure on the opposition to face one of the most 
crucial decisions in its battle against Chavez.  We can 
expect some minor opposition voices to denounce the appeals 
process; the traditional political parties will likely stay 
on board; Salas Romer\'s PV continues to oppose acceptance of 
reparos.

SENATE VOTE 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The GOV and the National Assembly reacted harshly to 
the vote April 13 by the Colombian Senate to request that the 
OAS consider applying the Democratic Charter to Venezuela. 
Opponents of President Chavez have generally welcomed the 
vote as a sign of international support for the opposition, 
and growing isolation for the Chavez government. GOV 
officials called the Colombian action \"inadmissible 
interference,\" and claimed the USG was behind it. Some people 
in the opposition have warned that such initiatives by the 
Colombians risk stirring up Venezuelan nationalism, and 
represent interference in Venezuela\'s internal affairs. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
Vice-President Rangel 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Venezuelan Vice-President Jose Vicente Rangel accused 
the USG of being behind the resolution, as part of its 
alleged anti-Venezuelan campaign, and as part of a greater 
Plan Colombia. He accused Colombian Senator Enrique Gomez 
Hurtado of acting as spokesperson of the Democratic 
Coordinating Committee, rather than as a representative of 
his own people. He claimed that Colombia had far greater 
political and human rights problems than Venezuela. He 
accused Pedro Carmona, who briefly took over the presidency 
in April 2002 and is now in exile in Colombia, of being the 
intellectual author of the resolution. Foreign Minister Jesus 
Perez called the vote a \"gross interference\" in Venezuela\'s 
internal affairs, but said the National Assembly would give 
the official response to the Colombian legislative initiative. 
 
----------------- 
National Assembly 
----------------- 
 
3.  (U) The National Assembly voted 90 to 25 on April 15 to 
\"categorically condemn\" the Colombian Senate\'s resolution as 
an \"inadmissible interference\" in Venezuela\'s internal 
affairs. The President of the NA Commission on Foreign 
Affairs, Tarek William Saab, suggested that the document had 
been written in English by the U.S. State Department because 
of its alleged poor grammatical construction. At the same 
time the Assembly voted to begin an investigation on the 
\"arms race\" begun by Colombia, and to solicit information 
from the U.S. and Spanish legislatures on sales and donations 
of arms to Colombia. 
 
------------------- 
Opposition reaction 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Many opponents of President Chavez supported the 
Colombian Senate\'s resolution. It was seen as a sign of 
international isolation for the government, and of support 
for the opposition. Opposition editorials, NA deputies, and 
representatives of the Democratic Coordinating Committee 
(DCC) pointed to the vote as a form of moral support for the 
opposition, and a serious warning to the government. D\'Elsa 
Solorzano, head of the Judicial Commission of the DCC called 
it further evidence of the delicate situation of human rights 
in Venezuela. Virginia Contreras, former Ambassador for 
Venezuela to the OAS, called the resolution \"very grave for 
the Venezuelan government from an international point of 
view.\" 
 
5.  (U) Tal Cual editor Teodoro Petkoff criticized the 
Colombian Senate\'s resolution as interference in Venezuelan 
internal affairs. He cautioned political leaders to consider 
that cheering for Colombian interference made their changes 
against Cuban interference sound hypocritical. Petkoff also 
pointed out that Colombia had its own problems, and that the 
invoking of the Charter was highly unlikely. Luis Manuel 
Esculpi, of the Union party, wrote in El Mundo on April 15 
that any initiative coming from Colombia was likely to spark 
a nationalist reaction in Venezuela, and so be 
counterproductive to the opposition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C) The GOV has taken advantage of the Colombian action 
to rally its supporters in the face of a plot, as they have 
packaged it, between Venezuela\'s historic rival, Colombia, 
and the Chavista\'s bete-noir, the U.S. While some Chavez 
opponents wanted to spin the vote positively, it gives them 
little of real benefit, while allowing the Chavista\'s to 
question their patriotism.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Pro-GOV National Assembly (AN) deputies reestablished 
the Supreme Court Law as a legislative priority April 15, 
after the bill laid dormant since 2003.  The Constitutional 
Chamber of the Supreme Court removed potential legal 
roadblocks to the bill with a 3 to 2 January 26 ruling 
asserting the AN could pass the law with a simply majority. 
The law would expand the court from 20 to 32 members and 
allow new justices to be approved by a simple NA majority, 
leading to charges of GOV court packing.  Opposition 
legislators continue a strategy of delay and filibuster that 
began in August, 2003.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Supreme Court Law: From Backburner to Full Throttle 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (U) After placing the Supreme Court Law on the backburner 
since last year, the pro-GOV Bloque de Cambio of National 
Assembly (AN) legislators vigorously resumed attempts to pass 
it April 15.  The Bloque de Cambio approved four articles 
during 16 hours of debate that concluded at 8 a.m. April 16, 
and has continued to debate the bill, albeit with turtle\'s 
progress, in lengthy session April 20.  The Assembly has 
approved 14 of the bill\'s 29 articles have since debate began 
last August due to opposition delay tactics. 
 
3. (C) AN Deputy Leopoldo Martinez told poloffs April 15 that 
he suspects the pro-GoV effort is timed to intimidate Supreme 
Court (TSJ) justices who are considering the validity of 
signatures gathered to convoke a recall referendum on 
President Hugo Chavez (ref c).  He claimed before April 15 
pro-GOV legislators seemed content to postpone the bill\'s 
passage pending a clear result to the recall question, but 
now \"Chavez is cracking the whip.\"  He claimed Chavez is 
playing an \"all or nothing game\" that could backfire as 
justices react defensively to the not-so-subtle bullying. 
 
4. (C) Martinez predicted the pro-Chavez coalition known as 
the Bloque de Cambio could pass the bill in less than a month 
without changing debating rules as they have done in the 
past, by passing marathon session extensions and ignoring 
other pending legislation.  COPEI SecGen Cesar Perez Vivas 
told poloff March 9 that the opposition could stall the bill 
until after August.  The opposition deputies have also set up 
a \"duty roster\" to ensure they have votes on hand for the 
procedural votes to delay action. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
SUPREME COURT FACILITATE PASSAGE OF SUPREME COURT LAW 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (U) The Venezuelan Supreme Court (TSJ) released a ruling 
January 26 clarifying that only a simple majority vote is 
needed to pass the controversial Supreme Court Law in the 
National Assembly (NA).  The Court\'s five-member 
Constitutional Chamber ruled 3-2 that the 1999 Constitution 
did not require a two-thirds majority vote for an organic law 
that modifies an existing organic law.  They argued the new 
1999 constitution only requires a two-thirds majority to 
approve all new organic laws. 
 
6. (U) The decision generated public criticism from 
opposition leaders and current and former members of the 
Supreme Court.  Justices Antonio Garcia and Pedro Rondon, who 
voted against the decision, argued that because the proposed 
law is a replacement for the existing Supreme Court Law, 
which preexists the 1999 Constitution, it should not be 
considered \"new\" nor be subject to the Constitution\'s simple 
majority stipulation for \"new\" laws.  Additionally, they 
claim the ruling destroys the organic designation, a valuable 
legal tradition that protects institutions from political 
tinkering with the stricter two-thirds requirement.  Garcia 
said the ruling gave the assembly a \"blank check\" to 
 
influence government institutions because the new voting 
standard is a majority of legislators present.  Because a 
quorum consists of 84 deputies, Garcia asserted, the law 
could be passed with the support of 43 legislators, or 25 
percent of the 165-person Assembly. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Still Waiting For Rule Changing Session 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) To expedite the law\'s passage, the Bloque de Cambio 
has threatened to speed the process by changing internal NA 
rules, a maneuver they have used six times in the past four 
years.  Opposition legislators warn the new proposed changes, 
including temporary suspensions of deputies for disrupting 
sessions, would make the assembly a rubber stamp for 
President Hugo Chavez and violate their democratic rights to 
participation.  Bloque de Cambio legislators argue that the 
opposition shouldn\'t be allowed to block their initiatives 
indefinitely with stalling tactics. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Law Would Change Court Composition 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) The Supreme Court law, a legislative priority for the 
Chavez government, would expand the court from 20 to 32 
members and allow new justices to be approved by a simple AN 
majority. The current justices were elected by a two-thirds 
majority.  Bloque de Cambio legislators have been trying to 
pass the law from the Assembly floor since August 2002, but 
opposition delaying tactics have minimized GOV progress to an 
average of two articles per session (ref a).  Opposition 
deputies fear the law would allow the Bloque de Cambio\'s slim 
majority to pack the court with pro-GOV justices.  Bloque de 
Cambio legislators argue more justices are needed for the 
increased workload the Court would receive under the law. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The TSJ Law would give Chavez a stranglehold over the 
judicial branch, as the TSJ is also tasked with appointing 
subordinate judges.  It has been a priority for the National 
Assembly\'s pro-Chavez majority for some time.  Opposition 
deputies have not made it easy for the Chavistas to make 
progress on the legislation, but theirs is a losing battle. 
The Supreme Court decision clinched passage of the bill for 
Chavez, and it is only a matter of time before greater 
control of the judiciary is his.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  President Chavez has again raised the threat of 
stopping oil sales to the U.S., this time in response to 
President Bush\'s alleged \"intervention.\"  The remarks, made 
to an Italian newspaper, follow several weeks in which this 
theme had lain dormant (although he has turned to other forms 
of U.S-bashing).  He suggested that China and Brazil could be 
alternative markets for Venezuelan petroleum.  Meanwhile, 
Venezuela\'s latest effort to diversify oil sales away from 
the U.S. involves a food-for-fuel swap to Argentina.   We 
remain convinced that withholding oil to the U.S. is likely 
to be technically difficult and financially costly, but 
clearly this high risk option remains on Chavez\'s mind.  End 
summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Stop Intervening  --  Or Else 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (U).  In an April 18 interview with newspaper 
\"Liberazione,\" organ of the Italian Communist Refoundation 
Party, published in Spanish on the web site of state news 
agency Venpres (and summarized in an Associated Press story 
of the same day) Chavez referred at some length to the 
prospect of Venezuela cutting off oil sales to the U.S. 
Asked if oil could be a weapon for Venezuela, he said  \"It\'s 
one thing for me to say that I do not want to use it, and 
another that they make me use it.  In (President) Bush\'s 
case, he should cease the madness of directly intervening in 
Venezuela\'s internal affairs.  That would spark a conflict 
here, and it would be absurd to continue selling oil to them. 
 Not only the U.S. exists.   Oil doesn\'t deteriorate.  Oil is 
sold.\" 
 
3.  (U)  He went on to add that oil could be sold to Europe 
and Asia.  \"Chinese companies have asked that I increase 
their quota of business with Venezuela.  We can\'t because we 
are part of the OPEC quota.  We sell a million and half 
barrels per day to the United States.  It wouldn\'t cost much 
to place it in other places.  Brazil imports petroleum.  It 
has to buy it in the Middle East.  Why?  Because the strategy 
of the Venezuelan oil company for many years has been linked 
only to U.S. interests.  In the event of conflict, 
contractual obligations would be broken.\" 
 
---------------- 
Previous Version 
---------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Chavez previously raised the prospect of cutting off 
oil sales to the U.S. in a February 29 speech to political 
supporters (ref A).  There, he had said that \"not a drop of 
oil would arrive from Venezuela\" if the U.S. were to seize 
CITGO or otherwise \"blockade\" Venezuela.  He also noted that 
the U.S. had \"plenty of installations\" in Venezuela that 
could be seized in retaliation.  Following these highly 
publicized remarks, he adopted a more conciliatory tone.  In 
a March 9 ceremony, hastily organized at GOV insistence, to 
mark the award of an important natural gas concession to U.S. 
major ChevronTexaco (ref B), he stressed Venezuela\'s 
reliability as an energy supplier and his recognition of 
ChevronTexaco as \"brothers from the U.S. who come not to 
attack us nor show a lack of respect but come to unite with 
us.\"  Since then, until this most recent comment, Chavez and 
his government had dropped the oil threat although other 
anti-U.S. themes have in fact become more prominent in his 
discourse in recent weeks. 
 
--------------------- 
 
Diversification Drive 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  As the oil threat rises and falls, efforts to 
diversify Venezuela\'s energy relations away from the U.S. 
have received some prominence of late.  Venezuela will 
reportedly provide Argentina with up to 8 million barrels of 
fuel oil to make up for energy shortages arising from 
insufficient availability of natural gas, and in exchange 
will take quantities of Argentine powdered milk, soybean oil, 
beef and yellow corn.  Chavez was quoted in Buenos Aires 
daily \"La Nacion\" on April 19, defending the decision in the 
face of allegations that the high sulfur product was 
incompatible with Argentine power generators. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C)  Chavez thinks in political and personal terms, not 
economic.  His threats may just be an effort to unnerve or 
annoy the U.S., but we believe they also reflect his desire 
to become the Latin American David to the USG Goliath.  As we 
have noted before (ref A), making good on a threat to cut off 
oil to the U.S. would be very costly to Venezuela, given that 
its heavy crudes are best marketed to the dedicated 
refineries in the U.S., and even its more desirable light 
crudes would need to be sold at steep discounts to conquer 
new markets.  And the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
remains available to counter the effect on world prices that 
a sudden withdrawal of Venezuelan oil could create. 
Venezuela has high foreign exchange reserves to mitigate the 
domestic economic impact of a cut-off in sales to the U.S. 
Nonetheless, such an oil boycott (in effect a self-imposed 
repetition of the December 2002-February 2003 general strike) 
could have sharp internal consequences.  These include a 
crash of the bolivar on the quasi-legal parallel market, 
which is responsible for half of Venezuela\'s foreign exchange 
needs, possible legal efforts by those customers left in the 
lurch to attach GOV and PDVSA assets abroad, and a 
generalized collapse in business and consumer confidence 
leading to an end to the current modest and extremely fragile 
economic recovery. 
 
6.  (C)  That said, Chavez clearly has not given up on the 
idea.  By making his comments to a European newspaper, he 
gives the lie to the assertions of spin-doctors Bernardo 
Alvarez (GOV ambassador to the U.S.) and Ali Rodriguez (PDVSA 
President) that such statements are entirely aimed for 
domestic political consumption and should be ignored by the 
international community.  We note that he has ratcheted up 
the threat this time and personalized it, raising the 
prospect of taking the initiative to impose an oil boycott if 
President Bush doesn\'t \"cease the madness of intervening\" as 
opposed to doing so only if the U.S. seizes CITGO assets or 
\"blockades\" Venezuela.  At the same time, read in the context 
of the interview as a whole which rambled through the full 
range of political and economic issues, Chavez\'s oil threat 
did not appear to be particularly immediate or even made with 
forethought.  Refusing to sell oil to the U.S., far and away 
Venezuela\'s largest customer, would be at best a high risk 
throw of the dice, which Chavez is likely to consider 
seriously only if our bilateral relations have deteriorated 
considerably more than they have already and he sees such a 
move as important to his survival in power or to his 
ambitions to replace Castro as a regional \"anti-imperialist\" 
leader.

SUBJECT: JULIO BORGES LEANS TOWARDS ACCEPTING 
 
 
Classified By: DCM STEPHEN G. MCFARLAND FOR REASONS 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Julio Borges told DCM and PolOff April 21 that Primero 
Justicia would decide whether to participate in the signature 
verification process once the National Electoral Council 
released details of the plan on April 23 or 24, with an 
opposition decision likely 24 hours later.  He seemed to be 
leaning towards participating in the process, which the DCM 
encouraged.  Borges stressed the need for the international 
community\'s support. He said the opposition had less than a 
50% chance of verifying enough signatures to activate the 
referendum. 
 
--------------------- 
Need more information 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Julio Borges, the President of Primero Justicia (PJ), 
Deputy in the National Assembly, and one of the leaders of 
the opposition coalition Democratic Coordinator (CD), met 
with DCM and PolOff on April 21.  Reacting to the National 
Electoral Council\'s (CNE) announcement the night before of 
the regulations for the signature verification (reparo) 
process, Borges insisted that PJ needed two more pieces of 
information before it could take a decision.  One was the 
number of tables there would be at each center.  Borges is 
worried that if there are not sufficient tables, some people 
may have to wait up to 7 hours, according to PJ\'s 
calculation.  The second point is just which signatures would 
have to be verified, and in what areas.  According to Borges, 
the CNE has already changed the numbers 5 times, and seems to 
be blatantly manipulating them.  He said that the first 
report from the CNE indicated that 50,000 signatures in 
opposition controlled Baruta, which is part of greater 
Caracas, had to be verified.  The figure in the latest report 
is 6,000.  The signatures to be verified are being 
transferred to Chavista controlled states, making it much 
harder, and more dangerous, for the opposition to mobilize 
people.  It also leads Borges to suspect the entire process 
is a massive fraud by the CNE.  For this reason, Borges wants 
to see the final number before agreeing to anything.  Jorge 
Rodriguez, one of the directors of the CNE, told Borges the 
information would be ready by April 23 or 24.  Borges said he 
thought the opposition would come to a decision within 24 
hours of getting the information.  He said to forget about 
trying to get a referendum before August 19th, because the 
GOV will never let it happen. 
 
----------------------- 
Unity of opposition key 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Borges declared that the unity of the opposition was 
of utmost importance at this time.  He said he suspected that 
the GOV\'s real intention with the reparos was to split the 
opposition.  He saw Proyecto Venezuela (PV), led by Henrique 
Salas Romer, as the greatest threat to that unity at this 
time.  PV has made its opposition to the reparo process well 
known.  Borges stated that any help the USG could give in 
that regard would be very useful to the CD.  Borges said that 
if the opposition decides to accept the challenge of the 
reparos, then it will be the opposition\'s last chance to stop 
Chavez, and the CD must present it that way to the public, 
and not as one more attempt to get rid of him.  He said he 
believed the people wanted to go to reparos, despite the bad 
odds, rather than refusing to participate, and challenging 
the legitimacy of the CNE. 
 
------------- 
Odds not good 
------------- 
 
4.  (C) Borges stated that the opposition\'s odds of getting 
the needed signatures were not good.  Under the best of 
circumstances, with no disruption whatsoever from the 
Chavistas, he thought the opposition had a 50% chance of 
getting the signatures.  Even relatively mild interference, 
like sending pro-GOV people to wait on line and check if they 
were on the lists, could bring that down.  Violence and fear 
would make it even more difficult. 
 
---------------------------- 
DCM encourages participation 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The DCM told Borges that A/S Noriega had expressed 
great interest in the decision facing the opposition.  The 
decision was the opposition\'s to make, but it represented a 
very important opportunity and needed to be assessed 
carefully.  He said the international community would 
participate as observers if the opposition agreed.  The DCM 
indicated that the decision by the Electoral Chamber of the 
Supreme Court, that the signatures should be accepted, was 
not very useful outside Venezuela, where the objections of 
the Constitutional Chamber and potentially the full Supreme 
Court tended to nullify the effect of the Electoral 
decision. 
 
 
----------------------- 
International observers 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Borges said that the opposition was essentially 
jumping into a swimming pool without water by going to 
reparos.  He supported it because the people wanted to, and 
to split the opposition would be worse.  He insisted, 
however, that it was up to the international community to 
tell the world \"who took the water out of the pool.\"  In this 
regard, Borges declared himself satisfied with the attitude 
of the OAS, but thought that the Carter Center, and 
especially Francisco Diez, were too wishy-washy in 
criticizing the GOV, and too eager to be liked by everyone. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Borges is clearly leaning towards accepting the 
reparos. While he made the case for pursuing more favorable 
terms through the court system, he agreed with us that the 
judicial route would be long and ultimately fruitless. He is, 
however, very nervous that the opposition will lose the 
reparos, and thus legitimize the CNE and GOV by accepting 
their manipulation of the process. He does not want to be the 
one that splits the CD, though, and so will tend to accept a 
bad deal, depending upon what more information/rules the CNE 
provides the CD on April 23/24.

1.  (U) GOV OFFICIALS REACTED STRONGLY TO REMARKS MADE BY 
    SENATOR BILL NELSON (D-FL) TO THE MIAMI HERALD ON APRIL 18TH. 
 IN THE INTERVIEW SENATOR NELSON HAD NOTED THAT THE U.S. KNEW 
THAT THE GOV WAS AIDING THE FARC, WAS FAILING TO CONTROL A 
BLACK MARKET IN VENEZUELAN PASSPORTS, AND WAS INTERFERING 
WITH VENEZUELAN\'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONVOKE A RECALL 
REFERENDUM.  HE DECLARED THAT THE TIME MAY COME WHEN 
VENEZUELA MAY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED HOSTILE TO U.S. 
INTERESTS. 
 
2.  (U) VICE-PRESIDENT JOSE VICENTE RANGEL SAID THAT MANY 
\"CONCEITED\" SENATORS COME TO VENEZUELA AS \"TOURISTS\", AND 
THEN SAY \"SILLY THINGS\" ABOUT VENEZUELA.  HE SAID HE WOULD 
ASK FOR FUTURE OFFICIAL VISITORS TO PASS A LIE-DETECTOR EXAM. 
 \"WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE NORTH AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WE WANT

\"NELSON GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS A BLABBERMOUTH, 
WHO ARRIVES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THEN, AFTER A

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV released on April 22 a letter sent a week 
earlier by former President Carter to President Hugo Chavez 
registering concerns over delays in the signature appeals 
process negotiations.  The letter offered recommendations to 
the GOV on the parameters of the appeals process and proposed 
an OAS-Carter Center observation mission to monitor them. 
Official press stripped the date from the letter and implied 
that President Carter had congratulated the GOV on the 
completed appeals process negotiations.  Private media 
emphasized Carter\'s criticisms of GOV foot-dragging during 
the signature verification process.  The Carter Center (TCC) 
representatives publicly lamented the GOV\'s decision to 
release \"private correspondence,\" especially after 
negotiations had concluded, and privately explained to 
government opponents the Carter Center position.  The 
letter\'s release briefly influenced opposition discussions 
about participating in the appeals process, but seems to have 
had little damaging effect.  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
The Velvet Glove Approach 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Former President Jimmy Carter sent a letter to 
President Hugo Chavez on April 16, before the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) decided on April 21 on rules for the 
signature appeals process (\"reparos\") for the presidential 
referendum (ref).  The letter congratulates the CNE, the 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD), and the Comando Ayacucho (the 
pro-Chavez campaign committee) for the efforts being made to 
find an acceptable appeals mechanism.  The letter notes that 
the verification process had suffered long delays and 
uncertainties, causing Venezuelans to doubt the integrity of 
their democratic institutions.  Carter recommends specific 
features for the appeals process, such as the use of registry 
books for those contesting the CNE\'s decision concerning 
their signature.  Carter also offers observers for the 
appeals process, and supports the Comando Ayacucho\'s proposal 
to include new observers from UNDP and the European Union. 
 
------- 
Spin... 
------- 
 
3. (C) After the CNE made its announcement, the GOV press 
agency Venpres released the letter on April 21, leaving off 
the date.  The Venpres headline read \"Carter Recognizes 
Efforts of the Executive on the Appeals Process.\"  The timing 
of the release implied that President Carter had 
congratulated the GOV for reaching an acceptable agreement, 
implying that the opposition should take the deal.  Even OAS 
chief observer Marcelo Alvarez_ was confused by the press. 
Despite knowing about the letter last week, Alvarez_ told 
PolOff, he thought Venpres was referring to a new letter. 
 
------------ 
Counter-Spin 
------------ 
 
4. (U) Private media played up Carter\'s criticisms of the GOV 
for the delays in the verification process.  Caracas daily El 
Universal said Carter expressed \"worry.\"  News channel 
Globovision said Carter\'s message was that the appeals 
mechanism would revive confidence of Venezuelans in the CNE. 
CD negotiator Alberto Quiros pointed out on a Globovision 
interview that Carter\'s letter was written before the 
mechanism was defined.  The Carter Center (TCC) tried to 
correct the story to Venezuelan press. 
 
--------------------- 
 
TCC Regrets Confusion 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) TCC Latin America chief Jennifer McCoy told the 
Ambassador by e-mail, that it was \"unfortunate\" that the GOV 
released the private letter under confusing conditions.  She 
said the letter had been intended to encourage the GOV 
negotiators to agree quickly to a workable appeals mechanism. 
 McCoy said TCC would clarify to opposition leaders that TCC 
has not taken a position on the appeals proposal and would 
not advise them on whether to accept it. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) We do not know whether Carter\'s letter caused the 
Chavistas to be more flexible during the negotiations.  The 
letter\'s release, however, was clearly a GOV attempt to 
suggest that President Carter endorses the CNE\'s proposed 
appeals process just at the time that the opposition is 
debating whether to participate.  The letter\'s splash has 
been brief, and does not appear to have had great negative 
effect on opposition deliberations about going to the reparos.

Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
---------- 
Summary 
----------- 
 
1.  (C) In separate meetings, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) 
pressed Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jesus Perez and National 
Assembly Vice President Ricardo Gutierrez on the referendum, 
relations with Cuba, GOV support to the FARC, passport fraud, 
and agrement for Ambassador-designate Brownfield.  Gutierrez 
said close ties with Cuba would not result in a second Cuba 
in Venezuela; he demurred on alleged evidence of USG support 
for the April 2002 coup attempt, saying that President Chavez 
had more information.  FonMin Perez denied GOV supported the 
FARC; expressed concern over USG statements that 
&reverberated8 within Venezuela; said the GOV approved of 
the OAS and Carter Center role in the referendum process; and 
said he would press Chavez on agrement.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Foreign Minister Perez 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) ForMin Perez received Senator Nelson on Saturday, 
April 17.  Also present were the Ambassador, staffer Dan 
Shapiro, the ForMin,s aide, DCM, and conoff.  Perez began 
with the familiar government line on the importance of 
bilateral relations and the need to get through the current 
bilateral differences.  Nelson told Perez up front that he 
perceived that relations were bad.  He stressed that Senator 
Kerry,s earlier statement (posted on his webpage) that 
criticized the GOV and supported the referendum process 
genuinely reflected Kerry,s views; he also stressed that 
Kerry,s statement was not an effort to court the 
Cuban-American vote, which no matter what Kerry said would 
vote overwhelmingly for President Bush.  Nelson said was 
going to meet with presidential candidate Sen. Kerry during 
the following three days, and asked Perez what he should tell 
the Senator about Venezuela. 
 
3.  (C) Perez said the GOV had the will to improve relations 
with the USG.  Unfortunately, relations were badly damaged 
after the April 2002 coup.  The GOV not only supported the 
role of the OAS and the Carter Center, but had invited them 
in the first place. Unfortunately, Perez said, the Venezuelan 
opposition did not want to abide by the rules, nor did it 
accept that there were autonomous institutions that disagreed 
with the opposition (a reference to the CNE (electoral 
council), which is controlled by Chavistas).  The opposition 
sought to politicize the work of foreign observers.  Public 
statements by the USG reverberated throughout the country, 
and Perez &implored8 the US to think carefully about the 
effects of such statements on democracy in Venezuela. Sen. 
Nelson said that good relations indicated that the GOV should 
provide agrement to Ambassador-designate Brownfield; Perez 
said the international cabinet of the GOV had so recommended 
to President Chavez, and that he was hopeful that agrement 
would be approved. 
 
4.  (C) Sen. Nelson turned the conversation to Venezuelan 
support for the FARC; he told Perez that he believed that the 
GOV was adding the Colombian guerrillas.  Perez disagreed; 
Sen. Nelson said that he had seen intelligence to support his 
conslusion.  Perez did not respond. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to document fraud, Sen. Nelson underscored 
the USG concern that Venezuelan passports were easily bought, 
and thus could be openly used by criminals and terrorists 
seeking to carry out attacks in the US and Europe.  Perez 
said the subject is of great concern to the GOV, which had 
inherited a bad situation.  The GOV is developing methods to 
better control passports and identity cards.  (Note:  three 
days later, the Disip police announced arrests of several 
passport procurers.)  Perez said the GOV is waiting to see 
what decision the Andean Community will make regarding a 
common passport for 2005. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Assembly Vice President RicardoGutierrez 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) During his April 16 call on Gutierrez, Sen. Nelson 
emphasized U.S. concern for democracy and worries about the 
very close relationship between Venezuela and Cuba.  Nelson 
was particularly concerned by the series of false statements 
by GOV officials that accused the USG of having carried out 
the April 2002 coup - this was totally false.  Gutierrez 
demurred, saying that President Chavez must have classified 
information that substantiated GOV claims.  Gutierrez 
complained that the USG had also financed groups that had 
participated in the 2002-03 strike, and suggested that USG 
covert operations were taking place in Venezuela.  Nelson 
said this was not the case.  Turning to Cuba, Sen. Nelson 
stressed our concern about Chavez, close friendship with a 
dictator.  Gutierrez said that Castro has wide support in 
Latin America because of his successful social policies and 
because of his anti-US stance.  He defended the presence and 
the work of the Cuban doctors in Venezuela, and said there 
was no way these doctors would indoctrinate Venezuelans with 
Communist ideas. Venezuela was a democracy, and there was no 
risk that a castroite communism would take over. 
 
----------- 
Comment 
----------- 
 
7.  (C) The GOV was caught flat footed by Senator Nelson,s 
interview with the Miami Herald on April 17. Apparently 
ForMin Perez had told Chavez that the meeting went well, then 
had to explain the criticism of the government in the 
interview. Former Foreign Minister Chaderton told the 
Ambassador on April 22 that Ambassador to Washington Alvarez 
had been overconfident about the Nelson visit. The GOV 
consistently mistakes cordiality with agreement, then 
denounces critics as having double-crossed GOV hospitality. 
As a TV channel owner told the Ambassador on April 23, giving 
the interview to a U.S. paper rather than a Venezue3lan 
medium was a very smart decision. Otherwise the GOV would 
have dismissed Senator Nelson,s comments as part of a media 
conspiracy.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  During his April 15-17 visit to Venezuela Senator 
Bill Nelson (D-FL) met with representatives of U.S. energy 
businesses operating in Venezuela, with state oil corporation 
PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez, and with members of the board 
of the Venezuela-U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
(VENAMCHAM).  Energy company representatives outlined the 
situation which they faced in Venezuela and estimated that 
Venezuela produced no more than 2.5 million barrels of oil 
per day.  PDVSA President Rodriguez put the figure at 3.15 
million barrels per day and outlined plans for a major 
expansion of the oil sector.  VENAMCHAM board members, whose 
businesses ranged from food processing to electrical 
equipment, expressed concerns about an overall unfavorable 
business climate.  (Senator Nelson\'s meetings on political 
issues are discussed septel.)   End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Energy Sector Dinner 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Senator Nelson dined with energy sector executives 
representing operators, oil field service companies and the 
trade association of foreign oil companies.  The industry 
representatives underlined that legal stability is their 
primary concern.  They pointed to the mixture of \"radical 
rhetoric with businesslike behavior,\" of the GOV, adding, \"if 
they didn,t need us, none of us would be here.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Turning to a discussion of President Chavez\'s recent 
threats to stop exporting oil to the U.S. (reftel and 
previous), the industry representatives argued that Venezuela 
still needed the U.S. market.  However, they pointed to the 
Libyan example, noting that its production was over 3 million 
b/d when Qadhafi came to power and has now dropped to 1.5 
million b/d.  This reduced income nonetheless has been enough 
to maintain Qadhafi in power.  The industry representatives 
then commented that, with Venezuelan production decreasing 
(they put current production at approximately 2.5 million 
b/d), Chavez may ultimately not need a market the size of the 
U.S. market. (The Ambassador pointed out that Venezuela\'s 
population is five times that of Libya.) 
 
4.  (C)  Senator Nelson countered with a question about 
whether the expectations of the Venezuelan poor can be met 
with dropping oil production.  The company representatives 
noted that the GOV had just made state oil company PDVSA\'s 
2004-2009 business plan public, envisioning a major increase 
in Venezuela\'s production capacity by 2009.  In sum, however, 
despite GOV stated plans to hire more oil rigs, etc., in 
2004, the company representatives anticipated that Venezuelan 
production would continue to fall and that Venezuela,s 
presence in international markets would decrease. 
 
------------- 
PDVSA Meeting 
------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Senator Nelson opened his meeting with PDVSA 
President Ali Rodriguez by telling him that he had met with 
U.S. companies that were interested in producing more oil in 
Venezuela.  \"What are the prospects?\" he asked.  Rodriguez 
responded that the prospects were good.  He said that PDVSA 
had just finished an intensive examination of its business 
prospects and had also just published its 2004-2009 business 
plan in which it envisioned increasing its production 
capacity from 3.8 to 5.0 million b/d.  The U.S., he said, 
would continue to be a major partner. (Note:  Production 
capacity is the amount of production a country believes it 
could produce given optimum circumstances of facilities and 
wells.  Actual production is the amount currently being 
produced.  In the case of Venezuela, the amount of actual 
production claimed by the GOV is under dispute.  End Note.) 
 
 
5.  (C)  Rodriguez said that Venezuela (PDVSA plus the 
 
Strategic Associations under which foreign oil companies 
operate here in partnership with PDVSA) was producing 3.150 
million b/d.  In response to a question by the Senator about 
why others said production is 2.5 million, Rodriguez 
responded that PDVSA\'s production alone was 2.56 million. 
Venezuela, according to Rodriguez, had tremendous reserves 
but the market could not accept an infinite amount of oil and 
must instead be balanced. 
 
6.  (C)  Senator Nelson commented that he had seen a great 
deal of poverty in Venezuela and that, if he were President 
Chavez, he would pump more oil.  Rodriguez responded that 
PDVSA planned to do just that but that it needed do so on a 
rational basis.  Pointing to the extra heavy crude of the 
Orinoco heavy oil belt as an example, Rodriguez said that the 
current seven percent recovery level was too low.  The GOV 
wanted to increase that to 20 percent or more and was now 
examining the development of new technologies with its 
partners.  He added that new laws passed by the Chavez 
government had opened the hydrocarbons sector to new 
investment.  ChevronTexaco, for example, had won important 
off-shore exploratory gas blocks and now Venezuela planned to 
bid out seven more blocks. 
 
7.  (C)  Turning to a discussion of energy policy, Senator 
Nelson noted that oil consumption in the U.S. would continue 
to increase.  He detailed Senator Kerry\'s energy policy, 
saying that the Senator believed it was not good for the U.S. 
to be dependent on Middle Eastern oil.  Rodriguez agreed that 
projections hold that U.S. demand will continue to increase. 
He added that he believed there should be an international 
agreement between producers and consumers.  He noted that he 
had been OPEC Secretary General at a time when prices had 
dropped and added that this volatility affected everyone. 
 
8.  (C)  The Ambassador then asked Rodriguez about the status 
of the Tomoporo oil project.  (Note:  While the GOV has gone 
back and forth on whether PDVSA will develop this large new 
field itself or open it to foreign investment, the most 
recent announcement was that PDVSA would develop it.  End 
note.)  Rodriguez explained that PDVSA is continuing to study 
the development of Tomoporo, the largest new project on the 
horizon.  He added that between 2004-2009, PDVSA\'s business 
plan envisioned $37 billion in investment.  Of this, $27 
billion would be invested by PDVSA while $10 billion was 
anticipated from third parties. 
 
----------------- 
VENAMCHAM Meeting 
----------------- 
 
9.  (C)  In an April 17 meeting, members of the 
Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce  and Industry 
(VENAMCHAM) Board of Directors briefed Senator Nelson on 
increasingly negative business conditions in Venezuela.  The 
members attributed the country,s economic decline to various 
political factors, including endemic corruption and the 
absence of a predictable rule of law.  Board member Alberto 
Mestre, head of General Mills\' operations in Venezuela,  told 
the Senator corruption had increased under the current 
administration and asked for U.S. help in confronting the 
problem.  Mestre also warned of imminent problems in the food 
sector if the GOV continued directly importing food in 
competition with the private sector while simultaneously 
maintaining rigid price and exchange controls.  Reina McPeck, 
coordinator of Venamcham,s small and medium business 
committee, estimated that almost 10,000 businesses had shut 
down in the last year of economic contraction. 
 
10.  (C)  Regional General Electric representative Jose Luis 
Serra told the Senator that Venezuela remained attractive for 
multinationals in comparison with places such as Iran or 
Iraq.  However, he expressed concern about future investment 
given the unpredictable nature of GOV economic policy 
creation.  He noted that the \"rules of the game have changed\" 
when dealing with government entities such as PDVSA, and 
communication has become more complicated.  In response to 
their appeals for investment and support from the U.S., 
Senator Nelson asked the gathered businesspeople what efforts 
they had made to address Venezuela\'s underlying social 
problems as a means of gaining support from Chavez\'s core 
constituency.   They described ongoing projects aimed at 
increasing literacy, providing health care and fostering 
 
 
entrepreneurship.  The members ended by asking the Senator to 
convey to candidate Kerry their call for the U.S. to get more 
involved in Venezuela\'s search for a solution to its 
political crisis.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. CHARLES A.SHAPIRO FOR REASON 1.4 (D). 
 
1.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR HAD BREAKFAST WITH FORMER FOREIGN 
MINISTER, NOW AMBASSADOR-DESIGNATE TO FRANCE, ROY CHADERTON 
APRIL 22.  CHADERTON LAMENTED THE POOR STATE OF 
U.S.-VENEZUELA RELATIONS, AND BLAMED THE SITUATION ON 
SCHEMING COLOMBIANS AND ON MEDIA OWNERS LIKE GUSTAVO 
CISNEROS.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD CHADERTON STRONGLY THAT 
RELATIONS ARE POOR BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE 
PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA HAS BEEN IMPLACABLY HOSTILE TOWARD THE 
UNITED STATES, HAS INSULTED PRESIDENT BUSH, AND HAS 
THREATENED TO CUT OFF OIL SALES TO THE U.S., THE AMBASSADOR 
REMINDED THE FORMER MINISTER.  TO TRY TO BLAME POOR RELATIONS 
ON COLOMBIAN ACCUSATIONS THAT VENEZUELA IS ASSISTING THE FARC 
OR ON MEDIA OWNERS, COMPLAINTS ABOUT INFRINGEMENT ON FREEDOM 
OF EXPRESSION IS SPECIOUS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID. 
 
2.  (C) SEVERAL TIMES, CHADERTON RETURNED TO POSSIBILITY OF 
INCREASING COOPERATION IN SPECIFIC TECHNICAL AREAS.  EACH 
TIME, THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT THE ISSUE IS AN 
INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT THAT COMMITS HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND TAKES REVENGE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SIGNED 
THE PETITIONS FOR THE RECALL REFERENDUM, AND A PRESIDENT WHO 
INSULTS THE UNITED STATES AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.  WHEN 
CHADERTON REITERATED HIS LAMENT ABOUT THE NON-DEMOCRATIC 
NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD HIM HIS 
ANALYSIS WAS OUT OF DATE, THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD EVOLVED, 
HAD MATURED AND HAD SIDELINED THE MORE RADICAL, COUP PLOTTING 
    GROUPS, LIKE THE \"BLOQUE DEMOCRATICO.\"  SINCE THE MAY 29, 
2003 OAS AGREEMENT, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, THE OPPOSITION HAD 
FOCUSED ON THE RECALL REFERENDUM ONLY TO HAVE THE NATIONAL 
ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) STEAL THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION 
PROCESS UNDER GOV ORDERS.  YOU CANNOT PICK YOUR OPPOSITION; 
THE OPPOSITION SELECTS ITS OWN LEADERSHIP, THE AMBASSADOR 
REMINDED THE FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER.

OTHER MATTERS 
------------- 
 
3.  (C) DISCUSSING THE VISIT OF SENATOR BILL NELSON (D-FL), 
CHADERTON CONCLUDED THAT VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. 
BERNARDO ALVAREZ MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVER-CONFIDENT IN HIS REPORT 
TO CARACAS ABOUT WHAT NELSON WOULD SAY PUBLICLY AFTER HIS 
TRIP.  CHADERTON SAID PRESIDENT CHAVEZ INSTRUCTED HIS STAFF 
TO HOLD AGREMENT FOR AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD THE SAME AMOUNT OF 
TIME THAT WE HAD DELAYED AGREMENT FOR ALVAREZ.  CHADERTON 
ALSO SAID FOREIGN MINISTER JESUS PEREZ HAS BROUGHT BACK 
FORMER MFA CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION MADRIZ BUSTAMANTE. 
CHADERTON EXPENDED A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT GETTING MADRIZ, A 
RADICAL CHAVISTA, MOVED OUT OF THE MFA, ONLY TO HAVE PEREZ 
ACQUIESCE IN HIS RETURN.  CHADERTON FEARS MADRIZ WILL PURGE 
THOSE WHO ARE NOT WITH THE PROCESS.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (C) IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT CHADERTON, NOT HAVING THE 
    PRIZE OF THE VENEZUELAN EMBASSY IN PARIS YET IN HAND, HAS NOT 
CHANGED HIS MESSAGE SINCE LEAVING THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  HE 
SPOKE PROUDLY OF HIS LONGSTANDING DISGUST WITH THE VENEZUELAN 
MEDIA.  SEEN THROUGH THIS OPTIC, THE MEDIA ARE TO BLAME FOR 
VENEZUELA\'S PROBLEMS.  THE PROBLEM IS THE MEDIA, NOT THE 
FAILED POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OR CHAVEZ\'S HOSTILE 
RHETORIC TOWARDS ALL WHO ARE NOT PART OF HIS \"REVOLUTIONARY\" 
PROCESS.  GIVEN CHADERTON\'S REPUTATION FOR PROTECTING 
VENEZUELA\'S CAREER DIPLOMATIC SERVICE FROM POLITICIZATION AND 
FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, HOWEVER, IT IS 
SURPRISING THAT CANNOT SEE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF HIS 
GOVERNMENT\'S HOSTILE RHETORIC ON BILATERAL RELATIONS.  NO 
DOUBT THAT CHAVEZ CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON A LOYAL AMBASSADOR 
WHEN CHADERTON GOES TO EUROPE.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s Coordinadora Democratica (CD) decided 
April 27 to participate in the appeals process, scheduled for 
May 27-31, for the signatures collected to petition for a 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  CD leader 
Governor Enrique Mendoza told Poloff April 26 it is 
technically possible to win the appeals, adding that the 
decision to participate in the appeals process would be 
purely political.  Beginning April 23, the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) gave the opposition the data categorizing the 
signatures as valid, under observation, or rejected.  Similar 
data has also been given to the OAS Carter Center and the 
pro-Chavez Comando Ayacucho.  After its analysis of the data 
and the CNE-proposed procedures, the NGO Sumate concluded 
that the key to opposition success will rest with its ability 
to mobilize the millions of Venezuelans who want to recall 
President Chavez.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Coordinadora Approves Reparos 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) announced on April 
27 it will participate in the May 27-31 signature appeals 
process for the presidential recall referendum.  A CD 
spokesperson made the announcement late on April 27 after a 
seven-hour debate within the CD\'s political committee. 
Leonardo Carvajal, who chaired the political committee 
session, told poloff April 28 that about 10 of the 40 
committee members at the outset of the meeting were opposed 
to going.  The NGO Sumate, he said, gave an \"excellent\" 
presentation on the feasibility of the appeals process 
(\"reparos\") that convinced some, he said.  Fence-sitters 
Primero Justicia and Alianza Bravo Pueblo resisted giving 
their support, but finally did so \"under protest\" for the 
sake of unity.  Carvajal said that most groups saw that the 
appeals process, despite its risks, is the only way to hold a 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez by August. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Proyecto Venezuela and Causa R Hold Out 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Henrique Salas Romer of Proyecto Venezuela (PV) sent a 
representative to the CD meeting, as has been his practice. 
Salas did not immediately comment, though Carvajal confirmed 
that Salas was taking a \"calculated\" position not to support 
the CD\'s efforts.  Andres Velazquez of Causa R said his party 
would not participate either because the appeals process is 
designed to make the opposition lose.  Velazquez said the GOV 
had devised a trap that would permit the GOV to allege that 
the presidential referendum had died of \"natural causes, when 
we\'re in the presence of a murder.\" 
 
-------------------- 
CD Reveals Game Plan 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) CD head Enrique Mendoza launched the opposition\'s 
campaign for the appeals process on April 28.  Mendoza said 
the CD would begin immediately to form committees to locate 
persons who must appeal their signatures.  On May 8, Mendoza 
said the CD would re-activate 700 of the signature collection 
centers used during last year\'s signature drive to inform 
citizens of the status of their signatures.  (The NGO Sumate 
planned and will help organize the event.)  Mendoza said the 
CD would \"swear-in\" and train volunteers from May 10 to 17, 
 
 
then put the volunteer networks to work May 18-26 to contact 
every signer that needs to participate in the appeals 
process.  The volunteers will then mobilize the signers to 
get to the appeals centers May 27-31. 
 
------------------------------ 
CNE Continues to Set the Rules 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) began releasing 
the data on the results of the signature verification process 
for the presidential recall referendum April 23.  The 
database, which the CNE subsequently updated two more times, 
was provided to opposition representatives, the OAS Carter 
Center and the pro-Chavez Comando Ayacucho.  The database 
listed 1,910,965 valid signatures and 1,192,914 signatures 
eligible for the appeals process.  Some 900,000 of the 
signatures sent to the appeals process are associated with 
the so-called \"planillas planas,\" signature forms filled out, 
in the same handwriting.  The CNE rejected 375,241 signatures 
outright, principally for errors in the daily tally sheets 
(\"actas\"), unspecified errors in the fingerprints, and for 
contradictions with the electoral registry. 
 
----------------------------- 
Technical Analysis of Results 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Maria Corina Machado of Sumate told the Ambassador on 
April 27 that the NGO\'s assessment of the CNE data indicated 
that the CNE had manipulated it, in demonstrable statistical 
aberrations, to require more appeals in areas where the 
pro-Chavez forces have the advantage.  Machado said that 
under the best scenario, the opposition could go over the top 
with more than 2.6 million valid signatures.  In the worst 
case, they would only be able to match the number 2.46 
million threshold, but would have no cushion of signatures. 
It all depended on the politician ability to mobilize, she 
said.  Fifty-five percent of the appeals are concentrated in 
about 400 of 2700 appeals centers, Machado said.  Disruptions 
at these sites such as violence or inclement weather could 
cause serious setbacks, she warned.  Machado indicated that 
Sumate had advised the CD on the appeals campaign, which will 
include a combination of media ads, websites, cell phone 
messages, political party contacts, and neighborhood 
canvassing. 
 
7. (C) CD technocrats Amado Dounia and Alejandro Vivas also 
told poloff April 26 they believe the appeals process is 
winnable.  The principal challenge, they said, is the 
physical limitation of having only 2,700 appeals centers 
operating for three days.   This puts a cap, they estimate, 
of 800,000 people that can participate, not including those 
who wish to withdraw their signatures from the petition (see 
para 7).  Dounia said they would push the first day to reach 
370,000 appeals because the GOV will try to intimidate 
participants.  Dounia estimates each appeal will take up to 
three minutes to process. 
 
------------------------- 
Chavez Eggs On Opposition 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) President Chavez challenged Venezuelans publicly on 
April 27 to go to the appeals and confirm their signatures. 
He said persons in the opposition are against the appeals 
because an \"immense quantity of the signatures\" were 
fabricated.  The pro-Chavez Comando Ayacucho threw its 
support behind the appeals process, though \"under protest\" 
because the CNE granted too many concessions to the 
opposition.  MVR Deputy Willian Lara told reporters on April 
25 Chavez supporters will be contacting those whose 
signatures were deemed valid by the CNE to convince them to 
retract their signatures during the appeals process.  Lara 
claimed they would eliminate up to 15 percent of the valid 
signatures (286,000 signatures) in this manner because those 
persons had been coerced into signing.  CD representatives 
estimate the Comando Ayacucho may strike up to 50,000 from 
 
 
the valid signatures via this method.  Sumate estimates 
between 100,000 and 150,000. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The Coordinadora is back in its element:  mobilizing 
people.  Venezuelan political life will, for the next month 
at least, have the appeals to sustain it.  To get there, the 
opposition had to sacrifice its principled stand that the GOV 
defrauded their signature drive through unfair rule changes. 
Those holding out for another solution have mostly accepted 
that this fight will not be settled by judges or uprisings, 
but by getting people out in massive numbers to demonstrate 
the will for a presidential recall vote.  The GOV 
underestimated the opposition during the signature drive and 
was forced to react blatantly to damper the opposition 
efforts.  The GOV should be better prepared this round.  We 
therefore cannot overstate the need for international 
observers as a hedge against such tactics, and to underscore 
our message that the international community is scrutinizing 
the referendum process.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV said once again on April 26 that Venezuela 
would continue to be a reliable oil supplier to the United 
States.  The statement was made in response to a story in 
Miami\'s \"El Nuevo Herald\" picked up by all leading Caracas 
dailies the morning of April 26, which alleges that Chavez 
has a secret plan to sell Venezuelan oil to China instead of 
to the U.S.  Industry experts quoted in the press on April 27 
detailed the reasons (from refinery and shipping constraints 
to the size of the price discount Venezuela would probably 
have to offer to China) why such a deal would be a poor one 
for Venezuela.  One expert commented to econoff that, while 
such a deal might be possible, Chinese interest in it would 
be another question, particularly given that it would 
inevitably strain China\'s ties to the U.S. In sum, Chavez 
would have to be willing to impose massive losses on 
Venezuela on purely political grounds.  This cannot be 
discounted entirely since Chavez governs by political 
instinct rather than economic rationality, but we believe 
Chavez is likely to consider cutting off oil exports to the 
U.S. if bilateral relations worsen signficantly, or he sees 
such a move as important to his survival in power.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------ 
OIL TO CHINA 
------------ 
 
2. (U) On April 26, Caracas dailies headlined a story picked 
up from Miami\'s \"El Nuevo Herald\"  alleging that Chavez has a 
secret plan to sell one million barrels per day of crude to 
 
SIPDIS 
China.  Quoting former National Security Senior Deputy 
Constantine Menges, the story states that Chavez \"is not only 
preparing for a radical cut-off of supplies to the U.S., but 
also to use oil as a political weapon in order to impede the 
reelection of President George W. Bush.\" 
 
3. (U) Minister of Communications and Information Jesse 
Chacon later denounced the story, stating categorically (as 
was reiterated in a subsequent press announcement released by 
the Vice President\'s office) that the information was totally 
false.  Chacon characterized the \"El Nuevo Herald\" story as a 
\"dirty war\" story, generated by a columist paid by the 
Venezuelan opposition.  Chacon underlined that the only time 
oil exports to the U.S. had been suspended during the Chavez 
presidency had occured during the opposition-supported strike 
in December 2002.  Chacon continued, \"We hope and are sure 
that this will not occur again, that is, that the U.S. has a 
guarantee that the supply will continue, commercial relations 
will continue to grow, gas concessions have been granted, a 
policy has been designed to diversify our crude and products 
in the U.S....\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BUT, HOPEFULLY, WISER HEADS WILL PREVAIL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) On April 27, Caracas dailies reported Chacon\'s denial 
as well as comments from various industry experts attesting 
to the pain such an action would inflict on Venezuela\'s own 
bank balances.  The analysts quoted in the press cited the 
difficulties of diverting Venezuela\'s heavy, sour crudes from 
the U.S. deep conversion refineries, the problems and costs 
of shipping Venezuelan oil to China vice the U.S., and the 
deep discounts Venezuela would probably have to offer China 
in order to sign such a contract.  Ciro Izarra, the former 
Manager of PDVSA\'s Commercial Division, speculated to the 
press that that such a contract would represent a $2 million 
daily loss for Venezuela. 
 
5. (C) Econoff discussed the possibility of China sales with 
an industry source who commented that it is conceivable that 
China could buy Venezuelan crude.  After all, he noted, China 
already buys orimulsion from Venezuela.  But, he noted, China 
has never run a lot of Venezuelan crude through its 
 
refineries.  He suggested that the Chinese would want to 
purchase a number of test shipments in order to estimate the 
economics of a deal.  Finally, he added, while such a deal 
might be possible, Chinese interest in it would be another 
question, particularly given that it would inevitably strain 
China\'s ties to the U.S.  Turning to the economics of such a 
deal for PDVSA, Venezuela\'s state-owned oil company, he noted 
that PDVSA currently makes its royalty payments to the GOV 
based on the actual prices it receives from oil sales.  The 
Ministry of Energy and Mines is currently pushing, he said, 
to shift to a royalty based on a price formula based on U.S. 
West Gulf prices -- assumed to be the best that PDVSA could 
receive.  Any deal with China would probably inflict huge 
losses on PDVSA.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) The Chavez administration has once again denied any 
intent to divert its oil sales from the U.S. market (although 
President Chavez himself has stated that it might use such an 
option).  On economic grounds, such a decision would be 
monumentally foolish.  Chavez would have to be willing to 
impose losses on Venezuela and on PDVSA on purely political 
grounds.  This cannot be discounted entirely as Chavez 
himself is disposed to stir the pot by his own comments on 
the possibility of cutting off oil to the U.S. (reftel). 
Doubtless PDVSA has been told to analyze all alternatives to 
the U.S. as a commercial partner, but we believe that Chavez 
is likely seriously to consider a cut-off only if our 
bilateral relations have deterioriated considerably more than 
they have already and he sees such a move as important to his 
survival in power.

INTERIOR AND JUSTICE (MIJ) GOV SPEAKERS DISMISSED ALLEGATIONS 
OF VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE DISTURBANCES FROM 
FEBRUARY 27 - MARCH 5.  SENIOR MIJ OFFICIALS CONTENDED THAT 
HUMAN RIGHTS ARE MULTIFACETED, AND THE GOV IS ADVANCING 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS; SECURITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN 
RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE; THE DEMONSTRATORS VIOLATED THE PUBLIC\'S 
RIGHT TO TRANSPORTATION, AND WORK.  PRESIDENT CHAVEZ TOLD THE 
AUDIENCE THAT THE GOV\'S SOCIAL MISSIONS (EDUCATION, HEALTH 
CARE) \"HAVE OPENED A NEW HORIZON FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, RECOGNIZED 
NOW BY THE WORLD.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE MIJ DIRECTORATE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZED THE 
\"FIRST NATIONAL FORUM ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE BOLIVARIAN 
CONSTITUTION OF VENEZUELA OF 1999\" ON APRIL 27 AND 28. 
POLOFF ATTENDED SOME OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  SPEAKERS INCLUDED 
THE ENTIRE LEADERSHIP OF THE MIJ, ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES 
OF OTHER GOV ORGANISMS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS PORTFOLIOS, 
INCLUDING THE ARMED FORCES AND THE PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE.  A 
NUMBER OF SPEAKERS FROM GOV SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND 
MISSIONS SPOKE ABOUT ECONOMIC HUMAN RIGHTS. PLANNING FOR THE 
FORUM BEGAN IN JANUARY, ACCORDING TO MIJ DG OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
MAYERLING ROJAS VILLASMIL, BEFORE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS BY STATE SECURITY FORCES IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH. 

------------------------------ 
INTERIOR MINISTER LUCAS RINCON 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND JUSTICE LUCAS RINCON OPENED 
THE FORUM WITH AN AGGRESSIVELY DEFENSIVE SPEECH, CALLING THE 
BOLIVARIAN CONSTITUTION \"ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE 
WORLD WITH REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS.\"  HE ACCUSED THE 
OPPOSITION OF USING HUMAN RIGHTS TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF 
THE GOV INTERNATIONALLY.  WHILE ADMITTING THAT THE AMBITIOUS 
GOALS OF THE CONSTITUTION HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULFILLED, HE 
ASSURED THE AUDIENCE THAT \"THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION IS 
WORKING ARDUOUSLY TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE ELEMENTAL 
RIGHTS SUCH AS LIFE, HEALTH, EDUCATION AND FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION, WHICH HAVE BEEN CASTRATED FOR ALL THESE YEARS...\" 
  RINCON ATTACKED THE \"HYPOCRISY\" OF OPPOSITION COMPLAINTS, 
AND PRAISED GOV STEPS TO PROVIDE SOCIO-POLITICAL RIGHTS TO 
THE PEOPLE. 
 
-------------------------------- 
DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) IN HER SPEECH, MAYERLING ROJAS VILLASMIL, DIRECTOR 
GENERAL OF THE MIJ FOR HUMAN RIGHTS TRIED TO RECAPTURE THE 
MORAL HIGH GROUND BY DENOUNCING THE OPPOSITION AS HYPOCRITES 
FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AFTER YEARS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES UNDER THE AD AND COPEI GOVERNMENTS.  SHE 
ADMITTED THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS, AND CALLED FOR 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS.  SHE CLAIMED 
    THAT NOW WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT THE GOV WAS 
PUBLICLY TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING HUMAN RIGHTS.  SHE SAID HER 
OFFICE HAD BEEN PLANNING THE EVENT FOR FOUR MONTHS, 
INDICATING THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH WERE 
INCONVENIENTLY RAISING BRUTALITY ISSUES IN A FORUM DESIGNED 
TO SHOW OFF SOCIAL PROGRESS. 
 
---------------------------- 
VICE MINISTER CARLOS BETTIOL 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) VICE MINISTER FOR INTERNAL RELATIONS AND CITIZEN 
SECURITY, CARLOS BETTIOL PRAISED THE GOV FOR ITS 
MULTI-FACETED VIEW OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE ADVANCED NATURE 
OF THE BOLIVARIAN CONSTITUTION.  HE ATTACKED THE OPPOSITION 
AND INDEPENDENT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS FOR QUESTIONING THE GOV\'S 
DEDICATION TO HUMAN RIGHTS, AND CHARGED THAT THE MEDIA AND 
OPPOSITION ALSO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS.  WHILE ADMITTING THAT 
THE STATE HAD GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS, HE EMPHASIZED THE PROTECTION OF COLLECTIVE, AND 
NOT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. 
 
6.  (U) BETTIOL TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT WITHOUT SECURITY NO 
 
CARACAS 00001474  002 OF 002 
 
 LIES ACCUSATIONS 
AGAINST VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES, DEFENDED THEIR ACTIONS, 
AND ACCUSED THE MEDIA OF EXAGGERATING ISOLATED INCIDENTS.  HE 
SAID CLAIMS OF TORTURES AND DISAPPEARANCES ARE ALL LIES. 
BETTIOL ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE DEMONSTRATORS FAILED IN THEIR 
OBLIGATIONS AS CITIZENS BY VIOLATING OTHER PEOPLE\'S RIGHTS TO 
TRANSPORTATION AND WORK BY BLOCKING STREETS IN THE 
DISTURBANCES FROM FEB. 27 TO MARCH 5. 
 
----------------------- 
PRESIDENT CHAVEZ CLOSES 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (U) PRESIDENT CHAVEZ CLOSED THE EVENT ON APRIL 28, AGAIN 
PRAISING THE ADVANCED NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION.  HE POINTED 
OUT THAT DESPITE \"EVERYTHING THAT HAS OCCURRED HERE: COUP 
D\'ETAT, THREATS TO SECURITY, TO SOVEREIGNTY AND DEFENSE, THIS 
GOVERNMENT... HAS NOT SUSPENDED EVEN ONE CONSTITUTIONAL 
GUARANTEE.\"  HE CLAIMED THAT THE SOCIAL MISSIONS THE GOV HAS 
INITIATED \"HAVE OPENED A NEW HORIZON FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 
RECOGNIZED NOW BY THE WORLD.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C) IN THIS CONFERENCE, THE GOV ESTABLISHED ITS VISION 
AND DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
SPEAKERS INDICATE THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS TO 
HIGHLIGHT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE GOV\'S EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE 
    MISSIONS.  OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO THE BOLIVARIAN 
CONSTITUTION AS THE BASIS BY WHICH THE GOV WILL MEASURE 
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, THOUGH THEY DID NOT NEGLECT TO NOTE 
THEY WOULD ADHERE TO INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDS. 
SIGNIFICANTLY, THEY RAISED COLLECTIVE RIGHTS ABOVE INDIVIDUAL 
RIGHTS, BLAMED THE VICTIMS OF ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
BY STATE SECURITY AGENTS FOR VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC, AND ELEVATED SECURITY ABOVE OTHER RIGHTS. 
THIS WAS A TIP OF THE HAT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS -- A GESTURE -- 
AND CONTRASTS STARKLY WITH THE GOV\'S PERFORMANCE.  THE 
ABSENCE OF ANY SIGNS OF REMORSE OR RECONSIDERATION, DESPITE 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN REGARDING THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS THAT 
OCCURRED FEBRUARY 27 - MARCH 5, SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE 
OPPOSITION THAT THE GOV IS PREPARED TO DEFEND ITSELF BY ANY 
MEANS NECESSARY.

SUBJECT: GOV: RENEWED OFFENSIVE AGAINST EX-PDVSA EMPLOYEES 
 
REF: 03 CARACAS 3725 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASON 1.4 (D) 
 
1. (U) THE GOV RESUMED FORCED EVICTIONS OF EX-OIL WORKERS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES EARLY THE MORNING OF APRIL 22 AT THE CAMPO 
MEDICO RESIDENTIAL AREA IN FALCON STATE.  UP TO 80 NATIONAL 
GUARD (GN) TROOPS IN FULL RIOT GEAR SURROUNDED THE HOME OF 
ANDRES AND MARISOL PACHECO AND FORCED THE FAMILY TO VACATE 
THE HOUSE, ACCORDING TO NEWS REPORTS. 
 
2. (C) FANNY GUEDEZ OF THE EX-OIL WORKERS NGO PETROLEUM 
PEOPLE TOLD POLOFF APRIL 26 THAT THE PACHECOS\' 19-YEAR-OLD 
SON HAD BEEN OPERATED ON RECENTLY FOR APPENDICITIS WITH 
COMPLICATIONS.  DUE TO HIS HEALTH CONDITION, THE STATE 
PEOPLE\'S DEFENDER AND THE CHILD WELFARE OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO 
MEDIATE A SEVEN-DAY DELAY IN THE EVICTION, BUT PDVSA 
OFFICIALS REFUSED. EX-PDVSA WORKER LEOPOLDO ROJAS WAS ALSO 
FORCED FROM HIS HOME, BUT GUEDEZ CLAIMS THE GN EVICTED HIM 
WITHOUT A COURT ORDER.  SIX MORE EVICTIONS IN CAMPO MEDICO 
WERE EXPECTED ON APRIL 28, GUEDEZ SAID. 
 
3. (U) IN SEPTEMBER 2003, APPROXIMATELY 300 GN TROOPS AND 
POLICE RAIDED THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS SEMERUCOS NEAR CAMPO 
MEDICO WITH TEAR GAS FOR THE STATED PURPOSE OF EVICTING ONE 
EX-PDVSA WORKER FROM GOVERNMENT OWNED HOUSING (SEE REFTEL). 
THE GN AND ARMY ALSO CARRIED OUT EVICTIONS OF FORMER OIL 
WORKERS IN THE STATES OF MONAGAS AND ANZOATEGUI BUT HAD 
MOSTLY CEASED SUCH ACTIONS BY DECEMBER 2003. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
    ------- 
 
4. (C) THE GOV\'S EVICTIONS OF EX-OIL WORKERS IN THE FALL OF 
2003 ELICITED OUTCRIES FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY, 
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE GN\'S EMPLOYMENT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE 
AGAINST UNARMED ADULTS AND MINORS. ALLEGATIONS THAT THE 
EVICTIONS VIOLATED DUE PROCESS RIGHTS RECEIVED LESS 
ATTENTION.  THE GOV WAS COMPARATIVELY RESTRAINED IN THE APRIL 
22 EVICTIONS, THOUGH THE LEGAL AUTHORITY WITH WHICH THE 
ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT MAY BE LESS THAN CONVINCING UNDER 
CLOSE EXAMINATION.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELA MACROECONOMIC UPDATE 
 
 
-------- 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
1. (U) Venezuela\'s most recently published economic 
indicators illustrate the negative effects of deep 
recession, exchange and price controls, and chronic fiscal 
deficits. Strong international reserves position and high 
average oil prices have contributed to reduce the country 
risk and facilitated the partial public external debt 
refinancing. However, the current political uncertainty is 
affecting the economic decision-making for both the private 
and public sectors. NOTE: Most official data reported here 
does not include Q1 of 2004. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
--------------- 
 
2. (U) Total GDP decreased 9.2 percent in real terms during 
2003 compared with the previous year. This figure was the 
steepest decline in Venezuelan history. The hardest-hit 
sectors were construction (-37.4 percent), commerce (-12.0 
percent), petroleum (-10.7 percent), and manufacturing 
(-10.6 percent). During the last quarter of 2003, Venezuela 
registered a GDP increase of 9 percent after seven 
consecutive quarters of economic recession. A recovery is 
foreseen during 2004 after two consecutive years of severe 
economic contraction.

UNEMPLOYMENT 
------------ 
 
3. (U) Second semester 2003 figures (the latest published as 
of April 28, 2004) from the National Institute of Statistics 
(INE) indicate an unemployment rate of 16.8 percent. This 
figure represents 2.01 million unemployed out of a labor 
force of 12.01 million, and a total population of 25.63 
million. Shifts in the work force from the formal to the 
informal sector of the economy, which accounts for more than 
a half of the occupied working labor force, have mitigated 
unemployment to some extent. However, some economists 
suggest that the informal sector may have reached its 
capacity to absorb new entrants.

OIL PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Oil production and export reductions during 2003 were 
partially offset by the increase in the average export price 
during the year. The total value of oil exports reached USD 
20.8 billion in 2003 with an average export price of USD 
25.7 per barrel. Venezuela\'s OPEC production quota is 2.704 
million barrels a day starting on April 1, 2004. Oil prices 
have been increasing during 2004, reaching a record high of 
USD 30.9 per barrel during the last week of March.

MONEY SUPPLY/M2 
--------------- 
 
5. (U) Monetary liquidity increased 57.5 percent during 
2003, largely as a result of exchange controls. This the 
highest money supply annual increase of the last six years. 
Most of the excess liquidity accumulated in the economy 
during these months was withdrawn by the BCV by allocating 
government bonds and certificates of deposits to domestic 
banks. Liquidity could continue to grow during the first 
half of 2004 because of the expected government expenditure 
increase.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

6. (U) The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) reported that 
consumer prices for the Caracas metropolitan area rose 21.9 
percent from February 2003 to February 2004. Consumer prices 
lagged producer prices, however, as wholesale prices 
increased by 36.7 percent during the same period. (Note: The 
GOV imposed price controls February 11, 2003 on some primary 
 
food items, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products as a 
complement to the exchange control regime.)

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
7. (U) Interest rates reported by the Central Bank in 2004 
continue the downward trend of 2003. Weak credit demand and 
excess liquidity because of the strict application of 
exchange controls were the most important causes of this 
trend. The spread between lending and deposit rates 
decreased from 6.59 percent in January 2004 to 4.72 percent 
in March 2004.

EXCHANGE RATE 
------------- 
 
8. (U) The exchange control system pegged the bolivar at 
1,600/USD on February 5, 2003. One year later, on February 5, 
2004, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank devalued the 
Bolivar 20 percent, to 1,920.00. A National Exchange Control 
Administration (CADIVI) oversees all official foreign exchange 
transactions. CADIVI\'s heavy bureaucratic burden on official 
exchange, Venezuela\'s dependence on imported food and 
manufactured goods, and the petroleum sector\'s need for access to 
dollars have resulted in the official exchange rate being 
overvalued again. The parallel market exchange rate closed at 
around 3,100/USD at the end of March 2004.

MERCHANDISE TRADE BALANCE 
------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Non-oil exports decreased 4.0 percent to USD 4.92 
billion during 2003 compared with 2002. According to the 
INE, exports of base metals (aluminum, steel, iron, etc.) 
accounted for 37.9 percent of total non-oil exports for the 
period, followed by mineral products (19.5 percent), and 
chemicals (15.8 percent). The United States was the largest 
recipient of Venezuela\'s non-oil exports (40.5 percent), 
followed by Colombia (11.9 percent), and Mexico (6.4 
percent). Imports decreased by 21.4 percent during 2003, 
largely because of the imposition of exchange controls.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

10. (U) Venezuela\'s balance of payments registered a surplus 
of USD 5.44 billion during 2003, compared with a deficit of 
approximately USD 4.43 billion during 2002. Exchange 
controls and the resulting fall in imports and capital 
flight have contributed in Venezuela\'s shift from net debtor 
to net creditor.

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES 
---------------------- 
 
11. (U) BCV-held international reserves have been increasing 
continuously since the exchange controls were imposed in 
February 2003. Reserves are currently 53.6 percent above 
their levels one year ago, as foreign exchange transactions 
remain suppressed. Of the total amount of reserves (USD 23.3 
billion) at the end of March 2004, around USD 4.6 billion 
(or 19.7 percent) were in monetary gold.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
12. (U) The fiscal deficit increased as the government spent 
more than expected during 2003, particularly in the fourth 
quarter. The most important sources of non-oil income were 
the value added tax, the income tax, the Central Bank 
profits, and the bank debit tax. The economic recession 
affected the other non-oil incomes such as customs revenues. 
The 2003 fiscal deficit was mostly financed with domestic 
debt facilitated by the excess liquidity in the financial 
sector due to the exchange controls that were imposed in 
February.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT 
------------------ 
 
13. (U) The government was actively refinancing its domestic 
and external debts during 2003. Domestic bonds and treasury 
promissory notes dramatically increased both in the share of 
domestic banks\' portfolio holdings and in the share of the 
GOV\'s debt. During March 2004, the Ministry of Finance 
allocated bonds for the equivalent of USD 3.0 billion, of 
 
which one third were USD denominated with maturity in six 
months, while the rest were in local currency with 
maturities in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

BANKING SYSTEM 
-------------- 
 
14. (U) Recession and low consumer confidence have depressed 
credit demand. The percentage of net loans to total deposits 
decreased from 54.46 percent in December 2002 to 32.69 in 
February 2004. The contraction of the economy during 2003 
also affected debtors\' ability to pay.  The percentage of 
past due loans increased from December 2003 to February 
2004. This figure is lower than a year before, as banks have 
been cleaning up their credit portfolios, declaring more of 
the past due loans as outright losses.

DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
------------------------- 
 
15. (U) New direct foreign investment registered during 2003 
increased to USD 1,174.2 million. Much of this influx was a 
result of major foreign investment in Venezuelan telecom 
giant CANTV.

CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 
---------------------------- 
 
16. (U) The Caracas Stock Exchange (CSE) index closed at a 
record high of 26,579.69 at the end of March 2004, 
increasing 19.7 percent from its close in December. The 
index increased 212.5 percent from its level in March 2003. 
A primary catalyst in this rise is the use of CSE shares to 
acquire American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock 
Exchange that are then used as foreign exchange vehicles. 
However, the CSE has also benefited from the lack of other 
investment opportunities in the broader economy.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Although the opposition has agreed to participate in 
the National Electoral Council\'s (CNE) signature appeals 
process (\"reparos\") on May 27-31, which if successful will 
prompt a recall vote against President Hugo Chavez, most in 
the opposition do not expect a fair and transparent process. 
The CNE already rejected 375,000 signatures on questionable 
grounds and will not permit the signatures to be appealed. 
Chavez opponents also worry that the CNE will manipulate 
other aspects of the process -- such as identity cards, daily 
tally sheets, and on-site computers -- to knock out 
signatures.  They also fear the GOV will continue to convince 
and otherwise intimidate signers to withdraw their names. 
Combined, these efforts may be sufficient to whittle enough 
signatures away from the opposition\'s potential thin margin 
of victory.  End summary. 
 
--------------- 
Fool Me Once... 
--------------- 
 
2. (C) The Carter Center and OAS released a statement April 
30 stating that the National Electoral Council (CNE) had put 
in place the \"necessary guarantees\" for citizens to reaffirm 
or withdraw their signatures from the petition for a recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  While the 
international observers naturally want to instill confidence 
in the May 27-31 appeals process (\"reparos\"), most in the 
opposition are convinced that the GOV will use every 
available method to prevent the referendum.  After watching 
the CNE prune back the 3.4 million signatures collected last 
year to 1.9 million, Chavez opponents are wary of this next 
stage of the referendum process.  The CNE\'s public approval 
ratings reflect this suspicion, falling to 40 percent in 
March while disapproval reached 56 percent, according to one 
poll.  Fifty-one percent of those polled believed the GOV had 
too much influence over the CNE; only 27 percent believed the 
CNE is operating independently. 
 
----------------------- 
Rejected Without Appeal 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) Most difficult to swallow for the opposition is the 
CNE\'s rejection of some 375,000 signatures outright, with no 
chance of appeal, for a variety of reasons, some justified, 
some not.  The NGO Sumate told the Ambassador that about 
250,000 of these signatures should have been eligible for 
appeals.  For example, a viewer called in during a news show 
featuring Sumate to complain that her signature had been 
rejected without appeal for an incorrect date of birth.  The 
Sumate reps pulled up a copy of the signature form and 
compared the information with the electoral registry, which 
matched perfectly.  Another press report showed an identity 
card of a man dead 25 years but whose name appears in the CNE 
website as \"rejected, with right to appeal.\"  While the 
signature was possibly entered fraudulently with the 
deceased\'s information, how this signature passed to the 
appeals category is a mystery. 
 
4. (C) Coordinadora Democratica (CD) spokesperson Jesus 
Torrealba told poloff May 3 these rejections are becoming a 
\"severe problem\" for the CD, not just because of the 
numerical loss of signatures but also because CD negotiators 
had to agree to the figures to advance on the appeals 
process.  Torrealba said the CD is considering a nationwide 
protest at the state offices of the CNE to protest the 
exclusion of these signers.  Also, he said, some opposition 
members are considering legal action.  Torrealba admitted 
that these moves are a way to express frustration rather than 
 
to force the CNE to accept the signatures. 
 
------------------- 
Similar Handwriting 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) During a CD briefing for the diplomatic corps on May 4 
attended by the Ambassador and Polcouns, Alejandro Plaz of 
the NGO Sumate highlighted that the CNE sent 956,388 
signatures to appeal because the signature forms were filled 
out, but necessarily signed, in the same handwriting (the 
\"planillas planas\").  Sumate concluded that 54 percent of 
these signatures were not made with similar handwriting and 
should have been validated.  Plaz said an independent audit, 
reportedly carried out by an unnamed European firm, validated 
Sumate\'s analysis.  (Note:  The audit reveals that, 
regardless of the fairness of applying a new criteria after 
the fact, the CNE did not apply it consistently.  Validating 
even half of these signatures would have put the opposition 
just short of the necessary 2.4 million threshold.) 
 
---------------------------- 
National Identity Card Games 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) OAS chief observer Marcelo Alvarez told poloff April 
22 he believed the verification of national identity cards 
(\"cedulas\") would pose a problem during the appeals process. 
The pro-GOV campaign committee Comando Ayacucho announced it 
was aware of an opposition attempt to falsify identity cards 
to boost appeals.  Ayacucho\'s Ismael Garcia announced May 3 
that his organization will mount an \"anti-fraud operation\" at 
the appeals centers.  Rumors abound among Chavez opponents 
that the GOV will, in fact, falsify identity cards 
corresponding to valid signatures, substitute the photo with 
a Chavez supporter, and then send the person in the photo to 
withdraw the signature.  Mere allegations of identity theft 
like these could also disrupt the appeals process, especially 
if the CNE were to react by changing procedures during the 
three-day period. 
----------------- 
Counting As We Go 
----------------- 
 
7. (C) Opposition members are pleased the CNE agreed to 
execute daily tally sheets (\"actas\") as a record of the three 
days of appeals.  The rules permit international observers to 
collect one of the four copies of each tally sheet, which the 
opposition hopes will reduce the chances for fraud. (Note: 
There are nearly 2,700 appeals centers, far more than the 
expected number of observers.)  The opposition also plans to 
use the tally sheets to monitor daily progress in the 
appeals.  The CNE, however, rejected 120,329 signatures 
collected last year because of missing or incorrectly filled 
out tally sheets.  Chavez opponents also fear the CNE could 
similarly reject appeals. 
 
8. (C) CNE computers stationed at appeals centers with more 
than 100 appeals are also a risk, according to CD reps.  The 
rules state the computers will only be used to check whether 
signers appear in the database and not for counting appeals. 
CD appeals center coordinator Amado Dounia told poloff April 
26 he believes the computers will be used to keep the Comando 
Ayacucho informed in real-time of the appeals results. 
 
--------------- 
Repent, Signer! 
--------------- 
 
9. (C) The Comando Ayacucho claims its supporters will scour 
lists of signers to convince them to \"repent\" and retract 
their signatures (ref a).  National Assembly Deputy Nicolas 
Maduro predicted publicly April 26 that 30 percent of the 1.9 
million valid signatures would be retracted.  Rumors persist 
of intimidation and harassment of public workers, passport 
applicants, and university candidates who signed the petition 
(ref b).  Torrealba asserted that health sector NGOs had 
reported to the CD that public hospitals are denying 
medication to those who signed.  Confederation of Workers of 
 
Venezuela (CTV) Executive Secretary Pablo Castro told poloff 
April 30 the GOV may resort to cash payments to obtain 
retractions. 
 
------------------- 
When The Cat\'s Away 
------------------- 
 
10. (C) CD representative Leonardo Carvajal told poloff April 
28 he believed the CNE, the military units that support 
electoral events, and Chavez would \"behave themselves\" during 
the appeals process, specifically because of the presence of 
OAS Secretary General Gaviria and former President Carter. 
Once they leave, Carvajal asserted, the CNE would find a 
pretext to disqualify enough signatures to sink the 
referendum. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) The victorious appeals scenarios we have seen from 
the opposition rely on close-to-ideal conditions.  While any 
one of the risks outlined above is probably not enough to 
impede the process, a combination of them could whittle away 
enough of the opposition\'s slim margin of victory.  Chavez is 
disposed to use any legal or quasi-legal means to avoid the 
referendum.  The opposition\'s strategy is based on a massive 
turnout to demonstrate popular support and international 
observation to rein in GOV excesses.  Our message continues 
to be support for a fair and transparent process open to 
international scrutiny.

Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The National Assembly completed the second reading of 
the Organic Law of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) April 
30.  The bill, which now goes to committee before further 
consideration by the plenary, would: 
-- raise the number of Supreme Court judges from 20 to 32; 
-- allow the judges to be appointed by a simple majority of 
the National Assembly; 
-- give the Human Rights Ombudsman, Attorney General and 
Comptroller General the power to suspend judges; 
-- and allow the Assembly to revoke judicial confirmations by 
a simple majority.  Chavez opponents believe it will be three 
to five months before new judges are appointed, but are 
concerned that Chavez supporters will move quickly to suspend 
judges they do not like from the TSJ.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Marathon sessions to pass law 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The National Assembly (NA) has been considering the 
Organic Law of the Supreme Court of Justice since January of 
2003.  The pro-GOV majority, called the Bloque del Cambio (BC 
- Alliance for Change) used three tactics to pass the law on 
this reading.  First, they reduced the bill from 179 articles 
to 23, by combining articles and dropping some parts of the 
law.  They also modified internal NA debate rules six times 
to restrict the extensive debates that the opposition had 
used as a delaying tactic.  BC legislators then used marathon 
NA sessions, extending through the night, to push the 
shortened bill through the NA. 
 
3.  (C) Opposition deputies charge that the changes to 
internal NA rules, and the compression of the articles 
violate parliamentary procedures and standards for drafting 
laws.  Primero Justicia deputy Gerardo Blyde told members of 
the diplomatic corps on May 4 that legislators did not see 
amended texts, some of them five to six pages in length, 
until they were brought up for a vote.  NA rules, Blyde said, 
require texts to be distributed five days in advance. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
4.  (C) The bill now goes to the Internal Politics commission 
for fine tuning before being returned to the plenary for 
another vote.  The commission has ten days, but according to 
legislator Leopoldo Martinez, the Bloque del Cambio could 
succeed in turning the bill back to the plenary as early as 
May 6.  The bill would then be sent to the President, who has 
10 days to approve it, send it back to the NA for changes, or 
send it to the TSJ, according to article 214 of the 
Constitution.  Names of GOV supporters are already being 
floated in the papers.  Among those whose names are being 
rumored to be candidates for the new judgeships, according to 
press reports, are NA Deputy Luis Velasquez Alvaray 
(Movimiento Quinta Republica), who led the push to pass the 
law, and Marisol Plaza, the Solicitor General. 
 
----------- 
Main Points 
----------- 
 
5.  (U) Chavez opponents note that the main provision of the 
bill is to expand the number of TSJ judges from 20 to 32. 
The GOV argument is that the extra judges are needed to bring 
down the backlog of cases before the TSJ.  The opposition 
argues it is an attempt to solidify the Chavista\'s hold on 
chambers they already control, and take control of the ones 
they do not.  The law would also allow the NA to approve 
judges with a simple majority vote after three failed 
attempts to get a two thirds majority.  The law would also 
give the NA more control over the appointments committee that 
recommends candidates to the NA, and reduce the influence of 
 
the TSJ on the committee.  According to Martinez, it would 
take three to five months for the first new judges to be 
appointed. 
 
6.  (C) Martinez also warned about two other features of the 
law which will become operative much sooner.  The \"Citizen 
Power,\" composed of the Human Rights Ombudsman, the 
Controller General, and the Attorney General (all Chavista 
appointees) can suspend judges when they have committed 
serious infractions.  This suspension must then be accepted 
or rejected by a two-thirds majority of the NA.  Until such a 
decision, the judge would remain out of office.  Blyde 
asserted that this provision violates the constitution and 
gives Chavez supporters the ability to side-line judges 
without having to convince two-thirds of the legislature of 
the charges. 
 
7.  (C) Another article allows a majority NA vote to remove 
any justice from the TSJ who is found to have made false 
statements in the nominations process.  Martinez said this is 
designed to get rid of Franklin Arrieche, justice of the 
Civil Chamber, and Vice President of the full court. 
According to Martinez, these very rapid steps could give the 
GOV control of the TSJ long before any judges are appointed, 
and in time to prevent an adverse ruling from the full court 
on the dispute between the Electoral and Constitutional 
Chambers over their competency to rule on the Presidential 
recall referendum. 
 
--------------------- 
Opposition Complaints 
--------------------- 
 
8.  (C) In addition to Blyde\'s complaints about the tactics 
used to pass the law, poor legislative craftwork and 
constitutional violation, Carlos Tablante of the Movimiento 
Hacia el Socialismo (MAS) called the bill \"a parliamentary 
coup d\'etat which will gravely injure the Judicial Power.\" 
Teodoro Petkoff argued in his May 4 newspaper column that for 
all intents and purposes, President Chavez is now de facto 
President of the Supreme Court.  Opposition leaders continue 
to examine options to fight the law.  One possible avenue is 
a repeal referendum, which would require the signatures of 
ten percent of the people on the electoral register to 
activate it.  They are also considering taking the law before 
the TSJ. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) With this law, the Chavistas hope to take firm 
control of all the chambers of the TSJ, ending any serious 
judicial review of their actions.  Besides the ability to 
appoint loyal judges, the law gives the Chavistas running the 
Citizen Power a huge stick with which to threaten any judge 
who might dare to oppose the government.  This power will be 
the first to come on line, and may be enough to render the 
opposition\'s judicial strategy moot.  The only real hope for 
the TSJ is if the Court itself decides to intervene in its 
own defense.  The idea of a repeal referendum is almost a 
non-starter, given the history of the presidential recall 
referendum.  The Chavez success on the TSJ law bodes ill for 
other legislation that the revolution has deemed a priority. 
The next target is the media law. No doubt we will see many 
of the same tactics to push the draft through without 
compromise or meaningful debate.

SUBJECT: PRO-CHAVEZ GROUP PLANS LEGAL ACTION AGAINST 
AMBASSADOR 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES S. SHAPIRO FOR REASONS 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The pro-Chavez human rights group ASOVIC delivered a 
letter to the Director General of the Office of the Foreign 
Minister Demir Porras declaring its intention to begin legal 
action against the Ambassador for alleged involvement in the 
April 11, 2002 events.  The group cites alleged training of 
various Venezuelan police forces, recordings of police radio 
transmissions, and the alleged presence of U.S. ships in 
Venezuelan water during the April 2002 events. 
Paradoxically, the letter says ASOVIC will join in the law 
suit against President Chavez currently in the International 
Court of Justice in the Hague, as an interested party.  Asked 
how the MFA will assist the group with the case, MFA official 
Rebeca Guevara (protect) told us the Ministry planned to take 
no action.  ASOVIC joins the chorus of pro-Chavez voices that 
insist on repeating allegations, despite their being refuted 
by the OIG, of Embassy and USG direct involvement in the 
April 2002 events.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------ 
ASOVIC 
------ 
 
2.  (C)  On April 11, the human rights group ASOVIC delivered 
a letter to the Director General of the Office of the Foreign 
Minister Demir Porras communicating its intention to pursue 
legal \"actions\" against the Ambassador. ASOVIC alleges that 
the Ambassador conspired in the deaths and injuries incurred 
by the victims of the April 11, 2002 events.  ASOVIC is the 
National Association of Victims of the Coup d\'etat, a 
pro-Chavez human rights group formed after the restoration of 
Chavez to power in April, 2003.  The group blames the 
Metropolitan Police (PM) for the killings on April 11, and 
claims that most of the victims were Chavez supporters. 
Carlos Correa, Coordinator General of the independent human 
rights group PROVEA, told PolOff on April 28 that ASOVIC 
tends to support the government, and does not cooperate with 
other human rights groups on any projects. 
 
----------------------------- 
Suit against the Ambassador? 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  In the letter, the group says it is informing the 
MFA of the next international actions to be carried out 
against the Ambassador.  ASOVIC asserts it has enough 
evidence to carry out legal actions in U.S. courts, and/or 
international courts.  The only specific action referred to, 
however, is the intention to make itself a party to the suit 
that has been brought against President Hugo Chavez in the 
International Criminal Court in the Hague (using their 
accusations against the Ambassador to defend Chavez).  The 
suit against Chavez has been brought by the human rights 
group VIVE, which PROVEA, the Vicariate on Human Rights, and 
the human right group COFAVIC, also criticized as 
politicized, for its association with the opposition. 
 
4  (C) According to reports on the pro-GOV website 
aporrea.org, Porras told the representatives of ASOVIC that 
the social movements should act autonomously to support the 
GOV\'s international actions to show the world their version 
of what happened in April 2002.  PolOff asked MFA North 
America bureau Chief Rebeca Guevara April 23 how the Ministry 
intended to handle the matter. Guevara said the MFA was not 
intending to take any action. 
 
------------ 
The evidence 
------------ 
 
5.  (U)  ASOVIC uses several standard Chavista accusations to 
support its case.  The first piece of \"proof\" is alleged 
training courses in assault given to the PM Fenix Group, and 
the municipal police of Chacao and Baruta, two opposition 
controlled municipalities of greater Caracas.  The second 
\"proof\" is alleged recordings from the Operations Control 
room of the PM on April 11, which supposedly make reference 
to the Ambassador (allegedly code named \"Zeus 32 Americana\"). 
 The tapes purport to be communications among senior PM 
 
 
officials and the officers in the field on April 11, 2002. 
Pro-GOV groups have claimed that the references to \"Zeus 32 
Americana\" somehow prove U.S. involvement.  Other \"proof\" is 
the alleged presence of U.S. ships in Venezuelan waters on 
April 11, 2002 and the presence of U.S. military personnel at 
Fuerte Tiuna the same day.  ASOVIC calls these \"Acts of 
State\" which led directly to the deaths of their family 
members. 
 
6.  (U) ASOVIC also criticizes statements by NSC Advisor 
Condoleeza Rice, A/S for WHA, and the head of the Southern 
Command accusing the GOV of having totalitarian tendencies, 
and violating human rights. ASOVIC asserts the statements lay 
the groundwork for the coup, along with financing of 
pro-democracy (seen as pro-coup) NGOs.  The association 
presents all this as a plot to overthrow the democratically 
elected constitutional government of Venezuela. 
 
---------- 
Groundless 
---------- 
 
7.  (U) These allegations are part of the standard GOV 
propaganda line. They are baseless.  A special report by the 
Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found: 
 
-- The USG gave no training to the Chacao, Baruta or 
Metropolitan Caracas police forces. 
 
-- \"Zeus 32 Americana\", if it exists, has nothing to do with 
the Ambassador or the Embassy. 
 
-- \"Nothing to indicate that the Department or Embassy 
Caracas planned, participated in, aided, or encouraged the 
overthrow. The record shows that the Department and the 
embassy consistently discouraged the use of undemocratic and 
unconstitutional means to remove the democratically elected 
Chavez government. Similarly, OIG found that U.S. assistance 
programs in Venezuela, including those of National Endowment 
for Democracy (NED), were consistent with U.S. laws.\" 
 
-- There were two US Coast Guard cutters engaged in anti-drug 
exercises with a Dutch cutter on April 11, 2002, and the 
Dutch cutter had a helicopter airborne. But these units were 
100 miles off Orchila Island, not off the mainland coast of 
Venezuela. The exercise was known to Venezuelan officials, 
and had taken place in the past. They had nothing to do with 
the events going on in Venezuela. 
 
-- US military personnel left Fuerte Tiuna on April 11, and 
returned on April 13, 2002 to try to find out who was in 
charge, and had nothing to do with the coup. 
 
-- The OIG report finds \"There was never any attempt to 
advise, support, or otherwise cooperate with, members of the 
opposition.\" 
 
------------------- 
Metropolitan Police 
------------------- 
 
8.  (U) Much of ASOVIC\'s alleged evidence is related to the 
GOV view that the killings in April 2002 were the 
responsibility of the opposition controlled PM.  The only 
people in jail for the events of April 11 today are eight PM 
officers in prison awaiting trial.  A court absolved the 
pro-Chavez gunmen who fired weapons Puente Llaguno at the 
opposition marchers on April 11, 2002, and President Chavez 
declared them heroes of the Revolution in 2003. The court 
that is holding the PM officers is the court that ASOVIC says 
has accepted the alleged PM recordings from April 11, 2002, 
as a valid piece of evidence.  The policemen are being 
charged under a Venezuelan law conspiracy provision.  The 
opposition claims the film of the PM firing on Chavez 
supporters, which is one of the main pieces of evidence 
against the PM, actually shows them defending protesters from 
attacks by Chavez supporters. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) ASOVIC\'s evidence is specious and the threat of 
beginning a case against the Ambassador is part of the GOV\'s 
 
 
campaign to use anti-U.S. rhetoric, and attacks on the 
Ambassador, as a distraction from the presidential recall 
referendum (septel).  The GOV\'s charges are baseless and they 
know it, but the GOV repeats them, presumably in hopes of 
convincing voters that Chavez and the GOV are the defenders 
of Venezuelan sovereignty against an invented US threat. 
ASOVIC has no credibility whatsoever in independent human 
rights circles, and is 100 percent identified with the 
Bolivarian revolution. It is a stalking horse for the 
Bolivarian revolution.

SUBJECT: SECOND SOLDIER DIES OF BURNS FROM FORT FIRE 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (B 
) AND (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Attorney General\'s Office announced May 5 that a 
civilian court will take over the case of an army fort fire 
in Zulia State that resulted in six injuries and two deaths. 
On May 4, Angel Pedreanez became the second soldier to die 
after being severely burned in a Fort Mara confinement cell 
March 30.  The first soldier, Orlando Bustamante, died of 
burn injuries April 4.  (Information Minister Jesse Chacon 
offered his resignation April 5 after Bustamante\'s death, but 
President Chavez refused it.)  Relatives of the soldiers and 
opponents of Chavez accused the GOV of failing to investigate 
the incident properly and covering up for the military. 
Pedreanez\' parents claim that their son was murdered, while 
conflicting accounts of the events have become political 
fodder for both GOV opponents and supporters.  Investigations 
of the incident continue.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
CIVILIAN JURISDICTION 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Attorney General\'s Office announced May 5 that a 
civilian court will take over the case of an army fort fire 
in Zulia State that resulted in six injuries and two deaths 
March 30.  Zulia State Attorney General Mariangela Canga told 
reporters that she had seized records concerning one of the 
deceased soldiers, Angel Pedreanez, and had ordered two 
prosecutors to take over the investigation from the military 
tribunal that had been overseeing the case.  Canga charged 
that the military tribunal had effectively frozen the 
investigation. 
 
3. (U) On May 4, Venezuelan soldier Angel Pedreanez died, 35 
days after he and seven other soldiers were severely injured 
in the army barracks fire.  The eight were confined in a 
punishment cell on Fort Mara.  Though still listed in 
critical condition, Pedreanez was slowly recovering and had 
spoken for the first time April 30 after being taken off a 
respirator.  Hospital Director Crispin Marin told the press 
that Pedreanez died of cardiac arrest during reconstructive 
surgery.  \"I never said he was out of danger,\" Marin said. 
\"I am very careful about such things until the patient leaves 
the hospital.\" 
 
4. (U) Fellow soldier Orlando Bustamante died of burn 
injuries April 4, the same day that President Chavez mocked 
opposition criticism over the handling of the incident. 
Chavez told his audience that the soldiers had only suffered 
light burns.  Information Minister Jesse Chacon offered his 
resignation at the time, saying he had misinformed the 
president on the severity of the soldiers\' injuries, but 
Chavez refused it, saying he was responsible for not checking 
the information. 
 
----------------- 
THE PLOT THICKENS 
----------------- 
 
5. (U) Discussing the incident in an April 1 press interview, 
Gen. Carlos Briceno, Commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 
said the soldiers had been confined to the disciplinary cell 
for various military infractions.  He also denied that the 
fire was anything but accidental.  \"The Democratic 
Coordinator (CD) is saying these guys were injured because 
their families signed the petition (against Chavez), that 
someone threw gasoline in the cell and burned them 
intentionally...they are creating false rumors.\"  Vice 
President Rangel said April 2 that none of the soldiers had 
signed against the president, and that competent authorities 
had already determined that no gasoline had been used to set 
the fire. 
 
6. (C) Military sources first told reporters that the fire 
started when one of the soldiers fell asleep while smoking. 
The director of army intelligence told DAO shortly after the 
incident \"not to believe anything in the press\" about the 
fire, and that a full investigation is underway.  Eddie Rios, 
a pro-GOV member of the special investigative commission 
 
appointed by the National Assembly to look into the matter, 
shared a recording with the press April 2 in which two of the 
victims blamed Pedreanez for starting the fire by smoking in 
bed.  Jesus Carrillo, an opposition member of the special 
investigative commission, asserted in an April 2 press 
interview that Rios reached a verdict without having fully 
investigated the incident.  Referring to Rios\' recording, 
Carrillo asks, \"How could these soldiers who were asleep be 
witnesses to the moment when Pedreanez started the fire?\" 
 
7. (U) During a May 4 press conference, Pedreanez\' distraught 
parents expressed rage and bewilderment.  Claiming that their 
son had been murdered, they blamed the government and charged 
that members of the military had entered the hospital room 
surreptitiously and killed him.  Hospital Director Marin 
disagreed that anyone could have entered unauthorized, saying 
that the hospital had maintained strict security outside 
Pedreanez\' room. 
 
-------------- 
MOD STATEMENTS 
-------------- 
 
8. (U) Defense Minister Gen. Jorge Luis Garcia Carneiro 
pleaded with the press May 4 to refrain from speculating over 
the causes of the fire and deaths while the investigation 
continues.  Garcia Carneiro also expressed condolences to the 
Pedreanez family, offered them full support for any action 
they wish to take on their son\'s behalf, and assured them 
that the armed forces would not object if they want the case 
placed under civilian jurisdiction.  The National Assembly\'s 
Defense Commission approved a plan to reconstruct the case 
events, and Eddie Rios of the special investigative 
commission said the investigation will remain open until the 
cause of the fire has been determined.

9. (C) Defense Minister Gen. Garcia Carneiro\'s response to 
the Pedreanez family contrasts with the military\'s initial 
reaction not only to this case, but also to several other 
recent suspicious death cases.  The military has a long 
history of tolerating abusive behavior among its own and then 
closing ranks when confronted by civilians.  This strategy\'s 
short-term effect should make it easier to diminish 
opposition efforts to use military abuse cases as political 
tools.  Another area of concern, however, is how the 
Pedreanez incident will affect Chavez\' standing with the 
troops.  After the first death, Chavez sought to blunt 
criticism, taking the blame upon himself and shielding his 
officers.  He also went personally to Fort Mara to 
demonstrate his concern.  Now that a second soldier has died, 
a second similar performance may not be as convincing.  We do 
not yet have a good sense of how Chavez will handle the 
matter or what the repercussions will be in the military. 
For their part, Chavez opponents will not cease to use the 
Pedreanez incident to heap shame on the government.

Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) President Chavez would lose a recall referendum, 
though his support remains strong amidst increasing 
polarization, according to two polls conducted in March.  One 
poll suggests Chavez would be revoked 59-41 percent, while 
the other suggests he would be revoked 53-40 percent. Both 
polls show Chavez\' overall support is steady at 41 percent, 
and thus suggest Chavez would be a very strong contender in a 
post-referendum presidential election.   End Summary 
 
-------------------------------- 
Datanalisis - Situation Stable 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Datanalisis conducted its poll, published in the 
Caracas daily El Universal on May 6, from March 17 to 21 with 
a sample of 1,290.  President Chavez has a personal approval 
rating of 41.5 percent, which has been steady in Datanalisis 
polls since November 2003.  The number of people describing 
themselves as Ni-Ni (in favor of neither the opposition nor 
Chavez) declined from 38.2 percent in December 2003, to 30.2 
percent, while self proclaimed Chavistas rose from 24.5 to 28 
percent, and opposition from 32.8 to 37.4 percent. 
 
3.  (U) The poll shows 76.9 percent of those asked were 
somewhat or very disposed to vote in a recall referendum.  Of 
these, 59 percent would vote to recall President Chavez, and 
41 percent would vote to retain him.  Datanalisis shows a 
steady decline in disapproval for Chavez from 57.2 to 54.8 
percent between November 2003 and March 2004. 
 
4.  (U) According to Datanalisis support for the CNE has 
fallen from 67 to 44 percent from December 2003 to March 
2004. Support for the armed forces has fallen from 61 to 44 
percent.  Chavez and the judicial system have held steady at 
41 and 43 percent respectively.  The Catholic church was the 
most respected institution, at 73 percent. 
 
-------------- 
Consultores 21 
-------------- 
 
5.  (U) Consultores 21 poll, which was obtained by the 
Embassy, was taken from March 19 to 30 with a sample of 
1,500. It shows that Chavez would be recalled 53-40 percent, 
compared with 52-43 in December 2003. Chavez would also be 
the first choice in a hypothetical presidential election for 
37.5 percent of the voters, followed by Enrique Mendoza, at 
17 percent. The Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR) was the 
first choice of 31 percent of those polled, while opposition 
parties were chosen by 40 percent and 29 chose neither or 
none. 
 
6.  (U) 15 percent of those polled said they agreed with 
Chavez, whatever he said, while 26 percent agreed with him, 
but admitted that he could be mistaken. nine percent agreed 
with the opposition, whatever they said, while 30 percent 
supported them, but admitted they could be mistaken. This 
poll gives a 41 to 39 percent majority for Chavez, while 17 
percent declared themselves Ni-Ni. 
 
7.  (U) 35 percent of those polled indicated that someone in 
their household had benefited from one of the GOV\'s social 
plans. The acquisition of goods of primary necessity was 
cited by 42 of those who had received help, while 55 percent 
cited one of the educational programs. Those polled were 
evenly divided on whether these plans are meant to help 
people, or control and indoctrinate them, 48 to 48 percent. 
 
8.  (U) 41 percent of those polled said that the opposition 
should keep fighting if the recall referendum did not take 
place, while 53 percent said they should wait until the 2006 
presidential elections. Of those who wanted to keep 
struggling, 39 percent indicated taking the streets and 
protesting as the best tactic. Only four percent favored 
 
armed rebellion. Overall, 85 percent of respondents thought 
there was political violence in Venezuela, and 82 percent 
said defending ones beliefs did not justify violence, against 
14 percent who thought it did. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) President Chavez\'s popularity rating in these two 
polls constrasts with earlier polls that suggested Chavez\' 
support was slipping to around 30 percent. In both polls 
Chavez is at 40 percent, while the opposition is still 
divided. The polls indicate that Chavez would lose a recall 
referendum if one were held, but would be formidable if 
Presidential elections were held instead (and if Chavez were 
a candidate in a post-referendum election.) The MVR has the 
most support of any one party by far, though in theory an 
alliance of all the opposition parties could defeat it. 
 
10.  (C) We suspect these and other polls may underestimate 
to some extent Chavez\' support among the poor and very poor. 
In addition, in a dynamic, media-driven electoral situation, 
Chavez\'s charisma and tactical smarts -- and control of 
government -- would help him.

SUBJECT: THE ABCS OF THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT\'S POLITICAL 
PROPAGANDA STRATEGY 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  The Venezuelan government (GOV) has crafted a 
targeted and generously funded political propaganda strategy 
to convince Venezuelans and the international community that 
Chavez\'s Bolivarian Revolution is the true democratic road to 
prosperity and to divide, discredit, and demoralize 
opposition efforts to challenge the Chavez regime.  Chavez 
terms any opposition to his government as a \"Made in the USA\" 
corrupt, terrorist, coup-mongering plot  to topple his 
democratic government.  His favorite punching bag is the U.S. 
government and its senior officials, whom he regularly 
derides for meddling in Venezuela\'s domestic affairs.  The 
GOV will likely continue its spending flurry to win the 
hearts and minds of Venezuelans and the international 
community, be it through political propaganda or through its 
number of social projects to convert the poor and middle 
classes to the revolution.  The GOV has contracted lobby firm 
Patton Boggs to improve President Chavez\'s image in the 
United States.  Nonetheless, Chavez\'s attempts to lobby the 
U.S. government are unlikely to curry favor with Washington 
as long as he insults and falsely accuses President Bush and 
senior officials of idiocy and conspiracy to overthrow his 
regime.  The GOV has a competitive advantage in that Chavez 
and his advisors have set a clear and consistent government 
line.  And, whether it is a \"Bash U.S. Imperialism Day,\" or a 
march in support of Venezuela\'s elderly population, the GOV 
and its well-disciplined followers toe the revolutionary 
line.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Definition 
---------- 
 
2. (U)  According to the American Heritage Dictionary 
propaganda is \"The systematic propagation of a given doctrine 
or of allegations reflecting the views and interests by the 
proselytizers of the doctrine.\"  In the following study, the 
term propaganda encompasses the instruments of misinformation 
and disinformation. 
 
--------------------------------- 
GOV Plan - Big Bang for the Bucks 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Political propaganda, both favoring and opposing the 
Chavez government, is commonplace in Venezuelan broadcast and 
print media.  The GOV has developed a targeted and generously 
funded political propaganda strategy to convince Venezuelans 
and the international community that Chavez\'s Bolivarian 
Revolution is the true democratic road to prosperity and to 
divide, discredit, and demoralize opposition efforts to 
challenge the Chavez regime.  Though precise figures on how 
much the GOV spends on propaganda are unavailable, estimates 
from private media owners run from an average of Bolivares 50 
million to 65 million per day (around USD 30,000) for 
domestic propaganda to about USD 1 million per day for the 
GOV\'s domestic and international political propaganda 
campaign.  According to foreign and Venezuelan media, the GOV 
signed a USD 1.2 million contract with lobby firm Patton 
Boggs in September 2002 to improve President Chavez\'s image 
in the United States.  The GOV has confirmed the contract, 
but not the amount. (Comment:  Chavez\'s attempts to lobby the 
U.S. government are unlikely to curry favor with Washington 
as long as he insults and falsely accuses President Bush and 
senior officials of idiocy and conspiracy to overthrow his 
regime.  End Comment). 
 
4.  (U)  The Venezuelan state press agency, television, and 
radio stations have openly become instruments of the GOV and 
its affiliated parties.  In February 2004 the president of 
state television station Venezolana de Television (VTV) 
publicly stated that VTV was not a state channel, but rather, 
part of the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR), President Chavez\'s 
political party.  GOV propaganda openly targets Venezuela\'s 
 
 
lower and middle socio-economic strata, which represents 
about 90 percent of the population. 
 
5.  (U)  Government media regularly broadcasts 
government-sponsored activities, e.g. the inauguration of a 
new discount market (MERCAL) or the expansion of 
Cuban-assisted medical program for poor neighborhoods (Barrio 
Adentro), to underscore the diversity of its supporters. 
However, when the government media cover opposition events, 
they zoom in on participants resembling the white elite and 
avoid images that reflect a diversity of class and color in 
the opposition.  Government media also alter images of 
opposition rallies to make it appear that the turnout was 
paltry, while it modifies footage of its own events to 
exaggerate participation. 
 
-------------- 
GOV Strategies 
-------------- 
 
6.  (U)  In order to support its objective of strengthening 
President Chavez and his Bolivarian Revolution, the GOV has 
three propaganda strategies: 
 
--Convince the Venezuelan people and the international 
community that Chavez\'s Bolivarian Revolution is the true 
democratic road to prosperity. 
 
--Divide, discredit, demoralize, and dismantle opposition 
efforts to challenge the Chavez regime with allegations that 
a coup-mongering, terrorist, and corrupt elite leads the 
opposition. 
 
--Accuse any entity or government whose views or policies 
challenge the Chavez government as conspiring against the 
Chavez regime or of meddling in Venezuela\'s domestic affairs. 
 
----------- 
GOV Tactics 
----------- 
 
7.  (U)  The GOV\'s tactics are to: 
 
--Hire lobby groups and media consultants in Venezuela and 
abroad; tailor propaganda products to target audiences. 
 
--Utilize print and broadcast media to advance objectives 
both in country and abroad. 
 
--Polarize Venezuelan society through the use of messages and 
images, e.g., the poor, middle class, and dark skinned are 
good people and they support the GOV; the evil are wealthy 
and fair skinned (the \"squalid, oligarchy\") and they support 
the opposition. 
 
--Create adversaries (United States), and ideological \"soul 
mates,\" (Cuba), to appeal to Venezuelan nationalistic 
inclinations and to the population\'s inclination to support 
the underdog, e.g., Venezuela\'s revolutionary David to the 
U.S. imperialist, neo-liberal Goliath. 
 
--Link these external adversaries with the opposition, and 
its friends with the Chavez revolution. 
 
--Deflect the social and economic failures of President 
Chavez\'s Fifth Republic by blaming them on the corrupt and 
nefarious Fourth Republic, which Chavez claims he toppled 
when he assumed office in December 1998. 
 
--Discredit and demoralize opposition leadership and their 
efforts to voice their opinions through constitutional and 
electoral mechanisms. 
 
--Milk the sovereignty card and link these alleged external 
threats to the opposition. 
 
--Invite/pay foreigners to visit Venezuela and testify in 
favor of Chavez and his Bolivarian revolution, and to 
 
 
lambaste the domestic and foreign policies of the foreigners\' 
respective countries. 
 
-------- 
Messages 
-------- 
 
8. (U)  The following are some of the propaganda messages 
GOV spokespersons and media repeat many times every day: 
 
--Venezuela\'s confrontation is between an elite white 
minority and a dark, poor majority, the latter who all defend 
President Chavez. 
 
--All members of Venezuela\'s popular and labor classes and a 
growing number of the middle class support Chavez. 
 
--Opposition members are coup-mongering terrorist fascists, 
who are willing to betray their country to overthrow Chavez 
with help from the United States. 
--Chavez is the legitimate, legal, democraticallyelected 
leader of a sovereign people\'s governmen. 
 
--Chavez, unlike his corrupt predecessors, fights corruption 
and believes in justice for all Venezuelan citizens. 
 
--Freedom of expression in Venezuela is alive and well; there 
is no persecution of those who oppose the GOV. 
 
--The GOV is nationalistic; those opposing it are traitors. 
 
--The U.S. wants to topple Chavez to seize Venezuela\'s oil. 
 
------------------------ 
GOV Propaganda Practices 
------------------------ 
 
9. (U)  The following are examples of GOV propaganda 
practices: 
 
--Message Distortion and Image Alteration:  VTV broadcasts 
images of the September 11, 2001 attack on New York\'s Twin 
Towers, compares this image with Venezuelan opposition 
strikers, and emits the message, \"The people (Venezuelan) 
know who the terrorists are.\"  VTV and newspapers carry 
full-page ads that use altered footage to contrast huge 
turnouts at GOV rallies with supposed paltry crowds in 
opposition marches.  The GOV projects images of \"dark masses\" 
rallying behind Chavez, while its shots of opposition marches 
zoom in on white, well-dressed elites, even though a range of 
classes and colors attend opposition marches. 
 
--Abuse of Authority/Cadenas:  President Chavez frequently 
delivers political propaganda through his national radio and 
television broadcasts that all broadcast media must carry. 
From December 1999, when Chavez assumed office, to April 30, 
2004, he has used 578 hours to this purpose, reports leading 
conservative national daily \"El Universal.\" 
 
--Smear Campaigns:  GOV ridicules opposition private sector 
leader Carlos Fernandez, labor leader Carlos Ortega, and 
petroleum leader Juan Fernandez.  GOV conducts illegal 
wiretaps of their conversations and broadcasts/publishes them 
in government media and juxtaposes the conversations with 
violent images.  The GOV launches particularly virulent 
attacks on private media owners who oppose the Chavez 
government and on civil associations, such as SUMATE, which 
has helped the opposition\'s Democratic Coordinator (CD) in 
technical and informational aspects for the presidential 
recall petition drive.  Chavez has accused millionaire 
Venevision/Cisneros Group President Gustavo Cisneros of being 
the pack leader of the private media\'s conspiracy against 
him.  He frequently calls the four leading private television 
stations the \"Four Horsemen (or Prostitutes) of the 
Apocalypse,\" and he has conveyed instructions to his 
followers during his weekly Sunday program \"Alo Presidente\" 
and during his \"cadenas\" to attack certain media outlets that 
 
have allegedly defamed the President. 
 
--Appealing to Nationalism/Culpability and Innuendoes: 
Chavez employs traditional songs and jingoisms, featuring 
popular actors and musicians to appeal to Venezuelan 
nationalism.  (Note:  The opposition employs similar tactics. 
 End Note.)  GOV propaganda blames the opposition for any and 
all of the country\'s political and economic woes, blaming it 
on the opposition\'s December 2002 national work stoppage. 
GOV spots on the opposition\'s December 2002 - February 2003 
national strike blend images of violence and food shortages 
with the message, \"Do these ends justify the means?\"  (In 
Spanish, the word \"medios\" can signify \"means\" or \"media.\") 
The play on words attempts to create an association between 
the opposition media and the violence and food scarcities. 
 
--\"Chavismo Heavy\" VS \"Chavismo Light\":  The GOV uses 
unfounded accusations, threats, and insults to discredit the 
opposition and to convince his followers to continue their 
support for him.  He employs a similar tactic for any 
perceived international support to the opposition, e.g. using 
pro-GOV National Assembly deputies to allege on television 
that there is a CIA-directed conspiracy to topple Chavez, 
even assassinate him.  The GOV employs lighter tactics to 
attract the middle and working classes, women, and youth, all 
groups that are either ambivalent towards Chavez or support a 
leadership change.  Promotional campaigns for Chavez\'s social 
missions:  Robinson, Rivas, Sucre, Cristo, and Vuelvan Caras 
are form part of the GOV\'s tactics. 
 
--------------------- 
International Efforts 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (U)  Venezuelan Embassies and consulates are also tasked 
with spreading the revolutionary message, specifically 
through the promotion of a slick government documentary 
titled, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,\" which was 
produced by two Irish free-lance filmmakers who reportedly 
said they were BBC employees when they sought to interview 
Venezuelans concerning the April 2002 temporary alternation 
in constitutional order to some, and coup attempt, to others. 
 The video has been shown at a number of theaters in major 
U.S. metropolitan areas and at several prestigious U.S. 
universities, including Harvard, Stanford, and the University 
of California system, and most recently at the Lincoln Center 
in New York.  To date, there has been very little questioning 
of the documentary\'s veracity in the U.S. media.  The GOV 
also has plans to place its political ads and broadcast VTV 
programs throughout the hemisphere through regional cable 
networks and it has invested over USD 55 million to turn VTV 
into a regional 
television network rivaling Brazil\'s \"O Globo\" by September 
2005. 
 
11.  (U)  The GOV\'s international efforts extend far beyond 
the dissemination of videos and broadcasting and information 
posted on Venezuelan Embassy websites. 
 
--Through its extensive and expanding network of Bolivarian 
Circles (\"Circulos Bolivarianos\"), the GOV spreads the gospel 
of Chavez\'s Bolivarian Revolution.  In the United States 
alone, there are Bolivarian Circles in Florida, New York, 
Washington, D.C., Oregon, Texas, Oklahoma, and California. 
One of the Bolivarian circles organized a march in Times 
Square on May 8 to say no to U.S. and French occupation in 
Haiti and to U.S. intervention in Venezuela. 
 
--The GOV is also using the Cuban Solidarity Network and the 
Bolivarian Circle of Miami, whose director is Alvaro Sanchez 
(a2000@rockmail.com) to recruit U.S. university students to 
join the GOV\'s \"Ingles Barrio Adentro\" program.  Volunteer 
students are being recruited to teach English in Venezuela in 
the poor barrios of three cities - Caracas, Maracaibo, and 
Barcelona - specifically in neighborhoods where Cuban medics 
live and work for Chavez\'s Barrio Adentro health program. 
According to recruiting information, local governments will 
guarantee the safety of participating U.S. students, noting 
 
 
the presence of thousands of Cuban doctors who are already 
safely volunteering in these impoverished neighborhoods. 
 
--The pro-Chavez Women\'s Bank (\"Banco de Mujer\") deploys 
Venezuelan women to the United States to talk to audiences of 
the glories of the Bolivarian Revolution and to lambaste the 
U.S. government\'s hurtful neo-liberal policies that aim to 
enslave the populations of developing countries. 
 
--More recently, the Foreign Ministry has taken upon itself 
to purge or sideline to insignificant positions Venezuelan 
diplomats and other Foreign Ministry employees who refuse to 
defend and promote the revolutionary line. 
 
------------------------------- 
Examples of The Government Line 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U)  The Chavez government\'s propaganda strategy has a 
competitive advantage beyond its generous financing: Chavez 
and his advisors have set a clear and consistent government 
line.  Whether it is a \"Bash U.S. Imperialism Day,\" or a 
march in support of Venezuela\'s elderly population, the GOV 
and its well-disciplined followers tow the government\'s 
revolutionary line.  The under-funded, unfocused, and often 
undisciplined opposition is at a clear disadvantage when it 
comes to countering GOV propaganda (septel). 
 
13.  (U)  Mega-fraud:  In the heated fray over whether the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) should or should not call 
for a presidential recall referendum, the GOV has stepped up 
its propaganda campaign against the opposition, both in 
quantity and frequency of propaganda through television, 
printed ads, billboards in television and print media and to 
a lesser degree, on the radio.  Using its message of 
\"mega-fraud,\" the pro-GOV political party command center 
Comando Ayacucho has placed ads, including in private, 
pro-opposition papers that point to supposed inaccuracies 
(many of them distortions) in the opposition\'s presidential 
recall drive, suggesting the opposition drive was a massive 
fraud.  Among the papers publishing these ads are 
pro-opposition, conservative daily \"El Universal,\" slightly 
pro-Chavez and highly popular tabloid \"Ultimas Noticias,\" and 
pro-GOV tabloid \"VEA.\"  An MVR National Assembly deputy, Luis 
Tascon, has a web page that encourages Venezuelans to verify 
whether their name fraudulently a 
ppeared in the opposition\'s presidential recall signature 
drive held for four days during November-December 2003: 
(www.luistascon.com) or to denounce any other irregularity. 
Opposition leaders insist the real purpose of the site is to 
identify those who signed, screen them for GOV employment or 
benefits and pressure them to recant. 
 
14.  (U)  Full Frontal Attack against the Opposition:  In one 
VTV ad, while classical music plays in the background, a 
cartoonist sketches a rose and a thorn and writes, \"The 
opposition, without the rose of love, and with a thorn of 
hatred.\"  In another VTV video clip, with the backdrop of 
crowds in line to buy liquid fuel canisters (during the 
December 2003- January 2003 opposition-led national strike, a 
voice says, \"The opposition unleashed terrorism on the 
Venezuelan people and it led to hunger and unemployment. 
Thanks to the new PDVSA (state oil company), PDVSA is for all 
of us, all of us are PDVSA.\" 
 
15.  (U)  Taking on Uncle Sam:  Pro-GOV VEA dedicates a 
generous number of its pages to discredit the U.S. government 
(U.S. Iraq policy, domestic problems, etc.) and accuses it of 
leading Venezuela\'s opposition.  It also lobs darts at U.S. 
Ambassador Shapiro through the use of insulting caricatures 
or altered photos featuring the Ambassador as the head of the 
opposition leadership, suggesting a cabal between the 
Ambassador/USG and the opposition.  Chavez has escalated his 
attacks on the United States in his frequent speeches.  He 
claims that Venezuela\'s opposition is \"Made in the USA,\" that 
the USG masterminded and financed the April 2002 coup against 
him.  Chavez assures his audiences that U.S. troops are 
stationed along the Colombia side of the border, waiting for 
 
 
the opportune moment to invade Venezuela and topple his 
government. 
 
16.  (U)  Alo Presidente - Chavez\'s Weekly Bully Pulpit:  In 
his weekly Sunday \"Alo Presidente\" program, which often lasts 
five hours, President Chavez issues instructions and conveys 
sub-textual messages to his followers; threatens and 
discredits those who oppose him; and attacks foreign 
interests he associates with the opposition, the U.S. 
government being a favorite culprit.  He has repeatedly 
promised to unveil evidence proving U.S. involvement the 
events of April 11, 2002, including U.S. naval and air 
presence in Venezuelan waters. 
 
17.  (U)  Attacking Former Supporters:  VTV routinely airs 
three-minute clips that combine outdated/out of sequence 
images with current events to denounce opposition members, 
political parties, or civil society groups.  One example is a 
video of the Metropolitan Police chief, who once supported 
Chavez, allegedly testing a number of weapons in Europe to 
prove to Venezuelans that the police chief was an arms 
trafficker who was probably plotting violence against the 
President in February 2004.  The video footage, however, was 
from two years ago, when the police chief was still a Chavez 
supporter. 
 
18.  (U)  Kinder, Gentler Chavismo:  In his effort to attract 
the middle and working classes, youth, and women, groups that 
tend to either favor some sort of leadership change or 
support the opposition, the GOV has issued a number of soft 
and friendly \"unifying\" ads that appeal to these groups.  The 
Ministry of Communications and Information uses the new 
slogan \"Venezuela ahora es de todos\" (Venezuela is now for 
all of us) and the colors of the flag to appeal to 
patriotism.  Another ad features a woman who, thanks to a GOV 
micro-credit, has established a successful weaving business. 
Half-page ads have appeared in dailies \"El Universal,\" 
\"Ultimas Noticias,\" and \"VEA\" and on VTV in 45-second 
segments. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Opportunity Knocks, with a Catch 
-------------------------------- 
 
19.  (U)  Chavez\'s numerous social missions come with a 
catch; the recipients must be loyal to the Chavez revolution. 
 In one GOV ad, the GOV announces that, starting on February 
12, it will publish lists of people who have signed up for 
the latest government social program \"Vuelvan Caras\" (Turn 
Around), which aims to reduce unemployment.  This ad has 
appeared in \"Ultimas Noticias.\"   On February 19, the GOV 
started publishing the cedula numbers of Venezuelans who 
signed in the opposition\'s recall petition and urged people 
to scrutinize the list and denounce to the GOV if their name 
had been fraudulently used.  There are numerous stories of 
Venezuelans who lost their privileges or chances for 
employment once they have signed the opposition\'s 
presidential recall petition; others say they declined to 
sign because they did not want to lose their benefits. 
 
20.  (U)  Using Children for Political Proselytism.  Chavez 
has used on at least three occasions children and youth to 
broadcast eloquent, memorized speeches in favor of the 
Bolivarian revolution and its leader.  Many compare this 
tactic to Castro\'s in Cuba. 
 
21.  (U)  Possible Use of Foreign Media and Fake Polls.  The 
following electronic December 3, 2003 \"Washington Post\" 
article was e-mailed to dozens of Venezuelan journalists in 
December 2003, immediately following the opposition-led 
presidential recall referendum petition drive.  The article 
distorts the possible results of the drive and suggests the 
opposition did not collect enough signatures to hold the 
recall.  The article\'s poor English was the first clue that 
something was amiss, and the \"Washington Post\" journalist who 
supposedly wrote the article (follows) confirmed to U.S. 
Embassy Caracas that the article was a fake, the result of a 
sophisticated hacking job of The Washington Post web page and 
 
 
e-mail system.  Similar incidents have occurred with \"Chicago 
Tribune\" and \"New York Times\" articles.  Whether these 
e-mailed articles were the work of the GOV or its 
sympathizers is uncertain; however, they certainly serve the 
GOV\'s interests and the tactic is a one commonly employed by 
the Cuban government, according to private media sources. 
 
Begin Article:  Confusion in Venezuela -- Opponents of Chavez 
Surprisingly   Claim Various Amounts of Signatures to Trigger 
Recall Referendum.  The results of the recollection of 
signatures that took place last weekend throughout the 
country, has become a contest off figures.  \"El Nacional,\" a 
national daily newspaper, opened last Tuesday, with 3.8 
million signatures, the Coordinadora Democratica, followed 
with 3.6, Sumate, a social organization, added its own 
opinion offering 3.4 and Salas Romer, leader and presidential 
candidate of Proyecto Venezuela, a leading political party, 
expressed the amount of 3 million signatures.  On the other 
hand, the officialist Comando Ayacucho, announced in a press 
conference that took place the same day, that the 
recollection did not meet the required figure of 2.4 million 
signatures needed to recall mister Chavez. The number stated 
was 1.9 million.  End Article. 
 
22.  (U)  In February, March, and April 2004, the GOV 
referred to three polls, allegedly one by famed pollster 
Alfred Keller, and the other two by a group called North 
American Opinion Research, to demonstrate that most of 
Venezuela\'s business community no longer trusted its leaders, 
and preferred to support Chavez and that Chavez\'s popularity 
had increased substantially.  Keller refuted the first poll\'s 
existence and attributed it to the GOV\'s disinformation 
campaign.  In February, U.S. Embassy Caracas and a number of 
interlocutors were unable to find any organization called 
North American Opinion Research.    However, when the second 
North American Opinion Research poll appeared in daily 
tabloid \"Ultimas Noticias,\" its editor gave Embassy a copy of 
the poll.  The poll had no names, contact information 
included; the editor told emboff that North American Opinion 
Research was not as Chavez asserted, a U.S. polling firm, but 
rather some sort of local endeavor.  Zeta, a liberal-leaning, 
pro-opposition weekly political events magazine, wrote that 
the poll was a fraud, and noted that the use of the word 
North American to describe a U.S. firm was uncustomary in the 
United States, while Venezuelans did often use the word North 
American to refer to the United States.  (Comment:  The fact 
that the firm has an accent over the \"i\" in Opinion, also 
makes it doubtful that a U.S. firm is the source of the poll. 
 End Comment.)

TV Propaganda 
------------- 
 
23. (U)  VTV and the new government educational and cultural 
channel Vive TV use images from private channels to convey 
aggression on the part of the opposition against the alleged 
large mass of people who support Chavez.  It also regularly 
airs one to five-minute segments that accuse the opposition 
of conspiring to kill Chavez and his democratic Bolivarian 
 
revolution.  Comando Ayacucho airs ads to attract undecided 
voters, using Venezuelan folk or classical music in the 
background and soft, easily digestible messages that assure 
these voters that they too may join the benign, pretty 
revolution and benefit from its resources. 
 
---------------- 
Print Propaganda 
---------------- 
 
24. (U)  Pro-GOV group \"The Committee to Defend the 
Constitution\" issues communiques that list a number of 
possible plans by the opposition to mount a coups d\'etat. 
Its full-page, color communiques often appear in \"VEA\" and 
\"Ultimas Noticias.\"  The GOV\'s ideological organ, the 
Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement (MBR-200) and the Farmers\' 
Bolivarian Front (Frente Bolivariano Campesino) along with a 
pro-Chavez mayor issued a communique in support of Chavez and 
 
 
denouncing alleged fraud against the Chavez regime in Cojedes 
state.  A number of new print media endeavors have emerged, 
some local, others national, which support the GOV\'s 
revolution.  All of them serve to discredit supposed 
opposition leaders and many attack U.S. imperialism and 
interference in Venezuela\'s domestic affairs. 
 
---------- 
Billboards 
---------- 
 
25.  (U)  Examples of pro-GOV billboards: 
 
--La revolution bolivariana avanza a paso de vencedores.\" 
\"The Bolivarian Revolution advances at the pace of the 
conquerors.\" 
 
--\"Venezuela ahora es de todos.\"  Venezuela now belongs to 
all of us.\"  (Ministry of Information and Communications). 
 
--\"Chavez es el pueblo\".  \"Chavez is the people.\"  (shots of 
Chavez embracing an elderly woman; listening to a young girl 
who is wearing a red beret;  laughs with a member of one of 
Venezuela\'s Indian tribes. 
 
---------------- 
Other Mechanisms 
---------------- 
 
26.  (U)  U.S. Support. A number of U.S. celebrities and 
black leaders have visited Miraflores and the Vice 
President\'s office: Danny Glover and a group of TransAfrica 
members; boxing promoter Don King; Catholic lay missionaries; 
and Roger Toussaint, president of the New York Metro and 
Transport Union.  The union leader came to Venezuela to 
express his \"..concern over State Department  declarations 
and his rejection of USG interference in the referendum and 
in other GOV business.\"  Don King\'s visit was unforgettable 
after he mistook his cues and, instead of his singing \"Chavez 
will not leave,\" he chanted \"Chavez will leave.\" 
 
27.  (U)  Propaganda on Line.  The GOV liberally uses 
cyberspace to spread its war on the oligarchy, neoliberalism, 
the United States government, and the proposed Free Trade 
Area of the Americas (FTAA).   A sample of the numerous sites

28.  (U)  The Chavez government is likely to continue 
investing substantial amounts of cash to win the hearts and 
minds of Venezuelans and the international community, be it 
through political propaganda or through its number of social 
projects to convert the poor and middle classes to his 
revolution.  Though some of the GOV\'s propaganda promotes the 
image of a beautiful and peaceful revolution, other messages 
are foul-mouthed and aggressive.  And, while some of his 
social programs appear to have drawn support from segments of 
the lower social strata, and some hit a responsive 
anti-American cord among traditional leftists, some (not all) 
of this support will last only as long as the cash flows.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The Coordinadora Democratica conducted on May 8 a 
nationwide simulation of the May 27-31 appeals process 
(\"reparos\") for the presidential referendum signatures. 
Press reports estimate that about 950,000 people attended the 
one-day event, which was carried out peacefully.  Signers 
were invited to go to 2,500 centers to check the status of 
their signature in the petition drive against President Hugo 
Chavez.  Sumate representatives announced that evening they 
had registered some 25,000 volunteers to assist during the 
appeals process.  On May 10, the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) published the results of the signature verification 
process in a 136-page supplement in at least one newspaper. 
The \"success\" of the simulation, however, was quickly 
overtaken by the GOV\'s revelation that it had captured 89 
alleged Colombian paramilitaries near Caracas.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Signature Drill Reports Solid Turnout 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On May 8, the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) held a 
simulation to prepare for the May 27-31 appeals process for 
the signatures collected to petition for a recall referendum 
against President Hugo Chavez.  Venezuelans who signed 
petitions in November 2003 went to some of the 2,500 
locations where they signed to confirm whether their 
signatures had been validated or not by the National 
Electoral Council (CNE).  Luis Enrique Palacios of the NGO 
Sumate, which helped organize the event, told reporters May 8 
that more than a million people had gone to check their 
signatures (other press reports estimated 950,000).  Sumate 
is now analyzing the participation to help Chavez opponents 
focus efforts on those who did not attend.  Maria Corina 
Machado of Sumate told the press they had collected 
information on 25,000 volunteers to assist with the appeals 
process at the end of May. 
 
3. (U) Those who attended the event received printouts from 
Sumate with the digital image of their signature and its 
status as determined by the CNE.  Newspapers ran dozens of 
testimonials from frustrated Venezuelans whose signatures 
were not accepted.  One woman reported that her signature and 
thumbprint appear totally normal on the Sumate image, but the 
CNE rejected the signature without sending it to the appeals 
process.  The only reason given for the rejection on the CNE 
website is \"no error,\" meaning that no formal rejection code 
was assigned to the signature.  Another woman verified her 
information in the electoral registry beforehand and signed 
exactly as it appeared; her signature was rejected without 
appeal however, because the daily tally sheet corresponding 
to her signature was disqualified for \"having amendments.\" 
Sumate provided persons whose signatures have been rejected 
without recourse to appeal with forms to complete so this 
alleged disenfranchisement will be documented. 
 
4. (C) CD representative Jorge Casado told Polcouns May 9 he 
thought the event was a success.  He pointed out that even in 
the remote state of Amazonas they were able to get 25 percent 
turnout.  Heavy rain in some states was the only limiting 
factor, said Casado.  He asserted that the turnout was 
affected because persons who had already learned their 
signatures were valid stayed home.  A new concern, according 
to Casado, is that the government will counter the abstention 
of these types with Chavez supporters porting false 
identification.  He also complained that in Carabobo, 
Henrique Salas Romer was becoming an obstacle and his 
Proyecto Venezuela had given only lukewarm support to the 
simulation. 
 
------------------------------ 
 
CNE Publishes Identity Numbers 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Preparing for the appeals, the CNE published in the 
May 9 edition of Caracas daily Ultimas Noticias a 136-page 
supplement listing the identity numbers of citizens whose 
signatures were rejected or accepted in the Caracas District 
and the states of Miranda and Vargas.  Each page lists more 
than 6,000 identity numbers in minuscule type and indicates 
the number of the voting center at which the signature can be 
appealed.  Signers have also been able to check the status of 
their signature on the CNE website (www.cne.gov.ve), as well 
as that of Sumate (www.sumate.org).

Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The opposition used the simulation as practice for a 
complicated process, an opportunity to recruit volunteers, 
and as a demonstration of popular support.  The story of 
alleged Colombian paramilitary activity near Caracas has 
dampened the bounce the CD could have hoped for from this 
\"success.\"  As on other occasions, the GOV has set the agenda 
and forced the opposition to react to it.

1. (C) Venezuelan authorities detained between 50 and 90 
alleged Colombian irregulars in the dawn hours of May 9 in 
the southern outskirts of Caracas.  Calling the men 
\"paramilitaries\" in his \"Alo, Presidente\" program, President 
Chavez claimed the opposition was training them for another 
coup attempt with the help of the US, Colombians, and Cuban 
exiles.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel called on all 
\"friends of Venezuela\" to denounce the detainees as 
terrorists and drug traffickers.  Human Rights group COFAVIC 
expressed consternation with the GOV\'s lack of proof or legal 
basis for the detentions, and opposition leaders denounced it 
as an attempt to smear them and derail the upcoming reparos. 
The GOV followed the detentions with raids on properties in 
Caracas, including the embassy warehouse (septel).  We can\'t 
 
dismiss the GOV\'s allegations that the Colombians were part 
of an anti-GOV plot -- but the absence of weapons, and more 
information, raises questions about what occurred.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) President Chavez announced the May 9 early morning 
capture of at least 53 alleged Colombian irregulars in the 
southern outskirts of Caracas during his \"Alo, Presidente\" 
program.  Chavez said that 50 others escaped.  Minister of 
Interior Lucas Rincon later informed the audience that an 
additional 24-30 had been captured.  Calling the men 
\"paramilitaries,\" Chavez claimed his political opponents had 
imported terrorists and were training them to overthrow 
and/or assassinate him with the help of the USG, wealthy 
Colombians, and Cuban exiles.  He also charged that the US 
was hoping the \"paramilitaries\" would create a pretext for a 
US invasion of Venezuela.  Chavez said political police 
(DISIP), scientific and investigative police (CICPC), and the 
National Guard captured the group during a raid on a ranch 
owned by Cuban exile Robert Alonso, who is linked to the 
president\'s domestic opponents and anti-Castro groups in 
Miami. 
 
3. (U) Contradicting the president\'s accusations, El Hatillo 
Mayor Alfredo Catalan told news channel Globovision May 9 
that his police, acting with the Metropolitan Police, had 
intercepted two buses, reported as stolen, on the back roads 
of Caracas at approximately 1:3 a.m.  They found more than 
50 unarmed men, dresed in camouflage fatigues on the buses. 
Some twohours later, Catalan said, contingents from the 
DSIP and CICPC arrived and detained the men. 
 
4. U) Speaking to reporters May 9, Fifth Republic Movment 
deputy William Lara said the case would be ried in a 
military court, because the group had lanned to attack a 
military base and steal its wepons to use against the 
government.  According t Lara, Article 486 of the Military 
Justice Code reats any attack on the armed forces as 
militaryrebellion and therefore subject to military justic. 
 Lara also claimed that the detainees planned t attack the 
military base silently with knives ad straight razors to 
avoid detection. 
 
5. (C) olombian Ambassador to Venezuela Maria Holguin tol 
the Ambassador May 10 that, at her request, the GOV gave her 
a list of 4 alleged Colombian paramilitaries who had been 
etained.  The GOC performed a name check which shoed that 
only one person had a criminal record.  Holguin was skeptical 
of the paramilitary accusation.  She said not only had the 
detainees who were interviewed on TV not used paramilitary 
slang, but also it is unlikely for paramilitaries to move 
around in large numbers without weapons.  Despite being 
denied consular access to the detainees, Holguin thinks it 
likely that they are Colombians. but she is highly doubtful 
they are or were paramilitaries. 
 
6. (U) During a May 10 press briefing, Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel equated the detainees with terrorists and drug 
traffickers and called on OAS SecGen Cesar Gaviria, the 
Carter Center, and \"all those who are responsible\" to 
denounce the presence and activities of the alleged 
paramilitaries and thus declare whether they are Venezuela\'s 
friends or enemies.  Rangel accused opposition leaders, 
including military dissident Gen. Felipe Rodriguez, of having 
met with the Colombian military to coordinate sealing of the 
border during the alleged paramilitary operation.  According 
 
 
to Rangel, the Colombian military was charged with preventing 
the FARC from going to Chavez\' aid after the attack on the 
GOV commenced. 
 
7. (C) Liliana Ortega, director of the human rights NGO 
COFAVIC, told poloff May 10 that there is no clear 
information on who the detainees are, why they were detained, 
or what charges they will face.  She characterized the GOV 
raid and the subsequent plan to try the case in a military 
court as \"very strange and confusing.\"  Placing the case 
under military jurisdiction, she said, will make it much more 
difficult to obtain a convincing explanation of what happened. 
 
8. (U) Speaking to reporters May 10, pro-opposition deputy 
Ernesto Alvarenga (Solidaridad) demanded that the GOV publish 
the names and identity numbers of the detainees, as well as 
ask the Colombian Government for confirmation of their 
citizenship status.  Alvarenga emphasized that the timing of 
the raid to coincide with the opposition\'s May 8 reparo 
simulation was no coincidence.  It represented, he said, the 
GOV\'s attempt to link the \"paramilitaries\" with the 
opposition, damaging its democratic credentials and 
distracting it from the reparo effort. 
 
9. (SBU) The GOV followed up on the detentions May 10 with 
raids around Caracas.  Authorities first entered the 
warehouse complex where the embassy storage facility is 
located.  There, witnesses told RSO, they searched the 
embassy warehouse and at least one other private facility 
(septel).  The authorities also searched the house of the 
ex-wife of former President Carlos Andres Perez, and 
attempted to enter the house of National Assembly deputy 
Rafael Marin.  In addition, they raided a vacant house, 
allegedly belonging to a National Guard colonel, where 
hundreds of bullet-proof vests were found, and the house of a 
person allegedly linked to the February 27-March 5 protests. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) The timing of this incident, the lack of basic 
information about it other than GOV assertions, and most 
importantly, the rush to consign the case to military court 
with little justification all inspire suspicion.  That said, 
there is a history of conspiring among radical anti-Chavez 
forces, and so we do not rule out the possibility that 
someone hired these Colombians to do something against the 
GOV. If the case isn\'t merely a \"show\" as the opposition 
charges, then the government will have to come up with some 
convincing evidence quickly.  On the other hand, the case 
could serve as a vehicle for bringing more charges against 
opposition figures, such as those recently brought against 
the mayors of Baruta and Chacao.  An arrest warrent has just 
been issued for the mayor of Baruta, Henrique Capriles. 
Press reports he is detained in DISIP..  For now, all 
attention is off the reparos and the referendum, a fact that 
is certainly to Chavez\' liking.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Amid considerable press attention on reports of 
corruption at CADIVI (the Commission for Administration of 
Foreign Exchange) which has led to the dismissal of 50 
employees, a pamphlet bomb exploded at their main office in 
the early morning hours of April 29.  CADIVI\'s President is 
more concerned with corruption in the private sector, and has 
revived calls for a law to punish both those who try to cheat 
CADIVI and those who conduct parallel market transactions. 
FinMin Nobrega has made statements which indicate that CADIVI 
is working better than ever, but the facts indicate that 
liquidation of dollars is just as slow as it has been.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
AN EXPLOSIVE ACCUSATION 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) While there have been prior reports of corruption in 
CADIVI, it was not until rumors reported in the local press 
named one of the directors, Adina Bastidas, as a leader of 
the internal \"Mafia\" that such claims were addressed publicly 
by the institution.  Bastidas denied such claims, instead 
stating that 50 employees (11% of the workforce) have been 
dismissed since the inception of the agency for \"not working 
ethically.\"  The firings appear to have taken place two to 
three weeks earlier.  CADIVI workers have been accused of 
charging a \"commission\" from 200-400 Bolivares per dollar 
exchanged, up to 40% of the difference between the official 
exchange rate and that attainable on the black market. 
 
---------------------- 
THERE OUGHTTA BE A LAW 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) CADIVI President Edgar Hernandez Behrens has sought to 
move the issue of corruption at CADIVI in a different 
direction.  He has made a series of public statements, not 
about corruption by employees, but instead about the absence 
of a law punishing those who go into the parallel market, 
stating \"that there is not a law to punish those who violate 
the norms that regulate the application for and acquisition 
of foreign exchange.\"  He also denounced under-declarations 
of exports, over-declaration of and outright falsification of 
imports, as well as the presentation of other false documents 
in order to obtain approval.  Together, in his perspective, 
these acts \"constitute an imperative and undeferrable 
requirement for the health of the foreign exchange policy of 
the country.\"  He stated that the purpose of this law is to 
\"punish those who harm the general interests of the 
Venezuelan society.\"  Ricardo Sanguino, a pro-Chavez Diputado 
and member of the National Assembly Finance Committee, has 
promised that such a law will be completed by the end of May. 
 COMMENT: The parallel market is deeply entrenched and is 
implicit in the structure of the GOV\'s financial management. 
If a law imposing penalties for parallel transactions were 
passed, enforcement would likely be sporadic, discretionary 
and work as a means to intimidate political enemies.  It is 
not clear whether the GOV will make this a legislative 
priority.  END COMMENT. 
 
---------------- 
A REAL EXPLOSION 
---------------- 
 
4. (U) At about 3:30 AM on April 29, a bomb exploded outside 
of the CADIVI office.  No one was hurt, and press reports 
indicate it was a pamphlet bomb.  The pamphlet was attributed 
to Grupo Carapaica (ref B), a violent Marxist group which 
claims no ties to Chavistas, but says it supports Chavez\' 
programs.  According to a CADIVI press release, the pamphlet 
demanded the departure of corrupt officials from CADIVI, 
naming three of the five directors (including Hernandez but 
not Bastidas). 
 
 
------------------------------- 
CADIVI IS IMPROVING...ISN\'T IT? 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) FinMin Nobrega has attempted to put a positive spin 
on CADIVI\'s efforts, stating that \"never before, in any 
quarter, has (CADIVI) liquidated more dollars than in the 
first quarter of 2004.\"  While this may be technically true 
(see ref A and previous), it appears that the increased 
liquidations are merely keeping pace with the demand, as the 
economy, benefiting from high oil prices and increased 
government spending, recovers.  Statistics provided to 
econoff by the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce show 
that 44% of all forex requested of CADIVI by Feb. 20, 2004, 
was actually liquidated by the Central Bank (BCV).  Daily \"El 
Universal\" reports that the amount of forex liquidated from 
Jan. 1, 2004, to Apr. 20, 2004, was also 44% of the amount 
requested.  NOTE: Such statistics were available on the 
CADIVI website (www.cadivi.gov.ve) until February 20, but 
have since been removed.  It is not clear how \"El Universal\" 
obtained their data, but the results now appear available 
only to those who can crunch the massive amounts of raw data 
that CADIVI still provides. 
 
-------------------- 
WHY THE DISCREPANCY? 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Nobrega has claimed that the reason more money has 
not been liquidated is that importers\' requests were 
approved, but they have not had the merchandise shipped.  A 
BCV employee confirmed to econoff that this is indeed one of 
the reasons for lack of money.  Exporters are loath to ship 
goods without a reasonable assurance that funds will be 
forthcoming.  Accordingly, many goods are not shipped until 
approval is obtained, delaying the final liquidation. 
Another reason is that importers get approvals for a specific 
amount of exchange.  If the amount of the order changes for 
any reason, it cannot be liquidated until a new approval is 
obtained for the correct amount.  It has also been suggested 
by our business contacts that in their thirst for cheap 
CADIVI dollars, many applicants applied for more dollars than 
they ultimately were able to find enough Bolivars to buy. 
Hence, their final order cannot be liquidated \"on time\" by 
CADIVI. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) We see no sign that the GOV will eliminate exchange 
controls.  Chavez\'s continued interest in accessing Central 
Bank \"excess reserves\" (which would all but melt away in an 
open exchange market) implies their indefinite continuation. 
We expect the corruption issue to be equally long-lived.  It 
appears that CADIVI was going to keep the dismissals quiet, 
until the accusation against Bastidas became public and the 
need arose to go on the offensive.  Considering the wait, the 
fact may have been reserved for just such a time.  Since its 
inception, CADIVI has been plagued by complaints of 
corruption, and a whole industry of dubious \"fixers\" and law 
firms have sprung up to meet the demand of the new 
bureaucracy.  Some are simply undertaking the onerous 
paperwork that small firms not connected with strategic 
industries such as food and pharmaceuticals (which get their 
foreign exchange more regularly) cannot manage. 
Nevertheless, others are clearly making payoffs to get CADIVI 
dollars. 
 
8. (C) That said, at least one veteran government relations 
expert for a U.S. firm told us that CADIVI\'s corruption level 
remains well below that of previous exchange control systems 
which eventually stopped being a meaningful check on the 
validity of foreign exchange transactions.  He suggested 
that, for now at least, the desire for control by Chavez has 
kept corruption in check and that the dismissals reflect this 
effort.  In our own conversations with Bastidas, we have 
found her superficially courteous but very rigid on 
substance.  As Chavez\'s Executive Vice President and later 
Minister of Production and Commerce, she had a reputation as 
a hard leftist.  While some bribes are being taken, CADIVI is 
 
 
first and foremost a tool of the Revolution.

SUBJECT: STEEL STRIKE RAISES ISSUES OF POWER AND 
PRIVATIZATION 
 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)   A strike at the partially privatized SIDOR steel 
complex in Puerto Ordaz (Bolivar state) by a pro-government 
union has gone on for two weeks.  Company sources express 
fear that the strike, allegedly over failure to share profits 
with workers, may be a prelude to an effort to undo the 
privatization, and suspect GOV connivance.  If further 
prolonged, a shutdown at SIDOR could affect a wide range of 
Venezuelan businesses at a time when the economy remains very 
fragile.  Some employees, however, have returned to work, and 
the GOV now may be looking for a face-saving way out for the 
union.  If a negotiated solution is not found, the SIDOR 
strike could force the GOV to choose between a union that 
supports it and multinationals that it has largely left alone 
until now.  End summary. 
 
----------- 
The Players 
----------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Since April 23, SIDOR (Orinoco Steel Works), 
Venezuela\'s principal steel producer, has been hit by a 
strike by its main union, SUTISS.  SIDOR, which employs 5,700 
workers at its Puerto Ordaz (Bolivar state) mill and wharf 
complex, producing a wide variety of steel products, was 
originally a wholly-owned component of the giant state 
enterprise \"Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana\" (CVG).  It was 
largely privatized in 1998, with the sale of 70 pct to a 
consortium led by Argentine interests, but also including 
Brazilian, Mexican, and private Venezuelan firms.  The GOV, 
through CVG, retained a 10 pct interest.  When the firm was 
partially privatized, the GOV was committed to selling the 
remaining 20 pct to employees on preferential terms under a 
\"Labor Participation Program.\"  However, it has not done so, 
and it is generally believed that the Chavez government 
prefers to keep as much as possible of the firm in state 
hands (see below).  SIDOR faced hard times after its partial 
privatization, in face of over-production in the world steel 
market and an over-valued bolivar.  Ultimately, it underwent 
a reorganization in which in exchange for a cash infusion, 
the GOV (through CVG) took back an additional 10 pct, giving 
it a 40 share, including the undistributed Labor 
Participation Program stock, and leaving the consortium with 
60 pct. 
 
3.  (SBU)  SUTISS, the main SIDOR union (representing 4000 
workers), is run by elements in sympathy with the Chavez 
government, and is linked to the pro-Chavez UNT labor 
confederation, which has supported the strike.  The 
pro-Chavez union gained strength following privatization, 
when the workforce was chopped back from 13,000 in an abrupt 
manner, and has organized a number of short-term walk-outs 
since then.  Its leader, Ramon Machuca, campaigned for the 
union presidency as an opponent of privatization.  During the 
December 2002-February 2003, SUTISS led a large march on 
state oil enterprise PDVSA\'s Anaco natural gas processing 
plant in support of keeping it open.  Had the Anaco plant 
closed, all of the Guayana basic industries complex (SIDOR 
and CVG\'s Venalum and Bauxilum aluminum mills) would have had 
to just down.  In fact, they stayed open through the strike. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
The Issues - Money and Politics 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Superficially at least, this is a strike about 
money.  With SIDOR enjoying a more favorable economic 
climate, as a result of increased world demand for steel and 
a cheaper bolivar, SUTISS is demanding that the workers 
receive 90 days pay worth of \"profit-sharing.\"  SIDOR insists 
that the 15 days which it paid them as a Christmas bonus is 
all that the law requires.   The union also alleges that 
SIDOR, which has made significant payments to CVG recently, 
should be giving some of this money to the workers.  SIDOR\'s 
response is that any money it is transferring to CVG is 
repayment of debt incurred during the restructuring, and not 
any kind of dividend.  It asserts that the workers should 
look to CVG to hand over to the workers their Labor 
 
 
Participation Program shares, if they expect to benefit from 
the firm\'s improving position. 
 
5.  (SBU)  However, company sources tell us that they see a 
larger agenda here.  They suggest that union leader Machuca 
wants to create chaos with an ultimate goal of getting the 
GOV to intervene and roll back SIDOR\'s privatization. 
Connivance with the GOV is suspected here.  They note that 
upon taking office Chavez froze planned partial 
privatizations of other CVG firms.  They also suggest that 
the GOV dragged its feet on the distribution of the Labor 
Participation Program shares to individual workers to keep 
its own existing interest as high as possible to prepare for 
such a move.  There is also speculation that Machuca is 
interested in using a labor battle at SIDOR to either promote 
the candidacy of former CVG President Francisco Rangel, the 
pro-Chavez Fifth Republic Movement candidate for governor of 
Bolivar state (or in another version, to promote himself as 
an alternative to Rangel). 
 
--------------------- 
Economic Consequences 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  As the strike drags on concern is rising about its 
impact.  SIDOR has announced it will stop paying the 
strikers, a move which the union denounces as unfair.  The 
lost income will have an immediate effect on the economy in 
Bolivar.  But beyond that, the businesses which rely on 
SIDOR\'s steel are getting nervous.  (SIDOR has kept up 
intermittent deliveries from inventories thus far, but cannot 
do so indefinitely.  It has also faced union demonstrations 
and roadblocks which have turned violent, adding to its 
difficulties.)  Leaders of business associations ranging from 
the strongly anti-Chavez Venezuelan Industrial Confederation 
(CONINDUSTRIA) to the more pro-Chavez Confederation of Small 
and Medium (FEDEINDUSTRIA) have weighed in, noting that SIDOR 
supplies raw material for a wide range of businesses, and 
that some are on the verge of shutting down.  An 
advertisement placed by the steel industry\'s trade 
association noted that SIDOR\'s steel is used in everything 
from auto parts and food packaging to petroleum tubes. 
SIDOR\'s steel is also used by CVG for production processes at 
its aluminum smelting plants, and it too has called for a 
rapid end to the conflict. 
 
----------------- 
Finding a Way Out 
----------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  The GOV has been largely silent on the SIDOR 
strike.  SIDOR management has demanded that the strike be 
declared illegal, which the GOV has thus far not done.  Only 
on May 3 did the Labor Ministry become engaged, hosting a 
meeting between labor and management, which has not 
apparently moved the parties any closer.  State-owned CVG has 
published an advertisement saying that it is moving forward 
on the distribution of the Labor Participation Program shares 
to SIDOR workers (although it is not clear at all that this 
is what the union is seeking).  Thus far Chavez has made no 
comments on the strike.  News reports on May 10 and 11 stated 
that several hundred workers had voluntarily returned to 
their jobs, and implied that the return of the Labor 
Participation Program shares, plus some additional bonus 
money could be the basis for a settlement. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU)  We cannot say whether the GOV has actively been 
involved with the union in setting up this crisis or whether 
it has stumbled into it as a result of the union\'s acting on 
its own.  But it now faces difficult choices.  Letting the 
strike continue hurts an economy which the GOV has sought to 
pump up as it deals with the challenge presented by the 
political opposition\'s referendum drive.  Supporting SIDOR 
management and declaring the strike illegal would be 
tantamount to disavowing the new pro-Chavez labor movement it 
has spent so much effort in promoting.  Intervening to undo 
SIDOR\'s privatization, while attractive ideologically, would 
set the GOV up with a direct confrontation with foreign 
 
 
multinationals, including ones from two countries it is 
trying hard to cultivate, Brazil and Argentina.  If the 
strike is indeed beginning to crumble (good jobs are hard to 
come by and many workers may not want to follow the union 
over a cliff), then the distribution of the Labor 
Participaton Program shares, plus some more money (either 
from SIDOR itself or from the GOV) may allow the union to 
declare victory.  That would probably be the best short-term 
outcome from the GOV\'s point of view, unless it really does 
want to use this as a chance to \"deepen the revolution,\" 
albeit at a high political and economic cost.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELA\'S FUEL DEAL WITH ARGENTINA 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard M. Sanders.  Reason 1.4(b). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  Venezuela and Argentina are moving forward with a 
USD 200 million deal under which state oil corporation PDVSA 
sells fuel oil and diesel fuel to Argentine firms to ease its 
energy crisis, and Argentine companies sell a range of food 
products and manufactures to the GOV.  In addition to simply 
making a sale, the GOV may hope to gain political points in 
Buenos Aires, while making at least a gesture towards 
diversifying oil sales away from the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
We Send You Fuel 
---------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On May 10, Caracas newspapers announced that the 
first load of fuel oil had arrived in Argentina which had 
been purchased under an agreement signed on April 6 between 
Venezuelan Minister of Mining and Energy Rafael Ramirez_ and 
Argentine Minister of Planning Julio de Vido.  That same day 
econcouns met with Alberto Alvarez, the Argentine Embassy\'s 
Economic-Commercial Counselor, who outlined the scope of the 
deal.  Noting that Argentina faced a severe power shortage, 
as a result of its post-default growth surge, together with a 
failure to provide adequate incentives for natural gas 
production, he said that the short-term solution was to 
re-open closed power plants which could run on fuel oil and 
diesel fuel. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The deal, he said, entailed the purchase of USD 
200 million in fuel oil and diesel fuel, which would be sold 
by PDVSA to a private Argentine entity called CAMMESA 
(Wholesale Electricity Market Management Company), which 
would in turn sell it to the various companies with 
mothballed power plants.  The amount sold would be 8 million 
barrels of fuel oil and 1 million barrels of diesel over the 
next six months (the Southern Hemisphere winter).  PDVSA 
would charge the market price for these products.  However, 
it would agree to payment within 45 days instead of the seven 
or ten days which is normal in such purchases. 
 
-------------------------- 
You Send Us Other Products 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Alvarez said that CAMMESA would take the money 
earned from the sale of the fuel oil and diesel fuel and put 
it into a trust fund to be jointly administered by PDVSA, the 
Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES), which is owned 
by the GOV, and the Foreign Trade and Investment Bank (BICE) 
owned by the GOA.  The money would be used for the purchase 
of Argentine products by Venezuelan ministries and state 
corporations.  PDVSA would purchase a range of metal products 
such as steel tubes and valves.  The Agricultural Supply 
Corporation (CASA), an arm of the GOV\'s Ministry of 
Agriculture, would buy products such as powdered milk, 
sunflower and soybean oil, yellow corn and beef.  (CASA is 
the vehicle for supplying the GOV\'s MERCAL program of 
state-run food markets in low income neighborhoods.)  The 
Office of the Minister of State for Special Economic Zones (a 
rural development agency) will buy live cattle.  The Ministry 
of Health would buy medical supplies for state hospitals. 
Alvarez said that the price of the various products to be 
sold would be set by a bidding process. 
 
------------------------- 
Comment:  Buying Friends? 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  This kind of creaky, state-to-state counter-trade 
arrangement seems like a throwback to the 1960\'s or earlier. 
Still, as outlined by Argentine diplomat Alvarez, this deal 
seems fairly neutral from an economic point of view. 
Argentina gets needed fuel with a longer repayment period 
than it would otherwise have, and some new access for its 
food and other products to the Venezuelan state sector. 
Venezuela finds a new market for petroleum products. 
 
However, we also see some political angles here.  PDVSA is 
largely dependent on the U.S. market, a situation which has 
never sat well with Chavez.  This sale to Argentina, while 
hardly affecting the overall structure of PDVSA\'s marketing, 
is at least a down payment on further diversification.  The 
purchase in turn of other products from Argentina fits in 
nicely with the GOV\'s ideological predilection for 
south-south trade, and in particular with the MERCOSUR 
countries (again as opposed to the U.S.). 
 
6.  (C) And by coming to Argentina\'s rescue at its hour of 
need, the GOV may be hoping to purchase some good will in 
Buenos Aires.  When Kirchner took office, there was 
considerable speculation here that he would have a close 
rapport with Chavez as a fellow leftist.  This has proven not 
to be the case.  Argentina has kept a low profile here, and 
while hardly anti-Chavez, it has shown its support for the 
democratic process,  most notably by Kirchner\'s meeting with 
representatives of Venezuela\'s opposition during his last 
visit here.  Petro-diplomacy has a long tradition in 
Venezuela, although it has usually been used with the 
Caribbean and Central American countries, who receive 
preferential prices for Venezuelan oil.  It remains to be 
seen whether Venezuelan fuel oil can be used to warm 
relations with Argentina as well as Argentine homes.  We note 
that according to Alvarez, if Argentina\'s energy crisis is 
not resolved by next year, it may want to renew the current 
deal.

CRISIS? 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard Sanders for reasons 1.4 (b) a 
nd (d) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) After dodging the drought bullet in 2003, Venezuela\'s 
power sector is once again (still?) in a fragile state.  This 
time, however, other weaknesses in the electric power system 
caused by lack of investment, government inattention, and 
political meddling are taking center stage.  The problems are 
centered around CADAFE, a state-owned company that is largely 
responsible for the national transmission grid.  Legendarily 
inefficient and corrupt, CADAFE is described as \"untouchable\" 
under the Chavez regime, according to industry sources.  In 
fact, CADAFE is reportedly a test case for populist 
\"co-management\" structures for the GOV.  The Chavez 
Government has also shown a willingness further to threaten 
the electric power system with political retaliation against 
top managers.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
THE RAINS SAVE THE DAY 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) Venezuela\'s installed electrical generation capacity 
is 20,908 MW, of which about 13,500 MW or approximately 65 
percent is provided by hydroelectric stations.  The largest 
of these, Guri (the world\'s third largest dam by one 
measure), located in the southwest of the country, delivers 
9.025 MW alone.  In 2003, the water levels in the Guri 
reservoir reached historic lows.  This led to fears that 
power would have to be drastically rationed.  The early onset 
of the rainy season, however, forestalled what might have 
been yet another blow to Venezuela\'s battered economy.  As of 
April 29, 2004, the dam\'s water level stood at 252.45 meters 
above sea level or about 7.90 meters higher than the historic 
minimum set in 2003.  While the water level is low, the 
operations of Guri\'s turbines are not expected to be at risk 
in 2004.  Instead, other weaknesses in the Venezuelan 
electric power system caused by lack of investment, 
government inattention, and political meddling are taking 
center stage.  Much of the concern about the system is 
focused on CADAFE (Compania Anonima de Administracion y 
Fomento Electrico), a state-owned company that, in addition 
to managing thermal electric plants such as the Planta 
Central plant near Caracas, is also responsible for the 
national transmission grid and transmits and distributes 
electricity to about 80 percent of Venezuela. 
 
------------------------- 
ELECTRICAL SECTOR FAILURE 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) On March 31, emboffs met with Carlos Mibelli, 
President of the Venezuelan Association of Power Companies 
(CAVEINEL), for a sectoral overview.  Mibelli praised GOV 
efforts to introduce a regulatory framework in 2001 but 
cautioned that signficant work needed to be done to create a 
truly competitive market.  He pointed to CADAFE, the largest 
national operator, as the source of most of the sector\'s 
inefficiency.  Mibelli estimated CADAFE\'s average 
\"non-technical losses,\" i.e., theft by illegal hook-ups, at 
40 percent and said he did not foresee any real effort to 
streamline the company\'s corrupt operations and management 
because of CADAFE\'s untouchable status under the Chavez 
administration.  Mibelli described the industry\'s public 
enterprises as well into a process of \"slow death\" since 
rates were only allowed to increase by 10 percent in the last 
two years, far below inflation.  He predicted the GOV\'s 
maintenance of a populist stance towards the sector would 
result in long-term system failure. 
 
4. (C) Miguel Lara, General Manager of OPSIS, the Office for 
the Operation of Interconnected Systems, identified the main 
problem for Venezuela\'s power sector as the lack of long-term 
planning on the part of the GOV.  In an April 1 meeting, Lara 
explained that OPSIS had been created in 1968 to manage the 
planning, operation and interchange of energy between the 
largest public and private generation companies in Venezuela. 
 As a large part of the country\'s power is hydro-generated, 
said Lara, periodic droughts can have a significant impact on 
the system\'s ability to deliver electricity.  2003 saw one of 
the biggest droughts in Venezuelan history, resulting in a 
season of rolling blackouts.  Lara called Venezuela\'s thermal 
 
 
generation facilities deficient.  He said a crisis was 
averted in 2003 only because a long-anticipated contribution 
from the Caruachi Dam on the Caroni River in southwestern 
Venezuela finally entered the grid and demand fell 
dramatically due to the economic contraction. 
 
5. (C) Lara expected demand for power to grow 5-6 percent in 
2004 putting significant additional stress on an already 
overloaded system.  Caruachi may be able to generate enough 
power to meet increasing demand in the next few years, 
however, there are no long range plans for other projects in 
development at this time.  Lara predicted this lack of 
long-term infrastructural planning would inevitably lead to a 
system crisis at some point in the future. 
 
---------------------------------- 
POLITICIZATION OF THE POWER SECTOR 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The power sector has also felt the effects of the 
political retaliation that has followed the effort to force a 
presidential recall election.  On March 19, econoff met with 
Ciro Portillo, former Vice President of ENELVEN (Energia 
Electrica de Venezuela), a state-owned utility serving the 
western part of Zulia state.  According to Portillo, 18 
Enelven managers were informed by their supervisors on March 
2 that they would be immediately fired unless they agreed to 
retract their signatures on the presidential recall 
petitions.  One manager subsequently retracted but the 
remaining 17, each with an average of 20 years of experience 
and a total of 350 years of power sector experience between 
them, were either forced to retire or given severance 
packages.  Portillo, who had had 36 years in ENELVEN, 
reported that it was made clear to him that if he did not go 
quietly he would not receive any retirement benefits.  In the 
March 31 meeting with CAVEINEL President Mibelli, Mibelli 
told econoffs he had seen another list of 80 mid-level 
ENELVEN employees who were being pressured to recant their 
signatures. Other politically-motivated harrassment has been 
reported in EDELCA (Electrificacion del Caroni), the 
state-owned company that handles the massive hydroelectric 
projects on the Coroni river.  Finally, econoff learned on 
April 2 that Miguel Lara and two other top OPSIS managers 
would also be forcibly retired because they had signed 
presidential recall petitions. 
 
------------------------------ 
CADAFE:  A FAILING EXPERIMENT? 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) On April 6, Econoff called on Andres Gluski, President 
of Electricidad de Caracas (majority U.S.-owned by AES 
Corp.), to ask his opinion about the dire predictions for the 
stability of the electrical power sector.  Gluski confirmed 
that Venezuela\'s power system is in a fragile state.  Gluski 
said that in early March the system had come close to a major 
blackout.  At that time, EDC had a turbine down for scheduled 
maintenance and, while this should not have been a problem, 
CADAFE also had had two of its three turbines at Planta 
Central off-line because of unexpected problems.  Gluski 
noted his concern that a blackout affecting Caracas would 
give the GOV an excuse to call for a state of emergency. 
Ultimately, a blackout was avoided.  Given CADAFE\'s problems, 
Gluski commented that the entire Venezuelan electricity 
system could be at risk of destabilization.  He also pointed 
to the critical role played by OPSIS in managing national 
load factors, stating that if Miguel Lara and other top OPSIS 
managers depart, OPSIS will not be handled as efficiently and 
the effects of CADAFE\'s shortcomings will be magnified. 
 
8. (C) Miguel Lara noted to econoff that CADAFE has routinely 
incurred huge losses since its inception due to corruption, 
bad management, a flawed billing system and low rate 
increases.  He added that these problems have been 
exacerbated because of the political impossibility of 
criticizing CADAFE under this administration.  According to 
Lara and Mibelli, CADAFE is being used as a test case for 
\"co-management\" structures under which a three tier system of 
circles (operations, management and executive circles) has 
been created to manage the company.  In the operations 
circle, groups of approximately 20 workers jointly decide on 
company policies.  Mibelli noted that as opposed to similar 
systems implemented in countries such as Japan where the 
managers would take the advice of workers and make a 
decision, in CADAFE the workers can override decisions by 
managers.  Gluski added that a radical wing of the Patria 
 
 
para Todos Party (PPT - Fatherland for All) has been trying 
to infiltrate the electrical unions and has been particularly 
active in CADAFE.  In sum, without a fundamental 
restructuring of CADAFE, these men predict uneven power 
distribution as a fact of life for the future. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) CADAFE was expected to be restructured as a result of 
a framework law governing generation, transmission and 
distribution passed by the Chavez Government in 2001.  The 
law was intended to unbundle service activities and to create 
competition and a spot electricity market.  Instead, it 
appears increasingly likely that the Chavez Government will 
not implement the law and CADAFE\'s many shortcomings will not 
be addressed.  The Chavez Government has also shown a 
willingness further to threaten a fragile electric power 
system with the implementation of populist management 
structures and political retaliation against top managers. 
While the GOV should be considering steps to prepare for 
rationing, it apears to be ready to take the risk of a major 
power failure instead.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) FOUR MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY WERE DETAINED APRIL 28 IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE MARCH 5 DEATH OF THE SOLDIER ROBERT 
AGUILAR AT SOCUAVO MILITARY BASE IN ZULIA STATE.   AGUILAR\'S 
FAMILY CLAIMS HE DROWNED AFTER SUPERIOR OFFICERS PUT HIM IN A 
TANK OF SEWAGE AS PUNISHMENT.  DEFENSE MINISTER GEN. JORGE 
LUIS GARCIA CARNEIRO DENIED THAT AGUILAR WAS BEING PUNISHED, 
ASSERTING THAT OFFICERS CAUSED HIS DEATH WHEN THEY FAILED TO 
FOLLOW STANDARD PROCEDURES DURING SWIMMING PRACTICE. 
MILITARY AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF THE 
SOLDIER JOHN KERVIN DURAN FEBRUARY 27 AT FORT TIUNA IN 
CARACAS.  DURAN REPORTEDLY DIED AFTER SEVERAL UNEXPLAINED 
TRIPS TO THE HOSPITAL, AND HIS FAMILY WAS NOT PERMITTED TO 
SEE HIS BODY.  ARMY COMMANDER GEN. RAUL BADUEL TOLD THE PRESS 
APRIL 24 THAT IT IS \"STRANGE\" THAT DURAN\'S FAMILY WAITED TWO 
MONTHS TO ACCUSE THE MILITARY OF CAUSING HIS DEATH. 
INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH DEATHS CONTINUE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) ARMY SOLDIER ROBERT AGUILAR DROWNED MARCH 5 AT SOCUAVO 
MILITARY BASE IN ZULIA STATE.  FOUR MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY, 
INCLUDING SECOND LTS. OSCAR DANIEL GUEDEZ AND JOSE LUIS 
UZCATEGUI, WERE DETAINED APRIL 28 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
DROWNING.  THE OFFICERS FACE CHARGES OF QUALIFIED HOMICIDE, 
ABUSE OF AUTHORITY, DISOBEDIENCE, AND CAUSING INJURY TO A 
FELLOW SOLDIER.  AGUILAR\'S FATHER TOLD THE PRESS APRIL 21 
THAT TWO OFFICERS FROM THE BASE BROUGHT HIS SON\'S BODY TO 
HIM, SAYING THAT HE HAD DROWNED ACCIDENTALLY DURING SWIMMING 
    PRACTICE AND THREATENING THE FATHER AND HIS OTHER SON IF THEY 
FILED A COMPLAINT.  THE FATHER CHARGED THAT AGUILAR, WHO 
COULD NOT SWIM, HAD DROWNED AFTER GUEDEZ AND UZCATEGUI PLACED 
HIM IN A TANK OF SEWAGE AS PUNISHMENT FOR SLEEPING ON DUTY. 
 
3. (U) DENYING THAT AGUILAR DIED WHILE BEING PUNISHED, 
DEFENSE MINISTER GEN. JORGE LUIS GARCIA CARNEIRO SAID APRIL 
23 THAT THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUGGESTED THAT 
AGUILAR\'S COMMANDING OFFICERS EXHIBITED \"IMPRUDENCE\" WHEN 
THEY FAILED TO FOLLOW STANDARD PROCEDURES DURING A SWIMMING 
PRACTICE.  GARCIA CARNEIRO SAID THAT THOSE OFFICERS WOULD BE 
DISCIPLINED, AND THAT A MILITARY TRIBUNAL WOULD RULE ON THE 
MATTER SHORTLY.  THE ZULIA STATE PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE HAS 
FILED A MOTION FOR THE CASE TO BE TRIED IN CIVILIAN COURT. 
 
4. (U) ON FEBRUARY 27, SOLDIER JOHN KERVIN DURAN DIED AT FORT 
TIUNA IN CARACAS, REPORTEDLY AFTER SEVERAL UNEXPLAINED TRIPS 
TO THE HOSPITAL.  SPEAKING TO REPORTERS, ONE RELATIVE CLAIMED 
TO HAVE SEEN BRUISES ON DURAN\'S FACE AND UPPER BODY, THOUGH 
THE AUTOPSY INDICATED NO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL INJURIES.  THE 
REST OF THE FAMILY WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE BODY BECAUSE THE 
HOSPITAL HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER QUARANTINE, ACCORDING TO NEWS 
REPORTS.  ARMY COMMANDER GEN. RAUL BADUEL CAST DOUBT ON THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THE DURAN FAMILY\'S CLAIMS, BECAUSE THEY HAD 
WAITED \"ALMOST TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FACT\" TO QUESTION THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH.  GEN. BADUEL IMPLIED THAT THEY 
WERE ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE USED BY THE GOV\'S ENEMIES. 
THE FAMILY EXPRESSED ITS CONCERNS ON THE MILITARY\'S HANDLING 
OF DURAN\'S CASE TO THE PRIVATE TV BROADCASTER GLOBOVISION 
APRIL 23.  SPEAKING TO THE PRESS APRIL 24, BADUEL INSISTED 
THAT \"THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT CONCEALING IMPROPER ACTS.\" 

------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) GEN. BADUEL\'S ASSURANCES NOTWITHSTANDING, THE MILITARY 
IS TRYING TO CONCEAL ITS MISDEEDS AND SENDING THE MESSAGE 
THAT THE PHYSICAL ABUSE OF SUBORDINATES BY OFFICERS IS 
NORMAL.  SUCH ABUSE HAS BEEN A COMMON PRACTICE IN THE 
MILITARY BUT RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION UNTIL THE OPPOSITION 
REALIZED ITS POTENTIAL AS A POLITICAL WEAPON.  A RECENT 
EXCEPTION WAS THE CASE OF ARMY LT. ALESSANDRO SICCAT, NOTED 
IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES.  SICCAT WAS 
CONVICTED BY A CIVILIAN COURT FOR THE JANUARY 2001 BURNING 
AND MURDER OF AN ALLEGEDLY DISOBEDIENT SOLDIER.

REF: 03 CARACAS 1357 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) THE GOV UNILATERALLY DECREED A 30  INCREASE IN THE 
MINIMUM WAGE, ATTEMPTING TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION FOR THE 
LOWEST-EARNING WORKERS.  HOWEVER, THOUGH OVERALL INFLATION IS 
RELATIVELY DOWN, FOOD PRICES ARE INCREASING FASTER THAN ANY 
OTHER CATEGORY, AND THIS NEW ACTION IS ONLY GOING TO 
EXACERBATE THAT.  PURCHASING POWER IS SLIPPING AWAY, AS THE 
GOV CONTINUES TO MAKE ECONOMIC DECISIONS BASED ON POLITICS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
BY THE NUMBERS 
-------------- 
 
2. (U) ON MAY 1, THE GOV DECREED A MINIMUM WAGE (AND SOCIAL 
SECURITY PENSION) INCREASE OF A TOTAL OF 30 , 20  EFFECTIVE 
ON MAY 1 AND THE OTHER 10  ON AUGUST 1.  THIS BRINGS THE 
TOTAL INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO JUST OVER 100  SINCE 
APRIL 2002.  ALTHOUGH THE LAW ALLOWS THE GOV TO MAKE THIS 
DECISION UNILATERALLY, IT FIRST REQUIRES CONSULTATIONS WITH 
    BUSINESS AND LABOR REPRESENTATIVES, A STEP WHICH WAS IGNORED 
AS IT WAS LAST YEAR (REFTEL).  IN ADDITION, THE GOV RAISED 
SALARIES FOR MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYEES 38  (30  FOR TEACHERS), 
ALONG WITH A ONE-TIME 2 MILLION BOLIVAR (1 MILLION FOR 
TEACHERS) BONUS. 
 
--------------------- 
RE-INFLATION FORESEEN 
--------------------- 
 
3. (U) INFLATION HAS DROPPED TO 23.1  ANNUALIZED (COMPARED 
TO 33.5  A YEAR AGO), WHILE WHOLESALE INFLATION IS AT 33 . 
HOWEVER, ECONOMISTS AGREE THAT THE WAGE INCREASE WILL RAISE 
INFLATION MORE, POSSIBLY TO AROUND 35  BY THE END OF 2004. 
EVEN THE GOV AGREES: WILMAR CASTRO, MINISTER OF PRODUCTION 
AND COMMERCE, SAID LAST WEEK THAT \"AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE 
SALARY INCREASE, THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE AN EFFECT ON 
PRICES.\"  WHILE OVERALL INFLATION HAS DROPPED, THE HARDEST 
HIT SECTOR HAS BEEN FOOD AND NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 
DESPITE PRICE CONTROLS, PRICES IN THIS CATEGORY HAVE 
INCREASED OVER 40  IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS THROUGH MARCH 
(FOLLOWING A 35  INCREASE THE YEAR BEFORE).  NOTE: THE 40 
FIGURE IS BASED ON MULTIPLE PRESS REPORTS CITING THE NATIONAL 
STATISTICS INSTITUTE (INE) AS THE SOURCE, BUT A CALL PLACED 
BY THE EMBASSY TO THE INE ELICITED THE ANSWER THAT 
INFORMATION SINCE JANUARY IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. 
END NOTE.

COMMENT 
------- 

4. (U) FINMIN NOBREGA HAS CALLED THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
SITUATION AN \"OPTIMAL COMBINATION\": CONTAINING INFLATION (THE 
2004 BUDGET ASSUMED INFLATION OF 25 ) AND GDP GROWTH.  THERE 
HAS UNDENIABLY BEEN A PARTIAL RECOVERY IN OVERALL CONSUMER 
SPENDING, AND OUR CONTACTS IN THAT SECTOR ARE REPORTING 
INCREASED SALES.  HOWEVER, THOSE EARNING THE MINIMUM WAGE, 
FOR WHOM FOOD IS FAR AND AWAY THEIR MOST IMPORTANT PURCHASE, 
HAVE LITTLE TO CHEER ABOUT.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELAN VP RANGEL ON BILATERAL RELATIONS 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CHARLES S. SHAPIRO FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) 
and (d) 
 
--------- 
  SUMMARY 
 --------- 
1. (C)  The Ambassador met May 12 with VP Rangel and the 
FonMin Perez to complain about GOV hostility towards the US, 
including recent statements, the search of the Embassy 
warehouse, and the removal of the MILGP from Ven bases.  He 
reiterated our total rejection of extraconstitutional actions 
against the GOV.  Rangel blamed the US for always criticizing 
the GOV; apologized for the warehouse search; and reaffirmed 
the decision to move the MILGP.  He expressed frustration 
with the statements and actions of opposition figures in the 
US; concern about the paramilitary threat; and reiterated 
that the GOV believed that the GOV, and the Ambassador, were 
involved in the April 2002 coup attempt.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
 GOV POLICY TO ATTACK THE US 
----------------------------- 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador met May 12 with Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel and Foreign Minister Jesus Perez.  DCM also 
attended.  The Ambassador detailed US concerns about 
bilateral relations and recent allegations that the US 
supported alleged coup plotting: 
 
--The GOV\'s decision to constantly attack the USG, since at 
least August 2003, including personal attacks against the 
President, the Secretary, and National Security Adviser Rice. 
 
--The statements just May 11 by the GOV\'s ombudsman, German 
Mundarain, that accused the State Department of involvement 
with the alleged coup conspiracy of the 100 plus arrested 
Colombians; 
 
--The illegal May 10 search by the Guardia Nacional (GN) of 
the US Embassy warehouse.  We are particularly concerned by 
statements by the lawyer of the warehouse owner that the GN 
Major specifically asked which warehouse was the US Embassy\'s 
so he could search it; and 
 
--The May 7 letter from MOD Garcia Corneiro giving the DATT a 
deadline of May 30 for the MILGP to vacate all Venezuela 
military installations. 
 
3. (C) Regarding the 100 plus alleged \"paramilitaries\" that 
the GOV has detained, and whom the GOV claims are linked to 
the Coordinadora (CD) and others in the opposition, the 
Ambassador stressed that the US firmly supports democracy, 
and rejects any extraconstitutional actions in Venezuela.  In 
terms of the Colombian paramilitary groups, the US has done 
more than any other country besides Colombia to oppose them. 
We consider such groups to be terrorists, just like the FARC, 
and we are seeking the extradition of their leaders on 
narcotics charges.  We have no information on the persons 
just captured by the GOV; should there be any link between 
them and persons in the US, the US would cooperate in the 
investigation if the GOV so requested. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 RANGEL: \"WE DON\'T ATTACK BUT MERELY COUNTERATTACK\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
4.  (C)  Rangel responded in a sweeping fashion that the GOV 
had never attacked the US, but rather had counterattacked. 
There were continuous statements by USG officials that 
criticized the GOV and put in doubt its legitimacy, and the 
GOV would not be silent.  \"We are a small country, but we 
have our dignity.\" Most recently, during the Interamerican 
Press Society meeting, A/S Noriega had sharply criticized the 
GOV.  Florida Governor Bush just did the same.  It was 
possible that there had been some exaggerations (by the GOV, 
Rangel implied), but in almost every case the US started the 
argument.  Rangel said he had suggested to the US that both 
countries put aside their microphones, but the US had not 
done so.  If the US made up information linking the GOV to 
the FARC, the GOV would respond.  If Senator Nelson attacked 
the GOV, GOV Deputy Tarek Saab would return the favor. 
 
5.  (C)  Regarding possible cooperation in the GOV 
investigation of the Colombians, Rangel expressed 
appreciation, and said that the DISIP (secret police) and DIM 
(military intelligence) would share information with US 
agencies. 
 
6.  (C)  On the warehouse search, Rangel said he would 
 
reiterate -- he did so twice -- Venezuela Ambassador to the 
US Alvarez\' apologies to DAS Deshazo for the search.  He 
insisted that the GN did not know that the warehouse was 
occupied by the US Embassy; had it known, it would not have 
searched it. (Note:  However, when the GN were told this by 
warehouse employees, they went ahead anyway and searched the 
place.) 
 
7.  (C)  Rangel said that the GOV was not saying that there 
was a link between the USG and the \"paramilitaries\" that the 
GOV had captured (Note: One hour later, President Chavez said 
there was a \"vast international conspiracy\" to overthrow the 
GOV to control Venezuelan oil.)  But it was a fact that 
accused coup plotter Roberto Alonso was in the US and made 
statements with impunity.  Carlos Ortega and Carlos Fernandez 
(leaders of the 2002 paro) and journalist Patricia Poleo went 
to Miami to lead marches against Chavez.  The Ambassador 
interrupted that in the US., visitors also had freedom of 
speech,  these individuals had not committed crimes in the 
US., and the GOV had not sought their extradition.  Rangel 
said that it was fine for the US to say that it does not 
approve of extraconstitutional activity -- \"but you know that 
the US was involved in the April 2002 coup, members of the US 
military group were involved, and we will soon reveal the 
proof that you personally and the USG were involved.\"  The 
Ambassador rejected this categorically; Rangel threatened 
that the GOV would reveal its proof as the US had requested. 
 
8.  (C)  Rangel said that the removal of the MILGP from 
Venezuelan military bases was based on the need to use the 
space on these bases for other purposes.  When he was MOD, he 
ordered the MILGP off Venezuelan facilities but the orders 
had never been executed.  He said he believed it 
inappropriate for any country\'s military to be housed on 
Venezuelan facilities.  The Ambassador stated that the 
Venezuelan military had  similar space on three US military 
bases; Rangel said that the situations were different, the 
Venezuelans had no space in the equivalent to Fuerte Tiuna, 
which would be the Pentagon.  In any case, when US generals 
such as Gen. Hill and Gen. Meyer openly criticized President 
Chavez, it is inappropriate to have US military on Venezuelan 
bases. 
 
9.  (C)  Rangel said he understood the US had a very clear 
position on the \"paramilitaries;\" so did the GOV.  He said 
there were some 1,000 Colombian paramilitaries in the border 
area; the 130 captured so far were just the \"tip of the 
iceberg.\"  Those captured included some 20 whose ID cards 
from Colombia said \"reservist\" or \"professional soldier.\" 
Powerful economic interests (Rangel did not elaborate when 
asked) were behind this paramilitary effort, as were retired 
and active duty Venezuelan military officers.  Perez 
interjected that the GOV remained concerned -- as he had 
noted previously to the Ambassador -- about Venezuelans in 
Miami who were plotting against the GOV;  Rangel wound up by 
stating that the GOV sought \"serious relations\" with the US. 
The GOV would not accept anything else.  If there had to be 
permanent controversy between the two countries, so be it -- 
but the GOV was not locked into this position. 
 
--------- 
 COMMENT 
--------- 
10.  (C)  Rangel was fairly wound up and insulting -- and yet 
was more restrained than President Chavez was in his 
subsequent TV speech on national security (septel). 
Predictably, he was firm on the decision to remove the MILGP 
from Fuerte Tiuna; he was apologetic about the search of the 
Embassy warehouse -- but we still think the GOV at some level 
carried out this action deliberately.  Rangel appeared both 
energized and enthusiastic about pursuing the \"paramilitary\" 
issue, as is Chavez.  Much of Rangel\'s presentation followed 
the same points -- even used the same \"tip of the iceberg\" 
language -- that Chavez used in his speech one hour later. 
 
11.  (C)  We do not have enough information about the 
supposed paramilitaries.  Clearly, they are not Boy Scouts 
and we should not dismiss the GOV claims out of hand.  There 
is at least one victim supposedly executed by these 
\"paramilitaries\".  Our working hypothesis is that they may 
well be Colombian campesinos hired for an illegal purpose 
here.  But the timing is too good to be true for the GOV. 
They are certainly using it as a pretext to round up enemies 
and are flagging the paramilitaries as \"proof\" of US and 
Colombian plans to destabilize Venezuela.  In this 
environment reparos have been relegated to minor news. 
Rumors are once again circulating that the GOV is planning to 
 
declare a State of Emergency.

SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN \"PARAMILITARIES\" IN VENEZUELA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for reasons 
1.4 (a) and (b). 
 
1. (C) The Chavez administration is beside itself that the 
Venezuelan public in general, the international community, 
and the media are reacting very skeptically to the 
allegations of  a Colombian \"paramilitary\" threat to his 
government.  On May 9, Chavez went on a national TV and radio 
hookup to reveal the alleged conspiracy against him, and on 
May 12 Chavez inaugurated the National Defense Council with 
an impassioned speech in which he charged that SouthCom Cdr 
GEN James Hill had foreknowledge of the &invasion.8 Then 
Ambassador Jorge Valero denounced the invasion at the OAS, 
and chavista politicians are screaming themselves hoarse 
demanding that the Vatican, Colombia, the OAS, the United 
States, the Carter Center and anyone else with any 
credibility denounce the conspiracy. 
 
2. (C) So far the facts are few. Over 100 men have been 
detained.  The Colombian Embassy confirms that of the first 
50  names supplied by the GOV all are Colombian citizens. 
They were recruited and moved to a farm southeast of Caracas. 
The Metropolitan Police and the El Hatillo municipal police 
say that in the early morning of May 9 they stopped two buses 
full of men in uniform and alerted the National Guard.  The 
GOV claims the men were captured by a joint National 
Guard-DISIP-CICPC-DIM taskforce on a farm belonging to 
Cuban-Venezuelan Roberto Alonso.  However detained, they were 
apparently housed on that farm. They were unarmed except for 
one individual with a pistol, and they were wearing 
Venezuelan Army camouflage uniforms. 
 
3. (C) It is not known if these men are in fact 
paramilitaries.  The Colombian Ambassador told me that none 
of the names match their database of known paramilitaries. 
The deputy director of DIM could provide emboff with no 
details beyond the fact they come from Colombia,s Norte de 
Santander Department.  Asked which paramilitary front they 
belonged to, the DIM Deputy was stumped.  Nonetheless, these 
people are not Boy Scouts on an outing.  Our working 
hypothesis is that they are Colombian campesinos (not 
paramilitaries) recruited by someone.  The question is who. 
 
4. (C) I see four possibilities: 
 
--  The chavista version is that there really is a 
well-organized USG-GOC conspiracy led by the Coordinadora 
Democratica and funded by major business and media leaders. 
VP Rangel told me on May  12 that they were planning to 
attack simultaneously the presidential  palace (during an 
official dinner the night of May 12), the presidential 
residence, and an unnamed National Guard facility in Caracas. 
 They were going to pick up their weapons on the way to the 
attack and had been training with sticks (!) at the farm 
where they were hidden.  There are 1000 more 
\"paramilitaries\" around Venezuela, concentrated in the 
three states coincidentally controlled by the strongest 
opposition governors.  This official version requires 
suspension of disbelief. 
 
-- A group of radicals opposed to the government (perhaps 
within an organization called the Bloque Democratico) hired 
unemployed Colombian campesinos in an extraordinarily clumsy 
attempt to create enough disorder that a general uprising 
against Chavez would ensure.  This is more plausible than the 
first scenario. 
 
-- A variation is that the GOV knew of this plot through its 
penetrations and wiretaps of the opposition and let it 
develop to see whom they could smoke out.  On two recent road 
trips, I was stopped at numerous National Guard and state 
police roadblocks.  While I was passed through, buses were 
emptied of passengers who had to show identification to the 
police.  It is hard to imagine that 100 Colombians of 
military age could pass through numerous roadblocks and 
travel hundreds of miles to a secret rendezvous, even in 
small groups. 
 
-- A more malignant possibility is that the GOV organized 
this whole enterprise, that the Colombians were hired without 
knowing who the real organizers were and at least some 
radical anti-chavistas got caught up in the charade.  Chavez 
claims that he knew about the April 2002 coup and went along 
in order to smoke out disloyal military officers and reveal 
the true nature of the opposition. 
 
Whether the GOV discovered the plot or facilitated it, there 
is also a possibility that the &invasion8 will serve as the 
pretext for declaring a state of emergency and taking actions 
agains the media. 
 
5. (C) Whatever the truth is, Chavez is upset that people are 
not buying the officialversion which they are frantically 
flogging to dscredit the opposition, overshadow the reparos, 
nd prove US and Colombian threat to Venezuelan sovreignty. 
 
6. (C) The hard-core Chavistas do not need any convincing. 
They believe whatever propagada line the GOV is selling at 
any particular tim.  They believe not because they have been 
brainashed by a totalitarian state, but because they wat 
to.  The chavistas have suspended their disbelief. 
 
7. (C) But the majority of Venezuelans and te international 
media and diplomatic community ae skeptical.  Chavez 
screamed that the Oppositio committed mega-fraud during the 
petition drive. It is not so.  Chavez claimed that the 
United States is planning to invade Venezuela.  It is not so 
 Now Chavez claims hired Colombian paramilitaris have 
invaded Venezuela and is shocked that peole don,t believe 
him. 
 
8. (C) What we need to o: 
 
-- Keep our focus on reparos.  The joint OAS/Carter Center 
statement on May 12 recaptured the eadlines in the 
Venezuelan press. 
 
-- Repeat or policy is enshrined in OAS Res. 833, while 
rejcting all extra-constitutional actions or use of frce 
for political ends. 
 
-- Reiterate our willingness, if requested, for US law 
enforcement to fllow up on any information that leads to the 
US. 
-- Reject the absurd charges of US involvement, but in a 
matter-of-fact manner that does not allow US-Venezuelan 
relations to overshadow the reparo. 
 
-- Use this incident as a way to urge Colombia and Venezuela 
to increase cooperation against international terrorism 
against both the FARC and the paramilitaries.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero issued an ultimatum to the OAS and The Carter 
Center (TCC) to either retract their statement of May 12 or 
the CNE would reconsider the OAS/TCC observation mission of 
the recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  The May 
12 statement rejected the GOV\'s position that people who 
signed the recall petition against President Hugo Chavez may 
withdraw their names if they change their minds.  The OAS/TCC 
responded May 13 recognizing that the political actors had 
agreed on the point even though it went beyond the CNE norms. 
 Debate at the CNE continues, meanwhile, as rules are worked 
out for the verification of identity documents at the appeals 
centers and for the count of the results.  The CNE has 
printed the registers for the appeals (\"cuadernos\") and will 
make them available to the political actors and international 
observers for review.  The dispute with the OAS/TCC may blow 
over as it is not in the interest of either side to lose the 
international observers at this time.  End summary.

Carrasquero demanded on May 13 that the OAS and the Carter 
Center (TCC) retract a statement made on May 12 regarding 
norms for the May 27-31 signature appeals process. 
Carrasquero said that by emitting publicly an opinion on the 
CNE\'s norms, the international observers violated the 
November 2003 agreement with the CNE.  If the OAS/TCC did not 
apologize or clarify their position, he said, the CNE would 
reconsider the continuation of the international observer 
missions.  Minutes earlier, CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez 
(pro-GOV) accused the OAS/TCC of siding with the opposition 
and said he would no longer meet with OAS/TCC representatives 
until they apologized.  Rodriguez left the future of the 
missions open, saying he preferred that the OAS/TCC remain in 
the country because \"the CNE has nothing to hide.\" 
 
3. (C) The blow-up centers on whether signers of the recall 
petition against Chavez may \"repent\" and withdraw their 
signatures during the appeals period.  In the May 12 
statement, the OAS/TCC said that CNE norms and international 
standards dictated that the act of signing, like that of 
voting, is a unique expression of will and cannot be changed 
during the appeals process.  CNE rules issued in September 
said that names could be withdrawn from the petition only if 
the person claimed that he or she had not actually signed. 
Chavez supporters -- and the CNE\'s chavista majority -- 
maintain that anyone who changed his mind could remove his 
signature.  Chief OAS observer Marcelo Alvarez told poloff 
that it is not fair to permit some people to remove their 
names without letting others who did not sign the original 
petition the option of adding their names. 
 
---------------- 
OAS/TCC Makes Up 
---------------- 
 
4. (U) The OAS/TCC issued a new statement on May 13 
responding to the CNE\'s demands for an apology.  The 
statement \"clarified\" the position of the international 
observers that they continue to support the literal 
translation of the rules -- that only those whose identities 
were usurped may withdraw.  OAS/TCC added, however, that they 
recognized that the political actors had agreed with the CNE 
that to avoid new procedures, \"the simple manifestation of 
the person\'s desire was sufficient\" to include or exclude 
 
them from the lists. (Comment:  This is an artful step back 
from the May 12 statement and reflects the opposition stand 
on this point.  End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------- 
Technical Issues Debate Continues 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The CNE continues to prepare for the two appeals 
process (opposition deputies May 20-24 and the presidential 
May 27-31).  The role of poll workers remains in dispute. 
For example, the CNE\'s legal counsel Andres Brito again 
circulated a draft instruction May 11 that reportedly would 
allow poll workers at the appeals centers to reject an appeal 
if they could not verify the identity of the person making 
the appeal.  The opposition had objected to an earlier 
instruction granting poll workers this authority due to 
concerns that it could be abused to refuse appeals 
arbitrarily.  (Note:  It has been a common practice within 
the CNE to leak draft rules that disadvantage the opposition. 
 In the past these have been opening negotiating positions 
that the opposition has had to walk back.) 
 
6. (U) The CNE is also scheduled to discuss a resolution 
spelling out the verification procedure for the appeals 
process.  Chavez opponents had complained that the CNE\'s 
rules could permit hundreds of appeals to be invalidated 
through alleged errors in the daily tally sheets (\"actas\"). 
Jorge Rodriguez denied the accusations, saying that any 
errors in the tally sheets would be resolved by consulting 
the registers (\"cuadernos\") where the appeals are recorded. 
(Note:  The CNE denied about 150,000 signatures during the 
first verification process for errors in the tally sheets.) 
 
7. (U) The 6000-plus registers for the appeals were ready as 
of May 12, Rodriguez announced.  The registers correspond to 
specific appeals center; each table in the centers will 
receive one register for those want to reaffirm their 
signature and one for those who want to withdraw their 
signatures.  The NGO Sumate raised a red flag noting that the 
registers must be audited before being sent to appeals 
centers to ensure they match the data the CNE provided to the 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD).  Rodriguez said May 12 that 
the CD, the pro-Chavez Comando Ayacucho, and the 
international observers would be allowed on May 13 to take a 
statistical sample of the registers to assure their accuracy. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The CNE\'s public ultimatum may be bluster or a 
negotiating tactic.  The CNE has complained before that the 
OAS/TCC tries to usurp its authority.  The GOV thus far has 
indicated its interest in holding the appeals process, which 
it expects to win.  Without the OAS/TCC, the opposition would 
pull out and the presidential referendum process would die. 
The GOV is also aware that the OAS and TCC would release 
their observation reports upon leaving the country, which 
reportedly will put the blame on the GOV for sinking the 
process.  It is in neither side\'s interest at this time to 
lose the international observers.

1. (U) BARUTA MUNICIPALITY MAYOR HENRIQUE CAPRILES RADONSKY 
(PRIMERO JUSTICIA) PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE A CARACAS COURT 
MAY 11 TO FACE CHARGES REGARDING HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A 
VIOLENT PROTEST OUTSIDE THE CUBAN EMBASSY ON APRIL 12, 2002 
(REF).  DURING THE HEARING, PROSECUTOR DANILO ANDERSON 
REQUESTED THAT CAPRILES BE REMANDED TO CUSTODY BECAUSE THE 
MAYOR WAS A FLIGHT RISK, WHEREUPON DISIP (POLITICAL POLICE) 
OFFICERS TOOK CAPRILES INTO CUSTODY.  ANDERSON NOW HAS UP TO 
45 DAYS TO PRESENT FORMAL CHARGES AGAINST THE MAYOR. 
CAPRILES WILL REMAIN IN DISIP CUSTODY DURING THAT TIME, 
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. 
 
2. (C) CAPRILES WENT INTO HIDING WHEN THE FIRST DETENTION

4. (C) GOV ACTIONS AGAINST CAPRILES SHOW EVERY SIGN OF BEING 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.  A POPULAR POLITICIAN AND A DETERMINED 
ANTI-CHAVISTA, CAPRILES IS A SIGNIFICANT TARGET FOR CHAVEZ 
SUPPORTERS AS THEY STRIVE TO MAKE INROADS IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE CAPITAL.  NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THERE IS 
LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE BARUTA MAYOR TRULY WORKED TO CALM THE 
SITUATION AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN APRIL 2002, THE GOV IS 
INTENT ON PRESSING THE CHARGES.  SINCE THE FIRST DETENTION 
ORDER WAS ISSUED, PRIMERO JUSTICIA HAS BEEN AIRING TV SPOTS 
SHOWING THE MAYOR INTERVENING TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS, AND THE 
CUBAN AMBASSADOR LATER THANKING CAPRILES FOR HIS EFFORTS.  IN 
THE MEANTIME, CAPRILES WILL REMAIN IN CUSTODY.  WHILE THE 
COURTS MAY EVENTUALLY FREE CAPRILES, AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS A POLITICAL PRISONER.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Colombian Foreign Minister Carolina Barco, after 
meeting with President Chavez May 14, told reporters that her 
government is cooperating fully with Venezuelan authorities 
in the investigation of alleged Colombian paramilitaries 
detained in the southern outskirts of Caracas May 9 (ref). 
Barco denied that Colombia was involved in their activities. 
Additionally, a military court upheld the detention of three

\"COLOMBIA IS NOT INVOLVED\" 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) After meeting with President Hugo Chavez May 14, 
Colombian Foreign Minister Carolina Barco told reporters that 
her government is cooperating fully with Venezuelan 
authorities in the ongoing investigation of alleged Colombian 
paramilitaries detained in the southern outskirts of Caracas 
May 9 (ref).  Responding to questions, Barco denied that 
Colombia was involved in the alleged activities.  The Foreign 
Minister emphasized that the two countries are holding \"frank 
and open\" discussions, and that Venezuelan authorities will 
provide Colombia with the names and identity numbers of 63 
detainees shortly.  Responding to a reporter, Barco 
acknowledged President Chavez\' concern with the possible 
involvement of the Colombian military in the alleged plot, 
but she defended the integrity of her country\'s armed forces. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
VENEZUELAN MILITARY IMPLICATED 
------------------------------ 
 
3. On May 13, military tribunal judge Ruben Garcia upheld the 
detention of three Venezuelan military officers allegedly 
linked to the Colombians on the charge of military rebellion. 
 Col. Pedro Pico (Air Force), Col. Jesus Castro (National 
Guard), and Capt. Francisco Nieto (National Guard) were 
ordered held for the duration of the investigation.  National 
Guard Capt. Douglas Perez was released without charges after 
having been found in his brother-in-law\'s house with 
bullet-proof vests, according to news reports. 
 
--------------------- 
MORE \"PARAMILITARIES\" 
--------------------- 
 
4. (U) Claiming that he fled the ranch where his compatriots 
were detained May 9, a 25-year-old alleged Colombian was 
picked up by political police (DISIP) officers May 13 on a 
neighboring farm.  Sobbing, the young man told reporters that 
men came to his hometown of Cucuta, Colombia offering 
agricultural work in Venezuela.  \"But they cheated us,\" he 
said, \"because they also offered us Venezuelan identity 
documents if we voted for Chavez.\"  He claimed that the 
alleged recruits were brought by bus and \"trained with one 
rifle to rob homes and buses and to kill people,\" according 
to press reports.  The National Guard reported the May 13 
detention of another Colombian who had allegedly escaped from 
the ranch where the men had been brought.  That individual 
was turned over to the military prosecutor in charge of the 
case. 
 
5. (U) Speaking to reporters May 13, Defense Minister Gen. 
Jorge Luis Garcia Carneiro said 115 alleged paramilitaries 
have been detained and asserted that up to 500 are still at 
large.  Information Minister Jesse Chacon told the reporters 
that \"Plan Fumigation\" had two core elements: first, a group 
of \"paramilitaries\" were to attack an army base while wearing 
camouflage military uniforms to give the impression of an 
uprising taking place within the armed forces.  The media 
 
 
were meant to play a role, according to Chacon, by 
broadcasting the images of the \"uprising\" and thereby 
encouraging other military bases to rebel.  Second, a group 
of irregulars was to have been dispatched to Miraflores 
Palace to kill President Chavez.  According to Chacon, the 
joint operation was meant to have encouraged an international 
intervention to restore order. 
 
6. (U) Caracas daily TalCual reported May 14 that one of the 
detained \"paramilitaries\" was using the name and lost 
identity document of a church pastor still living in Cucuta, 
Colombia.  TalCual also discovered that a Venezuelan 
businessman alleged by DISIP to be an accomplice in the 
scheme was completely unknown in Maracaibo where he 
supposedly conducted business. 
 
---------------- 
OTHER CASUALTIES 
---------------- 
 
7. (U) The attorney for Dulce Bravo and Vasco Da Costa, both 
supposedly implicated in \"Plan Fumigation,\" claimed they had 
been severely mistreated during their detention in DISIP 
headquarters.  The attorney alleged that Bravo was sexually 
mistreated and Da Costa was subjected to electric shock 
torture before they were transferred to Fort Tiuna May 13. 
Military Attorney General Eladio Aponte ordered a medical 
examination of Da Costa, according to news reports.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) The GOV stepped up its efforts to blame the U.S. for 
the alleged paramilitary \"invasion\" of Venezuela with a 
massive march in Caracas May 16, during which Chavez 
announced the \"anti-imperialist\" phase of the Bolivarian 
Revolution (septel).

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Hugo Chavez addressed a pro-GOV mass march 
on May 16 against the alleged Colombian paramilitaries 
detained near Caracas May 9.  Outlining a new strategy for 
the \"integral, popular defense\" of the country, Chavez 
pledged to increase the size and budget of the armed forces, 
root out of \"traitorous\" military officers, and begin 
organizing civilians units under military command to defend 
the country.  Regarding the alleged paramilitaries, Chavez 
revealed that he had anticipated their presence and had 
placed 5,000 troops on the streets prior to May 9 for 
protection.  Chavez blamed the paramilitary plot on 
\"right-wingers in Washington\" and said it was he who ordered 
the MILGP out of its offices on Fuerte Tiuna.  Opposition 
parties denounced the citizen militias as \"legalized 
paramilitaries.\"  The proposal is a radical push, under 
constitutional cover while the opposition\'s attention is 
diverted, by which Chavez hopes to be able to better defend 
himself and his revolution.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
March Against Paramilitaries 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Perhaps more than a 100,000 Chavez supporters marched 
from eastern Caracas to the downtown area on May 16 to 
protest foreign interventionism and the alleged presence of 
Colombian paramilitaries in Venezuela (refs a and b). 
Marchers carried signs saying \"Paramilitaries and the CIA out 
of Venezuela,\" \"Bush is an assassin and coup-plotter,\" and 
\"Yankee Go Home, Bush Go To Hell.\"   GOV officials speaking 
to reporters chimed a recurring theme that the march was a 
demonstration that all Venezuelans, Chavistas or no, had 
turned out to reject the \"terrorism\" propagated by 
paramilitaries.  President Chavez addressed the march at the 
end point on Avenida Bolivar.  Private media showed images of 
the dozens of buses parked nearby, suggesting that the GOV 
employed its usual practice of bringing supporters from 
outside of Caracas. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
\"An Integral, Popular National Defense\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Chavez told the crowd that his \"Bolivarian Revolution\" 
had entered an anti-imperialist phase, announcing three new 
strategic objectives for ensuring the \"integral, popular 
defense\" of the nation.  The first of these objectives, 
Chavez said, is the strengthening of the military through an 
increase in size and operational capacity.  This will include 
greater intake into the military and, if necessary, the 
acquisition of weapons, Chavez said.  The President said he 
is still considering whether to create a special \"theater of 
operations\" in the center of the country to better coordinate 
the military.  To this end, Chavez said he had added that he 
had approved a 20 billion bolivar increase (about USD 10 
million) to the Army and National Guard. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Chavez Orders U.S. MILGP Off Base 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The second objective, he said, is to root out 
\"traitors\" in the military, an operation he called \"deepening 
the civil-military union.\"  Chavez said he had ordered 
Minister of Defense Gen. Jorge Garcia Carneiro to warn 
garrison commanders not to associate with traitors.  Chavez 
also noted the need to improve education of military 
personnel and be sure of the reliability of those military 
trainers.  Chavez digressed to say he had ordered the MILGP 
 
out of Fuerte Tiuna to make room for the government 
employment program \"Mision Vuelvan Caras.\"  Chavez said 
Fuerte Tiuna is a \"sovereign space\" and he could not permit 
any international presence, especially that of the U.S. 
\"empire.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
Citizens Organized for Defense 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) The third objective, Chavez said, is to incorporate 
the Venezuelan people into the defense of the nation.  \"Every 
citizen should consider himself a soldier,\" Chavez declared. 
Earlier attempts at building reserves have been insufficient, 
he said, and proposed organizing citizen groups that would 
receive informal military training. The groups should be 
formed in every \"poor neighborhood, canyon, island, 
countryside, university, factory, jungle, in every place 
where there is a group of patriots.\"  Chavez called on his 
military cohort, including active duty, retired and cashiered 
officers such as Minister of Information Jesse Chacon and 
Tachira Governor Ronaldo Blanco La Cruz, to lead Venezuelans 
in the formation of these groups to defend the country. 
 
---------------------------------- 
More Paramilitaries, GOV Was Ready 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) President Chavez reported the GOV had 120 alleged 
Colombian paramilitaries in custody (up from 89 a few days 
earlier).  Chavez said that nine of those in custody are 
minors and pledged either to return them to their families in 
Colombia or, if they desired, to place them in a Bolivarian 
school in Venezuela.  The President also said that his 
security forces were expecting some type of subversive 
activity before May 9 when the first group of alleged 
paramilitaries was detained.  Chavez said he had ordered 
5,000 troops to patrol Venezuela in anticipation. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Opposition Reacts to \"Militias\" Proposal 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Opposition parties on May 17 roundly rejected Chavez\'s 
call to give military training to citizen groups.  Leopoldo 
Puchi, Secretary General of the Movement to Socialism (MAS), 
charged that the GOV is introducing \"legalized 
paramilitaries\" to Venezuela to serve the political interests 
of the Chavez administration.  Representatives of COPEI 
accused the government of creating an \"artificial\" civil war 
in order to avoid the presidential recall referendum. 
Solidaridad Deputy Ernesto Alvarenga said Chavez\'s call for 
armed citizenry gives tacit approval to existing Venezuelan 
armed groups such as the Tupamaros, Carapaicas, Bolivarian 
Circles, and the Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Although the GOV is using the \"paramilitaries\" 
incident to distract from the presidential referendum and 
discredit the opposition, the incident is also giving Chavez 
cover as he takes one further radical step.  In his proposal 
to make civilians into defenders of the country, carefully 
basing it on an article in the Constitution, Chavez has made 
\"country\" and his \"revolution\" interchangeable.  He never 
used the phrase \"peoples militias,\" but it sounded ominously 
like militias.  Whether the idea ever really flourishes can 
be questioned.  Chavez\'s grandiose push for a substantial 
reserve corps has not yet met its mark, as he himself 
admitted when he told his audience that so far they had 
incorporated half of the 100,000 men and women they hope 
would comprise the reserves.  By giving the military a 
leading role, however, Chavez has craftily avoided giving the 
impression that he is creating a competing armed force, a 
step that would likely rankle institutionalists in the 
officer corps.  The promise of additional resources to the 
military also serves to mitigate jealousies that could erode 
 
loyalties or prod challengers.  At a minimum, the plan will 
legitimize Chavez supporters who already have links to armed 
irregular groups.  No doubt it will also serve as one more 
income distribution tool for the government to dole out 
stipends to the needy defenders of the Bolivarian revolution.

Classified By: Abelardo A. Arias, Political Counselor, 
for Reasons 1.4 (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The May 27-31 signature appeals process (\"reparos\") is 
a critical juncture in the opposition\'s attempt to remove 
President Hugo Chavez via a recall referendum.  The National 
Electoral Council\'s rigid appeals system will likely result 
in a slim margin of victory or defeat, which could increase 
the uncertainty in the political environment.  Scenarios for 
how the appeals process will play out depend on whether the 
opposition wins or loses, by a little or a lot.  Factors 
affecting the possible scenarios include the numerical 
capacity of the appeals system, violence, transparency, 
social protests, and the military\'s reaction.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
What If The Opposition Wins? 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Scenario 1:  Opposition Wins Big.  The opposition 
needs a net gain of about 550,000 signatures during the May 
27-31 appeals process to activate the recall referendum 
against President Hugo Chavez.  The NGO Sumate believes the 
most optimistic scenario is to hit a maximum of 2.66 million 
signatures, well above the 2.46 million threshold needed to 
activate the referendum.  A cushion of 200,000 such as this 
would hand a moral victory to Chavez opponents and give them 
momentum for a possible referendum on August 8.  A 
comfortable margin of victory would also limit the 
possibility of the National Electoral Council\'s (CNE) denying 
the referendum based on technicalities. 
 
3. (C) Chavez would have difficulty digesting this type of 
loss as it would suggest that his assertions of \"megafraud\" 
-- that no more than two million people actually signed -- 
were incorrect.  He would likely appeal the decision to the 
Supreme Court\'s (TSJ) Constitutional Chamber, which presently 
is disposed to rule in his favor.  The TSJ deliberations 
would take days or weeks, especially if the opposition 
opposes the Constitutional Chamber\'s jurisdiction (over that 
of the Electoral Chamber).  Whether the public, the 
international community, and the Venezuelan military would 
respect a TSJ decision depends on the merits of the case.  If 
opinion is against him, presumably Chavez would be forced to 
submit to the referendum.  Alternatively, he could try to 
delay the referendum past August 19 -- after which time a 
successful recall would replace Chavez with the Vice 
President.  Though less likely because of the political 
costs, Chavez could thumb his nose at the referendum 
altogether and cause a major constitutional crisis. 
 
4. (C) Scenario 2:  Opposition Squeaks By.  Winning by a slim 
margin -- 50,000 or less -- would not guarantee the 
referendum takes place.  The lesson of the process thus far 
is that the CNE is willing to revisit rules and procedures in 
favor of the GOV.  Factors such as transparency and the 
influence of international observers will be critical to 
ensuring the integrity of the results.  Even if the CNE is 
compelled by slim margins, and by national and international 
opinion, to convoke the referendum, the GOV will snipe at the 
decision as an \"electoral coup d\'etat,\" pressing allegations 
the opposition only crossed the threshold through fraud. 
There is some speculation, perhaps far-fetched but possible 
nonetheless, that the majority of pro-Chavez CNE directors 
might resign in protest rather than certify the appeals 
results, causing the electoral equivalent of a mistrial.  In 
this scenario, Chavez would likely resort to the TSJ as 
outlined in Scenario 1. 
 
------------------------------ 
What If Chavez Opponents Lose? 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Scenario 3:  Opposition Bombs.  Falling significantly 
short of the 2.46 million would break the backbone of the 
opposition, namely, the Coordinadora Democratica (CD).  The 
majority of Venezuelans will blame utter failure primarily on 
the opposition, not the GOV, regardless of how much tricks, 
irregularities, or fraud influenced the outcome.  With the 
referendum clearly extinguished (the Constitution allows only 
one chance per term, per official), the opposition would 
fragment further as groups diverge into new strategies of 
resistance.  Political parties would switch attention to the 
September 26 state and local elections, though anti-Chavez 
candidates will have been stained by \"losing the referendum.\" 
 Some groups would become more radical and join those already 
advocating for an extra-constitutional exit for Chavez via (a 
hoped for but unlikely) military uprising. 
 
6. (C) A CD belly flop is the scenario on which Proyecto 
Venezuela founder Henrique Salas Romer is betting.  Salas 
would probably try to form a new opposition front geared at 
defeating Chavez in the 2006 elections.  Chavez supporters 
would rally for the September regional elections and possibly 
sweep them in the face of a crushed opposition.  National 
Assembly elections in 2005 would become the next 
battleground, where a Chavista landslide would consolidate 
Chavez\'s control over the state.  Chavez himself would press 
more stridently for development and implementation of 
revolutionary programs. 
 
7. (C) Scenario 4:  Opposition Misses By An Inch.  A slim 
margin of failure would look a lot like scenario three, but 
with greater rancor toward the GOV.  The CNE would declare 
the referendum process terminated, which would touch off 
social protests against Chavez.  The opposition would 
challenge the results in the Supreme Court, only to be 
frustrated by the blocking power of the Chavista magistrates 
there.  Opposition unity would slowly decline as Chavez 
opponents face the reality of the referendum\'s death. 
Opposition parties may still win some key states and 
municipalities in the regionals, but probably fewer than they 
currently hold.  The GOV would continue its program of 
intimidating opposition groups, though it may attempt a modus 
vivendi with some parties to develop a \"loyal opposition.\" 
Perhaps more so than in Scenario 3, Chavez would push his 
revolutionary programs.  Without a clear win, his political 
position would need to be buttressed further with hostile 
rhetoric. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Critical Factors Affecting Outcome 
---------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Appeals Process Infrastructure.  The CNE has designed 
a three-day process that will see long lines and only two CNE 
workers receiving the appeals at each of the 2,659 centers. 
Mathematically, this puts a cap of around 800,000 for the 
number of appeals that can be received, lower than the 1.19 
million potential appeals and not including those who may 
wish to be removed from the 1.9 million valid signatures. 
This scenario does not take into account possible harassment 
from Chavez supporters, bad weather, or CNE incompetence. 
The opposition hopes it can familiarize people with the 
process sufficiently beforehand to maximize the number of 
persons attended. 
 
9. (C) Violence and/or Social Protests.  An outbreak of 
violence -- or threats thereof -- during the appeals could 
discourage turnout.  A Chavez speech calling on his followers 
to stop the \"megafraud\" during last year\'s signature drive 
dissuaded people from signing, according to CD analysts. 
Social protests, peaceful or otherwise, may also play a role, 
especially as Venezuelans wait for the CNE to announce the 
results.  If the opposition announces a big win on June 1, 
after the appeals centers close but before the expected 
official announcement o/a June 4, Chavez supporters are sure 
to take to the streets.  Chavez opponents might act similarly 
if the process is compromised by GOV dirty tricks. 
 
10. (C) Fraud and Manipulation.  Fraudulent acts committed by 
either side could be a determining factor in a narrow victory 
 
or defeat.  The pro-GOV campaign committee Comando Ayacucho 
has already alleged that Chavez opponents plan to falsify 
identity cards for the appeals process.  The Coordinadora, 
too, claims that the GOV has been issuing identity documents 
to supporters in the name of persons whose signatures have 
been deemed valid and have not reason to attend the appeals 
process.  A major fraud accusation during the three days of 
appeals could cause the CNE to modify rules in a manner that 
affects the outcome of the process.  International observers 
will be key for damage control in this case.  Also, although 
CNE rules state that the appeals will simply be counted at 
the tables and totaled by the CNE, it cannot be ruled out 
that the CNE will manipulate the process by elaborating a new 
\"verification\" process that scrutinizes the individual 
appeals. 
 
11. (C) Reaction of the Military.  The army, acting under 
\"Plan Republica,\" will provide security and logistical 
support for the appeals centers and transportation of CNE 
materials.  The military will probably perform as it did 
during the signature drive, generally fulfilling its mission 
with few disruptions by local commanders.  Whether the 
military was soured by its heavy repression of citizen 
protests in February and March, and whether it is hesitant to 
repeat such oppression, is uncertain.  The military\'s 
response to blatant electoral tinkering by Chavez is anyone\'s 
guess. 
 
12.  (C) The Weather.  Opposition organizers believe a key 
factor affecting possible turnout will be rain, and the end 
of May is solidly in Venezuela\'s rainy season.  Counting on 
maintaining a maximum flow of people at the signature 
centers, losing even a few hours because of a rainstorm, will 
be significant.  Coordinadora advisor Jorge Casado, for 
example, told PolCouns that during the May 8 simulation they 
clearly saw the possible negative impact of the weather at 
several locations around the country. 
 
--------------------------- 
Comment:  The Known Unknown 
--------------------------- 
 
13. (C) The success of the opposition\'s collection of 
signatures in November surprised Chavez, his lieutenants 
having assured him that his opponents would fall short. 
Faced with overwhelming numbers of signatures against him, 
Chavez first cried \"mega-fraud\" and then had the CNE commit 
its own fraud by invalidating hundreds of thousands of 
legitimate signatures during the verification process.  We 
cannot predict what Chavez will do, but we do not expect him 
to be a passive observer of the appeals process.  He will act 
to defeat the process, by hook or crook, but maintaining a 
fig leaf of plausible deniability. 
 
14.  (C) Most polls show an overwhelming preference by 
Venezuelans on both sides to have a referendum to settle the 
country\'s political impasse.  With less than two weeks to go, 
Chavez opponents remain energized and confident that they 
will have the turnout needed to succeed.  The allegations of 
Colombian paramilitary invasion, however, have already become 
a major distraction and a GoV damper on opponents with 
concerns about a possibly harsher crackdown.  Additionally, 
the GOV smirks of unusual confidence -- from Chavez down to 
CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez -- give rise to suspicions that 
Chavez may indeed be planning something that will keep the 
opposition from crossing over the threshold.  We thus believe 
the appeals will result in the less decisive scenarios (2 or 
3).  Much will depend on the referee work of international 
observers, or at least their cataloguing the GOV\'s electoral 
transgressions.

SUBJECT:  HUGO CHAVEZ\' MAY 9 ALO PRESIDENTE SPEECH 
 
1.  The following is a summary of Venezuelan president 
Hugo Chavez\' May 9 Alo Presidente program.  Chavez\' 
marathon speeches, of three to five hours, increasingly 
contain accusations of U.S. interference in domestic 
affairs and conspiracy to overthrow his government.  This 
191st Alo Presidente was delivered at the Barinas 
Maternity Hospital in Barinas, Barinas state.  Topics 
included U.S./Venezuelan relations, in particular, the 
Iraqi prisoner scandal and U.S. government policy on 
Cuba.  Other topics were the capture of paramilitaries on 
Roberto Alonso\'s hacienda; the \"enemies of the state,\" 
including broadcast and print media outlets Globovision, 
Venevision, RCTV, \"El Nacional,\" and \"El Universal;\" and 
the inauguration of the Barinas hospital. 
 
---------------------- 
Iraqi Prisoner Scandal 
---------------------- 
 
2.  \"Venezuela condemns the United States Government for 
the violations of human rights in Iraq,\" said Chavez.  He 
called the photos of American soldiers abusing the human 
rights of the Iraqi prisoners \"heinous\" and \"savage\" and 
asked the international community to judge President 
George W. Bush\'s \"anti-terrorist war.\" 
 
\"This is called terrorism and, even more, savagery,\" said 
President Chavez when he showed the photos of a pile of 
naked Iraqis before American soldiers in a prison in 
Baghdad. 
 
\"It is an aberrant thing, they are piled up naked, as if 
it were a sexual witches\' Sabbath, and a woman soldier 
was enjoying it.  That is a sick woman,\" said Chavez. 
 
\"They will be accountable for these war crimes and, also, 
for these heinous photos. Let the world be the judge! 
This is Mr. Bush\'s war.  These are not rumors, these are 
photos of smiling faces of the American soldiers,\" he 
said. 
 
The President stated that the photos have not only 
provoked outrage in the Arab world, but also \"in the 
entire world, because we, most human beings, are neither 
sick nor inhumane.\" 
 
Chavez also said that the abuses of the Iraqi prisoners 
represent a \"reason\" why the \"U.S. government did not 
want to sign the Rome Statute...through which war crimes 
and crimes against humanity are punished.\" 
 
The President also accused the Venezuelan media of not 
releasing the abuses of the Iraqi prisoners.  \"They don\'t 
want to mess with their masters because those media 
outlets are paid by them and they totally serve the 
empire.\" 
 
------------------- 
U.S., No; Cuba, Yes 
------------------- 
 
3.  Cuba:  On behalf of the Venezuelan government and 
people, Chavez rejected with \"firmness, courage and Latin 
American fraternity\" the hardening of the U.S. 
administration\'s strategy, led by George W. Bush, on 
Cuba. 
 
\"How does the U.S. government morally condemn Cuba for 
violating human rights?\" asks Chavez, reaffirming his 
\"support\" to the Havana government.  \"We regret that 
there are governments of this hemisphere that subject 
themselves to the strategy of the empire, as Fidel Castro 
said on May 1,\" said Chavez. 
 
\"What Fidel says is true.  There are governments that 
submit themselves to the strategies of the United States 
. . . sometimes because they are pressured, because they 
depend on an IMF loan or because they want to be 
praised,\" said Chavez.  \"They want to condemn Cuba for 
 
alleged violations of human rights, but nobody condemns 
the United States for its violations of human rights in 
Iraq,\" commented Chavez, again referring to the recent 
photos of Iraqi prisoners being tortured by American 
soldiers, which he termed \"a horrendous act.\" 
 
Chavez said that Cuba asked the very same United Nations 
Human Rights Commission that condemned the island as a 
result of pressure from the United States to investigate 
the violations the U.S. commits on its base located in 
Guantanamo, Cuban territory, for example, the 
disappearance of prisoners.  However, due to this UN 
organ\'s failure to act, the Caribbean country decided to 
withdraw the request. 
 
\"Washington\'s imperial government once again threatens 
the sovereignty of Cuba, through, for instance, the 
intervention of its communications, of the broadcast of 
Radio Marti, instigating the overthrow and murder of its 
president, Fidel Castro.  This is State terrorism.\" 
 
Chavez also said that the U.S. restriction on the number 
of resident Cubans in the country traveling to Cuba and 
on the resources they may send to their family members 
illustrates the new momentum in Bush\'s anti-Cuban 
strategy. 
 
4.  United States.  Conditions in the United States 
should not permit the United States government to 
criticize others:  8 million children without social 
security 
 
Chavez scoffed at the U.S. offer, that were a transition 
government be established in Cuba - something he thinks 
would be impossible - it would help vaccinate Cuban poor 
children.  He suggested Bush should start that 
vaccination drive with his country\'s poor children, since 
the public health on the Caribbean island has progressed 
significantly.  \"According to recent figures, at least 
eight million American children are out of the country\'s 
health system and social security,\" Chavez claimed. 
 
Chavez deplored the fact that some countries of the 
region submit to imperialistic plans like this one and 
that they don\'t raise their voices to condemn the 
atrocities the U.S. commits in Iraq.

SUBJECT:  HUGO CHAVEZ\' MAY 16 SPEECH 
 
1.  The following is a summary of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez\' May 9 speech during the Venezuelan 
government\'s (GOV) \"Rally for Peace and against 
Paramilitaries, and in Defense of Sovereignty and the 
Dignity of the Nation\" in Caracas, which substituted for 
Chavez\' usual Sunday Alo Presidente program.  The speech 
was broadcast in a national \"cadena,\" which all broadcast 
media were legally obliged to transmit.  Bilateral issues 
included the GOV\'s ultimatum that U.S. military personnel 
vacate their offices at Fuerte Tiuna and other Venezuelan 
bases; GOV accusations that Miami was the epicenter of 
the foiled conspiracy to deploy Colombian paramilitaries 
to Venezuela to assassinate President Chavez; the 
announcement of the \"Anti-Imperialist\" phase of the 
Bolivarian Revolution; allegations of USG violations of 
human rights in Afghanistan and Iraq; and the alleged USG 
role in the April 2003 coup attempt against Chavez. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GOV Gives U.S. Military the Pink Slip 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.   President Chavez confirmed his government\'s decision 
to order U.S. military personnel to vacate their offices 
on Venezuelan Armed Forces headquarters in Fuerte Tiuna 
in Caracas and in other bases in Venezuela.  \"I have 
ordered the U.S. military mission to leave Fuerte Tiuna, 
it was time to do so.  What is a U.S. military mission 
doing in the very heart of Fuerte Tiuna?  We have given 
them a deadline to leave . . . these are sovereign spaces 
where we cannot allow the presence of any international 
element, especially those of the North American Empire,\" 
said Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Colombian Paramilitaries - Miami Pulls the Strings 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.  Chavez alleged that the recent infiltration of 
Colombian paramilitaries \"in the heart of Caracas\" was 
part of an international imperialistic conspiracy with 
headquarters in Miami, Colombia (Bogota, Cucuta), and 
Caracas.  \"Those who brought this network of accomplices 
here -- which has an epicenter in Miami, another in 
Bogota, in Cucuta, and here in Caracas -- these terrorist 
paramilitaries and the traitorous Venezuelans, who 
planned the invasion of the paramilitaries and whom they 
contracted like mercenaries ... knew very well that these 
paramilitaries couldn\'t have overthrown the Venezuelan 
government, so their objective was the head of the 
President, to assassinate him, decapitate him,\" alleged 
Chavez.  The U.S. imperialists and Colombian-Venezuelan 
oligarchies\' \"simple, macabre plan\" would not succeed, 
however, and even if he were killed, Chavez would hear 
from his tomb the cry of the Venezuelan people against 
the \"boot of U.S. imperialism\" and in defense of 
Venezuela,\" averred Chavez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
The Revolution Advances to Anti-Imperialism Stage 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.  The Bolivarian Revolution has entered its \"anti- 
imperialist\" stage, proclaimed Chavez to the audience of 
tens of thousands of government followers.  He then 
proceeded to dictate the three lines of acton to defend 
the country from imperialism: 
-- trengthen the capacity of the National Armed Force 
(FAN).  Chavez said this action was not an armamnt race. 
Rather, the new revolutionary phase called for increasing 
Venezuela\'s military contingentto augment operational 
capacity and mobility thrughout the country, including 
establishing operaion theaters in some central states. 
\"The Hugo Cavez of 2002 (year of the coup d\'tat) is now 
part of history; we are ready to face any threat,\" Chavz 
emphasized. 
 
-- Reinforce the civic-militaryunion.  \"It is necessary 
to remain alert and to einforce the civic-military 
 
union.  It is up to every one of us; we have advanced a 
lot, but we still have a way to go,\" insisted Chavez. 
 
--  Form popular organizations to defend the homeland. 
\"The Defense of the Mother Land is everyone\'s task,\" 
urged Chavez.  \"In each city slum, island, farming area, 
university, factory, forest, in each place where there is 
a group of patriots (...) people taking the leading role, 
together with the Armed Force (...),\" Chavez proclaimed. 
\"It is necessary to join efforts to ensure the national 
defense, time has come to revolutionize security, to give 
it a new concept, to re-orient it, because we are still 
working with the paradigms of the IV Republic.  I call on 
all Venezuelans to join the defense of the homeland, of 
the national sovereignty ... In the coming weeks, with 
the advisory of the Council of Defense of the Nation 
(Codena) I will start issuing guidelines and 
instructions; I ask for the support of all the local 
powers, social movements, popular movements (...) Men and 
women of age that are not reservists, but who are in 
condition to become soldiers should get military training 
and organize themselves for the defense of the Mother 
land (...) Because nothing nor nobody will be able to 
beat Venezuela or a conscious and organized people,\" he 
added. 
 
5.  Chavez also called on the support of active and 
retired officials, such as Luis Reyes Reyes, Lara state 
Governor; Eliecer Otaiza Castillo, president of the 
National Institute of Educational Cooperation; Diosdado 
Cabello, candidate to Miranda governorship; Jesse Chacon, 
Communications and Information Minister; Hernan Gruber 
Odreman, former Governor of the Caracas area Federal 
District; Ronald Blanco La Cruz, Tachira state Governor; 
Florencio Porras, Merida state governor; and Pedro 
Carreno, National Assembly legislator.  \"The evaluation 
of retired officers is underway so that they begin giving 
military training wherever there is a group of patriots, 
with the people taking the leading role, together with 
the Armed Forces, to defend the country,\" insisted 
Chavez. 
 
----------------------------------- 
U.S. Imperialism: Afghanistan, Iraq 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  U.S. imperialism included flagrant violations of 
human rights, as evidenced by USG policy following 
September 11, in particular its policy on Afghanistan and 
Iraq, Chavez observed.  \"We were one of the few 
governments that dared to speak out when U.S. imperialism 
began with the invasion of Afghanistan, the bombing of 
towns and cities.  I recall I showed a photo of a photo 
of dead children.  I protested in the name of the 
Venezuelan people and our government, and this angered 
the government in Washington; we were only asking for 
respect for the life of Afghani children. . . We were 
right, especially after September 11, which the U.S. used 
as an excuse.  U.S. imperialism took off its mask, took 
on the United Nations, disrespected the Security Council, 
to invade Afghanistan, then Iraq,\" claimed Chavez. 
 
----------------- 
April 11 -- Again 
----------------- 
 
7.  Following Chavez\' accusations of U.S. imperialism, he 
launched into his usual allegations that the April 2002 
coup attempt against him could only have occurred with 
USG complicity. . .  \"There is an important detail, 
September 11, April 11, 2002; the fascist coup occurred 
only seven months after September 11, and everyone knows 
that this coup could only occur thanks to U.S. support 
and the support from groups from other countries,\" 
asserted Chavez.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Opponents of President Hugo Chavez and the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) continue to prepare for the signature 
appeals process (\"reparos\") scheduled for May 27-31. 
Relations between the international observers (OAS and the 
Carter Center) and the CNE improved slightly, but 
sensitivities remain as Chavez supporters have sunk to 
personal attacks against the observers.  The CNE is 
reportedly close to finalizing the procedure for totalling 
the signature appeals, which will reportedly include 
verification of identity documents to detect possible fraud 
at the appeals centers.  The signature appeals period for 15 
opposition and two pro-GOV deputies will take place May 
20-24.  For the presidential signature appeals May 27-31, the 
opposition remains optimistic they will mobilize enough 
people to compensate for the effects of fraud or people 
recanting their signatures.  Chavez and his supporters repeat 
constantly that the appeals process will not succeed in 
activating the recall referendum.  The international 
observers found no errors in their sample of the presidential 
appeals registers (\"cuadernos\") and the opposition is nearing 
completion of its audit.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Deputies Reparos May 20-24 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The National Electoral Council (CNE) has been 
preparing for the signature appeals process (\"reparos\") 
against opposition and pro-GOV deputies May 20-24 (the actual 
collection days are May 21-23).  During the signature drives 
in November 2003, Chavez supporters collected signatures 
against 32 opposition deputies; the opposition collected 
against 32 pro-GOV deputies.  The CNE determined that 
sufficient signatures were collected against 15 of the 
opposition deputies and two of the pro-GOV deputies for the 
deputies\' signature appeals.  The CNE will appeals centers in 
12 states, corresponding to the deputies\' electoral 
districts.  The OAS plans to have 13 observers and The Carter 
Center (TCC) 20 in-country for the event.  (Note:  One press 
analysis concluded that the National Assembly\'s balance of 
power would only be affected by the deputies\' referendum 
process if two opposition deputies who currently have no 
alternates were to be recalled.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
New Rules For Adding Up Signatures 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The CNE approved the rules for totalling the appeals 
on May 18, though has yet to publish the text.  The CNE board 
debated the rules for two weeks.  Among the points of 
contention, Coordinadora Democratica (CD) negotiator Alberto 
Quiroz said, was the CD desire to ensure the principle of 
\"sudden death,\" or that appeals will be totalled up at the 
end of each day and not be subject to further verification 
procedures.  He added that the CD also wanted the rules to 
avoid the possibility that the CNE could nullify appeals that 
are not properly tracked on daily tally sheets (\"actas\") as 
happened with the November signature drive.  Finally, Quiroz 
said the CD wanted to be sure the totalization rules track 
with the appeals regulations that give the CNE just four days 
to announce the results. 
 
----------------------------- 
DIEX To Police Identity Cards 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Press reports on May 19 indicate that the CNE had 
 
approved the use of Directorate of Identification and 
Immigration (DIEX) officials in charge of identity cards 
(\"fiscales de cedulizacion\") to canvass centers during the 
appeals period.  This had been a demand of the pro-Chavez 
Comando Ayacucho as a measure to prevent fraud.  Former 
fiscal Denis Cortez told Poloff May 19 there are no more than 
200 such officials, in his opinion an insufficient number to 
cover the appeals centers.  Cortez, who now heads the CD\'s 
anti-fraud committee, said that the fiscales are under the 
titular authority of the CNE, but have offices in DIEX and 
since 2003 have operated solely under DIEX authority.  Cortez 
asserted that the fiscales are biased toward GOV political 
interests and may, in fact, be facilitating alleged fraud in 
issuing false identity cards. 
 
------------------- 
Registers Look Good 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) The CNE completed printing the appeals registers 
(\"cuadernos\") and has permitted the opposition and OAS/TCC to 
do an audit sample.  Quiroz told reporters May 17 that the 
CNE failed to provide proper access to the registers within 
the time stipulated in the regulations, but that the audit 
would be completed by May 18 if work continued unimpeded. 
Movement to Socialism (MAS) President Felipe Mujica told 
poloff that the CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez had been acting 
as if he were doing the opposition a favor by allowing them 
to check the accuracy of the registers.  Mujica, too, said 
the CD audit was nearly completed and they had not yet 
discovered any glaring errors.  OAS observer mission chief 
Marcelo Alvarez__ told poloff the OAS/TCC sample showed the 
registers to be \"100 percent\" accurate. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Repentance: Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Whether people may withdraw their signatures because 
they claim their identity was stolen -- as the rules 
stipulate -- or whether they just have a change of heart -- 
which the Pro-Chavez Comando Ayacucho is promoting -- remains 
a subject of public debate.  Rodriguez said the parties 
agreed that the mere manifestation of the person at the 
appeals center is sufficient and such \"repenters\" do not need 
to state the reason for their withdrawal. 
 
---------------------------- 
Mujica:  People Power Is Key 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Mujica discounted efforts by the opposition to glean 
some advantage in the appeals process through rules or court 
cases.  The key, he said, is to mobilize more than enough 
people to go to appeals centers.  Mujica said public support 
for the appeals process is high and he expects an excellent 
turnout.  He said the GOV erred in thinking the appeals 
process would split the opposition.  Chavistas are 
\"hysterical,\" he said, to stop the appeals, noting with 
skepticism the GOV\'s recent claims that Colombian 
paramilitaries had invaded Venezuela (ref c).  Mujica\'s own 
wife was briefly kidnapped from their home by gunmen on May 
10, which Mujica called an attempt to intimidate.  Mujica did 
not rule out that the GOV may resort to extreme measures that 
interrupt the appeals, but he believed any such efforts would 
ultimately be self-defeating. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Chavez Sees Referendum \"Poco Probable\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Chavez said in an interview published by Reuters May 
18 he believed the opposition would not get enough signatures 
in the appeals process to activate the referendum against 
him.  He added that if the opposition does win, it will be 
more difficult for them because he will win the referendum. 
Chavez supporters are largely repeating this line in the 
press and in contacts with the Embassy. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Sumate Directors Ordered To Court 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) With one week remaining before the appeals process, 
Sumate directors Alejandro Plas and Maria Corina Machado have 
been summoned by a public prosecutor under suspicion of 
\"treason and conspiracy\" in relation to the NGO\'s receipt of 
grants from the National Endowment for Democracy.  Chavez 
leveled the charges of treason in February, after which 
prosecutors opened a case against the NGO that provides 
electoral technical support for the opposition.  Plas and 
Machado announced in a press conference on May 18 that 
despite already giving statements, they had been recalled -- 
Plas for May 21 and Machado for May 26 -- as suspects.  The 
summons could result in their detention.  Plas and Machado 
denounced the summons as an attempt to dissuade Sumate 
volunteers from supporting the appeals process. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
OAS/TCC and CNE Make Up, Until the Next Fight 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) After days of private discussion, the OAS/TCC and the 
CNE issued on May 17 a joint statement declaring they had 
\"smoothed things over\" and that the observers would stay on. 
CNE Director Rodriguez warned on May 18, however, that the 
observers are invited because of their impartiality; the 
moment they lose it, Rodriguez said, the CNE will reissue its 
ultimatum.  The dispute arose when the OAS/TCC issued a joint 
statement May 12 disputing the legality of the CNE decision 
to permit people to withdraw their names from the signature 
petitions to revoke President Chavez because they changed 
their minds.  Objecting to the statement, CNE President 
Francisco Carrasquero issued an ultimatum that the observers 
retract their statement or the CNE would \"reconsider\" the 
missions\' participation (ref a). 
 
11. (C) Alvarez__ told poloff May 18 that fundamental 
disagreements remain, but that the CNE could not afford to 
lose the participation of the OAS/TCC.  Alvarez__ said he had 
\"torturous\" meetings with Rodriguez over how to resolve the 
dispute. (Rodriguez told reporters things were \"on the slow 
road\" to resolution.)  Alvarez__ predicted the dispute would 
re-ignite the next time the observers disagree publicly with 
the CNE.  Alvarez__ was irritated with Ismael Garcia, a 
National Deputy and chair of the Comando Ayacucho, had 
accused him personally May 14 of taking a vacation paid for 
by Venezuelan media magnate Gustavo Cisneros (Venevision). 
Alvarez__ said that OAS Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo would 
arrive on May 19 for meetings with the GOV, during which 
Alvarez_ hopes the OAS will reject the personal attacks. 
Patria Para Todos (PPT) Secretary General Jose Albornoz 
demanded publicly May 17 that the OAS/TCC \"urgently\" replace 
their mission chiefs, who, he said, had become politicized. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) The CNE will likely continue to scrutinize the 
international observers closely.  The Comando Ayacucho\'s 
personal attacks on the international observers is the 
classic Chavista maneuver of attacking individuals to 
pressure their institutions.  Chavez supporters realize that 
the international observers could make the difference between 
victory and defeat and they are trying to discredit them. 
Despite this, the signature appeals are more or less on 
track.  Mujica\'s confidence may be misplaced, however, as 
there are still many opportunities for the GOV to interfere 
with the process.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) More than 400 persons detained during the February 
27-March 5 political disturbances have been released, but 
many still face pending charges.  Since December 2002, the 
detention, or threatened detention, of individuals aligned 
with the opposition has increased.  Some of the persons 
detained in connection with the events of April 11, 2002 are 
either still jailed, facing pending charges, or expecting to 
be charged shortly.  Opposition leaders accuse the GOV of 
using detentions to distract and intimidate them as they seek 
to focus on a peaceful, electoral solution to Venezuela\'s 
political impasse.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Prisoners Freed, But Many Cases Still Open 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) The opposition umbrella group Coordinadora Democratica 
(CD) claimed more than 400 Venezuelans were jailed for 
political reasons during the height of the February 27-March 
5 protests, a number confirmed by various international human 
rights organizations.  At least three judges were dismissed 
after they ordered the release of detained protesters for 
lack of evidence to support the charges against them.  The 
head of the CD,s Judicial Committee, D,lsa Solorzano, told 
poloff April 26 that two detainees remain in Caracas.  The 
directors of PROVEA and COFAVIC (human rights NGOs), however, 
told poloffs subsequently that all detainees have been 
released, although most remain under investigation for such 
charges as public damage, resisting arrest, and conspiracy to 
create \"catastrophes.\" 
 
----------------- 
GOV,s Most Wanted 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) In addition to the more than 400 detentions between 
February 29 and March 16, the GOV detained or attempted to 
detain several prominent opposition leaders: Baruta Mayor 
Henrique Capriles on charges stemming back to President Hugo 
Chavez, brief ouster in 2002 (septel), Libertador mayoral 
candidate Carlos Melo on illegal weapons charges, and David 
Rubio, Tachira State,s main CD organizer, for participating 
in a protest.  The GOV also announced in mid-March that it 
was preparing charges against Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez for 
his alleged use of public resources to support dissident 
military officers in late 2002-early 2003. 
 
----------------------- 
Lopez in the Crosshairs 
----------------------- 
 
4. (U) Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez of the opposition party 
Primero Justicia is under investigation for rebellion, 
instigating unrest, and conspiracy in connection with his 
alleged support of dissident military officers.  Declaring 
themselves in \"civil disobedience\" to the Chavez Government, 
the military officers had established an oppositional 
presence in Plaza Francia of Chacao Municipality in October 
2002.  The GOV says in essence that Lopez, as mayor, should 
have been more forceful in evicting the demonstrators. 
Lopez, who has not been detained, denies the charges\' 
validity and claims they are meant to intimidate him. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Capriles: Charges Politically Timed 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) On May 11, a second detention order was issued for 
Baruta Municipality Mayor Henrique Capriles of Primero 
Justicia (septel).  He is now in DISIP custody and could 
remain there up to 45 days, according to press reports.  On 
April 1, the Supreme Court struck down the first detention 
order for the mayor, who had been in hiding since that order 
 
 
was issued March 16.  Capriles had earlier sent his attorneys 
to three summons by the prosecutor; chavistas allege that 
Capriles\' failure to answer the summons personally explains 
why he is in jail, and Chacao Mayor Lopez is not.  Capriles 
told the Ambassador April 22 that Chavez\' control of the 
Attorney General\'s office allows him to control the timing of 
investigations and arrests, a significant weapon. 
 
------------- 
Melo Ambushed 
------------- 
 
6. (C) Shelby Cabezas, aide to Libertador mayoral candidate 
Carlos Melo, alleges that the GOV was forced to dismiss the 
case against his boss April 5 after it was exposed as \"a 
complete set-up.\"  He said Melo was \"ambushed\" March 1 by 
Venezuelan Political Police (DISIP) at a gas station around 
11 p.m., accused of transporting arms, and jailed the same 
night.  The following day Cabezas retrieved the gas station\'s 
surveillance tape that contradicted the prosecution\'s 
assertions that Melo had arms in his car, resisted arrest, 
and was arrested in a different location.  Cabezas asserted 
that the GOV\'s handling of Melo\'s case was a tactical error 
that had bolstered Melo in the polls from 4 percent to 45 
percent. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Rubio: Attempt to &Decapitate8 Tachira Opposition Backfires 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
7. (C) Although Tachira State CD leader David Rubio was 
released from jail April 2, he told poloff April 17 that the 
ruling didn\'t dismiss the charges against him of rebellion, 
creating a public disturbance, and engaging in a crime. 
Primero Justicia (PJ) Party Finance Coordinator Sergio Mendez 
told poloff April 16 that although the intent in jailing 
Rubio was to &decapitate the Tachira Coordinadora8 to 
ensure the opposition stayed divided in regional elections, 
it failed. 
 
---------------------------------- 
General Martinez and the Tachira 9 
---------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Dissident National Guard Gen. Carlos Alfonzo Martinez 
remains in custody, more than 16 months since he was detained 
in December 2002.  A small group of opposition demonstrators 
marched to the OAS Caracas office May 6 calling for his 
release and the release of nine opposition leaders in Tachira 
State who were detained in June 2003 on charges stemming back 
to the events of April 11, 2002 (refs A and B).  The DISIP 
detained Gen. Martinez in December 2002 while he was 
participating in an anti-GOV demonstration and placed him 
under house arrest.  In February 2003, the Attorney General 
charged him with rebellion, desertion, and violating national 
security zones.  After eight months of house arrest, Martinez 
was transferred to a military detention facility in Los 
Teques, Miranda State.  Despite 2003 rulings from the Supreme 
Court and the Inter-American Human Rights Court that he 
should be released, Martinez remains in the detention 
facility. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The good news: February 27-March 5 protesters are not 
languishing in jail.  The bad news: The GOV continues to use 
legal charges against its opponents, sapping energy from 
efforts to pursue the presidential recall referendum. 
Despite the GOV\'s veneer of reasonable legality, however, it 
is not adhering to legal procedures, which makes it difficult 
to view the detentions of political opponents as anything 
other than politically motivated.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELA: CNE VERSUS OAS-CARTER CENTER OBSERVERS 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. CHARLES S. SHAPIRO FOR REASON 1.4 (D). 
 
1.  (C) CONTRARY TO HIS COMMENTS TO THE PRESS MAY 20, OAS 
CHIEF OF STAFF FERNANDO JARAMILLO TOLD ME AND OTHER 
AMBASSADORS FROM THE GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT HIS AND FRANCISCO 
DIEZ,S MEETING WITH CNE DIRECTORS MAY 20 HAD BEEN TENSE AND 
DIFFICULT.  CNE DIRECTOR JORGE RODRIGUEZ, HE SAID, ACCUSED 
THE OAS AND CARTER CENTER (TCC) OBSERVER MISSIONS OF BEING 
TOTALLY BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION.  JARAMILLO 
CHARACTERIZED RODRIGUEZ\'S LITANY OF COMPLAINTS AS A 
MEMORANDUM OF AFFRONTS. 
 
2.  (C) JARAMILLO SAID RODRIGUEZ INSISTED THAT THE OAS/TCC 
HAD ALREADY DECIDED TO REJECT THE RESULTS OF THE APPEALS 
PROCESS.  RODRIGUEZ QUESTIONED THE OBSERVER MISSIONS\' 
INTEGRITY, LOYALTY, MORALS AND ABILITY TO DO THEIR WORK.  THE 
CNE DIRECTORS, JARAMILLO SAID, HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE OAS/TCC 
SHOULD MAKE NO STATEMENTS, AND SHOULD THEY WISH TO MAKE ANY 
THEY WOULD NEED TO CLEAR THEM WITH THE CNE BEFOREHAND. 
JARAMILLO SAID HE REJECTED THE \"ULTIMATUM.\"  NONETHELESS, 
JARAMILLO SAID, THE CNE HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT IS POLITICALLY 
IMPORTANT FOR THE OAS AND THE CARTER CENTER TO STAY IN 
COUNTRY AND WAS NOT READY TO EJECT THEM. 
3.  (C) JARAMILLO EXPLAINED TO US THAT IF THERE IS INDEED 
\"BIAS\" IN THEIR WORK, IT IS THE PRODUCT OF FACTS AND THE 
DECISIONS MADE BY THE CNE.  HE QUESTIONED THE CNE\'S ABILITY 
    TO RUN THE APPEALS PROCESS SUCCESSFULLY, SAYING THE CRISIS IN 
THE CNE IS MUCH MORE DEEP THAN MANY IMAGINE.  HE TOLD US THAT 
THE OAS/TCC OBSERVERS DO NOT HAVE EXPLICIT AGREEMENT FROM THE 
CNE ON THE TCC/OAS PLAN FOR OBSERVING THE REPAROS PROCESS. 
RATHER THEY ARE TAKING THE CNE,S LACK OF RESPONSE TO THE 
OAS/TCC LETTER OF MAY 10 OUTLINING THEIR PLANS AS AN ABSENCE 
OF OBJECTION AND ARE PROCEEDING ON THAT BASIS.  JARAMILLO 
QUESTIONED IF THE OBSERVERS WOULD IN FACT BE GIVEN THE ACCESS 
THEY NEED WITHIN THE CNE HEADQUARTERS TO DO THEIR WORK 
PROPERLY. 
 
4.  (C) ILLUSTRATING THE FLAWS IN THE APPEALS PROCESS, 
JARAMILLO SAID THE CHECKING OF IDENTITY DOCUMENTS WOULD 
LIKELY PROVE TO BE A DISASTER.  THE FORMULA OF HAVING 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO SIDES AGREE ON THE VALIDITY OF 
INDIVIDUAL VOTERS, NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD WAS A RECIPE FOR 
PHYSICAL CONFLICT AT THE SIGNATURE CENTERS.  JARAMILLO WAS 
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPUTER FRAUD, 
SAYING THAT THE CERTIFICATIONS (ACTAS) WOULD SERVE AS COUNTER 
BALANCE.  HE CALLED THE POSSIBLE DETENTION OF THE LEADERSHIP 
OF THE NGO SUMATE DIRECT AND CLEAR INTIMIDATION. 
 
5.  (C) I ASKED JARAMILLO AND THE AMBASSADORS IF THE OAS AND 
OTHER FOREIGN MINISTERS HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM THE GOV 
SIMILAR TO THE MAY 18 LETTER FROM VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR 
BERNARDO ALVAREZ TO THE SECRETARY.  NONE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF 
WHETHER SUCH A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THEM.  JARAMILLO NOTED 
THAT THE CNE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SEEKING A BLANK CHECK FROM 
THE OAS/TCC IN THE MAY 20 MEETING, SIMILAR TO THAT IN THE 
ALVAREZ LETTER.  (IN AN EARLIER MEETING CARTER CENTER 
REPRESENTATIVE AMB. GORDON STREEB, HE TOLD ME THAT THE FORMER 
    PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER HAD RECEIVED A SIMILAR LETTER FROM 
ALVAREZ.) 
 
6.  THE GOV APPEARS TO BE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO DISQUALIFY 
THE CARTER CENTER AND OAS OBSERVER MISSIONS IF THEY USE THEIR 
INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT TO QUESTION OR CRITICIZE THE CNE, ITS 
DECISIONS, OR THE REPARO PROCESS.  THE LETTERS TO THE 
SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT CARTER HAVE THE SAME GOAL, OBTAINING 
 
SIPDIS 
ADVANCE APPROVAL NO MATTER HOW DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLD. THE GOV 
NEEDS THE PRESENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO GIVE 
CREDIBILITY TO A DEEPLY FLAWED PROCESS.  THE REPARO PROCESS 
CAN WORK ONLY IF BOTH SIDES PLAY BY THE RULES IN GOOD FAITH. 
THE OAS AND THE CARTER CENTER OBSERVERS QUESTION WHETHER THE 
GOV WILL DO SO.  SO DO I.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The signature appeals process for the recall of 14 
National Assembly deputies (13 from the opposition and one 
from the GOV coalition) takes place May 20-24, with appeals 
centers operating May 21-23.  The CNE decided May 19 to drop 
two opposition and one pro-GOV deputy from the appeals 
process (\"reparos\") when it was determined that there were 
not enough potential appeals to activate the recall 
referendum against them.  The National Electoral Council 
(CNE) set up on May 20 the 550 appeals centers in 11 states 
to operate for the following three days.  One AD deputy 
subject to recall reported low turnout in his district and 
complained that CNE officials had been slow and uncooperative 
in organizing the event.  Chavez supporters are confident 
they will collect enough signatures to force a recall vote 
against six to ten opposition deputies.  Some 35 
international observers have been deployed to the 
corresponding electoral districts.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Deputies Signature Appeals Begin 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) set up 550 
appeals centers in 11 states on May 20 to register signature 
appeals in the recall process against 14 National Assembly 
deputies.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters May 21 
that 100 percent of the centers had opened with minimal 
difficulties.  The centers are open May 21-23 for signers of 
the November 2003 petition to appeal either their inclusion 
or exclusion from those petitions.  During the signature 
drives in November 2003, Chavez supporters collected 
signatures against 32 opposition deputies; the opposition 
collected against 32 pro-GOV deputies (ref a). 
 
3. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez announced May 19 that 
three deputies -- one from President Hugo Chavez\'s Fifth 
Republic Movement (MVR) and two from the opposition -- were 
dropped from the process because even with 100 percent of the 
appealable signatures restored the threshold of 20 percent of 
registered voters in the electoral district would not be 
reached.  Rodriguez also indicated that, although the rules 
stipulate the CNE must announce the rules within four days 
(May 28), the CNE will likely hold off on the announcement 
until the results of the May 27-31 appeals for the recall 
process against President Hugo Chavez are known. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Revocable Deputy Complains of CNE Foot-dragging 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (C) Accion Democratica (AD) Deputy Alfonso Marquina, 
subject to recall in Sucre, told Poloff May 20 that military 
officials in charge of delivering the appeals materials (as 
part of Plan Republica) were several hours late in arriving. 
Marquina also complained that, in preparation for the 
appeals, had delayed the training course for appeals agents 
three times, causing his volunteers to miss several days of 
work.  Marquina said the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) had 
\"orphaned\" the deputies subject to recall to focus on the 
presidential appeals.  Marquina said the AD party in Sucre 
was giving him its full support to field CNE agents and 
witnesses for the 29 centers (43 tables) operating in his 
state.  Marquina reported on May 21 that several centers had 
opened late and that attendance was low.  He noted that at a 
center with more than 3,000 potential appeals, only 50 
appeals had been collected in the first three hours of 
operation. 
 
----------------------------- 
Comando Ayacucho Sees Success 
 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Jose Albornoz (Patria Para Todos), member of the 
pro-Chavez campaign committee Comando Ayacucho, told poloff 
May 21 they are sure they will activate the referendum 
against at least six opposition deputies.  Albornoz said that 
with excellent turnout the Chavistas may get enough appeals 
to force the recall against 10 deputies.  Albornoz said that 
if these 10 deputies are ultimately recalled, it would have 
no effect on the National Assembly, where the GOV already has 
a simple majority. 
 
-------------------------------- 
International Observers Deployed 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The OAS has 15 observers and the Carter Center (TCC) 
20 observers in 11 states to cover the appeals.  According to 
the rules, international observers will receive a copy of the 
daily tally sheets (\"actas\") at the close of each day.  The 
observers will not be doing a \"quick count\" for the deputies 
appeals. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez supporters initiated the deputies recall 
process as a counterweight to the presidential referendum. 
It has not generated much excitement among Chavistas, and 
hardly any among the opposition.  It is important 
procedurally, however, as the CNE will no doubt fold the 
appeals verification into that of the presidential appeals 
the following week.  The CD is watching closely, of course, 
as CNE practices during this appeals period will foreshadow 
that of the presidential appeals.

1. (C) The signature appeals process for the recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez will begin May 27, 
with 2,659 centers opening to the public May 28-30.  The 
pro-Chavez campaign committee Comando Ayacucho formally 
requested the National Electoral Council (CNE) remove OAS 
Chief Observer Fernando Jaramillo for alleged bias in favor 
of the opposition.  The CNE prohibited the set up of 
information centers near appeals sites May 25, but 
pro-opposition CNE Director Ezequiel Zamora clarified 
subsequently that the information centers may operate in 
\"closed areas\" or political party offices.  GOV harassment of 
opposition leaders and ordinary citizens who signed against 
Chavez continues.  The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) claims 
it has made contact with 75 percent of persons eligible to 
appeal.  End summary.

Chavez Supporters Call For Removal of OAS Observer 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (U) On May 26, the day before start of the presidential 
signature appeals process (which will open to the public May 
28-30), the pro-Chavez campaign committee Comando Ayacucho 
formally requested that the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
demand the removal of OAS chief observer Fernando Jaramillo 
for allegedly favoring the opposition.  Ayacucho Coordinator 
Ismael Garcia cited Jaramillo\'s comments to reporters during 
the May 21-23 appeals for deputies that \"fewer people had 
turned out than expected\" as evidence of bias.  Former 
Minister of Infrastructure Diosdado Cabello said Jaramillo 
had intervened in Venezuelan electoral issues so often that 
Jaramillo had lost all validity as an impartial observer. 
Cabello reiterated that the CNE is the only legitimate 
electoral authority and that quick counts carried out by 
international observers are not valid.  Garcia also said 
Venezuelan OAS Ambassador Jorge Valero would shortly present 
a formal complaint to OAS SYG Gaviria requesting Jaramillo\'s 
removal. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Information Centers Prohibited, Maybe 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) CNE Director Oscar Battaglini (pro-GOV) announced May 
25 that the CNE had prohibited information centers (sites 
operated by the Coordinadora and Comando Ayacucho near the 
appeals centers to give logistical support and allow citizens 
to check the status of their signatures).  On May 24, CNE 
Director Jorge Rodriguez had announced that such centers must 
be located at least 150 meters away from the appeals center. 
Battaglini said the CNE acted on intelligence supplied by the 
military that the centers could lead to disruptions in public 
order.  Twenty minutes after Battaglini\'s comments, CNE 
Director Ezequiel Zamora (pro-opposition) told reporters the 
board had not/not banned information centers if they are 
located within an enclosed area, such as a private house or 
political party campaign office.  The official CNE press 
release affirmed the ban and did not mention Zamora\'s 
interpretation.

4. (C) Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza announced that 
the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) would proceed with plans to 
establish the centers.  Opposition appeals preparations 
proceeded normally on May 26, including a simulation of the 
appeals process staged in Caracas\' Chacao municipality to 
 
familiarize volunteers with the mechanics of the process.  A 
CD representative told poloff May 25 that organization for 
this round of the referendum process is better than ever 
before.  He claimed the opposition had contacted 75 percent 
of the 1.19 million persons with right to appeal, with higher 
percentages in key areas such as Zulia state.  Opposition 
groups in Anzoategui State signed a unity pact May 25 to 
consolidate forces in support of the appeals, as did 
political groups in the Sucre municipality of Caracas on May 
26. 
 
------------------------ 
GOV Harassment Continues 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) GOV prosecutors continue to press legal actions 
against well-known Chavez opponents.  A judge granted Sumate 
directors Alejandro Plaz and Maria Corina Machado, charged 
with treason for accepting a grant from the National 
Endowment for Democracy, access to their case files.  They 
are now scheduled to appear June 2 for indictment and 
possible detention.  A judge sentenced journalist Ibeyise 
Pacheco to nine months in prison for defaming a military 
officer after she accused him of corruption in 2002. 
Pacheco, who remains free, told reporters she would appeal 
the decision.  Authorities also detained retired Gen. 
Francisco Uson May 22.  He faces charges of defaming the 
armed forces.  At the time of his detention, Uson was working 
with the Coordinadora on logistics for the appeals in Bolivar 
State. 
 
6. (C) Allegations persist of dismissal of public employees 
who signed against Chavez and threats against recipients of 
public welfare programs.  Causa R Deputy Andres Velazquez 
told poloff May 25 he had personal knowledge that the Comando 
Ayacucho, under its so-called \"Plan Sovereignty,\" is going 
door-to-door in Anzoategui and Bolivar states searching for 
petition signers who receive public aid.  Chavez supporters 
tell the signer to withdraw their names during the appeals 
process or they or their family members will lose their 
benefits.  Velazquez said his own son, a teacher, had been 
denied a government housing loan unless he withdraw his 
signature.  Antonio Suarez, an Executive Secretary of the 
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), told poloff May 26 
he had documented 52 firings and 63 transfers of public 
workers for having signed, along with 850 threats of 
dismissal if workers do not retract their signatures.  Suarez 
said he had presented these cases to the Human Rights 
Ombudsman, the CNE, and the International Labor Organization. 
 
------------------------------------ 
GOV Announces Intelligence Operation 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Vice Minister of Interior and Justice Carlos Betioll 
announced May 26 that the GOV will mount a special 
intelligence operation to prevent \"anarchic groups\" from 
disrupting public order during the appeals process.  He 
refused to give names, but said several individuals with a 
history of plotting were under suspicion.  Mayor of 
Metropolitan Caracas Alfredo Pena said May 26 2,600 
Metropolitan Police will patrol Caracas to maintain public 
order.  The GOV plans to mount an open street market 
(\"megamercado\") in downtown Caracas during the appeals 
process, according to press reports. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The GOV is laying the groundwork for this weekend by 
instilling a climate of fear and uncertainty.  So far, the 
Chavistas are employing the modus operandi of alleging 
violent conspiracies and attacking those who can criticize 
them, namely, the international observers.  The opposition is 
largely staying out of the fray with the GOV as they prepare 
for the appeals.

SUBJECT: TSJ LAW TAKES EFFECT 
 
 
Classified By: A/DCM ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The Organic Law of the Supreme Court of Justice came 
into effect May 20 after the National Assembly (NA) passed it 
on May 18.  The Internal Policy committee of the NA made 
several substantial changes in the law between its second 
reading and the final vote, which the opposition claims 
violates parliamentary procedures. These changes increase the 
power of the Constitutional Chamber of the court, granting it 
supervisory power over other chambers and give legislators 
greater influence over the judiciary. Constitutional expert 
Tulio Alvarez_ has challenged the validity of the law before 
the TSJ. 
 
-------------------------- 
Substantial Changes in Law 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Organic Law of the Supreme Court of Justice 
(LOTSJ) came into effect on May 20 after the National 
Assembly (NA) passed it on May 18. The final version of the 
law contained substantial changes made by the Internal Policy 
Commission (IPC) of the NA without discussion in the plenary. 
 Opposition deputies criticized the changes, noting that 
Assembly commissions do not have the authority to do so.  The 
IPC made the final changes under unusual circumstances. After 
the IPC\'s president, Nicolas Sosa (MAS) failed to gather a 
quorum to discuss the Commission\'s report required for the 
bill to go to its final reading, the commission\'s vice 
president, pro-Chavez deputy Iris Valera (MVR), called the 
pro-Chavez majority of deputies to order without opposition 
presence.  The pro-Chavez quorum then made the changes to the 
law. 
 
3.  (U) In addition to the irregularity of making changes 
between second and final readings, opposition deputies have 
protested that reducing the bill from 179 articles to 23 to 
overcome an opposition filibuster violates law-making 
principles. The pro-Chavez majority also changed National 
Assembly rules six times in the 16-month discussion of the 
bill when the opposition used existing rules to block the 
bill. 
 
------------- 
Super Chamber 
------------- 
 
4.  (U) NA Deputy Gerardo Blyde (Primero Justicia) found more 
than 34 changes to the law done by the committee. The version 
of the law passed on second reading attributed to the full 
court, the right to \"resolve the conflicts of whatever nature 
which may arise among the chambers\", and to \"review the 
sentences dictated by any of the chambers\". The version of 
the law presented by the IPC to the plenary for final 
approval gave these powers to the Constitutional Chamber. It 
also gave the chamber the right to take over jurisdiction of 
a case when fundamental constitutional principals are at 
stake. This was not in the law as passed on second reading at 
all. 
 
5.  (C) NA Deputy Leopoldo Martinez (Construyendo Pais) told 
PolCouns 19 May that the changes turn the Constitutional 
Chamber into a super chamber, a supreme court above the 
supreme court. In the version of the law passed on second 
reading, the full court, consisting of all the judges from 
all the chambers, had that role. Martinez called this 
increase in power especially dangerous given the 
Constitutional Chamber\'s demonstrated bias in favor of 
President Chavez. Another change eliminated the requirement 
that members of the NA and TSJ justices have no family 
connections. Numerous newspaper reports have pointed out that 
the Second Vice President of the NA, Noheli Pocaterra is 
married to TSJ justice Carlos Oberto Velez. 
 
----------------------- 
 
LOTSJ Challenged in TSJ 
----------------------- 
 
6. (U) Constitutional expert Tulio Alvarez_ challenged the 
constitutionality of the new law before the TSJ on 24 May. He 
specifically challenged articles 13 and 23 of the LOTSJ. 
Article 13 deals with the Nominations Committees for TSJ 
justices. Alvarez_ claims, as does Gerardo Blyde, that 
articles 264 and 270 of the 1999 constitution state that the 
nominations committee is dependent on the Judicial Power, not 
the Legislative Power. The new law gives the power to elect 
the nominations committees to the NA. 
 
7. (U) Article 23 of the law gives the Moral Power (Human 
Rights Ombudsman, Attorney General, Controller General) the 
authority to suspend justices indefinitely, pending the 
two-thirds vote in the NA that the 1999 constitution requires 
to remove a justice. Alvarez_ and Blyde call this article one 
of the most dangerous parts of the law. Alvarez_ argues that 
it clearly usurps the power of the NA, and subverts the power 
of the TSJ. (Note: Under these provisions, the suspension of 
a judge is tantamount to removal, according to Chavez 
opponents, because of the present control the executive 
enjoys over the legislative and moral branches of government.) 
 
----------- 
Last Stand? 
----------- 
 
8.  (U) Critics of the law, fear it will permanently 
compromise the judicial system. The liberal daily El Nacional 
editorialized on 20 May, \"The new Supreme Court law ... is 
nothing less than the end of the rule of law and of checks 
and balances ... the door has been opened to establish an 
outdated and militaristic dictatorship with a deep repressive 
and police-heavy orientation. There is no longer justice in 
Venezuela.\" Referring to the changes made by the IPC of the 
NA, Tal Cual editor Teodoro Petkoff wrote May 20, \"What the 
governing-party majority has done with the (law) during the 
session in which it was given final approval goes beyond the 
limits of the abuse of power, arrogance and the most absolute 
disrespect for public opinion. There is no longer any 
pretense of hiding behind a fig leaf.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The TSJ law puts the judiciary firmly under Chavez\' 
control. The changes made in the Assembly\'s commission 
demonstrate the pro-Chavez majority\'s willingness to bend 
parliamentary rules and use its simple majority to push the 
Chavez agenda through the NA. This Chavista success gives the 
opposition  cause to be concerned about future legislation 
such as the media, anti-terrorism and national police bills 
which are designed to advance Chavez\' revolution. The 
Constitutional Chamber coup, slipped in in a technical 
session, suggests the GOV may be willing to use blunter 
instruments to give Chavez what he wants.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The signature appeals process formally began on May 
27, with armed forces and National Electoral Council (CNE) 
workers mounting the 2,607 appeals centers throughout 
Venezuela (centers will be open to the public May 28-30). 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel on May 27 characterized an 
editorial by WHA A/S Roger Noriega as an \"open, flagrant, and 
deliberate provocation.\"  Rangel also renewed allegations 
that OAS chief observer Fernando Jaramillo is biased against 
the GOV and issued an ultimatum that either SYG Gaviria 
remove Jaramillo or the OAS observer mission could not 
continue.  Rangel and the armed forces reaffirmed the CNE\'s 
ban on information centers to be set up near appeals sites. 
The opposition called on the CNE and armed forces to act 
objectively during the appeals, and demanded the right to 
audit appeals materials when centers open to the public.  End 
summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Appeals Process Set-Up Begins 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The five-day period for the signature appeals in the 
recall referendum process against President Hugo Chavez 
formally began on May 27.  National Electoral Council (CNE) 
workers and the armed forces, under its Plan Republica to 
support electoral events, readied the 2,607 appeals centers 
for the three days (May 28-30) in which the centers will be 
open to the public.  The centers are scheduled to open at 6 
a.m. and remain open a total of 12 hours per day (or, on the 
last day, until lines are depleted).  More than 100 
international observers under the auspices of the OAS and 
Carter Center (TCC) deployed around the country. 
 
-------------------------------- 
GOV Blasts Noriega, OAS Observer 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) On May 26, CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez rejected the 
op-ed piece by WHA A/S Roger Noriega accusing the GOV of 
impeding the referendum process.  Rodriguez dismissed the 
comments as \"interference from an illegitimate government\" 
and countered with allegations of irregularities in the 
election of President Bush.  On May 27, Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel excoriated Noriega\'s piece as an \"open, 
flagrant, and deliberate attempt at provocation\" and as 
evidence of an imperious policy toward Venezuela and the rest 
of the world.  Rangel, too, questioned the legitimacy of the 
Bush administration and then accused the USG of hypocrisy in 
its human rights policy, showing for reporters the photos of 
abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.  Rangel said the GOV 
plans to complain officially to the Department of State as 
well as via its missions to the OAS and the UN. He also said 
the GOV will not recognize the U.S. as a member of the Group 
of Friends. 
 
4. (U) Rangel also reiterated charges of bias against OAS 
Chief of Staff Fernando Jaramillo.  Rangel linked Jaramilo\'s 
\"highly suspicious\" behavior and the Noriega op-ed piece. 
The Vice President said the GOV will not recognize any OAS 
report with Jaramillo\'s name.  Rangel claimed to have called 
SYG Cesar Gaviria on May 26 after reading the article and 
insisted that Gaviria disassociate himself from Noriega\'s 
comments and remove Jaramillo immediately.  Rangel said he 
issued the ultimatum that either Jaramillo leave or the OAS 
would not be welcome as international observers.  In press 
reports on May 27, SYG Gaviria expressed his continued 
support for Jaramillo. 
 
-------------- 
Plan Republica 
 
-------------- 
 
5. (U) General Julio Quintero, head of the Unified Military 
Command (CUFAN), told reporters May 26 the armed forces would 
not permit the installation of information centers as banned 
by the CNE May 26.  He said the armed forces would deploy 
45,000 soldiers to support the appeals centers and transport 
the appeals materials under \"Plan Republica.\"  Carter Center 
representative Francisco Diez, however, questioned during a 
press conference May 27 whether the CNE had actually 
prohibited the centers.  Vice President Rangel affirmed that 
information centers would not be permitted.  Coordinadora 
Democratica (CD) advisor Jorge Casado told PolCouns May 22 
that they planned to go ahead with the centers.  In their 
view, the restriction on keeping them indoors was to the 
Coordinadora\'s advantage because the authorities ostensibly 
would need warrants to enter private premises. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Opposition Seeks Assurances of Fair Play 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Opposition spokespersons outlined May 27 three demands 
of the GOV during the appeals.  First, the CD wants to be 
able to audit the appeals registers (\"cuadernos\") when the 
centers open to assure their accuracy as well as to assure 
the quality of the indelible ink used to mark the pinkie 
fingers of those who make appeals.  Second, the CD called 
upon the armed forces to perform their duty and not impede 
opposition efforts to collect the appeals.  Finally, the CD 
asked for the CNE to maintain clear rules of the game, 
especially during the verification stage after the appeals. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The centers of information will probably be the first 
major dispute when the appeals centers open.  The GOV no 
doubt sees the centers as the backbone of the opposition\'s 
organization for the appeals and wants to eliminate them. 
The CNE did not issue a resolution to decide the matter, but 
it is clear the intention is not to allow the information 
centers.  Rangel\'s railing against the OAS is a policy of 
bluster.  SYG Gaviria, fortunately, seems to be firm in not 
giving in to it.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The appeals centers opened May 28 in an atmosphere of 
calm.  Turnout appeared to be good (anecdotally, between 25 
and 30 percent by the afternoon), especially in urban areas, 
with reports that very few of the participants sought to 
withdraw their signatures.  There were reports across the 
country of confusion over validity of identity cards and of 
signatures missing from the appeals registers (cuadernos). 
National Electoral Council (CNE) directors and Vice President 
Jose Vicente Rangel described the process and completely 
normal and without irregularities.  Heads of international 
observer missions have expressed satisfaction with the 
process and met with GOV officials and the political actors. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Process Opens In Relative Calm 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Signature appeals centers for the presidential recall 
referendum opened more or less on time May 28 across 
Venezuela amidst relative calm.  National Electoral Council 
(CNE) Director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters in the morning 
that only 24 of the 2,607 centers failed to open.  Army 
troops, operating under Plan Republica in support of the CNE, 
have been observed in ample numbers at appeals centers. 
Emboffs observed organized groups of Chavez supporters near 
some appeals centers, though there has been one report of 
violence (see para 7). 
 
---------------- 
A Strong Turnout 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) Embassy observers noted strong turnout in urban 
appeals centers, less so in rural centers where the number of 
appeals are much less.  There appeared to be a steady stream 
of participants.  Some reports in the early afternoon said 
some centers had already processed up to 30 percent of the 
appeals.  Participants on this weekday have tended to be 
older.  The number of those withdrawing their signatures has 
been very low, according to Emboffs.  A Coordinadora 
Democratica (CD) representative told poloff as of late 
afternoon the turnout rate was 25 percent. 
 
----------------------------- 
Confusion Over Cedulas, Lists 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) There were widespread reports of confusion over the 
verification of national identity cards (cedulas).  An 
instruction from the CNE advised workers to ensure that cards 
issued in December 1999 or later bear the name \"Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela.\"  This led some CNE workers to deny 
persons whose cards are valid but were issued prior to that 
date.  CNE officials tried to correct this problem via press 
statements, but the problem has persisted.  Emboff noted 
several incidents firsthand in Carabobo state where Plan 
Republic soldiers performed the cedula check and denied entry 
of some individuals into appeals centers. 
 
5. (U) Emboffs heard complaints from several Venezuelans who 
believed they had a right to appeal after consulting the CNE 
and Sumate, only to find they were not included in the 
appeals register (cuaderno).  There were reports that CNE 
lists posted outside centers do not match the registers. 
Data in CNE computers on-site also showed inconsistencies 
with the registers, according to reports.  Emboff in Zulia 
state reported this problem was widespread, after consulting 
with international observers there. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CNE, GOV, Observers Praise Process 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) CNE President Francisco Carrasquero and Jorge 
Rodriguez briefed international press in the morning. 
Carrasquero said the process was being carried out according 
to the law and emphasized that the CNE, vice international 
organizations, is the authority when it comes to releasing 
results.  CNE Directors Ezequiel Zamora and Sobella Mejias 
(opposition), who had not been invited to the international 
press conference, briefed national reporters, describing the 
CNE board as \"distracted, but not fractured.\"  OAS SYG Cesar 
Gaviria met with Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel and told 
reporters afterward that the process was being carried out in 
a satisfactory manner.  Carter Center representative Jennifer 
McCoy met with the pro-GOV campaign committee Comando 
Ayacucho, reiterating her institution\'s commitment to 
impartial observation of the process. 
 
7.  (C) TalCual newspaper editor Teodoro Petkoff and 
Coordinadora Democratica leaders Pompeyo Marquez_ and Carlos 
Quiroz Corradi told the Ambassador May 28 they were 
conservatively optimistic that, despite the GOV\'s efforts to 
stop them, the opposition would gather enough \"repaired\' 
signatures to call for a presidential recall referendum. 
Luis Miquilena concurred, but he suggested that Chavez would 
then call for elections before going to a referendum.  Quiroz 
Corradi noted that the fact that there were four copies of 
the actas (one for CNE/Caracas, one each for Comando Ayacucho 
and the Coordinadora Democratica, and one for the foreign 
observers) made it more difficult for the GoV to alter them. 
Quiroz feared that violence could interrupt the process.  For 
example, pro-GoV sympathizers working for HIDROLAGO in San 
Francisco municipality (next to Maracaibo, Zulia state) 
roughed up 5-7 people who were repairing their signatures, in 
full view of the military tasked with guarding the site. 
When the chavistas returned, the military intervened and 
ordered them to leave. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The opposition seems to be having a good day.  The 
opposition should get a sense of their standing overnight as 
daily tally sheets (\"actas\") are totaled.  Harassment by the 
military and Chavistas has been sporadic so far.  The 
identity card flap and inconsistent lists is a matter of 
concern, but seem to be in small proportion to the overall 
numbers.  Strong turnout is still the key to overcoming these 
problems.

reports of violence at appeals centers, including two 
assaults against journalists.  National identity cards 
continued to be controversial, as unclear rules from the 
national Electoral Council (CNE) caused some people to be 
denied entrance to appeals centers.  The GOV launched 
allegations of fraud over  the discovery of allegedly 
falsified identity cards.  Former President Carter arrived 
and began visiting appeals centers.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
Slow Start... 
------------- 
 
2. (U) Appeals centers opened May 28 for a second day of 
signature appeals in the recall process against President 
Hugo Chavez.  Observers reported low turnout at the opening, 
but picking up by 10:00 a.m.  Most centers did not have lines 
but maintained a steady stream of participants.  Observers 
reported anecdotally that many centers had received more than 
half of the possible appeals. 
 
------------------ 
But Things Heat Up 
------------------ 
 
3. (U) By 1:00 p.m., reports of violence came from several 
states.  Groups of anti- and pro-Chavez supporters surrounded 
appeals centers, occasionally resulting in scrapes.  One 
observer in Zulia reported having seen 15 fights, one of 
which resulted in nine people being hospitalized.  One person 
was lightly wounded when a Plan Republica soldier fired his 
shotgun at the ground to disperse the group.  Two reporters, 
in Caracas and Carabobo, were assaulted by Chavez 
sympathizers.  There were multiple reports of attacks against 
opposition political party offices serving as information 
centers for the opposition.  GOV security forces also 
reportedly raided several information centers.  Private media 
showed images of a center in Caracas that had been closed 
amidst harassment by Chavez supporters, some on motorcycles 
bearing shotguns.  Despite these incidents, observers 
reported calm and normal operations at most appeals centers. 
 
4. (U) Plan Republica units, according to some reports, 
impeded entry to appeals centers over technicalities.  There 
were reports and images of Plan Republica forces standing by 
while government sympathizers harassed appeals centers. 
There were also reports of the military closing centers for 
long periods over procedural disputes. 
 
------------------------ 
Identity Cards A Dilemma 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Controversy over vague and contradictory rules 
regarding national identity cards slowed the process.  The 
ambiguity allowed workers to reject appeals based on the 
perceived authenticity of the cards.  The CNE reportedly sent 
an instruction to appeals centers on May 27 when the 
controversy erupted, but there was confusion over whether the 
instruction held precedent over the appeals norms approved by 
the CNE board.  Three directors put forth personal (and 
varying) interpretations of the rules, as did two 
pro-government politicians.  Contradictions were also present 
between the appeals registers (caudernos), computer database, 
and pre-printed lists of appeals posted outside the centers, 
which caused several people trying to make appeals to be 
turned away. 
 
6. (U) At 6:15 p.m., the pro-GOV Comando Ayacucho announced 
 
the opposition had engaged in systematic fraud nationwide, 
falsifying identity cards.  At 3:00 p.m. the secret police 
(DISIP) allegedly captured a man in Caracas with more than 
400 falsified identity cards.  The DISIP said also they had 
evidence of falsified cards in other parts of Caracas. 
Libertador Municipality Mayor Freddy Bernal claimed the 
person was also engaged in falsifying police credentials, 
alleging it was part of the \"Plan B\" by the opposition to 
rebel against Chavez.  The mayor of Puerto Cabello reported a 
man had been detained by security forces with 179 identity 
cards. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Jimmy Carter Arrives; Gaviria at CNE 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Former President Carter arrived at mid-day.  Carter 
visited four appeals centers later in the day.  He told 
reporters he was observing and would make press comments at a 
later time.  OAS SYG Gaviria met with CNE officials late in 
the day.  More than 100 international observers are present 
throughout Venezuela.  Other international observers invited 
by the CNE have also been seen meeting with GOV and 
opposition officials.  Among them are international 
journalists, human rights advocates, electoral officials, and 
members of the Socialist International.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelans turned out in lesser numbers on the last 
day of presidential signature (May 30) appeals.  Partial 
results indicate the opposition collected enough appeals to 
activate the referendum.  There were violent confrontations 
between Chavez sympathizers and opposition groups near 
appeals centers nationwide.  GOV security forces raided 
dozens of opposition information centers in search of fraud 
alleged by Chavez supporters.  The pro-Chavez campaign 
committee Comando Ayacucho accused the opposition of 
falsifying 10,000 identity cards in hundreds of centers 
across Venezuela, and called for an audit of all appeals 
registers (cuadernos).  National Electoral Council (CNE) 
President Francisco Carrasquero expressed concern at the 
alleged electoral fraud and encouraged appeals workers to 
scrutinize identity cards.  Former President Jimmy Carter, 
accompanied by OAS SYG Gaviria, told reporters that the 
reported irregularities were minor technicalities and should 
not delay official results.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Opposition Reaches Threshold 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Turnout was lower May 30 for the third and final day 
of signature appeals, with heavy rains in Caracas and in many 
states around Venezuela.  Observers noted that participation 
had picked up in some states, but it did not reach first-day 
levels.  Appeals centers operated normally, though observers 
noted that Plan Republica soldiers scrutinized closely 
persons trying to enter centers.  With two hours remaining 
before closure, results from one source said the opposition 
had reached 2.52 million valid signatures, at least 80,000 
signatures above the threshold needed to activate the recall 
referendum against President Hugo Chavez May 30.  Projections 
suggest the opposition will exceed the threshold by 110,000 
signatures. (Update: as of May 31, opposition was claiming it 
exceeded threshold by 130,000 signatures.) 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Violence, Threats Around Appeals Centers 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Press and observer reports noted the continued 
presence of Chavez supporters, and in many cases, opposition 
groups, around appeals centers.  There were reports of 
harassment of participants by Chavez groups.  Observers noted 
groups of Chavez supporters, some of them armed, arriving at 
sites in buses and government vehicles, where they would 
intimidate participants.  Disputes often resulted in Plan 
Republica soldiers closing centers temporarily. 
 
------------------------------ 
Chavistas Allege Massive Fraud 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) Members of the pro-Chavez campaign committee Comando 
Ayacucho alleged the opposition engaged in mass fraud, 
falsifying identity cards (cedulas).  The Comando Ayacucho 
demanded that the National Electoral Council (CNE) audit 
every appeals register to ensure the fraudulent cedulas had 
not been used.  GOV security forces raided dozens of the 
opposition\'s information centers throughout Venezuela, 
alleging they were factories for producing false cedulas. 
Comando Ayacucho members were present for several raids, 
showing the false cedulas allegedly recovered from the sites. 
 Libertador Mayor Freddy Bernal claimed to have found a 
\"national identity card cloning center,\" alleging the GOV had 
discovered at least 10,000 such cards.  Political party 
offices, doubling as information centers, were also targets. 
DISIP agents at one site claimed they did not need a search 
warrant because they were in hot pursuit of gunmen who had 
fired on them. 
 
5. (U) The Comando Ayacucho also claimed that more than 5,300 
people who had passed away since signing in November 2003 had 
mysteriously appealed their signatures.  Pro-Chavez Fifth 
Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy Willian Lara said the Comando 
Ayacucho would request the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
exclude these signatures automatically.  In some centers the 
\"deceased\" persons appeared and defended their signatures, 
according to press and observer reports.  The CD dismissed 
the fraud allegations as desperation by the GOV and demanded 
that the CNE not change the rules by auditing every register. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Carter and Gaviria Visit Chavez, CNE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) Former President Jimmy Carter and OAS SYG Cesar 
Gaviria met separately with President Chavez on May 30. 
Chavez told reporters after the Carter meeting he would 
comply with any decision by the CNE.  Carter and Gaviria met 
with the CNE board later in the day.  Carter told the press 
that the process was being carried out in peace and calm. 
News reports of intimidation and violence, he said, were 
minor problems that did not disrupt the appeals process. 
Carter said the technicalities raised by the Comando Ayacucho 
should not delay the delivery of results. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The GOV was aware of the opposition\'s progress and 
tried to discourage turnout through harassment and, failing 
that, discrediting the results by alleging fraud.  The 
opposition seems to be on track to have obtained a moderate 
cushion of signatures to activate the recall referendum.  We 
are still several days away from the deadline for the CNE to 
announce the results (June 4).  Both sides are celebrating 
triumph for now, but just as the government has been 
intimidating and harassing the opposition prior to this 
weekend, it will continue to do so, keeping tensions elevated 
in the coming days.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) claimed on June 1 
they had collected 131,000 more signature appeal than needed 
to activate the referendum against President Hugo Chavez. 
National Electoral Council (CNE) Vice President Ezequiel 
Zamora (pro-opposition) denounced on May 31 that the CNE had 
inexplicably stopped tallying results, and only resumed work 
when the delay was discovered.  Former President Jimmy Carter 
and OAS SYG Cesar Gaviria made a surprise visit to the CNE on 
May 31, because they had noticed a lag in information about 
results, drawing threats from CNE President Francisco 
Carrasquero and CNE Director Oscar Battaglini (pro-GOV) they 
would toss out both international observer missions.  Carter 
and Gaviria subsequently met with Chavez, who reassured them 
he would abide by the decision of the CNE.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
CD Briefs Diplomatic Corps 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) briefed the 
diplomatic corps June 1 on the results of the May 28-30 
signature appeals (reparos) for the presidential recall 
referendum.  DCM and poloff attended.  Sumate representative 
Roberto Abdul reported that 750,931 persons confirmed their 
signatures, with 94,745 persons withdrawing their signatures, 
for a net gain of 656,186.  When added to the 1.91 million 
signatures already certified by the National Electoral 
Council (CNE), the number of valid signatures rises to 
2,567,150, or 131,067 in excess of number needed to activate 
the recall vote against President Hugo Chavez.  Abdul said 
they had taken 345 complaints from citizens about aggression 
at the appeals centers, mistreatment by the military, and 
confusing CNE procedures. 
 
---------------------------- 
Zamora Accuses CNE of Delays 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (U) On the evening of May 31, CNE Vice President Ezequiel 
Zamora (pro-opposition) told reporters the CNE had lost a day 
of work adding up the daily tally sheets (actas) due to 
manipulation in the informatics department.  Zamora also 
complained that he had been denied access to information 
about the appeals.  Zamora denied rumors that the CNE had 
developed new instructions to the committee processing the 
actas, and threatened to \"rebel\" if the CNE generated new 
rules now, after the fact. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Carter and Gaviria Make Surprise Visit 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Former President Jimmy Carter and OAS SYG Cesar 
Gaviria arrived at the CNE minutes after Zamora\'s statement 
and were received by Zamora and fellow opposition Director 
Sobella Mejias.  Carter and Gaviria found idle the offices 
where the actas were supposed to be being tallied.  They told 
reporters they had come to the CNE because they were 
concerned about the lag in information they were receiving 
from the CNE.  Carter subsequently met with President Chavez. 
 Carter told reporters June 1 that Chavez reiterated his 
promise to abide by the CNE\'s decision.  CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez (pro-GOV) appeared before reporters after Carter 
and Gaviria left the CNE and criticized the observers for not 
having given prior notice of their visit.  Rodriguez claimed 
the totalization process was proceeding normally, noting that 
some actas were slow to arrive at CNE site.  Gaviria the 
Ambassador on June 1 that CNE President Francisco Carrasquero 
and Director Oscar Battaglini threatened to expel President 
 
Carter and Gaviria.  Carter and Gaviria did not blink. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CD Positive, But Laments Delays, Persecution 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) CD negotiator Alberto Quiros told the diplomatic corps 
June 1 Zamora\'s accusations the day before were justified. 
The process is being carried out in a normal manner, he said, 
with some inconveniences.  Specifically, Quiros cited the 
late delivery of actas from the states.  He said that CNE had 
informed him that morning that all but three states had been 
received and the remainder would arrive at the CNE on June 1. 
 Quiros said he is confident the CNE is now working and can 
announce final results by June 4.  Fellow CD negotiator 
Felipe Mujica, Secretary General of the Movement to Socialism 
(MAS), asserted that there is no reason for the delays other 
than that the CNE is waiting for the political decision from 
Chavez as to how to proceed. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Chavistas Back CNE Authority, Cry Fraud 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Comando Ayacucho Coordinator Ismael Garcia told 
reporters June 1 that the OAS and Carter Center (TCC) must 
maintain their objectivity and not emit opinions that are the 
competency of the CNE.  Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy 
William Tarek Saab accused the OAS/TCC of speaking on behalf 
of opposition parties AD and COPEI and questioned the OAS\' 
inclusion of a State Department official in its observer 
mission.  MVR Director Elias Jaua told reporters June 1 the 
appeals were a civic demonstration by Venezuelans despite 
being \"stained\" by criminals linked to the 
\"counter-revolution\" who falsified identity cards to forge 
signatures.  Jaua said the MVR would request the CNE permit 
them a physical inspection of the appeals registers as part 
of their complaint of alleged electoral crimes. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The GOV is well aware there are enough signatures to 
force the referendum.  Chavista lieutenants continue to level 
accusations against the opposition of massive fraud, setting 
the stage for Chavez to reject the results of the appeals 
should he so choose.  He may also decide to squeeze the CNE 
and eke out a favorable decision, as he did during the 
signature drive.

SUBJECT: MYSTERIOUS GASOLINE SHORTAGE AFFECTS EASTERN 
CARACAS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro; for reasons 1.4(b) and (d 
) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) A gasoline shortage affected the eastern, primarily 
opposition, portion of the city of Caracas over the weekend 
of May 29-30.  The shortage mysteriously coincided closely 
with the days of the appeal process for the presidential 
referendum.  While Minister of Energy and Mines Rafael 
Ramirez attributed the shortages to \"technical failures in 
the billing process,\" representatives of U.S. companies that 
operate brand name service stations in Venezuela tell us that 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) claimed not to have received 
their product orders.  We suspect the GOV sought to make the 
opposition signature appeal more difficult by cutting off the 
gasoline.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
OUT OF GAS 
---------- 
 
2. (U) On Saturday, May 29, the residents of eastern Caracas 
(generally opposition) once again woke to find themselves 
facing gasoline shortages.  Some service stations began 
running out of unleaded gasoline on Saturday and were 
completely out of products as of Sunday night May 30 or 
Monday morning May 31.  These dates coincided with the May 
28-30 dates of the presidential referendum signature appeal 
process.  Addressing the press on May 31, Minister of Energy 
and Mines Rafael Ramirez attributed the shortages to a 
technical failure in the billing system at the Guatire plant 
that administers gasoline to Caracas.  According to Ramirez, 
the dispatch of gasoline had stopped because of this 
technical failure. 
 
------------------ 
OUT OF CREDIBILITY 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) Econoff contacted ChevronTexaco and ExxonMobil, both 
of which have downstream operations in Venezuela, to discuss 
the situation on June 1.  ChevronTexaco Downstream Manager 
Mauricio Pulido informed econoff that the ten Texaco brand 
service stations in the eastern part of the city of Caracas 
had all run out of fuel between Sunday night and Monday 
morning.  ExxonMobil Government Relations Manager Carlos 
Rodriguez also confirmed that Mobil brand stations in east 
Caracas, including the Mobil station across the street from 
ExxonMobil\'s corporate offices, had run out of product on 
Sunday, May 30.  Pulido reported that the Texaco stations had 
all received fuel as of Monday night and service had returned 
to normal which was again echoed by ExxonMobil\'s report. 
Pulido added, however, that deliveries to Texaco stations in 
west Caracas continued as normal through the weekend. 
 
4. (C) In direct contradiction to Minister Ramirez\'s press 
comments, Pulido said that when ChevronTexaco contacted 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) about the suspension of 
services during the weekend, PDVSA claimed it had not 
received ChevronTexaco\'s product orders.  When ChevronTexaco 
responded that it had proof of confirmation that PDVSA had 
received the orders, PDVSA said the products would be 
dispatched -- which did not happen until Monday night. 
ExxonMobil\'s Rodriguez added that despite repeated calls to 
PDVSA on Monday, no one had answered the phone. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) Venezuela\'s gasoline dispatch system has been more 
fragile since the end of the December 2002-February 2003 
strike.  Caracas, in particular, has been affected because 
the number of gasoline trucks serving the city has been cut 
in half since the strike.  Despite this we do not believe 
there is any way to attribute the suspension of service to 
half the city to \"technical reasons.\"  We suspect the GOV 
sought to make the opposition signature appeal more difficult 
by cutting off the gasoline.  If so, they started too late to 
 
 
have an impact.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Maria Corina Machado, of the electoral NGO Sumate 
told reporters June 1 that the hearing to charge her with 
treason and conspiracy had been rescheduled for the second 
time until June 10. Another Sumate leader, Alejandro Plaz, is 
scheduled to have his hearing June 2. On May 31, a Caracas 
court rejected a request from Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles 
Radonski (Primero Justicia) for release pending trial. He has 
been held since May 11. He is being charged with allegedly 
participating in the attack on the Cuban embassy during the 
April 2002 events. Both cases are clearly political and 
arbitrary, according to OAS SYG Cesar Gaviria.  Capriles is a 
political prisoner.  Macahdo and Plaz are in danger of 
becoming political prisoners.  End Summary. 
 
------ 
Sumate 
------ 
 
2. (U) Maria Corina Machado, one of the leaders of the NGO 
Sumate, told reporters June 1 that the hearing to charge her 
was postponed until June 10, to give her time to prepare her 
defense. Alejandro Plaz, the president of Sumate, will go 
before the judge June 2. The charges of treason and 
conspiracy stem from funding the group received from the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which GOV officials 
have charged is a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty. The 
two were first called to appear on May 26 and 27 
respectively, but the hearings were postponed until June 1 
and 2. 
 
-------------------------- 
Henrique Capriles Radonski 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) The seventh chamber of the Appeals Court of Caracas 
May 31 rejected the request by Primero Justicia (PJ) leader, 
and Mayor of Baruta, Henrique Capriles Radonski for release 
pending trial. Capriles\' lawyers also attempted to have the 
case heard by another chamber, arguing that the members of 
the chamber were well known Chavez supporters who would not 
give Capriles a fair hearing. The request was denied, meaning 
Capriles now will spend an additional 25 days in detention. 
 
4.  (U) PJ president Julio Borges announced May 28 that the 
Inter-American Human Rights Committee (IACHR) had asked the 
GOV for information on the Capriles case. The IACHR Executive 
Secretary Santiago Canton, according to Borges, asked for 
 
SIPDIS 
information on the legal proceedings in the case, and the 
conditions under which Capriles was being held. Borges told 
reporters Capriles is being held in a room without light, 
without ventilation, and is unable to walk or exercise. 
Prosecutor Danilo Anderson has claimed that Capriles has 16 
square meters of space, a bed, a TV and two fans, and thus is 
better off than most preisoners. 
 
5.  (C) Former Attorney General and law professor Ramon 
Escobar Salom told PolCouns that Capriles\'s continued 
detention is purely political. At this stage of an 
investigation, he said, following the criminal procedures 
code would normally result in the individual being allowed to 
go free on promise of appearance or on bail, especially if 
the person is well known, not to mention an elected official. 
In Escobar\'s opinion, the government wants to exemplify its 
support for Cuba in this matter. He also asserted that 
anti-Semitism cannot be disregarded as a factor in the 
government\'s animosity towards Capriles.  (Comment: Capriles 
legally maneuvered around earlier summonses until the March 
16 detention order (see next paragraph) was issued and he 
went underground. The court bought the prosecutor\'s argument 
that Capriles thus presented a flight risk.  We do not 
believe anti-Semitism is a factor in Capriles\'s case.) 
 
6.  (U) Capriles has been in custody since he appeared at a 
hearing on May 11 during which Anderson asked that he be held 
pending trial. The judge agreed, and ordered that he be held 
in the DISIP (political police) headquarters. Anderson first 
obtained a detention order March 16. At that time Capriles 
avoided detention by going into hiding, alleging lack of due 
process because Anderson would not let his lawyers see the 
charges. The Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice 
(TSJ) voided the March 16 order on March 31. The Penal 
chamber also ordered that another court hear the case and 
that Capriles\' lawyers be allowed to see the charges. 
 
7.  (U) The Capriles case goes back to the April 2002 events. 
On April 12, 2002, after Chavez\' removal from power, a group 
of people gathered in front of the Cuban embassy and began a 
violent protest. According to Capriles the Cuban ambassador, 
German Sanchez Otero, asked him to come and help calm the 
situation (Note: the Cuban embassy is located in Baruta). 
According to the GOV, Capriles led the protests, and the 
Baruta police did nothing to protect the embassy. 
 
-------------------------------- 
President Carter Talks to Chavez 
-------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria told the 
Ambassador June 1 that President Carter raised the Capriles 
and Sumate cases with President Chavez at a private meeting 
May 31. Gaviria called the cases \"arbitrary\" and \"clearly 
political.\"  Gaviria rejected the possibility that the Sumate 
projects financed by NED could be considered treason. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The GOV\'s moves against Sumate\'s leaders, in the 
middle of the reparo process, smacks of intimidation. Sumate 
is the technical brains of the opposition\'s referendum 
strategy, and the GOV would love to unsettle the 
organization. Machado and Plaz have responded intelligently, 
giving no grounds to claim they might flee, and requesting 
delays to prepare the case. This has made the case a mere 
distraction during the reparos. If the real intention is to 
break the organization to prevent its participation in future 
elections, there is a danger the Chavista judicial system 
will eventually put Sumate out of business. The Capriles case 
foreshadows where the Chavista justice system is headed. 
There is no explanation for why the Penal Chamber\'s decision 
has been disregarded.

there are rumors and indications that President Hugo Chavez 
may be willing to accept a National Electoral Council (CNE) 
decision that results in a recall referendum.  If so, the 
National Electoral Council would proceed to schedule a recall 
referendum.  Alternatively, some believe the President may 
push for early elections, a move complicated by legalities 
and feasible only if political agreements can be reached. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  President Hugo Chavez acknowledged publicly June 1 
that the opposition, though \"having engaged in some fraud,\" 
might have come up with sufficient valid signatures in the 
appeals process for the presidential recall referendum.  They 
may be a winner \"by  a hair,\" the President said, \"nothing 
more.\"  Vice President Rangel followed the President\'s 
comments June 2, saying that if the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) determines that the opposition indeed has 
sufficient signatures, the GoV is prepared to go to the 
recall.  Vice President Rangel\'s chief of staff, Rene 
Arreaza, told the ambassador June 2 that Chavez will/will 
accept the results of the appeals.  Other GoV officials, such 
as Minister of Culture Jesse Chacon, and Fifth Republic 
Movement leader Elias Jaua, have echoed what appears to be 
Chavez line. 
 
3.  (C) National Assembly Secretary and Podemos deputy 
Eustoquio Contreras (protect) told DCM June 2 that Chavez and 
his top political advisers discussed all options, including 
the \"hard line\" of simply telling the CNE to rule against the 
Opposition which Chavez ruled out, at a late night meeting 
June 1.  The outcome, however, was that Chavez was inclined 
to accept a CNE decision that would permit a referendum to go 
forward.  The meeting participants, according to Contreras, 
acknowledged that the Comando Ayacucho had been excessively 
optimistic in assessing the Coordinadora\'s capabilities, and 
in its own ability to persuade people to withdraw their 
signatures.  The Comando Ayacucho reportedly believed that 
the Coordinadora had obtained only some 80,000 signatures 
beyond the minimum required.  Chavez and his advisors also 
discussed what next if Chavez lost the referendum.  Arreaza 
told the Ambassador that there will be a series of meetings 
at Miraflores beginning June 4 in which they will decide if 
they go to the recall or move to early elections. 
 
--------------- 
Early Elections 
--------------- 
 
4.  (C) Aragua State Governor Didalco Bolivar told the 
Ambassador June 1 that he was seeking a meeting with the 
President to advise him that he should call early elections 
to attenuate the loss before the CNE announces the results. 
Other pundits and politics watchers have speculated that 
Chavez would make such a move to catch the opposition 
unprepared for an electoral contest.  In a second 
conversation with Arreaza, the Chief of Staff reiterated that 
Chavez will accept the results; the question is whether to go 
to the recall or call general elections.  The Political 
Committee (the cabinet, key MVR party members, and the key 
Chavista mayors and governors) are to discuss the options in 
Miraflores June 4.  Arreaza also confirmed the assessment OAS 
SYG Cesar Gaviria had given the Ambassador earlier: that 
PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez and VP Rangel favor accepting 
the results while hard-liners such as Chacon, Libertador 
Mayor Freddy Bernal, and National Assembly Deputy Tarek Saab 
oppose. 
 
--------- 
Obstacles 
--------- 
 
5.  (C) The main obstacle to calling early elections, 
 
however, is that there are currently no legal provisions for 
Chavez to call early elections,  according to former Attorney 
General and law professor Ramon Escobar Salom.  Early 
elections would require a constitutional amendment, an option 
the opposition discarded during the OAS talks in 2003 
because, they say, former President Jimmy Carter backed the 
recall referendum solution and they did not believe they 
Chavez would agree to the idea.  Under the Constitution, the 
President with the Council of Ministers can introduce an 
amendment which the CNE must then put up for ratification via 
a referendum within 30 days.  The amendment requires approval 
by majority of voters to come into effect. Escobar told 
PolCouns June 1, however, that it is conceivable that Chavez 
could make a political deal to short cut the legalities of 
the Constitutional amendment path. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) The important news is that Chavez, for whatever 
reasons, appears to have decided to accept a referendum.  He 
will continue to portray this, however, as the result of CD 
fraud, and GoV magnanimity.  Medium term, the important news 
is that the GoV knows it has lost a big one, and is concerned 
it may lose even more.  The combination of international 
observers, opposition organization and public opinion was 
critical, and will continue to be so in a referendum.

REF: CARACAS 1443 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR CHARLES S. SHAPIRO FOR REASONS 1.5 B & D 
 
1. (SBU) THE CENTRAL BANK (BCV) HAS REPORTED 1ST QUARTER GDP 
GROWTH OF 29.8% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2003, WHEN IT 
FELL 27.8%.  MINISTER OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT JORGE 
GIORDANI SAYS THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A PERIOD OF 
SUSTAINED GROWTH.  HIS IS A LONE VOICE, AS INDEPENDENT 
ECONOMISTS CALL THE GROWTH A TECHNICAL \"REBOUND\" AND EXPECT 
IT TO TAPER OFF - SHARPLY AND SOON. 
 
------------------------------ 
WHAT GDP INCREASE, FROM WHERE? 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) REAL GDP RATES HAVE BEEN LAGGING SINCE 1998, THE 
YEAR CHAVEZ BECAME PRESIDENT.  GROWTH IN 2000 AND 2001 OF 
3.2% AND 2.8% DID NOT OFFSET A 1999 DROP OF 6.1%, AND STEEP 
DECLINES IN 2002 AND 2003 (8.9% AND 9.4%) LEAVE REAL GDP 
NEARLY 18% BELOW PRE-CHAVEZ LEVELS.  GDP FELL FOR SEVEN 
STRAIGHT QUARTERS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF 2002, UNTIL A 9.0% 
INCREASE IN THE 4TH QUARTER OF 2003. 
 
3. (SBU) THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE GDP JUMP IS OIL 
PRODUCTION, WHICH GREW AT A 72.5% RATE OVER 1ST QUARTER 2003. 
 THIS IS HARDLY SURPRISING, CONSIDERING THAT THE NATIONAL 
STRIKE LASTED INTO EARLY FEBRUARY LAST YEAR, AND THAT 
    VENEZUELAN OIL PRICES HIT A NEW RECORD ($28.82/BARREL IN THE 
1ST QUARTER, 11.2% OVER 4TH QUARTER 2003).  THE NON-OIL 
GROWTH WAS 18.9%.  NOTE: ALL GOV COMMENTARIES FAIL TO POINT 
OUT THAT THESE JUMPS STILL LEAVE REAL GDP MEASURES BELOW 
PRE-STRIKE MARKS; INDEED, ALL THREE ARE LOWER THAN EACH YEAR 
(SAVE FOR 2003) SINCE 1996. 
 
------------------------------ 
SUSTAINED GROWTH OR A REBOUND? 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) PLANNING MINISTER GIORDANI, SPEAKING ON PRESIDENT 
CHAVEZ\' WEEKLY \"ALO, PRESIDENTE\" ADDRESS MAY 23, PREDICTED 
GDP GROWTH OF AT LEAST 6% A YEAR THROUGH 2006, AND SAID \"WE 
MUST LAY THE GROUNDWORK SO THAT THIS GROWTH IS SUSTAINED NOT 
ONLY FOR THE REST OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM, BUT ALSO 
FOR THE ONE TO COME AND FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.\"  THE GOV IS 
THE ONLY OPTIMIST ABOUT THE FUTURE.  GOLDMAN SACHS, FOR 
EXAMPLE, PREDICTS GROWTH OF 7% FOR 2004 OVERALL, BUT FALLING 
TO 0.0% FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND THEN GROWING ONLY 2.9% IN 
2005.  DOMINGO FONTIVEROS, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR FEDECAMARAS 
(FEDERATION OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY) CALLS 
GIORDANI\'S PREDICTION WISHFUL THINKING AT BEST, STATING THAT 
THE GOV\'S ECONOMIC POLICY IS A COLLECTION OF \"IDEAS, RATHER 
THAN A PLAN.\"  HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION 
HAS ACHIEVED THE POOREST GDP RESULTS EVER, DESPITE HAVING THE 
GREATEST REVENUES. 
 
5. (SBU) WHILE PRIVATE ECONOMISTS CALL THIS SIMPLY A REBOUND, 
GOV AUTHORITIES STRONGLY DISPUTE THE WORD ITSELF.  GIORDANI 
SAYS THAT THE TERM \"REBOUND\" (REBOTE) COULD NOT BE FOUND IN A 
    DICTIONARY, AND THAT IT \"MUST BE A NEW INVENTION OF OUR 
OPPONENTS.\"  RODRIGO CABEZAS, CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
FINANCE COMMITTEE, CLAIMS THAT THE \"TERM DOES NOT EXIST IN 
ANY BOOK ABOUT ECONOMIC SCIENCE...MAYBE ON ANOTHER PLANET, 
BUT NEVER ON EARTH.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT

6. (C) THE GOV CONTINUES TRYING TO PAINT BEAUTIFUL PICTURES 
BY USING ONLY ONE OR TWO COLORS, KNOWING THE REST OF THE 
PALETTE IS NOT PRETTY.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THINGS 
SEEM POSITIVE, GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST GOV 
ADMINISTRATION TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC CONTRACTION DURING AN OIL 
BOOM.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) announced June 3 
that its preliminary calculations indicated that the 
opposition had collected enough signatures to activate the 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  In a 
national radio and television broadcast (cadena) from 
Miraflores Palace a few hours later, Chavez conceded the 
\"clear tendencies\" of the CNE\'s projections, claimed that 
this really was a GOV moral victory, and challenged the 
opposition to do \"political battle.\"  Some Chavez supporters 
reacted violently while others reluctantly accepted the 
results, reiterating charges of opposition fraud.  The 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD) released its numbers -- with a 
greater margin of victory -- and called on the CNE to set the 
referendum for August 8, a date agreed to verbally during the 
signature appeals negotiations.  Delivering the preliminary 
results, CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez did not set a date for 
the recall vote.  Both sides called their followers to mass 
marches in Caracas, the opposition on June 5 and GOV on June 
6.  Chavez has taken the high road, admittedly his version of 
it, and now seems ready to take on the opposition personally 
in the referendum campaign.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CNE Announces Probable Presidential Recall 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) Director Jorge 
Rodriguez announced June 3 that the CNE\'s preliminary 
calculations indicated that the opposition had collected 
2,451,821 signatures, just 15,738 over the 2,436,083 needed 
to activate the recall referendum against President Hugo 
Chavez.  Rodriguez did not set a date for the referendum, 
which the rules say must be done when final results are 
announced.  CNE President Francisco Carrasquero said on May 2 
that if the opposition collected enough signatures via the 
appeals process, the referendum could take place on August 8. 
 Press reports say CNE technicians have proposed moving the 
date to August 15, four days before the date when the 
possibility of replacing a recalled Chavez via elections 
expires.  Rodriguez also announced that nine opposition 
deputies will definitely face a recall vote. 
 
------------------------------ 
Opposition Claims Wider Margin 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) With the go-ahead from Rodriguez, the Coordinadora 
Democractica (CD) released its results that showed the 
opposition had collected 2,569,584 signatures, 133,501 over 
the threshold.  CD Coordinator and Miranda State Governor 
Enrique Mendoza declared a \"moral victory\" and thanked 
opposition parties, civil society, and the international 
community, including OAS SYG Cesar Gaviria and former 
President Jimmy Carter, for their support.  Mendoza called on 
the CNE to respect the August 8 date for the referendum, 
saying the opposition would reject any attempt by the GOV to 
delay the referendum past August 19. 
 
---------------------------- 
Chavez Accepts the Challenge 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (U) A few hours after the CNE announcement, President 
Chavez addressed the nation (cadena) June 3 from Miraflores 
Palace.  He rejected he had been defeated and accepted the 
referendum, conceding the \"clear tendencies\" of the CNE\'s 
projections.  Calling the CNE\'s announcement a victory for 
\"participatory democracy,\" he recalled that it was he who 
first proposed the recall referendum be included in the 1999 
Constitution.  Surrounded by portraits and statues of Simon 
Bolivar, Christ, and Venezuelan military figures, Chavez made 
historical analogies to his struggle against the opposition. 
 
Chavez recounted the challenges faced by his administration, 
accusing the USG of conspiring to overthrow him, and 
challenged the opposition to prepare for a new Battle of 
Santa Ines.  (During Venezuela\'s Federal Wars, Gen. Ezequiel 
Zamora defeated the opposition\'s army through a series of 
strategic retreats.)  Addressing a widescreen television with 
images of thousands of supporters, Chavez told his people 
(the screen) that \"this is just a new battle, and what awaits 
us is a new victory.\"  After the broadcast, Chavez circulated 
briefly among the crowd outside. 
 
----------------------- 
Chavista Reaction Mixed 
----------------------- 
 
5. (U) Prior to the President\'s acceptance of the referendum, 
Chavez supporters railed against the CNE\'s decision.  Armed 
groups allegedly linked to the GOV (the pro-Chavez website 
aporrea said the Tupamaros had taken credit) reacted 
violently in downtown Caracas on June 2, leaving one person 
dead and several injured, including opposition Deputy Rafael 
Marin (septel).  (After his speech, Chavez denounced violence 
\"wherever it comes from\" and called on all parties to 
maintain peace.)  CNE directors Jorge Rodriguez (pro-Chavez) 
and Sobella Mejias (pro-opposition) traded allegations June 
2-3 about some 15,800 deceased persons that had not been 
removed from the electoral registry prior to the appeals 
process.  Chavez supporters allege the opposition falsified 
identity cards in the names of the dead people and sent 
impostors to make the appeals.  Chavez supporters asserted it 
was an injustice that the margin of victory announced by the 
CNE was just under the number of supposed deceased persons. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Both Sides Plan Mass Marches, June 5-6 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOV and opposition called for marches in Caracas 
to support their respective \"victories.\"  The opposition 
plans to march on June 5, the GOV on June 6.  The opposition 
also plans to hold marches in other cities June 6, according 
to Solidaridad Deputy Alejandro Armas.  Armas predicted to 
poloff June 4 the opposition marches would have large 
turnouts.  He said that turnouts of the opposition and 
Chavista marches would be good indicators of the popular 
support each side has for the referendum. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez\'s acceptance of the referendum is a clear 
victory for the referendum and a wise political move, 
especially with the OAS General Assembly just three days 
away.  Chavez believes his embrace of the referendum will 
save his image as a constitutional democrat, and exonerate 
the beleaguered CNE as a trustworthy institution.  His speech 
was pure hypocrisy, given the six months of delay he forced 
on the process.  He sought to stain the opposition\'s victory 
with fraud allegations not only to steal the momentum from 
the CD, but also to mollify radical elements within his own 
movement.  He made clear there will be no more middle men, 
that he personally would defeat the opposition at the ballot 
box.  This was his winning formula for reaching office, and 
may be his best bet now given the apparent failing of his 
political machinery -- the Comando Ayacucho -- to save him 
from the referendum.  Up to now, the GOV probably has not 
utilized its full capacity to boost Chavez\'s political 
popularity (and deflate that of the opposition).  Chavez now 
appears ready to try. 
 
8. (C) Why did Chavez give in?  We believe it was the 
OAS/Carter Center observation efforts, in large part, boosted 
by the Group of Friends and other countries; the perception 
that the truth would come out, and that opposition elements 
would use the lack of democratic options to justify violence; 
and Chavez\'s belief -- call it vanity -- that once again he 
can win big at the polls.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  ON MAY 22 THE NATIONAL GUARD AND DIRECTORATE FOR 
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ARRESTED FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, 
BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCISCO USON RAMIREZ_ FOR \"DEFAMING\" THE 
MILITARY.  GENERAL USON HAS BEEN AN OPEN SUPPORTER OF THE 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AND RECENTLY 
CRITICIZED THE ARMY\'S HANDLING OF THE FIRE MARCH 30 AT FUERTE 
MARA WHERE TWO SOLDIERS DIED.  THE GOV INSISTS THAT GENERAL 
USON SHOULD BE TRIED IN A MILITARY COURT, WHILE SEVERAL 
MILITARY JUDGES AND USON,S LAWYERS HAVE INSISTED THAT THE 
CASE SHOULD BE REFERRED TO A CIVIL COURT.  THE GOV ALSO HAS 
REMOVED ONE OF THE MILITARY JUDGES THAT HAVE REFUSED TO HEAR 
USON,S CASE. USON\'S ARREST IS A CLEAR WARNING TO OTHER 
RETIRED AND ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL.  THIS ARREST WAS ARBITRARY 
AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.  GENERAL USON IS A POLITICAL 
PRISONER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
CHARGED AND DETAINED 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF A DETENTION ORDER ON MAY 
21, THE NATIONAL GUARD AND DIRECTORATE FOR MILITARY 
    INTELLIGENCE (DIM) DETAINED FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, 
BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCISCO USON RAMIREZ_ ON MAY 22 FOR 
\"DEFAMING\" THE MILITARY. USON HAD PUBLICLY ASSERTED THAT THE 
MARCH 30 FIRE AT FUERTE MARA, IN WHICH EIGHT DETAINED 
SOLDIERS WERE BADLY BURNED, TWO OF WHOM LATER DIED, WAS NOT 
AN ACCIDENT, BUT WAS INTENTIONALLY STARTED FROM OUTSIDE THE 
CELL.  THE GOV AND NATIONAL ARMED FORCES (FAN) CONDEMNED AND 
REJECTED THIS STATEMENT AND CHARGED USON OFFICIALLY WITH 
DEFAMATION OF THE MILITARY.  THE NATIONAL GUARD AND DIM TOOK 
USON INTO CUSTODY AT THE AIRPORT IN PUERTO ORDAZ, BOLIVAR 
STATE, WHERE HE WAS REPORTEDLY EN ROUTE TO AN OPPOSITION 
TRAINING SEMINAR.  SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE CIVIL 
MILITARY ALLIANCE OF VENEZUELA, HAVE DENOUNCED THE DETENTION 
OF GENERAL USON AS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACT OF 
INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE OPPOSITION. 
 
------------------ 
JUDICIAL WRANGLING 
------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  THE ACTUAL JURISDICTION OF THE CASE HAS BEEN A 
SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY.  THE GOV CONTENDED THAT USON,S CASE 
SHOULD BE TRIED AS A COURT MARTIAL IN A MILITARY TRIBUNAL DUE 
TO HIS RANK AS A GENERAL.  USON,S LAWYERS, GUSTAVO PARILLI 
AND GONZALO HIMIOB, HAVE ASSERTED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
1999 CONSTITUTION, THE CHARGES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST GENERAL 
USON FALL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM. 
USON,S CASE HAS BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE SEVERAL MILITARY JUDGES, 
SOME OF WHOM HAVE DECLARED THAT THE CASE SHOULD BE TRIED 
BEFORE A CIVIL COURT.  THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE REMOVED ONE OF 
THE MILITARY JUDGES THAT HAVE REFUSED TO HEAR USON,S CASE 
    FROM THEIR POSITIONS.  USON REMAINS IMPRISONED IN MILITARY 
DETENTION CENTER IN CARACAS WHILE THE LEGAL WRANGLING OF HIS 
CASE CONTINUES.

COMMENT

4.  (C)  THE CHARGE OF \"VILIPENDIO\" (DEFAMING AN INSTITUTION) 
IS THE CHARGE THAT DICTATORSHIPS IN CHILE, URUGUAY AND 
ARGENTINA USED AGAINST THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  APART FROM 
THE METAPHYSICAL QUESTION OF HOW ONE COULD DEFAME AN 
INSTITUTION, THIS CASE IS ARBITRARY AND POLITICALLY 
MOTIVATED.  FRANCISCO USON IS A POLITICAL PRISONER.

1.  (C) On June 5, the Ambassador traveled to Maracaibo, 
Zulia State, where Esteban Pineda, editor of the Maracaibo 
daily Panorama, told him that the pro-Chavez gubernatorial 
candidate suffers from incredibly low support ratings and has 
few prospects in Zulia\'s upcoming elections.  At a lunch 
hosted by the Governor of Zulia, Manuel Rosales, invitees 
voiced concern over the date of the recall referendum and 
asserted that holding the referendum on August 15 could lead 
to delays beyond August 19 deadline.  When interviewed by a 
Panorama journalist, the Ambassador emphasized that the U.S. 
will only respect the results of the recall referendum if 
there is a clean and transparent electoral process. 
End Summary.

PINEDA\'S OBSERVATIONS 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On June 5, the Ambassador traveled to Maracaibo, 
Zulia State, where he met with Esteban Pineda, editor of the 
pro-Chavez Maracaibo daily, Panorama.  Speaking on his 
business interests, Pineda reflected that he has established 
working relationships with Zulia Governor Manuel Rosales and 
the GoV, and that what is most important is not allowing 
continued political polarization to affect the business 
climate.  The Ambassador and Pineda also discussed the 
pro-Chavez gubernatorial candidate for Zulia, retired 
National Guard General Alberto Gutierrez.  Pineda remarked 
that Gutierrez suffers from low support ratings and has few 
prospects in upcoming elections.  (The Ambassador had a 
meeting scheduled with Gutierrez, but Gutierrez canceled, 
saying he had been called to Caracas.  In fact, he did not 
leave for Caracas until the following day.)  Pineda is very 
proud that his varied business interests are doing well and 
that he has money invested in Venezuela, not abroad.  He 
maintains good relations with both President Chavez and Gov. 
Rosales. 
 
------------------ 
PANORAMA INTERVIEW 
------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  The Ambassador granted also gave an interview to a 
journalist from Panorama after meeting with Pineda.  Asked 
about the recall referendum, the Ambassador remarked that the 
U.S. will only respect the results of the recall referendum 
if there is a clean and transparent electoral process.  The 
Ambassador reiterated U.S. commitment to a peaceful, 
democratic, constitutional and electoral solution to the 
current political crisis in Venezuela.  The Ambassador also 
expressed hope that the recall referendum would lead to an 
improvement in bilateral relations between the U.S. and 
Venezuela, and that commented that cooperation on more 
technical issues such as immigration and trade could serve as 
a first step toward reconciliation. 
 
---------------------------- 
CONCERNS OVER THE REFERENDUM 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador attended a lunch hosted by the 
Governor of Zulia Manuel Rosales (opposition -- Nuevo Tiempo 
party).  The recall referendum and the reparos process were 
central topics of conversation.  Concern was voiced over the 
as yet undefined date of the recall referendum. Holding the 
referendum on August 15 as the GoV proposes, they said, could 
lead to delays beyond August 19.  Those in attendance were 
also apprehensive about the potential for political violence 
during and after the recall referendum.  This anxiety stems 
in part from the March 6 murder of a local Accion Democratica 
leader, Evangelina Carrizo, in Machiques, Zulia State. 
Alfonso Marquez, Mayor of Machiques, commented that the most 
unsettling aspect of the Carrizo murder is that the GoV has 
demonstrated no intention to prosecute the case although the 
alleged murderer has been identified. 
 
5.  (SBU)  The lunch guests discussed the field of candidates 
for Zulia\'s upcoming gubernatorial election.  As stated by 
Pineda, they too maintained that pro-Chavez candidate Gen. 
Gutierrez only had a public opinion rating between 22% and 
 
25%.  All thought that he would not pose a substantial threat 
to Governor Rosales.  It was also noted that former governor 
of Zulia (and rival opposition candidate), Francisco Arias 
Cardenas had received less than 5% of the votes in public 
polling. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  The key force in Zulia politics is Gov. Rosales. 
The state chapter of the Coordinadora Democratica is 
moribund.  Rosales is the opposition.  The state is heavily 
anti-Chavista and Venezuelans ratified more signatures in the 
appeals process than in any other state.  Chavez regularly 
accuses Rosales of being both a golpista and a secessionist. 
Rumors abound that Rosales is one of the governors Chavez 
would like to have jailed.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Before a multitude of supporters June 6, President 
Hugo Chavez morphed the recall referendum sought by his 
opponents into a referendum to ratify his mandate.  He called 
on his supporters to help him once again defeat the enemies 
of the Bolivarian revolution who would deprive them of the 
social programs Chavez has started.  Chavez\'s shift is 
important as the National Electoral Council, grappling with 
the questions of when the referendum will be and whether the 
process will be manual or electronic, also debates the 
formulation of the referendum question.  While the President 
has strategically gone into full campaign modeu, his 
opponents focus on tactical battles, and relegate matters 
such as identifying their leading candidate to a second 
level.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez, having accepted that the 
preliminary results of the appeals process indicated that 
there would be a recall referendum, convoked a rally in 
Caracas June 6.  Addressing the hundreds of thousands of 
supporters bused in from around the country, Chavez said he 
was pleased that the opposition had opted for a peaceful, 
constitutional route and called on his opponents to reject 
violence and refrain from seeking international intervention. 
 Denying that \"we\" had suffered a defeat, the President 
mocked the opposition\'s claim to victory, alleging that it 
was already considering dismantling the revolution\'s social 
programs, privatizing the state oil company and to reinstate 
military coup-plotters into the armed forces. 
 
3.  (U) Chavez called the referendum -- not once using the 
word recall, instead referring to it as national or 
ratification -- perhaps the best thing that could happen to 
Venezuelans because the \"oligarchy\" would now stop its 
whimpering.  Accepting it as \"one more challenge,\" he warned 
the opposition \"and its foreign masters\" to prepare for a 
defeat that \"will be indelibly written in the history of the 
21st century.\"  Chavez told his supporters to prepare for 60 
days of hard campaigning and set their goal at obtaining more 
than twice the vote that brought Chavez to office. 
 
---------------- 
What\'s the date? 
---------------- 
 
4.  (U) Chavez told the crowd he did not care whether the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) set August 8 or August 15 as 
the date for the referendum.  Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel and other leading Chavez allies have come out in favor 
of the later date.  CNE director Jorge Rodriguez has told 
reporters he favors the August 15 date because the Council 
needs the additional time for preparations.  The CNE is 
expected to set the date when results are announced June 8. 
 
5.  (U) Opposition leaders across the board are insisting on 
the August 8 date.  Miranda State Gov. Enrique Mendoza told 
reporters June 7 that they expect the CNE to honor a verbal 
commitment made to them by CNE director Jorge Rodriguez 
during the appeals process negotiations.  Mendoza said August 
8 is key because, should any problems arise, Venezuelans 
would have one more Sunday at their disposal to hold the 
referendum before August 19.  Chavez opponents also fear that 
the GoV may employ legal maneuvering, such as seeking 
distinction between when the voting occurred and when 
official results are in, to deny them new elections.  (Note: 
If a successful recall referendum occurs after August 19, 
there are no new presidential elections and the Vice 
President would assume office.) 
 
-------------------- 
Machines: Why Worry? 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Another point of contention before the CNE is whether 
to conduct the referendum with paper ballots or use 
 
electronic machines.  CNE director Rodriguez, who had a 
leading role in obtaining the contract for the new machines 
to be used, cites the electoral law as the reason for going 
the computer route.  VP Rangel and other Chavez supporters 
have also flatly taken the side of computerized voting. 
Fifth Republic Movement deputy Luis Tascon asserted that 
using computers guarantees transparency in the process and 
charged that the opposition insists on paper ballots so it 
can commit fraud. 
 
7.  (U) Conversely, the opposition believes the GoV insists 
on using the computers so it will be able to commit fraud. 
Among the reasons Chavez opponents cite is the partial GoV 
ownership (28% according to the Miami Herald) of the 
consortium that has the contract for the machines; all the 
machines needed for the vote have yet to be delivered; and 
the software for them has yet to be written.  Additionally, 
there is concern about possible manipulations and electronic 
fraud and Venezuelans\' lack of familiarity with the machines. 
 
 
8.  (C) CNE director Ezequiel Zamora, who opposes using the 
new machines for the referendum, argues that this is not time 
to try out a new system.  He noted, for example, that the 
infrastructure -- electricity and telephony -- is not the 
same in other parts of the country as it may be in the 
capital.  Carter Center representative Francisco Diez told 
the Ambassador that the computerization of the referendum 
should not be so problematic.  They had seen a demonstration 
of the machines, Diez said, and the electoral expert working 
for the consortium (we presume this is a former IFES 
consultant) is favorably known to them.  Each machine has 
built-in UPS to keep it functioning if power fails, and can 
transmit results by cellphone or satellite if hard lines 
fail. 
 
---------------------- 
Fighting for the \"Yes\" 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (U) Another point of contention before the CNE is the 
formulation of the question for the referendum.  Having 
invested more than a year on a \"yes\" vote, the Opposition 
favors a question that calls for an affirmative answer, i.e., 
\"Do you agree with revoking the mandate of the President of 
the Republic?\"  Chavez, however, turned the tables June 6 
when he made the recall referendum a ratification referendum. 
 The question his supporters favor is \"Are you in favor of 
President Chavez concluding his term?\"   There is as yet no 
definition of when the CNE has to decide on the language of 
the question.  The later that the decision comes in the next 
two months, assuming that it will be formulated in favor of 
the GoV, the more difficult it will be for the Opposition\'s 
campaign. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) While President has gone into full campaign mode, 
the Opposition battles tactically over questions such as the 
date, computerization or the language in the question to be 
put before the voters.  Matters such as who would be the 
opposition candidate -- or for that matter, how many -- are 
temporarily relegated to secondary attention.  Fortunately 
for the opposition, solutions to at least two of the three 
predominant issues appear to be in the offing.  Devoting 
energies to a larger, strategic vision of how to approach the 
referendum and the campaign to go along with it are a must 
that the Opposition can ill afford to delay.

SUBJECT: PDVSA MONEY GOES STRAIGHT TO GOV SPENDING 
 
REF: A. CARACAS 1443 
     B. CARACAS 1904 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CHARLES S. SHAPIRO FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Central Bank (BCV reserves) peaked on May 14, 
and have since been dropping sharply.  The chairman of the 
National Assembly Finance Committee and the President of 
state-owned oil company PDVSA have publicly confirmed that 
the reason for the decline is that PDVSA has ceased turning 
over its income to the BCV for conversion into Bolivars, an 
act that critics call illegal and unconstitutional.  The 
reason for this diversion appears to be to subsidize a new 
\"Special Development Fund\" announced recently by President 
Chavez, which is purportedly worth USD 2 billion.  After 
asking the BCV for, and not receiving, his mere \"millardito\" 
(a billion USD - see reftel A), he apparently has found a way 
to simply take two, courtesy of high oil prices.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
RESERVES DROPPING 
----------------- 
 
2. (SBU) BCV reserves peaked at a total of 24.721 billion USD 
(including the Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund, or FEM, a 
separate account for GOV revenue, theoretically to be built 
up when oil prices are high, but which in fact has less now 
than since its second month of existence) on May 14, but have 
since fallen to only 23.869 billion as of June 4.  NOTE: This 
is not due to BCV providing forex to pay for imports, as the 
amount of foreign exchange CADIVI (the Commission for Foreign 
Exchange Administration) approved in May was only USD 17 
million more than in April.  Even if forex approvals had 
increased substantially, it would not be enough to account 
for the drop, since reserves had been growing steadily since 
exchange controls were put in place in January 2003.  For 
example, the reserves grew by just over 1 billion USD in 
April 2004, 2.9 billion since January 1, and 8.58 billion in 
the 12 months ending April 30.  END NOTE. 
 
------------------------ 
PDVSA WITHHOLDING INCOME 
------------------------ 
 
3. (U) Newspaper articles on June 3 stated that PDVSA\'s 
finance team had received orders to suspend selling foreign 
currency to the BCV for at least the period of June through 
August of this year.  Daily \"El Nacional\" quotes anonymous 
BCV reps as saying that at least $750 million was also 
diverted in the month of May.  In the face of these stories, 
Rodrigo Cabezas, MVR party Deputy and head of the National 
Assembly Finance Commission, announced June 4 that this was 
indeed the case, and was the result of a decision made by the 
PDVSA board of directors.  The reason Cabezas gave is that 
any reform to the FEM law would have been delayed until the 
second half of the year, so PDVSA \"assumed responsibility\" 
and found a \"short-cut.\"  PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez 
subsequently echoed Cabezas\' comments on June 7 and assured 
that the move was perfectly legal, and in fact was done with 
the approval of the BCV. 
 
4. (U) Numerous independent economists have questioned this 
action, on grounds of legality and transparency.  The BCV 
law, for example, specifically states that foreign exchange 
obtained from oil exports \"must be sold exclusively to the 
Central Bank.\"  Also, the Constitution precludes any 
extra-budgetary spending.  Salomon Centeno, another member of 
the Finance Committee (and deputy from opposition party 
Accion Democratica) stated that the Assembly did not approve 
such an act and called for a special commission to 
investigate it. 
 
5. (C) The BCV seems to at least be aware of the reasons, 
although it is not clear that it approved the short 
circuiting of normal procedures, as PDVSA President Rodriguez 
asserted.  Milton Guzman, an economist at private Banco de 
Venezuela and former BCV employee, told econoff that his 
former co-workers have told him of an internal BCV memo that 
had circulated, telling employees in the financial operations 
area that the PDVSA money would not be forthcoming.  The 
development fund may actually be the idea of BCV President 
Diego Castellanos, who suggested it in a February 2004 letter 
 
to the Finance Committee during a period of public debate 
about the \"excess reserves.\"  However, this letter did not 
offer approval of the current method, since it stated that 
any fund must be \"in conformity with currency exchange 
standards,\" which Cabezas indicated at the time would be the 
case.  No one from the BCV has made any public statements 
about the issue since the reserves began dropping. 
 
------------------- 
MONEY FOR SOMETHING 
------------------- 
 
6. (U) The destination of these funds appears to be a new 
\"Special Development Fund\" announced by President Chavez on 
May 23.  He stated that USD 2 billion in oil funds would be 
used to finance national development projects, and said that 
USD 200 million were already designated for a sugar mill 
(being built with assistance from Cuban experts), a new state 
airline, a subway line in a Caracas suburb, and an irrigation 
system in western Venezuela.  Chavez claimed at the time that 
the money had been found in a \"secret\" PDVSA account that had 
been hidden by the BCV.  Banking Superintendent Trino Alcides 
also stated that this account was indeed worth just over USD 
2 billion. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ONLY THE BEGINNING?  PERHAPS NOT 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) There are strong indications that funds have been 
diverted in this manner for some time, though not in their 
entirety.  Some weeks ago, Luis Zambrano, senior economist of 
Banco Mercantil, told econoff he had learned that PDVSA was 
using money from its \"Rotating Fund\" (fondo rotatorio) to 
fund domestic social programs.  This fund, maintained in 
dollars, is legal, but was created for the express purpose of 
facilitating PDVSA\'s routine foreign purchases of equipment 
and other goods.  Zambrano believes that this method was not 
utilized until 2004, and estimated that spending from it 
would reach USD 3.3 billion for 2004 if Chavez remained in 
power. 
 
8. (C) Efrain Velazquez, President of the National Economic 
Council (CEN, a group of private economists and businessmen 
that was created nearly 50 years ago to advise the executive 
branch and is now all but ignored), told econoff in May that 
he was involved in discussions about a possible new law to 
affect BCV reserves (reftel A).  The proposed text would 
allow PDVSA to keep between one and two billion USD a year, 
and designate the funds for \"social projects.\"  When 
Velazquez protested that this would be inflationary, the BCV 
reps at the meeting told him it should not be a concern 
because the money would be spent in dollars \"for political 
activities abroad.\"  Velazquez told econoff that he believes 
that such funds would likely be spent domestically, but 
suggested that is any of it were spent outside of Venezuela, 
it might go to Evo Morales in Bolivia or other ideological 
allies. 
 
9. (C) Analysis of official GOV numbers raise questions as 
well.  While the reserves have been rising since January 
2003, BCV numbers indicate that the rate of increase has been 
slowing.  They increased by about USD 710 million/month over 
the course of 2003 (and USD 950 million/month from August to 
December, when CADIVI forex liquidations were at levels 
comparable to those of 2004), but by only USD 633 
million/month in 2004 through April.  This 10.8% slowdown is 
despite an 11.6% increase in oil prices, from an average of 
USD 25.82 per barrel in 2003 to USD 28.82 in 2004 (through 
April - up to USD 34.40 for May). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) Considering that a BCV employee told econoff that the 
\"secret\" PDVSA account that Chavez planned to tap was never a 
secret (nor does it make sense for it to have had USD 2 
 
SIPDIS 
billion in it), we believe that Chavez\' assertion was simply 
laying the groundwork for the PDVSA decision.  Since the BCV 
has refused to turn over money that \"rightfully\" (according 
to Chavez) belongs in the hands of the GOV, they can argue 
 
that robbing the BCV is only taking back what has been taken 
from them.  Chavez, repeatedly thwarted by the BCV and their 
bothersome insistence on legality, is clearly unwilling to 
settle for less. 
 
11. (C) We have our doubts as to how much of the money will 
be spent on big ticket infrastructure projects such as those 
Chavez named.  Much, we expect, will go to financing thinly 
disguised transfer payments to his key lower-income 
constituents through the various \"missions.\"  In any event, 
it does not appear that the money will be spent under the 
budget, which is debated publicly and subject (at least 
theoretically) to scrutiny by the National Assembly.  How the 
USD 2 billion will be converted to Bolivars is another 
unknown.  If it does not pass through the Central Bank, 
presumably it will be exchanged on the quasi-legal (though 
hardly transparent) parallel market.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) FRANCISCO CARRASQUERO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA\'S 
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED JUNE 8 THAT 
OPPONENTS OF PRESIDENT CHAVEZ HAD OBTAINED SUFFICIENT 
SIGNATURES TO PETITION FOR A REFERENDUM TO RECALL THE 
PRESIDENT.  ACCORDING TO THE CNE TALLIES, THE OPPOSITION 
OBTAINED 2,541,636 SIGNATURES, 105,533 MORE THAN THE 20% OF 
THE ELECTORATE NEEDED.  CARRASQUERO SET AUGUST 15 AS THE DATE 
FOR THE VOTE, AND ADDED THAT THE BALLOTING WOULD BE 
COMPUTERIZED.  THE OPPOSITION HAD STRONGLY FAVORED AN AUGUST 
8 DATE AND MANUAL BALLOTING.  COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA 
NEGOTIATOR FELIPE MUJICA (PRESIDENT OF THE MOVEMENT TO 
SOCIALISM -- MAS) CRITICIZED THE CNE FOR BACKTRACKING ON THE 
AGREED AUGUST 8 DATE, BUT ASSERTED THAT THE OPPOSITION WOULD 
TURN OUT MILLIONS OF VOTERS TO RECALL THE PRESIDENT 
REGARDLESS OF THE DATE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) IN A NATIONALLY BROADCAST (CADENA) STATEMENT JUNE 8, 
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE 
OFFICIAL RESULTS OF THE OPPOSITION\'S PETITION FOR A 
REFERENDUM TO RECALL PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ WHICH BEGAN WITH 
    THE FOUR-DAY SIGNATURE DRIVE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 2003. 
CARRASQUERO REPORTED THAT THE OPPOSITION OBTAINED 2,541,636 
VALID SIGNATURES, 105,533 MORE THAN THE 20% OF THE ELECTORATE 
NEEDED TO CONVOKE THE REFERENDUM.  IN THE MAY 27-31 APPEALS 
PROCESS, CARRASQUERO SAID, 773,755 VENEZUELANS CONFIRMED 
THEIR SIGNATURES, WHILE 91,669 RETRACTED THEIR SIGNATURES 
FROM THE PETITION.  (OPPOSITION TABULATED RESULTS SHOWED 
FEWER CONFIRMED SIGNATURES, 754,397 AND MORE RETRACTED 
SIGNATURES 95,777.) 
 
3.  (U) CARRASQUERO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REFERENDUM WOULD 
TAKE PLACE AUGUST 15.  THE CNE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THE 
BALLOTING WOULD BE COMPUTERIZED.  CHAVEZ OPPONENTS HAD 
ADVOCATED FOR THE REFERENDUM TO BE HELD AUGUST 8, ARGUING 
THAT AUGUST 15 IS TO CLOSE TO THE THRESHOLD DATE OF AUGUST 
AFTER WHICH THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD TAKE OVER IN CASE THEY 
ARE ABLE TO REVOKE CHAVEZ INSTEAD OF THERE BEING NEW 
ELECTIONS.  THEY ALSO ARGUED THAT COMPUTERIZED BALLOTING WAS 
NOT NECESSARY IN A SIMPLE VOTE SUCH AS THIS, THAT THE SYSTEM 
IS UNTRIED AND SUBJECT TO MANIPULATION, AND THAT RISK OF 
SYSTEMS FAILURE OR FAULTY PREPARATIONS COULD PUSH THE 
REFERENDUM BEYOND AUGUST 15. 
 
4.  (U) GOV OFFICIALS HAVE NOT REACTED PUBLICLY TO 
CARRASQUERO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT.  MIRANDA STATE GOV. ENRIQUE 
MENDOZA, SPEAKING FOR THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA JUNE 9, 
TOLD REPORTERS THE DATE MADE NO DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THE 
OPPOSITION WAS PREPARED TO WIN.  \"THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY 
RESPONSE WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME: THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO 
HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT.\"  MENDOZA ECHOED COMMENTS IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOWING CARRASQUERO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT BY COORDINADORA 
    NEGOTIATOR FELIPE MUJICA (PRESIDENT OF MOVEMENT TO SOCIALISM 
-- MAS).  MUJICA SAID THE SETBACKS ON THE DATE AND 
COMPUTERIZATION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION 
WAS PREPARED TO DEFEAT CHAVEZ ON AUGUST 15 WITH MILLIONS OF 
VOTES. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) CARRASQUERO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE OFFICIAL RESULTS 
BROADLY DEFINED THE PARAMETERS FOR THE RECALL.  A ROUGH AND 
TUMBLE CAMPAIGN WILL OCCUPY CENTER STAGE AND PUBLIC 
ATTENTION.  THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN, HOWEVER, IS WHETHER 
THE GOV CAN AND WILL ENSURE A FAIR BALLOTING.  WE KNOW THE 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN IN THE GOV\'S CROSSHAIRS AND 
THEIR PARTICIPATION WILL BE CRUCIAL.  THEY CERTAINLY 
DEMONSTRATED THEIR IMPORTANCE DURING THE APPEALS PROCESS. 
THE USE OF AN INNOVATIVE, UNTRIED COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR 
THIS PIVOTAL EVENT MERITS CLOSE ATTENTION ALSO.  ALTHOUGH THE 
PAPER BACK-UP IT EMPLOYS IS A RECOGNIZED SAFEGUARD, THE ROOM 
FOR MANIPULATION AND FRAUD IS AMPLE, AND THUS UNDERSCORES THE 
NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL OBESRVATION.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH SUMATE LEADERS 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) SUMATE leaders Maria Corina Machado and Alejandro 
Plaz were charged on June 10 and 11 respectively with 
conspiracy to \"destroy the republican form of government\" for 
accepting funds from the National Endowment for Democracy, 
but have not been detained. Plaz and Machado told the 
Ambassador and DCM June 8 that they feared they would be 
charged with treason and conspiracy and jailed when they 
appeared in court. Plaz asserted that the attempt to shut 
down SUMATE by arresting Machado and himself would fail as 
the organization is designed to operate in the face of 
repression. Machado and Plaz asked the Ambassador\'s advice on 
whether to go to jail, go into hiding, or seek asylum. The 
Ambassador discussed the options but declined to give 
specific advice on this issue, and talked about the best way 
the organization could go about informing the international 
community about their case. End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) SUMATE leader Maria Corina Machado was charged with 
conspiracy to destroy the republican form of government by a 
prosecutor June 10. Alejandro Plaz was similarly charged on 
June 11. The charges stem from funds the group SUMATE 
received from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) for 
voter education. Charges of treason were not filed against 
either, despite earlier indications. Neither had been taken 
into custody as of June 15. 
 
------------------------------------ 
SUMATE Leaders Expected to be Arrested 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador, DCM and PolOff (notetaker) met with 
Machado and Plaz June 8. Plaz reported that the only evidence 
in the prosecutor\'s file is the contract with NED, and a 
public accusation by President Chavez made on television 
February 15, 2004. Machado and Plaz told the Ambassador that 
they expected to be charged and perhaps arrested. 
 
4.  (C) Plaz told the Ambassador that the GOV would fail to 
shut SUMATE down. He explained that the organization drills 
for scenarios where offices are seized and leaders arrested. 
Machado pointed out that the GOV could not arrest 30,000 
people. She feared, however, that the case against them would 
effect operational efficiency, and intimidate people. Machado 
pointed out that the GOV claim that NED funded treasonous 
activities in Venezuela implicates the USG as well. 
 
----------------------- 
Ask Ambassador\'s Advice 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Machado told the Ambassador they were considering 
whether to accept imprisonment, go into hiding, or ask for 
asylum. Machado and Plaz reported that the situation was 
placing great strain on their families. Machado asked the 
Ambassador and DCM for their counsel. Though declining to 
give specific advice, the Ambassador noted that while going 
to prison would create an international scandal, the best 
Venezuelan prison is a nightmare and one could not in good 
conscience recommend that anyone go to prison. The DCM 
observed that politically the two would probably be of most 
value in prison, followed by exile, and then in hiding. 
 
6.  (C) Asked who he would recommend they talk to in the 
international community to bring attention to their case, the 
Ambassador recommended they speak with Amnesty International, 
the US Congress, and Moises Naim. He further suggested that 
they try to get in touch with representatives of the GOV\'s 
lobbyists in the US, Patton and Boggs, to try to get them to 
advise the GOV against pursuing the case. The DCM suggested 
talking to European Union missions. 
 
7.  (C) In a subsequent conversation the Canadian Ambassador 
told Ambassador Shapiro that he would gladly recommend both 
Plaz and Machado and their families for refugee status in 
Canada. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The case against SUMATE is purely political, as 
President Carter observed during the reparo process. It is 
designed to intimidate the most technically effective group 
in the opposition. SUMATE\'s talented and dedicated volunteers 
were critical to the success of the signature drive.  If the 
GOV were able to knock SUMATE out of commission by taking out 
the leadership, which is unlikely, as Machado and Plaz note, 
it would be a major blow to the opposition, and the recall 
effort. Machado and Plaz have handled the case intelligently, 
denying the courts a pretext to jail them. Machado and Plaz 
may still be arrested in the future, perhaps closer to the 
referendum, to confuse the opposition. A strong and immediate 
international reaction will be necessary to hold the GOV to 
democratic norms should this occur.

BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL. LONG PRE-TRIAL PERIODS OF DETENTION 
ARE NOT UNUSUAL IN VENEZUELA, DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS THE 
REFUSAL OF THE GN TO TRANSPORT DETAINEES. ASSUMING THAT THE 
OBJECT OF THE POLITICAL CASES CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IS TO 
INTIMIDATE OPPONENTS WITH THE PROSPECT OF LONG PERIODS IN 
JAIL, THE TACHIRA/MARTINEZ MODEL MAY BE APPLIED TO OTHER 
POLITICAL CASES IN THE FUTURE.

Classified By: Abelardo A. Arias, Political Counselor, for Reasons 1.4( 
b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The opposition is focusing all efforts toward a united 
front for the August 15 recall referendum.  Opposition 
leaders told the Ambassador in early June that they will wait 
to announce a candidate until after the referendum because 
the referendum is a Chavez/anti-Chavez vote.  The opposition 
is developing strategies to decide who would be the 
opposition\'s unified candidate in a presidential election 30 
days after the referendum, and how that candidate would be 
chosen.  They are considering three mechanisms to choose the 
candidate: polling, primary, or caucus.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
Meet the Candidates 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) When the GoV created the reparos process, there were 
splits within the opposition regarding the proper reaction. 
Primero Justica and Proyecto Venezuela voiced concerned about 
the validity of the reparos process, but then worked with the 
Democratic Coordinator (CD) in the reparos process.  After 
the success of the reparos, the opposition is united. 
Enrique Mendoza, Miranda state governor and strong opposition 
voice, supported the reparos process and has as a result 
improved his standing as a leading presidential candidate for 
the opposition.  AD leader Henry Ramos told the Ambassador on 
June 9 that he believes that the unified candidate will be 
Mendoza. 
 
3. (C) Henrique Salas Romer and Julio Borges are two other 
contenders to be the unified opposition candidate.  Salas\'s 
popularity and credibility suffered after he initially 
rejected the reparos process.  He has grudgingly backtracked 
and now is part of the united CD.  Salas, still a dissenting 
voice in the CD, told the Ambassador that although he was 
quoted as saying that the opposition\'s only focus now must be 
the referendum, he thinks that a unified candidate should be 
picked before August 15. Borges is still a prominent CD 
voice, but he is younger than the other contenders and is 
believed to be waiting for later opportunities. 
 
----------------------------- 
Election/Selection Procedures 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) If the opposition recalls President Chavez in the 
August 15 referendum, they will have one more challenge - a 
presidential election in 30 days.  Statements from GoV 
officials, including the Supreme Court, indicate that Chavez 
will be able to run in this election although it has not been 
officially determined.  Whether Chavez can run or not, the 
opposition\'s prospects are best if they can choose one 
candidate to run against him, thus avoiding splitting 
opposition votes between several candidates.  The process to 
choose the opposition unified candidate will determine the 
credibility and legitimacy of the opposition\'s bid to win the 
presidential election.  While the CD is debating the process 
now, it will wait until after the referendum to choose a 
unified candidate.  As Mendoza told the Ambassador on June 9, 
the CD views the referendum as a vote for or against Chavez. 
Presenting a candidate now could risk political divisions 
within the CD.  In addition, the opposition will not gain any 
political advantage by presenting one candidate now.  There 
appears to be no candidate at the moment who will be able to 
mobilize all opposition parties for the referendum.  After 
the August 15 referendum, the opposition plans to use the 
following week to enact its selection procedure. 
 
5. (C) Fernando Martinez Mottola (protect), a businessman and 
member of the opposition \"brain trust\" who is leading CD 
efforts to choose a unified candidate, described three 
 
procedural options - polling, primary, or caucus, to poloff 
on June 9.  Polling would be a \"poll of polls.\"  Four major 
polling companies in Venezuela would survey the country to 
find the top opposition candidate.  To address questions of 
legitimacy, the opposition would only use this strategy if 
one candidate clearly emerged in the next two months and if 
the results of the four polls provided a distinct candidate. 
Primaries would be a national vote to choose the opposition 
candidate.  The opposition could limit the voting to people 
who signed the petition for the recall referendum. However, 
to increase legitimacy, the opposition could allow all 
Venezuelans to vote for the opposition candidate (comparable 
to an American-style open primary).  A caucus process would 
invite 6,000 to 10,000 members of civil society to Caracas to 
select a candidate.  The participants would represent all 
sectors of society and be from all parts of Venezuela. 
 
6. (C) Martinez believes that the polling option will be 
suitable because one candidate will emerge over the next two 
months.  If a poll is not possible because there is no clear 
candidate, Martinez would support a primary because it will 
give credibility to the process and the operational capacity 
for voting should be available after the August 15 
referendum.  In all meetings with the Ambassador and poloffs, 
opposition leaders have highlighted the role of Sumate and 
its importance as a key coordinator in any referendum and 
election process.  See reftel on GoV efforts to harass Sumate 
and prosecute leadership on conspiracy charges. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The opposition\'s first priority right now is 
mobilizing people for the August 15 recall referendum.  While 
the CD is planning for a possible presidential election, it 
is not publicly talking about plans.  For the unified 
candidate selection process, the biggest challenge for the 
opposition is time.  If the opposition does not choose a 
candidate until after August 15, then the opposition has 30 
days to choose a candidate and campaign for that candidate. 
Credibility and legitimacy of the selection process is 
another key concern.  Whatever option is chosen, the process 
must be deemed credible to motivate Venezuelans to support 
the unified opposition candidate.

Classified By: AMB. CHARLES S. SHAPIRO. REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  On June 16, the Ambassador met with GOV Executive 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel.  Rangel stated that 
Chavez and his supporters would accept the results of any 
referendum and would act as a democratic opposition if they 
lost.  He said that the integrity of Venezuela\'s electoral 
institutions has been proven by events and challenged the 
opposition to commit in advance to accepting the results of a 
referendum if it loses.  The Ambassador stressed the 
importance of international observers to maintaining 
confidence in the electoral process; Rangel said that 
observers would be permitted but their presence would need to 
be \"regulated\" appropriately.  He asserted that Chavez\'s 
supporters were \"galvanized\" for the coming referendum while 
the opposition was in disarray.  He called for rebuilding the 
U.S.-Venezuelan bilateral relationship, highlighting 
excellent counter-narcotics cooperation.  The Ambassador said 
that, if, as has been discussed on a preliminary basis, 
Rangel\'s chief of staff visits Washington, he will be 
received appropriately.  However, he stressed, Chavez\'s 
personal attacks on President Bush have had a very negative 
effect.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
Referendum On Track 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On June 16, the Ambassador, accompanied by A/DCM, 
met with GOV Executive Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, 
who was accompanied by chief of staff Amb. Rene Arreaza. 
Rangel led off by offering President Chavez\'s greetings and 
best wishes for the Ambassador and his family.  The 
Ambassador thanked him and said that he now expected to 
remain in Venezuela through the August 15 recall referendum. 
He noted that President Chavez was now describing the 
referendum as \"an achievement of the revolution\" since it was 
enshrined in the Bolivarian Republic\'s constitution. 
 
3.  (C)  Rangel said that he looked forward to winning the 
\"ratification\" of Chavez\'s tenure in office, and that he 
hoped that following the victory, the opposition would accept 
the results.  If the opposition won, the current government 
would form a democratic opposition.  \"For fifty years, we 
were in opposition; we know how to do it,\"  he asserted, 
adding that the opposition, to judge by its behavior, did not 
know how to behave when it was out of power in a democracy. 
Rangel added that he wanted the opposition to state publicly 
that it would accept the results of the referendum, win or 
lose, but it had refused to do so thus far.  He would like to 
see a joint ceremony between the opposition and the 
government accepting the process\'s legitimacy. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Observers OK, But Must be Regulated 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The Ambassador responded that the possibility of 
alternation in power was essential to democracy, and 
established in the Bolivarian constitution.  The USG had made 
clear, including in statements from the Secretary, that it 
would accept the results of a fair and transparent process. 
However, the fact was that there was a great deal of 
skepticism on the opposition\'s part regarding the conduct of 
electoral institutions; for that reason international 
observers were crucial to maintaining a credible process. 
The Ambassador of the European Union had told him that the EU 
had a mandate to send up to 140 observers to Venezuela once 
it had received an invitation.  In response to Rangel\'s 
suggestion of a joint ceremony with the opposition blessing 
the electoral process, the Ambassador asked if there was any 
dialogue going on.  Rangel answered negatively, making clear 
that opposition acceptance beforehand of whatever outcome the 
referendum process produced was the pre-condition of any such 
 
dialogue.  The GOV, he added,  has been \"snakebitten\" by 
undemocratic opposition conduct in the past and is not going 
to talk to it without such a commitment on its part. 
(Comment:  The opposition has no reason to approve the 
conduct of the National Electoral Council ahead of time, and 
is not going to do so.  End comment.) 
 
5.  (C)  Rangel stated that the legitimacy of Venezuela\'s 
National Electoral Council had been validated by the 
successful conduct of the recall referendum and \"reparo\" 
process.  Observers would, he went on, be invited to the 
referendum; however, their presence needs to be \"regulated\" 
so that they are there as observers and not \"protagonists.\" 
He said that the National Electoral Council, not the GOV 
itself, would decide on such regulations; it was looking at 
how observation is structured in other Latin American 
countries such as Mexico. 
 
-------------------- 
Campaign Going Great 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Asked how he saw Chavez\'s effort to win the 
referendum going, Rangel said that the President\'s supporters 
were thoroughly \"galvanized,\" as shown by a recent massive 
rally.  The opposition (\"which is convinced that he is a 
dictator\") was caught off-guard by his acceptance of the 
referendum.  While leadership of the pro-Chavez \"Comando 
Maisanta\" campaign organization has been named, the 
opposition has yet to do the same. 
 
------------------- 
Bilateral Relations 
------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Rangel said that U.S.-Venezuela relationship needed 
to return to a more normal basis, and that the two countries 
had lots of work to do together.  He asked rhetorically how 
long Venezuela would have to put up with such things as the 
USG\'s recently released Trafficking in Persons Report which 
singled out Venezuela as a poor performer when there was no 
reason to think the situation here was any worse than it was 
in Colombia or Brazil which received better evaluations.  He 
also mentioned the declassification of a DOD report from 2002 
which alleged (apparently based on press accounts) that the 
GOV had been colluding with the FARC.  He noted that 
Venezuelan police had just conducted a massive drug seizure 
(six tons of cocaine), and said that the GOV wanted to 
continue cooperation in this area. 
 
8.  (C)  The Ambassador said that he appreciated 
counter-narcotics cooperation.  In terms of the overall 
bilateral relationship, President Chavez\'s evident decision 
to campaign against President Bush rather than the 
opposition, and his insulting personal remarks against him 
were very poorly received in Washington.  Rangel said that 
this is something \"that could be discussed.\"  The Ambassador 
said that there had been consideration of the suggestion that 
Rangel\'s chief of staff, Amb. Rene Arreaza, and MFA chief of 
staff Temir Porras come to Washington for discussions.  If 
the GOV chose to send them, they would be received at 
appropriately senior levels.  Rangel said that, while a final 
decision had not been made by President Chavez, there was \"a 
good disposition\" in this matter.  He also said that he was 
prepared to be helpful if the Ambassador and his staff were 
having difficulties meeting with appropriate GOV officials. 
 
--------------------------- 
More on Bilateral Relations 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Chief of Staff Arreaza later called the Ambassador 
to say that Rangel had liked the idea of broadening the 
international observation by inviting the EU and UNDP as well 
as the OAS and the Carter Center.  He added that at a June 13 
cabinet meeting (without Chavez) the consensus was that 
Chavez should stop attacking President Bush personally since 
these attacks were in fact helping the opposition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  Rangel, who can be caustic and contemptuous, was on 
his best behavior.  (This is the first time that a meeting 
between him and the Ambassador occurred at his initiative.) 
He seemed confident that Chavez could win the referendum 
process, derided the opposition as unprepared, and seemingly 
looked forward to the perceived opportunity that a Chavez 
victory in the recall referendum could give to reconstructing 
U.S.-Venezuelan relations on the GOV\'s terms  --  acceptance 
of the Bolivarian revolution and all its works.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The Chavez government appears to have made little 
progress on its alleged \"flagship\" issue - that of 
alleviating poverty, according to the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) office in Caracas.  There is no 
mechanism in place to track the results of its various ad hoc 
social welfare \"missions\" which in any event are only a year 
old for the most part.  Some of its programs, notably the 
\"Bolivarian Schools\" initiative, may indeed have value. 
Venezuela\'s slippage in terms of meeting the UN\'s Millenium 
Development Goals puts it in the \"high priority\" category. 
Even GOV poverty figures indicate deterioration, although the 
rate varies depending on what methodology is used.  The UNDP 
has briefed President Chavez on its findings; he reportedly 
expressed surprise and concern over the lack of good news, 
but we do not expect any policy change in the near future. 
End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Lots of Programs, Results Hard to Track 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On June 10, econcouns met with Claudia Jiminez_, 
Coordinator for Human Development at the Caracas office of 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).  Asked for her 
opinion of the range of \"missions\" (ad-hoc programs aimed at 
specific areas of social need, such as basic medical care, 
primary, secondary, and tertiary education, and unemployment) 
that the Chavez government has created, she was skeptical. 
Most of these projects have been mounted within the last 
year, and it is too soon to tell what there results are.  In 
any event, she added, such statistics as the GOV provides 
tend to be descriptive of the programs\' scope  -- how many 
students graduated, etc.  -- with little more information 
provided.  For example, with regard to the GOV\'s basic 
literacy campaign, \"Mision Robinson,\"  there is no way of 
knowing what the real level of literacy achieved for most of 
its graduate is.  For \"Mision Barrio Adentro\" (\"Inside the 
Slums\"), its medical care program using Cuban doctors, there 
is no monitoring of the overall health of the recipients of 
the services. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Jiminez_ was more positive about some of the GOV\'s 
education programs, particularly its \"Bolivarian Schools\" 
program, one of the Chavez government\'s first initiatives, 
which provides funding for certain designated schools to 
provide full (as opposed to half) day teaching schedules and 
makes school lunches available.  This program was in fact a 
reconstitution of earlier educational initiatives of the 
1960\'s which had been abandoned as Venezuela\'s economy 
declined and resources dried up.  Other more recent 
initiatives, such as such as \"Mission Rivas\" and \"Mision 
Sucre,\" high school and university scholarship programs, were 
more dubious.  She shared our impression that for the most 
part they were little more than transfer payments with little 
or no genuine study requirements.  However, she added, the 
GOV\'s own new \"Bolivarian University,\" established in an 
office complex belonging to state oil company PDVSA, however, 
appears to be real, with classes getting underway. 
 
--------------------------- 
A Crisis of \"High Priority\" 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Asked whether the UNDP\'s own statistics showed any 
important improvements in the living conditions of 
Venezuelans\' since Chavez took office in 1998, Jiminez_ said 
that the UNDP had been working directly with various 
ministries to obtain data regarding Venezuela\'s progress 
towards meeting the UN\'s \"Millenium Development Goals.\" 
(These goals, first identified in 1990, call for significant 
progress by 2015 in a range of areas including eradicating 
hunger and extreme poverty, reducing infant mortality, 
improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS and malaria, 
and guaranteeing environmental sustainability.)  The UNDP, 
she said, considered Venezuela to be to be a \"high priority\" 
country, which meant that it was either moving extremely 
slowly towards fulfilling these goals (or indeed moving 
backwards).  Decaying performance on poverty, nutrition, and 
education were Venezuela\'s principal weak points.  The high 
level of income inequality was considered to be an 
 
aggravating factor in Venezuela\'s poor performance. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Not Much Better by the GOV\'s Numbers 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU)  Jiminez_ provided econcouns with a statistical 
summary entitled \"Poverty Indicators, 2003,\" which had been 
briefed to her by Elias Eljuri, head of the GOV\'s National 
Statistical Institute (INE).  INE uses two ways to calculate 
poverty:  one simply based on purchasing power, and an 
alternative, basedon \"unmet basic needs.\"  By the former 
method, pverty had been on a slow decline from the first 
alf of 1998 through to the second half of 2001, when it rose 
again, through the first half of 2003 (the latest period for 
which figures are given), presumably as the economic crisis 
began to bite. 
 
% Population in Poverty     % in Extreme Poverty 
 
H1  1998      49.0           21.0 
H2  1998      43.9           17.1 
H1  1999      42.8           16.6 
H2  1999      42.0           16.9 
H1  2000      41.6           16.7 
H2  2000      40.4           14.9 
H1  2001      39.1           14.2 
H2  2001      39.0           14.0 
H1  2002      41.5           16.6 
H2  2002      48.6           21.0 
H1  2003      54.0           25.1 
 
6.  (SBU) By the GOV\'s own figures, therefore, the poverty 
rate in Venezuela has ended up somewhat worse than when it 
started when viewed in terms of income.  However, according 
to Jiminez_, the GOV gives more weight to measuring poverty in 
terms of \"unmet basic needs.\"  This looks at measures such as 
number of children between seven and twelve years of age who 
do not attend school, number of persons sharing bedrooms, 
adequacy of housing, number of households, the head of which 
has less than three years of schooling, and access to water 
and sewage.  By this measure the situation is a bit more 
stable (and comes in at lower levels), but again the trend 
shows no improvement.

7.  (SBU)  Jiminez_ suggested that the GOV preferred this 
latter series because (in addition to providing an overall 
lower rate), it was less sensitive to the damage done to the 
economy in 2002 and 2003.  This was the case because some of 
the indicators, such as availability of plumbing and sewage 
lines do not change quickly over time.  In Jiminez_\' view, 
however, the most pressing problem facing Venezuela\'s poor 
was their decreased purchasing power, which was captured by 
the first time series.  She noted that while for most of 
Chavez\'s term in office, the minimum wage kept pace with the 
increase in the price of a basic basket of foods, starting in 
the first half of 2002, a gap opened up, and by the second 
half of 2003, the minimum wage was 210,000 bolivars, while 
the food basket cost 255,000 bolivars. 
 
8.  (SBU)  It is worth noting that the Andres Bello Catholic 
University, which has a long-standing research program on 
poverty in Venezuela, using a methodology based on purchasing 
power, comes up with numbers that suggest an even more 
dramatic decay in living standards:

1998          56.5            21.4

Telling the Bad News to Hugo

9.  (C)  In early May, Antonio Molpeceres, head of the UNDP 
office in Venezuela, briefed President Chavez and his \"social 
cabinet\"  (Ministers of Planning, Health, Labor, Education, 
and Environment) on their findings.  As he recounted the 
meeting to the Ambassador, Chavez was very attentive, and 
seemingly surprised to find the persistently poor 
performance.  Cabinet members rushed to blame the problems on 
opposition \"sabotage\" of the economy in the December 
2002-January 2003 general strike.  However, Chavez cut them 
short, noting that the figures indicated deterioration which 
predated those events.  In her discussion with econcouns, 
Jiminez_ said that her impression was that the different 
ministries took seriously UNDP\'s analysis and valued their 
relationship with it and United Nations system organizations 
generally, but she could not point to any specific course 
corrections that were contemplated.  Molpeceres (who has 
departed to take up a new posting in La Paz) told the 
Ambassador that President Chavez simply does not understand 
the positive correlation between the general health of the 
economy and social indicators. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  The decline in Venezuela\'s social indicators under 
Chavez is a continuation of a long-term decline, which his 
government has failed to reverse.  Three of the six years 
1998-2003 were marked by shrinkage in the economy. 
Inflation, which ran at 29.9 pct in 1998, was running at 27.1 
pct in 2003.  Unemployment, 11.0 pct in 1998, ran at 16.8 pct 
in 2003, while underemployment, which ran at 49.8 pct in 
1998, ran at 52.7 in 2003.  An index of basic food 
consumption (giving 1995 as 100) came in at 84 pct in 1998, 
and dropped to 75 pct for 2003.  In fairness to Chavez, the 
general strike made 2003 an especially dismal year; 2004 is 
going to see a (statistically at least) important rebound. 
Exchange controls which keep interest rates low and money 
inside the country, combined with wide open fiscal policy are 
likely to increase the \"feel good\" factor.  The various 
social welfare \"missions\" will continue to be relentlessly 
publicized, whatever their real world impact may be.  But for 
Venezuela\'s millions of poor people, life is harder than it 
was when Chavez took office.  As Chavez heads into the 
referendum on his tenure in office, the UNDP\'s briefing 
cannot have been be very comforting for him.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  The May 9 discovery of alleged Colombian paramilitaries, 
replaced in national headlines by the appeals process and the 
announcement of the recall referendum, remains a salient 
issue.  The National Assembly has convened special 
investigative commission, which has already interviewed the 
Minister of Defense and has plans to interview several other 
high-ranking government officials.  The GOV has also issued 
detention orders for four senior military officers for 
alleged connections to the paramilitaries case.  Ten military 
officers and civilians have already been detained for alleged 
connections to the paramilitaries, and trials begin for first 
cases in the next two weeks.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The National Assembly (NA) has convened a Special 
Parliamentary Commission to investigate the case of the 
alleged Colombian paramilitaries discovered on the outskirts 
of Caracas on May 9.  The NA appointed Nestor Leon Heredia, a 
Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR) deputy and former military 
officer, as president of the Commission.  On June 7, the 
Commission \"privately\" interviewed Minister of Defense Jorge 
Luis Garcia Carneiro.  The Commission plans to conduct 
additional interviews with Minister of Interior and Justice 
Lucas Rincon and Army Commander Gen. Raul Baduel, as well as 
the directors of DISIP (security police) and the Directorate 
of Military Intelligence (DIM). 
 
---------------------- 
TARGETING THE MILITARY 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  As of June 1, the GOV had issued detention orders 
for four retired military officers in connection with the 
paramilitaries case; Gen. Nestor Gonzalez Gonzalez, Gen. 
Felipe Rodriguez, Gen. Ovido Poggioli and Col. Julio 
Rodriguez Salas.  On June 6, the GOV publicly offered a 
reward of twenty-five thousand dollar for information leading 
to the arrest of each of the four military officers.  In 
addition to links to the paramilitaries, the reward 
advertisements allege three of the officers are guilty of 
&military rebellion,8 a reference to their involvement in 
the October 2002 civil disobedience at Plaza Francia. 
 
4.  (U)  On June 8, Gen. Ovido Poggioli, a former director of 
the DIM, voluntarily presented himself to the Military 
Prosecutor,s Office, claiming that he had nothing to fear 
from the government,s accusations.  DISIP took Poggioli in 
custody for forty-eight hours following his appearance at the 
Military Prosecutor,s Office.  He is currently being held at 
a military detention center in Caracas. 
 
5.  (C) On June 14, poloff met with Alonso Medina, a defense 
lawyer specializing in military cases.  In addition to 
Poggioli, according to Medina, seven military officers and 
three civilians have been detained for alleged involvement in 
the paramilitaries case.  Medina noted that the first 
paramilitary involvement cases are scheduled to go to trial 
in the next two weeks. 
 
---------------------------- 
MORE PARAMILITARIES TO COME? 
---------------------------- 
 
(U)  On June 14, Eliecer Otaiza, MVR party figure and former 
director of DISIP, also currently president of the National 
Institute of Educational Cooperation, alleged that the 
paramilitaries detained at El Hatillo merely represent the 
&tip of the iceberg8 and that there are between four and 
five thousand paramilitaries currently in Venezuela.  Otaiza 
 
repeated the assertion that these alleged paramilitaries are 
seeking to assassinate President Chavez and other political 
leaders, and are a threat to Venezuelan sovereignty, the 
democratic process and the Bolivarian revolution. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
(C)  The targeting of numerous military officers for alleged 
connections to the paramilitaries case is part of an 
increased GOV campaign to persecute military officers it 
considers disloyal, including officers connected with the 
October 2002 Plaza Francia incident and the events of April 
2002.  Allegations that there are between four and five 
thousand additional paramilitaries currently in Venezuela, 
however implausible, could produce a new set of the 
distractions for the GOV to use in the period leading up to 
the referendum.  The commencement of trials in the next two 
weeks will provide insight into how the GOV plans to use the 
paramilitaries issue.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The Bolivar state appeals court June 7 ordered four 
National Guardsmen be detained pending trial for murder. The 
four are suspected of executing seven prisoners and wounding 
200 in the Vista Hermosa prison November 10, 2003. A lower 
court had set the four free March 9, 2004. The case is being 
pursued by prosecutors and the prison rights group 
Observatorio Venezuelano de Prisiones. End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Vista Hermosa Massacre 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Bolivar state appeals court June 7 ordered four 
National Guardsmen be detained pending trial for murder. The 
four are suspected of executing seven prisoners, and wounding 
200 in the Vista Hermosa prison, located in Bolivar state, 
November 10, 2003. The appeals court decision overturns the 
ruling of the local judge, who had freed the four men after 
rejecting the eye witness testimony of 20 inmates. The judge 
argued that the testimony of the prisoners was inherently 
unreliable. Humberto Prado of the prison rights group 
Observatorio Venezuelano de Prisiones (OVP), told PolOff June 
16 that the local judge\'s decision was, \"A license for (the 
National Guard - GN) to kill in the prisons.\" OVP is pursuing 
the case together with the prosecutor\'s office. 
 
3.  (C) Prado said the origin of the massacre was a prison 
uprising in August 2003, in which prisoners took some of 
their family members hostage, demanding improved prison 
conditions. Prado stated that there is prisoner testimony 
that GN Cap. William Jose Campos, in charge of the guard 
detachment, pointed a gun at the head of one of the leaders 
of the uprising, and threatened to kill him when the uprising 
was over. Following this the prosecutors\' office requested 
that the GN remove Campos from prison duty, which it did. 
 
4.  (C) On November 10, 2003, however, Campos reappeared at 
the prison and had the prisoners line up outside to be 
searched. According to Prado, all the prisoners were then 
brutally beaten (PolOff saw pictures) by the four National 
Guardsmen now being charged together with three prison guards 
employed by the Ministry of Interior and Justice (MIJ) (Note: 
The MIJ is responsible for interior security in prisons, 
while the GN is responsible for perimeter security only.) The 
names of seven men were then called out. They included five 
leaders of the August uprising, and two prisoners who had 
committed crimes against members of the GN (murder and 
robbery respectively). The seven men were then shot in the 
head. Prado states that forensic evidence shows all seven 
wounds have a descending trajectory, indicating execution. 
There are also 20 testimonies of witnesses which corroborate 
this version. Alonso Medina Roa, the defense lawyer for the 
National Guardsmen, told PolOff June 14 that while some of 
the prisoners may have been killed by the National Guard, 
some were killed by the prison guards working for the MIJ, 
and some by the prisoners themselves. 
 
5.  (U) GN Gen. Alberto Betancourt Nieves, commander of GN 
forces in the region, rejected the appeals court\'s decision 
to detain the four National Guardsmen June 8, and questioned 
the professionalism of the judges and prosecutors involved in 
the case. He told reporters that, \"For any National Guardsman 
service in prisons is the most detestable thing in his 
professional career, and so we are not going to act violently 
against something that is unworthy.\" He further stated, \"We 
are not going to make a big deal about murderers, drug 
dealers, thieves, and the victimizers of the community, whom 
no one wants, we are not going to dirty ourselves with 
something that is not worth it, and that represents such 
insignificant beings.\" 
 
------- 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) The attitude of Gen. Betancourt Nieves is shared by 
many in the criminal justice system. GN and MIJ guards do, 
however, \"dirty themselves\" inside prison walls, frequently 
trafficking guns, drugs and other contraband. The shocking 
barbarity of this case is perhaps outdone by the impunity 
that had up to now been shown to the National Guardsmen. The 
prosecutors and judges in this case, together with OVP, are 
trying to force the penal system to come to terms with the 
brutal nature of the prisons, and to stand up for the rule of 
law. Given the relatively non-political nature of the case, 
it will be an interesting test of the willingness of the GOV 
to allow judges and prosecutors to act independently against 
violations of human rights, and to protect and respect the 
work of NGOs.

1  (C) A Caracas prosecutor has called Juan Fernandez, leader 
of Gente de Petroleo (anti-Chavez group composed of fired

unspecified charges relating to the 2002 national strike. 
Victor Ferreres, president of Venevision testified June 15 
about the weapons found by the DISIP (Political Police) on a 
Venevision property June 12, which prosecutors are trying to 
tie to the paramilitary case. Prosecutors have also called 
Leonardo Carvajal of the education NGO Asamblea de Educacion 
to testify on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the 
government for receiving funds from the National Endowment 
for Democracy. DISIP agents also visited the leader of a 
human rights NGO that was recently had a grant approved from 
the US Agency for International Development, seeking 
information about the funding of his organization. End Summary 
 
-------------- 
Juan Fernandez 
-------------- 
 
2.  (U) A Caracas prosecutor informed Juan Fernandez, leader 
of Gente de Petroleo(anti-Chavez group composed of fired 
PDVSA employees) and member of the G-5 (a group of senior 
opposition figures), that he was a suspect in an 
investigation involving the national strike in 2002. 
Fernandez is due to testify on June 17. The prosecutor is the 
same one who sought to detain Fernandez and other 
ex-officials of PDVSA last year on charges of treason for 
their role as leaders of the national strike in 2002. At that 
time a Caracas appeals court rejected the arrest warrant 
issued by a lower court. According to newspaper reports, the 
evidence in the case consists of hundreds of pictures of 
empty gas stations, and technical reports of accidents at 
PDVSA installations, but no proof of the individual 
responsibility of any of the strike leaders in any alleged 
acts of sabotage. 
 
---------- 
Venevision 
---------- 
 
3.  (U) Victor Ferreres, president of Venevision, testified 
as a witness in the military court investigating the case of 
alleged Colombian paramilitaries captured May 9 outside 
Caracas. This followed the discovery by DISIP (Political 
Police) agents of some old firearms on a property leased by 
Venevision. Ferreres told reporters that he was satisfied 
with the way the testimony went, and was confident the case 
would be resolved satisfactorily. 
 
-------------------- 
NED and AID Grantees 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Caracas prosecutors have also called Leonardo 
Carvajal, member of the educational reform NGO Asamblea de 
Educacion, to testify about funding his group received from 
the National Endowment for Democracy. The investigation is 
reportedly similar to the process against SUMATE, involving 
charges of conspiracy against the GOV. DISIP agents 
questioned Carlos Alberto Nieto Palma June 6. Nieto is the 
head of Una Ventana a la Libertad, a human rights group, 
which just had a grant approved from the US Agency for 
International Development. Nieto told PAS FSN June 11 that 
the agents arrived at his home without a court order. They 
questioned him about his work defending alleged victims of 
torture at the hands of Venezuelan security services, and 
about receiving funds from the USG. Nieto reports the agents 
then asked him questions about his family and work, which he 
took to be warnings that the DISIP knew his movements and 
those of his family. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) The GOV is ramping up a judicial offensive by 
reopening the case against Fernandez at the same time there 
is a case against SUMATE and a widening paramilitary 
investigation. Precedent shows that these cases may lead to 
detentions with relatively little evidence, which may in turn 
leave political leaders out of action for long periods of 
time. The opening of an investigation against Asamblea de 
Educacion gives cover to the SUMATE case, by arguing that the 
cases really are for violation of funding rules, and not 
political intimidation. The visit to Nieto, who heads a 
respected human rights NGO, indicates a more aggressive 
posture by DISIP, intended to intimidate groups who are 
monitoring the actions of Venezuelan security forces.

Summary

1. (C) A Supreme Court (TSJ) decision on June 8 determined 
that a recalled Chavez may run for president in 2006, but 
left unclear whether he may participate in presidential 
election 30 days after the recall vote.  The National 
Electoral Council (CNE) on June 15 approved the question for 
the recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez planned 
for August 15.  The question does not use the constitutional 
language of a \"recall,\" but rather asks voters whether they 
agree to invalidate Chavez\'s \"legitimate and democratic\" 
mandate.  Despite the ambiguities of the TSJ\'s decision, we 
assume Chavez will indeed be allowed to run in the subsequent 
elections if recalled.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
TSJ Lets Chavez Run Again, Maybe 
 
SIPDIS 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme 
Court (TSJ) issued a decision June 15 that said a recalled 
Chavez may run in the 2006 presidential elections, but left 
unclear whether he would be permitted to run in the elections 
to be held 30 days after the August 15 referendum in the 
event he is recalled.  The case arose from a constitutional 
provision (art. 198) that prohibits National Assembly 
deputies who are recalled from running for the next full 
term.  The decision, which was approved three-to-two by the 
pro-Chavez majority of the Constitutional Chamber, said this 
prohibition did not apply to the President.  Dissenting 
opinions from two opposition magistrates criticized the 
decision for being silent on the pertinent question of 
whether Chavez can be re-elected just after being recalled. 
The dissenting justices argued that to permit a recalled 
official to run immediately for the same office effectively 
nullified the referendum process. 
 
3. (U) Constitutional lawyers offered an array of 
interpretations.  Tulio Alvarez said it was clear the Court 
had said Chavez would be \"definitively separated\" from his 
office for his current term.  Alvarez concluded from this 
that Chavez may not run again.  Esteban Gerbasi, the lawyer 
who filed the original petition with the TSJ and member of 
the opposition party Un Solo Pueblo, said the decision 
requires clarification, which he said he intends to request. 
Academic Rafael Chavero told reporters the Constitutional 
Chamber could easily have clarified the decision with \"two 
more lines,\" and had apparently decided not to resolve the 
issue. 
 
------------------------- 
CNE Approves The Question 
------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) board approved 
June 15 the formulation of the question to be asked for the 
August 15 recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez. 
The question was approved three-to-two by the pro-Chavez 
majority of the CNE board.  Although the 1999 Constitution 
uses the term \"revoke\" when referring to the referendum, the 
CNE opted instead to ask:  \"Are you in agreement with 
invalidating the popular mandate granted to Citizen Hugo 
Rafael Chavez Frias via democratic and legitimate elections 
as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for 
the current presidential term?  Option 1:  No, Option 2: 
Yes.\"  Rodriguez told reporters the board chose a question 
that was sufficiently clear, that could be answered with a 
\"yes\" or \"no,\" and \"had the effect of revoking the mandate\" 
of the official. 
 
5. (U) Reaction to the question was subdued.  Coordinadora 
Democratica (CD) negotiator Felipe Mujica said the question 
was \"badly formulated\" but left the opposition with the \"yes\" 
option it has used as a symbol for more than a year.  Mujica 
 
said the question was not important, noting that \"Venezuelans 
are not idiots\" and would understand how to vote.  Fellow 
opposition negotiator Alberto Quiros Corradi called the CNE\'s 
phrasing \"childish\" and denied it would have any effect on 
the process. 
 
--------------------- 
CNE Releases Timeline 
--------------------- 
 
6. (U) The CNE released on June 16 the timeline for the 
presidential referendum.  The timeline sets the public 
campaign period for July 16 - August 14, though both sides 
arguably are already engaged in politicking.  The electoral 
registry will be closed on July 10.  International observers 
will be registered August 11-13, according to the timeline. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The anti-Chavez legal experts are putting their best 
spin on the TSJ decision by saying that a recalled Chavez 
cannot run until 2006.  No matter how compelling logic and 
the legal arguments may be, however, there has been a general 
assumption in the political arena that Chavez would, in fact, 
be able to run again immediately if recalled.  TSJ President 
Ivan Rincon made that clear to the Ambassador in late 2003. 
Not to permit Chavez to run again would practically guarantee 
a win by the opposition candidate.  It is unlikely Chavez 
would allow a Court decision to bench him for (at least) two 
years.  And, in light of Chavez\'s control over the 
Constitutional Chamber, any clarifications the TSJ may be 
compelled to make will no doubt tip to his favor.  The only 
plausible scenario in which Chavez does not run after a 
referendum defeat would be if the referendum were to produce 
an overwhelming rejection of him by the Venezuelan people -- 
a political rather than a legal defeat.

1. (C)  A \"brain trust\" of informal consultants is working 
with the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) to develop a 
post-Chavez governance plan to help convince Venezuelans to 
vote against President Hugo Chavez in the August 15 recall 
referendum.  Fernando Martinez Mottola, a consultant for the 
CD, said the plan, which includes the key issues of 
employment, personal security, health, education, and social 
security will create a basic framework and a set of 
objectives for an opposition-led government.  Opposition 
leaders told the Ambassador on June 16 that this governance 
plan will serve as the Coordinadora Democratica\'s (CD) 
substantive agenda for the referendum campaign.  Martinez 
said plan would be ready by June 25, but it would not be a 
major component of the campaign until some technical issues 
(i.e. automation, observers) are resolved.  Given the diverse 
composition of the opposition, it will be a challenge to

broad strategic plan for a post-Chavez, opposition-led 
government.  The plan will include themes such as employment, 
personal security, health, education, and social security. In 
addition, the plan will address four central themes: 
reconciliation, decentralization, continuity of democracy, 
and social issues. 
 
3. (C) The political diversity of the opposition will not 
permit a detailed document, said Martinez, but rather broad 
guiding principles aimed at alleviating Venezuela\'s social 
problems, improving economic policy, and re-establishing 
institutional integrity.  Martinez said that the CD hopes to 
provide potential voters with a governance plan that 
incorporates ideas from previous opposition-affiliated plans. 
 Various transition plans have already been offered by Gente 
de Petroleo, economist Gerver Torres, academics at Andres 
Bello Catholic University, and a special CD committee. 
 
-------------------- 
Timing is Everything 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Martinez said the CD would not present its governance 
plan until technical referendum issues, such as automation 
and international observers, are resolved.  Martinez said the 
opposition must also attack Chavez effectively on social 
issues as part of its presentation.  He predicted the CD 
would not be ready to release the governance plan until a few 
weeks before the referendum.  (Separately, Martinez told the 
Ambassador June 16 the plan would be ready by June 25.)

Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The opposition needs to maintain its unity above all 
and avoid fractious debates over transition plans.  But 
developing a common substantive agenda is a necessary 
component of its overall recall referendum campaign.  Finding 
a balance between satisfying its diverse composition and 
delivering a credible, meaningful message to the electorate 
remains the challenge for the opposition. 
 
6.  (C) At a June 16 luncheon hosted by the Ambassador, 
opposition heavy weights Alberto Quiroz, Teodoro Petkoft and 
Pompeyo Marquez insisted that for the referendum, the heart 
of the opposition\'s message would be negative - Chavez has 
failed. Within that message special attention would be given 
to the theme of the Chavez government\'s corruption. This 
message in any event is one the whole opposition can agree 
upon.

1. (U) NUMEROUS GOV OFFICIALS RESPONDED WITH INDIGNATION AND 
CONDEMNATION TOWARD THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S 2004 TRAFFICKING 
IN PERSONS (TIP) REPORT, WHICH LISTED VENEZUELA AS A TIER 3 
COUNTRY.  THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ACCUSED THE U.S. OF SERIOUS 
TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF ITS OWN.  GOV AND 
PRO-GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ASSAILED THE REPORT AS PART OF A USG 
ANTI-CHAVEZ CAMPAIGN IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE AGUUST 15 
REFERENDUM.  WHILE THE REACTION WAS FORCEFUL, IT WAS SOON 
OVERTAKEN BY THE RELEASE OF THE JUNE 17 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH 
REPORT ON THE POLITICIZATION OF VENEZUELA\'S JUDICIARY. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
GOV CONDEMNS, DENIES, AND ACCUSES 
--------------------------------- 
 
    2. (U) GOV OFFICIALS AND MEDIA SOURCES CONDEMNED THE 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP) REPORT, CHALLENGED ITS 
LEGITIMACY, AND ACCUSED THE USG OF USING THE REPORT IN ITS 
\"DIRTY WAR\" TO UNSEAT PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  ON A 
STATE-SUPPORTED NEWS WEBSITE, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDED 
TO THE TIP REPORT WITH A PRESS STATEMENT CLAIMING THAT \"THE 
U.S. IS THE LARGEST TRAFFICKER IN PERSONS.\"  THE RESPONSE 
ACCUSED THE U.S. OF TRAFFICKING LATIN AMERICAN CHILDREN FOR 
PROSTITUTION AND AGRICULTURAL LABOR, NOT SIGNING 
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES PROTECTING CHILDREN\'S RIGHTS (E.G. UN 
CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD), AND PRODUCING THE 
LARGEST AMOUNT OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.  BERNARDO ALVAREZ, 
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S., SAID THAT VENEZUELA WOULD NOT 
ACCEPT THE USG\'S SELF-APPOINTED ROLE AS GLOBAL JUDGE OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS. 
 
3. (U) DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER AREVALO MENDEZ ACCUSED THE USG 
OF USING THE TIP REPORT TO UNSEAT PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ. 
MENDEZ SAID THAT THE REPORT IS THE WORK OF THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND CIA, WHO RELEASED THE REPORT TO \"PREJUDICE OUR 
COUNTRY, IN ITS ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE AUGUST 15 
REFERENDUM.\"  MENDEZ DESCRIBED THE REPORT AS AN AGGRESSION 
TOWARD CHAVEZ AND THE GOV, LIKENING IT TO THE USG\'S ALLEGED 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE EVENTS OF APRIL 11, 2002.  MENDEZ FUMED 
THAT THE \"INSANITY OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT HAS REACHED AN EXTREME.\" 
 
4. (U) TAREK WILLIAM SAAB, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY\'S FOREIGN POLICY COMMITTEE, COMMENTED ON THE HIGH 
U.S. PROSTITUTION RATE, PARTICULARLY CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, BUT 
DIRECTED MUCH OF HIS CRITICISM TOWARD THE USG PLOT TO REMOVE 
    CHAVEZ.  SAAB DESCRIBED THE TIP REPORT AS PART OF AN OPEN, 
HOSTILE USG CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO \"DISTORT THE VENEZUELAN 
REALITY AND FACILITATE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL RESOLUTION.\"  SAAB 
STATED THAT THE USG \"WANTS TO USE AND MANIPULATE A TOPIC AS 
SENSITIVE AS THIS TO CONDUCT A DIRTY WAR AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
REFERENDUM PROCESS.\" 
 
5. (C) VICE PRESIDENT JOSE VINCENTE RANGEL ALSO RAISED THE 
ISSUE WITH THE AMBASSADOR IN THEIR MEETING ON JUNE 16 (SEE 
REFTEL).  RANGEL CITED THE TIP REPORT AND ASKED RHETORICALLY 
HOW LONG USG ATTACKS ON THE GOV WILL CONTINUE, DIRECTLY 
CITING THE TIP REPORT.  RANGEL COMPARED VENEZUELA\'S 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS\' SITUATION TO COLOMBIA AND BRAZIL, WHO 
RECEIVED BETTER RATINGS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) FOGADE (Banking Protection Guarantee Fund, 
FDIC-equivalent) President Jesus Caldera Infante proposed 
raising the assessment (paid by banks) on all bank account 
deposits from 0.5% to 2.0%.  Industry experts say that this 
will force up interest rates, though Caldera disagrees.  With 
the extra income, he proposed that 30% of FOGADE\'s income be 
designated for spending on social needs, and announced that 
several employees have been fired for not being supportive of 
social development.  A fired employee says the dismissal was 
solely for signing the presidential recall petition.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
FOGADE OFFERS FUNDS FOR SOCIAL SPENDING, FIRES EMPLOYEES 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (U) Jesus Caldera Infante, former appeals court judge and 
President of FOGADE since May 7, testified before the Finance 
Committee of the National Assembly on June 14 and proposed 
that his institution take on a more activist role in social 
development within Venezuela.  He suggested spending 30% of 
its income on social needs, and also to quadruple the deposit 
assessment (a quarterly premium on all new banking deposits, 
to help guarantee funds in bank accounts) - from 0.5% to 2% - 
to earn more money for that end.  He intends that the money 
\"be designated to the ends and commitments of the State: 
health, education, housing, educational quality of life, 
encouragement of social and productive work, popular 
alternative economy, the creation of culture, and to perform 
teaching and academic exercises so that Venezuelans in the 
informal economy and who not deposit or save in the financial 
system do so.\"  Caldera, during his testimony, cited his 
interpretation of the Venezuelan Constitution, the 
Inter-American Human Rights Convention and the International 
Pact on Social Rights (apparently the UN International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), and stated 
that they should have precedence over the existing Banking 
Law. 
 
3. (U) Caldera also stated that FOGADE had fired a number of 
people, but did not specify how many, saying only that \"We 
have removed 80% of the previous structure,\" apparently 
meaning management.  He blamed the fired managers for 
\"dragging along a culture not consistent with the project 
laid out in the Constitution for the social development of 
the nation.\"  Caldera also requested greater autonomy for 
FOGADE, but also for more authority in the presidency. 
Finally, he discussed the recent donation by FOGADE of over 
300 pieces of real property (acquired following the 1994-5 
banking failures) to \"Mision Vuelvan Caras,\" a GOV 
anti-unemployment project, claiming that writing them off as 
a loss was not harmful to Venezuela. 
 
----------------------- 
PRIVATE SECTOR RESPONDS 
----------------------- 
 
4. (U) Caldera gave assurances, based on an internal study, 
that the measures would not cause interest rates to rise, as 
had happened in the past when premiums have been hiked.  The 
study took less than a month, and he justified such speed by 
the \"revolutionary and bolivarian management\" by 
characterizing them as \"qualified and very expert.\"  National 
Banking Association (ABV) President Aristides Maza, also in 
Finance Committee testimony, countered that lending interest 
rates would rise 2% as a direct result of the premium 
increase.  \"As the policy of everyone, both the public and 
private sectors, is to lower the lending rate, then this 
proposal seems incongruous.\" 
 
5. (C) Caldera asserted that the banking sector \"is 
unqualified for public service, that is, the collective 
interest is tended by a private entity,\" therefore FOGADE 
should act in its stead to force a public service role upon 
 
it.  Maza disputed this idea, and said the role of FOGADE is 
to protect the public interest by managing their assets. 
Maza warned that \"one cannot define the financial sector as a 
public service given that it is a mercantile activity.\" 
Oscar Carvallo, head economist of the ABV, privately told 
econoff that banking as a public service is \"an aberration,\" 
given that banks must discriminate (by choosing to whom to 
loan money) in order to survive.  He also believes that this 
theme of public service is the beginning of a plan to place 
additional requirements on banks.  That may have begun, as 
the GOV just required all banks to provide restrooms to their 
clients, and has recently discussed publicly the idea of 
setting banks\' working hours.  Carvallo suggested that the 
GOV is placing laws and \"justice\" (its own definition of it, 
that is) on equal footing, and applying the one which is more 
expeditious at the moment. 
 
6. (SBU) One of the fired FOGADE employees, Anna Kosa (a 
former Embassy employee), spoke publicly about the firings, 
calling them politically motivated.  She stated that 50 
people had been released, all of whom had signed the 
presidential referendum petition.  This followed a list 
published by members of Bolivarian Circles, listing all 
FOGADE employees and their perceived political allegiance, as 
well as harassing phone calls and notes.  She stated that her 
dismissal letter, signed by Caldera, gave no reason for the 
termination. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) Caldera, newly named to the job, may have been 
posturing for the Congress (and the cameras).  Nonetheless, 
this proposal represents yet another effort to divert state 
institutions away from their primary mission and turn them 
into piggy banks for the social \"revolution.\"  Though the 
amount of money involved (at 30% of current budget, FOGADE 
would only have $42 million for social projects) pales in 
comparison to the PDVSA social fund (see ref), it amounts to 
a disguised tax increase on the banking sector, which would 
inevitably be passed on to consumers who already pay a 0.5% 
tax on all withdrawals.  It also raises the issue of 
decapitalizing FOGADE at a time in which several small 
domestically-owned banks are considered to be fairly wobbly. 
If they go under and FOGADE\'s resources have been diverted to 
social (read: electoral) spending, any bailout of depositors 
would be that much more difficult.

) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) On June 17, Political officers met with Felipe Mujica, 
President of Movimiento a Socialismo (MAS) and one of the 
leading Coordinadora Democratica (CD) negotiators with the 
National Electoral Council (CNE).  Mujica outlined what he 
thought should be the CD\'s campaign strategy for the 
presidential recall referendum.  He largely dismissed 
concerns about the automated voting process and laid out what 
he thought were the lessons learned from the failed Comando 
Ayacucho.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
How to win the recall 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Mujica said that the CD is trying to overcome 
infighting to select its campaign command, which would 
consist of 13 to 15 members.  He warned that any effort by 
the CD to run on an anti-corruption platform would backfire, 
given the corruption of previous governments.  Instead, the 
MAS President is encouraging the opposition to focus on 
Chavez\'s failures, particularly the deteriorating economic 
conditions of many Venezuelans.  In addition, he believed 
that a plan that focuses on unity, peace, and the resolution 
of the political conflict would appeal to much of the public, 
which is tired of the ongoing crisis.  Mujica pointed to the 
success the Chilean opposition had in using a similar 
strategy to defeat Pinochet. 
 
3.  (C)  The MAS President noted that the CD is still 
developing its strategy, but was confident that the CD is on 
track.  He also said that it would be clear by July 30 how 
the referendum would come out. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Not too worried about recent CNE decisions 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  Mujica again dismissed any concerns that the wording 
of the recall question would benefit Chavez, repeating that 
\"We Venezuelans are not idiots\" and can properly read the 
recall question.  In regards to the automated voting system, 
which has caused much angst within the opposition movement, 
the MAS President warned that a manual system would also have 
been vulnerable to tampering.  Mujica acknowledged that the 
CD must negotiate as much control and supervision over the 
voting and tabulating process as possible.  He appeared 
confident that the CD\'s computer experts, particularly in 
SUMATE, would strengthen the opposition\'s ability to properly 
monitor the automated system. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Chavistas afraid of telling the truth 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Mujica claimed the Chavistas\' unwillingness to tell 
Chavez the truth contributed to the failure of the Comando 
Ayacucho in the signature appeals process.  According to 
Mujica, Comando Ayacucho members were afraid to admit to 
Chavez that they were not going to be able to get enough 
people to recant their signatures in order to prevent a 
recall referendum vote.  He also claimed that membership in 
the new Comando Maisanta is based solely on loyalty to 
Chavez. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  Mujica\'s thinking tracks with polls that suggest the 
opposition\'s ideal themes are reconciliation and 
 
re-unification of Venezuela.  The opposition still faces an 
uphill battle and is hampered by its slow internal 
deliberations to select campaign leadership.  As the recall 
vote approaches, the CD leadership will likely face 
increasing pressure to not only demonstrate Chavez\'s 
failures, but offer a viable alternative to the current 
government.

Classified By: A/POLITICAL COUNSELOR MARK WELLS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human 
Rights Watch, released a report in Caracas June 17 strongly 
criticizing Venezuela\'s new Supreme Court law, and calling 
for implementation of the OAS Democratic Charter if the 
Venezuelan authorities did not act to preserve the balance of 
powers. The GOV reacted harshly to Vivanco\'s statements, 
accusing him of being a US agent, and the National Assembly 
threatened to declare Vivanco \"persona non grata.\" Vivanco 
later met with the Charge, and discussed the possibility of 
the OAS taking action against Venezuela. End Summary 
 
---------- 
HRW on TSJ 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human 
Rights Watch, released a report in Caracas on June 17 about 
the Venzuelan justice system called \"Rigging the Rule of 
Law.\" The report strongly criticizes the politicization of 
the justice system, and the potentially negative effects of 
the new Organic Law of the Supreme Court (TSJ). The report 
discusses those aspects of the law which HRW alleges will 
erode judicial independence. These include: 
 
-- the naming of 12 more TSJ judges by simple majority vote 
in the National Assembly (NA), which the report calls \"court 
packing\"; 
 
-- the power given to the Moral Council (Attorney General, 
Controller General, Human Rights Ombudsman acting together) 
to suspend TSJ judges for \"grave offenses\"; and 
 
-- the right of the NA to annul appointments of TSJ judges 
under certain circumstances. The report argues that these 
potential effects are more serious because of the TSJ\'s role 
as administrator of the lower courts. 
 
3.  (U) The report also criticizes a series of past problems 
in the justice system, including: 
 
-- the prevalence of untenured judges, hired and fired at 
will by the Judicial Committee of the Supreme Court; 
 
-- the politicization of judicial decisions by supporters of 
President Chavez in the judicial system; 
 
-- the cancellation of a system of exams whereby judges 
gained permanent positions; and 
 
-- the failure of the Supreme Court to review the decision to 
shut down Venezuela\'s second highest court and remove its 
judges. 
 
------------------- 
HRW Recommendations 
------------------- 
 
4.  (U) The HRW report calls on President Chavez to instruct 
his supporters to suspend implementation of the new TSJ law 
and to modify the new TSJ law so it does not undermine 
judicial independence. The report also advises the TSJ itself 
that it should review the new law with an eye to finding it 
unconstitutional, reactivate the examination system and hire 
permanent judges, cease dismissing judges for political 
reasons, and review the appeals of judges who have been 
dismissed. If the GOV and TSJ fail to act, the HRW report 
calls on international lending agencies to refuse to work 
with the Venezuelan judicial system on any improvement 
projects. The report also calls on the SecGen of the OAS to 
invoke article 18 of the Democratic Charter to begin an 
investigation of the situation in Venezuela. 
 
------------ 
GOV Reaction 
------------ 
 
5.  (U) The GOV reacted with indignation to the HRW report. 
VP Jose Vicente Rangel called Vivanco \"a mercenary ... at the 
service of the imperial powers.\" He also called him a 
\"provocateur who doesn\'t represent anyone.\" Rangel further 
stated that HRW\'s statement confirmed that \"the real enemy of 
the process of change in Venezuela is George Bush.\" NA 
President and close Chavez advisor Francisco Ameliach called 
on the NA to declare Vivanco \"persona non grata.\" He said the 
HRW report \"practically constitutes a declaration of war,\" 
and said that when he heard Vivanco speak \"my blood boiled.\" 
The semi-official GOV paper VEA called Vivanco a CIA agent, 
though it offered no proof or explanation. 
 
------------------- 
Meeting with Charge 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Vivanco and HRW counsel Daniel Wilkinson attended a 
luncheon hosted by the Charge on June 18. EmbOffs and 
Canadian PolOff also attended. Vivanco discussed the 
possibilities of the OAS taking action against Venezuela for 
undermining judicial independence. He said it seemed the OAS 
was tired of Venezuela, and anxious to bring its presence in 
Venezuela to a close. He was particularly negative about the 
likelihood of Brazil taking a proactive stance, due to its 
long standing status quo foreign policy. Vivanco thought it 
was vital that countries such as the US, Canada, and Mexico 
take a strong stand on this issue in the OAS, since it was 
critical to the future of Venezuelan democracy. The Charge 
pointed out that the USG is extremely concerned about this 
issue, but the OAS is unlikely to take any steps to distract 
attention away from the presidential recall referendum in the 
short term. 
7.  (U) The Washington Post of June 22 contained a synopsis 
of the report as an op-ed co-authored by Vivanco and 
Wilkinson. The full report is available on the HRW web-site, 
at www.hrw.org. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The HRW report is an excellent synthesis of the 
threat facing the Venezuelan justice system, and its 
democracy in general. The harsh and churlish response of GOV 
officials may prevent internal damage among MVR 
unconditionals, but must give international supporters pause 
for thought. Should the referendum fail, the GOV destruction 
of judicial independence, and the likely increase in 
political persecution through the courts, will likely be the 
next big issue.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The National Assembly (NA) removed Supreme Court (TSJ) 
Vice President Franklin Arriechi Gutierrez June 16. The 
Chavista-controlled NA used the power given them by the new 
TSJ law to remove judges with a simple majority vote in some 
 
SIPDIS 
situations. Arriechi, known to oppose Chavez, will be 
replaced as TSJ VP by a Chavez supporter. Judge Arriechi has 
requested that the Constitutional Chamber suspend the action. 
The NA also solicited that the Moral Council (Attorney 
General, Controller General, Human Rights Ombudsman acting 
together) open investigations of Justices Alberto Martini 
Urdaneta and Pedro Rondon Haaz, which could lead to their 
indefinite suspension under the new law. End summary. 
 
------------------ 
Arriechi Fired 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C) The National Assembly (NA) voted June 16 to remove 
Supreme Court (TSJ) Vice President Franklin Arriechi 
Gutierrez (Civil Chamber) from the court. The new Organic Law 
of the Supreme Court gives the NA power to annul the 
appointment of Supreme Court judges in certain circumstances 
with a simple majority vote. One of the specific 
circumstances mentioned is the presenting of false 
credentials to the Nominating Committee, which Arriechi 
apparently did when he was nominated to the court. (Note: 
Arriechi falsely claimed to have been a professor at the 
Andres Bello law school, and to have a doctorate.) Arriechi 
has appealed to the Constitutional Chamber to suspend the 
measure, as it did after a similar attempt to remove Arriechi 
in December 2002. (Note: The charges against Arriechi were 
raised by the opposition when he was named in 2000, but the 
pro-Chavez majority in the NA pushed him through anyway.) 
 
3.  (C) Arriechi is a major target of the Chavistas because 
he wrote the decision for the full court (Plenary Chamber) 
absolving the military officers involved in the April 11, 
2002 events. He serves as the Vice President of the full 
court, leading the anti-Chavez judges. If he is removed, his 
position in the Civil Chamber will be taken by Tulio Alvarez 
Ledo, who is pro-opposition. His job as TSJ VP, however, will 
be filled by Omar Mora (Social Chamber), a firm Chavez ally. 
PolOff spoke to TSJ Judge Alberto Martini Urdaneta (Electoral 
Chamber) June 17. Martini reported that the rumor in the TSJ 
is that TSJ President Ivan Rincon will not accept Arriechi\'s 
appeal. Martini called Mora a \"taliban,\" who would likely 
become TSJ president after Rincon retires. 
 
-------------------- 
More Justices to Go? 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The NA also requested June 16 that the Moral Council 
(Attorney General, Controller General, Human Rights Ombudsman 
acting together) investigate Martini and Judge Pedro Rondon 
Haaz (Constitutional Chamber) to see if there are grounds for 
their removal. The Moral Council has the power under the new 
TSJ law to suspend TSJ judges indefinitely pending a 
 
SIPDIS 
two-thirds vote of the NA in favor or against permanently 
removing them (Note: With the current alignment of forces in 
the NA getting a two-thirds vote is impossible, making such a 
suspension virtually permanent.) Martini told PolOff that the 
grounds for the cases are specious, but said he expects he 
will be removed, because of the importance the GOV gives to 
controlling the Electoral Chamber prior the recall 
referendum. He said that while the first alternate in the 
Electoral Chamber is pro-opposition, Martini believes his 
replacement will be one of the other pro-Chavez alternates. 
Martini said that after he, and possibly Rondon, were removed 
from the court, the Constitutional Chamber would find the 
suspension power of the Moral Council unconstitutional. He 
 
 
did not believe that he or Rondon would be able to return to 
the court after such a ruling, however. (Note: The Moral 
Council did accuse Martini and the two other Electoral 
Chamber justices of a \"grave offense\" June 18 for the 
Electoral Chamber\'s March ruling validating the assisted 
signatures in the referendum drive. The investigation began 
before the new TSJ law was passed, and Martini told PolOff 
that he did not expect to be suspended for this case, because 
it was ex-post facto.) 
 
------------------------ 
Control of Penal Chamber 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Martini told PolOff that opposition TSJ Judge Rafael 
Perez Perdomo (Penal Chamber) plans to retire soon. Perez is 
part of a two-to-one opposition majority in the Penal 
Chamber, which oversees the criminal court system. The first 
alternate judge in the chamber is Julio Elias Mayaudon, 
identified with the opposition. Martini said pro-Chavez Judge 
Alejandro Angulo Fontiveros (Penal Chamber) plans to go on 
vacation just before Perez leaves, thus forcing Mayaudon to 
occupy his position for one week, and leaving Perez\' 
permanent seat to one of the other two pro-Chavez alternates, 
thus giving pro-Chavez judges control of the Penal Chamber. 
 
--------------------- 
Nomination Committees 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The NA named the nominating committee June 17 which 
will in turn name the twelve new TSJ judges. The committee 
currently consists of five pro-Chavez deputies (four from 
Movimiento Quinta Republica, and one from Podemos). These 
deputies are joined by six citizens chosen by the pro-Chavez 
deputies. NA President Francisco Ameliach told the press June 
18, after swearing in the committee, that the new TSJ judges 
would be designated by August 20 at the latest. The 
opposition has refused to participate in the committee 
because it does not recognize the TSJ law, which opposition 
leaders have asserted is unconstitutional. Martini said 
Rincon had told the TSJ judges that the nominating committee 
structure in the TSJ law would be found unconstitutional by 
the Constitutional Chamber. 
 
------------- 
Future of TSJ 
------------- 
 
7.  (C) Asked about the future of the TSJ law, Martini did 
not believe Rincon would find it unconstitutional, or prevent 
the nomination of the new justices. He thought a successful 
referendum was the only way the judicial system could be 
rescued from the control of the executive and legislative 
branches. He noted the complete control of the pro-Chavez 
judges over the TSJ\'s Judicial Committee, which controls the 
nominating and firing of untenured lower court judges. 
 
--------------- 
Arriechi Speaks 
--------------- 
 
8.  (C) Arriechi spoke to PolOff at a lunch hosted by PAO 
June 23. Arriechi said he would resist the NA\'s attempt to 
remove him, and continue to work, though he knew the TSJ 
would eventually prohibit him from entering the building. He 
did not think there was any possibility that the pro-Chavez 
judges on the TSJ would break with Chavez, describing them as 
a collection of self declared communists, thieves, and true 
believers. He also said Rincon and the pro-Chavez judges on 
the TSJ are already treating Martini and two other judges in 
the Electoral Chamber as if they were suspended, despite 
Martini\'s objections on procedural grounds. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
9.  (C) The NA is moving quickly to seize control of the 
court prior to the referendum. The naming of the 12 new 
judges may be subject to delay in the NA, so they are using 
the annulment and suspension powers to quickly remove leading 
opposition justices and seize control of critical chambers. 
Rincon apparently will be selective about striking down 
unfavorable aspects of the law. The fact that the TSJ 
controls the naming and disciplining of the 80% of Venezuelan 
judges who do not have permanent appointments means that 
changes in the TSJ reverberate throughout the judicial 
system. The NA is sending a clear message to the TSJ and the 
judiciary in general: if you are not with the process, you 
have no future here.

Classified By: Mark Wells, A/PolCouns, for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Hugo Chavez is in full campaign mode for the 
August 15 referendum on whether he should finish his term. 
Smarting from the moral defeat of having to accept the 
referendum, Chavez has recast the referendum as an inevitable 
victory for his revolution.  His strategy rests on mobilizing 
lower class voters who have historically abstained from 
elections.  Chavez is beefing up spending in his \"mission\" 
social programs and registering poor voters via a massive 
identity card drive.  On the darker side, the GOV continues 
to harass opposition figures with flimsy criminal indictments 
and some detentions.  Failing that, there is a bag of dirty 
tricks from which Chavez can draw to manipulate the electoral 
process.  The campaign\'s best asset, of course, is Chavez 
himself, who remains a formidable communicator.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Turning Defeat Into Victory 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) President Hugo Chavez was politically damaged by the 
convocation of the recall referendum against him, currently 
planned for August 15.  After vowing to his followers for 
more than a year that there would not be a referendum, Chavez 
surprised many by accepting the results of the signature 
drive mounted by the opposition to force the recall vote. 
Venezuela is thick with speculation over the fallout of 
Chavez\'s decision has had on his movement.  Though some stars 
have fallen -- most notably those of the previous campaign 
committee Comando Ayacucho -- Chavez has already regrouped 
and re-launched his campaign under the direction of the 
\"Comando Maisanta.\"  (Chavez also called for one hundred 
thousand \"electoral patrols\" of citizens who will get out the 
vote.)  Chavez claimed that the mere calling of a referendum 
provided for by his own Bolivarian Constitution is a victory 
for the participatory democracy espoused by his revolution. 
 
3. (C) Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy Juan Barreto, 
himself a director in Comando Ayacucho, told poloff June 17 
that Chavez is in full charge of the referendum campaign and 
is confident of a 65-35 percent defeat of the opposition at 
the polls.  Barreto claimed, most unconvincingly, that the 
opposition had actually failed to obtain enough signatures to 
activate the referendum, and Chavez had given the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) the go-ahead to approve the 
referendum in order to deal a final blow to his political 
opponents.  Barreto dismissed allegations that Chavismo is in 
disarray, though admitted that military supporters had 
opposed going to the referendum.  Barreto said the Comando 
Maisanta is a front organization to put new faces out to the 
public, but asserted that Ayacucho political operatives 
(officials of the pro-Chavez parties) such as himself are 
quietly toiling away on the campaign. 
 
----------------------------- 
Turnout, Registration Are Key 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Barreto said that mobilizing lower class Venezuelans 
who historically have abstained from voting is the principal 
strategy for Chavez to win the referendum.  The GOV is aiming 
for an abstention rate of just 20 percent, well below the 
rates of recent years.  The pre-Chavez political system, 
Barreto said, discriminated against the poor by limiting the 
number of voting centers in their neighborhoods.  He claimed, 
for example, that middle class Baruta municipality in Caracas 
with 70,000 voters had more than 30 voting centers while the 
nearby Sucre area with one million lower class voters was 
given only 24 voting centers.  Barreto said the CNE would 
correct this problem when it issues the list of voting 
centers for the referendum. (Comment:  The CNE agreed June 23 
to add centers and expand others in poor areas.  The 
transmission network for the voting centers is already being 
installed, suggesting the CNE may not be able to shift easily 
 
large numbers of voting centers out of upper class areas.) 
 
5. (C) Barreto said the poor have also historically denied 
identity cards (\"cedulas\") due to costs associated with 
obtaining identity documents.  Barreto said the GOV\'s \"cedula 
express\" program -- which utilizes mobile units to issue 
cards -- had issued two million cards to lower class voters 
since January, with the ambitious goal of four million cards 
by July 10, when the voter registration rolls are closed. 
Barreto said workers in the mobile units have been 
registering each cedula applicant in the electoral registry. 
He also said that Cuban doctors working in the \"Barrio 
Adentro\" program flag patients without cedulas.  The 
patients, he said are later visited by members of the 
Francisco Miranda Front, the cadre of Venezuelan \"social 
workers\" trained in Cuba, to arrange their identity cards. 
(The CNE is also operating more than 600 registration sites 
around Venezuela.) 
 
-------------------- 
Missions on Steroids 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) In his rhetoric, Chavez is putting his populist 
programs such as Mission Robinson (literacy) and Mission 
Sucre (college scholarships) on the line.  His message to 
voters is that the opposition will take away these programs 
if they return to power.  To a considerable degree these 
missions have been thinly disguised transfer payments to his 
key low-income constituents.  Chavez appears to be 
accelerating his efforts to put cash in the hands of would-be 
voters via the \"Missions,\" though it is debatable how much 
more effectively these moneys can be distributed with less 
than two months remaining before the referendum.  Chavez also 
has to deal with the curious fact that some 233,000 
recipients of Mission benefits also signed the petition 
against him, suggesting that some votes, at least, are not 
for sale.  Another explanation is that Mission rolls have 
been vastly exaggerated because of fraud or number padding by 
Mission administrators, suggesting that Chavez\'s support in 
the Missions is less than advertised. 
 
------------------------- 
Running Against Uncle Sam 
------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez\'s negative campaigning thus far has hit on the 
opposition as hapless agents of the USG.  Chavez relishes in 
claiming his true opponent is President Bush.  Barreto said 
that polls show the anti-U.S. message does not help and 
claimed the rhetoric would be softened.  Chavez, however, 
shows no signs of lessening his accusations that the U.S. is 
an imperial power on the verge of invading Venezuela. 
 
------------------------ 
Persecute The Opposition 
------------------------ 
 
8. (C) Questionable criminal indictments and detentions of 
opposition figures continue at a steady pace, evidence that 
the GOV will keep trying to discredit the opposition as 
undemocratic coup-plotters and try to keep key opposition 
leaders off-balance and preoccupied with their criminal 
defense.  Recent victims of this tactic include Sumate 
directors Maria Corina Machado and Alejandro Plaz, Gente de 
Petroleo leader Juan Fernandez, Army Gen. Manuel Rosendo, and 
Asamblea de Educadores leader Leonardo Carvajal.  Each plays 
a significant role in the Coordinadora Democratica (CD). 
Barreto claimed the GOV is attacking the leaders of the 
opposition\'s \"Plan B,\" a civil rebellion to be launched, he 
said, after Chavez wins the referendum. 
 
---------------------- 
Fraud and Manipulation 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) Chavez may also resort to manipulation or just 
downright fraud.  Chavez controls the CNE and has shown his 
willingness to change rules that do not favor him.  He may 
 
use this influence to delay the referendum (or the 
certification of its results) past August 19, when a 
presidential vacancy via recall would be filled by the Vice 
President.  These tactics may be a last resort, once the 
results of the referendum are known but not certified.  The 
new touch-screen electoral system may help facilitate fraud 
and manipulation.  The CNE approved in record time the 
contract for the Smartmatic-led consortium, one of whose 
members, Bizta, had received startup capital from the GOV. 
The deal smells of corruption -- and possibly fraud -- and 
puts in doubt the security of the referendum process.  We 
note that Chavez may not need to resort to fraud with the 
computerized system; an organizational and technical meltdown 
with the untested system could delay and possibly scuttle the 
referendum.  A June 23 announcement by CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez that he planned to install a system to 
electronically fingerprint to ensure people vote just once is 
also a concern for efficiency of the system. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Violence To Intimidate, Deteriorate 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) We also cannot rule out the use of violence to 
frustrate the opposition\'s preparations and intimidate 
voters.  When the GOV realized the opposition was on the 
verge of a big win during the signature appeals, armed Chavez 
supporters menaced dozens of appeals centers and opposition 
information offices.  For example, when the CNE projected on 
June 3 that the presidential referendum would take place, 
armed gangs (reportedly the Tupamaros) sacked private media 
offices and violently assaulted an opposition deputy.  If as 
the referendum race unfolds it appears Chavez is headed for 
defeat, Chavez may unleash this kind of targeted violence on 
his opponents to destabilize the political situation, albeit 
at a high price in terms of the perception of legitimacy for 
his government, both domestically and abroad. 
 
----------------------------- 
Blindfold, Delay the Referees 
----------------------------- 
 
11. (C) The CNE, Comando Maisanta, and GOV officials have 
called for strict limitations on international observers. 
Their argument is that observers have tried to undermine the 
authority of the CNE.  In truth, the Chavistas were incensed 
at the observers\' critical press statements, like those of 
Jimmy Carter just after the signature appeals process. 
Chavez supporters will try to suppress the observers\' 
interaction with the press, limit their access to 
information, and invite a slew of sympathetic observers to 
offset any negative press.  The CNE reportedly approved 
regulations June 23 that prohibit observers from making press 
statements, though the rules will not be finalized until 
officially published.  The rules also reportedly establish a 
special committee to oversee international observers run by 
CNE Director Oscar Battaglini, an outspoken critic of the 
OAS/TCC missions. 
 
------------------------------ 
Charm Offensive:  Coincidence? 
------------------------------ 
 
12. (C) We are also suspect the GOV may be trying to look 
improve its image at home and abroad.  Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel met with the Ambassador June 16, for the first 
time at Rangel\'s request.  Rangel proposed that his chief of 
staff, Rene Arreaza, accompanied by MFA chief of staff Temir 
Porras, to visit Washington for meetings with the USG.  In 
counter-terrorism, the GOV announced June 23 it had captured 
21 alleged members of the FARC in Venezuelan territory who 
were returned to Colombian territory.  On the drug front, the 
GOV said June 22 it had dismantled a drug cartel operating in 
the interior, resulting in cocaine seizures of 6,156 kilos. 
These events may be a coincidence, but it sounds like the GOV 
is following the advice of its Washington consultant on how 
to win friends and influence people. 
 
------- 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) The referendum pits Chavez against himself, an 
unenviable position for any politician.  But while 
politically wounded, Chavez is far from finished.  He is a 
tireless campaigner and talented communicator with nearly 
unlimited funds to spend over the next eight weeks.  His 
formula for boosting voter participation appears sound.  His 
populist message will probably not win over opponents but 
will be difficult to counter.  Chavez\'s thin bench of 
political advisors has proven to be incompetent, and hesitant 
to give Chavez the unvarnished truth, as shown by the 
signature drive and appeals process.  Hard-line and moderate 
supporters of Chavez will also continue to bicker among 
themselves.  Chavez\'s campaign re-shuffling has not 
eliminated these problems; \"Comando Maisanta\" is the same 
\"Comando Ayacucho\" with an image makeover.  Chavez is also 
prone to misreading political signs, especially where human 
rights and the international community are involved, which 
could hurt his domestic popularity.  The most dangerous 
scenario may be that if Chavez wakes up late in the campaign 
and figures that he is losing, under which scenario recourse 
to blatant fraud and intervention may be his last option to 
stay in office.

PRELIMINARY FIGURES 
------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  MARK FEIERSTIEN OF GREENBERG, ROSNER AND QUINLAN 
(GRQ) TOLD POLOFF ON JUNE 24 THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF GRQ\'S 
LATEST POLL REGARDING THE AUGUST 15 PRESIDENTIAL RECALL 
REFERENDUM.  THE FIGURES, COLLECTED AFTER THE REFERENDUM WAS 
CONVOKED, SHOW THAT LIKELY VOTERS ARE SPLIT 48-TO-48 OVER 
    WHETHER TO RECALL PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  FEIERSTIEN OFFERED 
THREE REASONS FOR THE FIGURES.  FIRST, CHAVISTAS ARE MORE 
LIKELY TO VOTE NOW THAT THERE IS A REFERENDUM.  SECOND, THE 
ECONOMY HAS DONE WELL IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS, WITH HIGH OIL 
PRICES AND MASSIVE SOCIAL SPENDING.  LASTLY, BY GOING FORWARD 
WITH THE REFERENDUM, CHAVEZ DEMONSTRATED HIS \"COMMITMENT\" TO 
DEMOCRACY AND WON HIMSELF INCREASED SUPPORT.  FEIERSTIEN SAID 
CHAVEZ WOULD WIN THE REFERENDUM IF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT 
ARRESTED NOW. 
 
--------------------------- 
A MESSAGE TO THE OPPOSITION 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  FEIERSTIEN SAID HE DELIVERED THESE RESULTS TO A 
SELECT GROUP OF SENIOR OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES.  HE 
OBSERVED THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS TO FOCUS ITS REFERENDUM 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHAVEZ AND HIS DISMAL RECORD ON JOBS, 
SOCIETAL UNITY AND CRIME.  HE ASSERTED THE OPPOSITION SHOULD 
STAY AWAY FROM THE ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY, AS CHAVEZ APPEARS 
MORE DEMOCRATIC AFTER CALLING THE REFERENDUM.  CORRUPTION IS 
ALSO A POOR THEME, FEIERSTIEN SAID, UNLESS A MAJOR SCANDAL 
ERUPTS DIRECTLY IMPLICATING CHAVEZ.  THOSE POLLED DID NOT 
VIEW CHAVEZ AS CORRUPT, RATHER BELIEVING THE OPPOSITION TO BE 
WORSE.  FEIERSTIEN ALSO CONTENDED THAT THE OPPOSITION SHOULD 
NOT SPEND EXCESSIVE TIME WRANGLING OVER THE ISSUES OF VOTING 
MACHINES AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, BUT SHOULD CONCENTRATE 
ON ESTABLISHING ITS ELECTORAL MESSAGE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
    ------- 
 
4.  (C)  THE POLL IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST 
\"POST-REPAROS\" POLL.  CHAVEZ GOT A BUMP OUT OF ACCEPTING THE 
REFERENDUM.  PREVIOUS POLLS ALSO MAY NOT HAVE ACCURATELY 
GAUGED THE COMMITMENT OF CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS, WHO DID NOT 
BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE A REFERENDUM.  ADMITTEDLY, GRQ IS 
SELLING ITS SERVICES AS AN ELECTORAL CONSULTANT AND THIS IS 
ITS SALES PRESENTATION.  HOWEVER, THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR: 
CHAVEZ IS FAR FROM FINISHED AND THE OPPOSITION HAS A TOUGH 
CHALLENGE AHEAD.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  On June 18, President Hugo Chavez, former President 
Jimmy Carter and media magnate Gustavo Cisneros met behind 
closed doors for two hours at Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas.  While 
Chavez, Cisneros and the Carter Center have all stated the 
meeting was simply a first step toward improved dialogue, the 
meeting has generated a flurry of media speculation over 
secret pacts and negotiations.  End Summary. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
------------------ 
THE OFFICIAL STORY 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  The meeting between Chavez, Carter and Cisneros was 
to have been conducted with total secrecy.  Cisneros and 
Carter flew in on Cisneros\' private jet to the VIP area of 
Simon Bolivar International airport outside of Caracas. 
However, an individual at the airport recognized Carter and 
alerted the media.  The media followed Carter to Fuerte Tiuna 
and broke the story. 
 
3.  (U)  The Carter Center released an official press 
statement on June 19, saying that the meeting between Chavez, 
Carter and Cisneros had been an attempt to establish a 
dialogue that would ensure the most appropriate climate for a 
constitutional process in Venezuela.  During the June 20 
edition of \"Alo Presidente,\" his weekly television broadcast, 
Chavez commented that this meeting was the first step toward 
creating a plan to cooperatively combat poverty and improve 
health and education opportunities following the August 15 
referendum.  Chavez also assured the audience that he had not 
been negotiating secret deals with the opposition.  One June 
22, Cisneros issued a press release that, in general terms, 
corroborated these two stories. 
 
-------------- 
THE RUMOR MILL 
-------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Pro-GOV daily \"VEA\", contended that Cisneros, who it 
characterized as one of the most hated people in Venezuela, 
had asked for the meeting to reconcile his differences with 
the GOV since his media outlets are losing their audience and 
that he recognizes Chavez will win the August 15 referendum. 
VEA also stated that this meeting has unsettled the leaders 
of Accion Democratica and COPEI, who felt that they were 
excluded from negotiations to determine the outcome of the 
referendum.  Jose Albornoz, Secretary General of the 
pro-Chavez Patria Por Todos (PPT) party, told poloff June 25 
that Chavez told him the purpose of the meeting was to open 
up communication with private media, which Chavez sees as his 
principal opponent. 
 
5.  (U)  Caracas daily \"Ultimas Noticias\" reported that the 
Chavistas are calling Chavez a traitor for meeting with 
Cisneros.  Caracas daily \"Tal Cual\" pointed out that if 
Chavez is willing to meet with a person the GOV has 
repeatedly called \"the lead coup plotter,\" the door has been 
opened for meetings with the Democratic Coordinator.  Both 
speculated that this meeting is perhaps the first step toward 
a sustainable democratic dialogue in Venezuela. 
 
6.  (C)  Solidaridad Deputy Ernesto Alvarenga met with poloff 
on June 23, and asserted that Chavez and Cisneros were 
negotiating Chavez,s departure from power and subsequent 
asylum in the Dominican Republic.  Alvarenga pointed to 
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez,s June 21 visit with 
Chavez as evidence for his claims. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Everyone was caught unaware by the meeting.  there 
were only three people present and each his offered their 
version.  Chavez probably had hoped to keep it secret and 
avoid being seen \"speaking to the Devil,\" as he put it.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) \"Amores de Barrio Adentro (Love Inside the 
Neighborhood),\" a state-sponsored soap opera, premiered on 
national television on June 22 after a two-hour national 
premiere party.  \"Amores\" is filled with pro-Chavez rhetoric, 
GoV propaganda, and attacks on the opposition, while 
providing the class rich boy/poor girl love story which is 
the staple of Latin American \"telenovelas.\"  The soap opera 
is a joint effort between the GoV, state-sponsored media, and 
the Ministry of Culture to create one more pro-Chavez 
propaganda tool.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
The Revolution Will Be Televised 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The first episode of \"Amores de Barrio Adentro (Love 
Inside the Neighborhood)\" debuted on state-owned station 
Venezolana de Television (VTV) on July 22.  It contained 
standard soap opera plots and characters, mixed with GoV 
rhetoric and propaganda.  (Note: The title is a play on words 
of the GoV\'s \"Barrio Adentro\" program, which brings Cuban 
doctors into poor neighborhoods. End note.)  VTV hosted a 
two-hour television premiere event from a Caracas theatre. 
During the premiere, the introductory speeches took a clear 
political bent.  The President of VTV, the President of 
Cineastas (film producers association), and the Minister of 
Culture all stressed how the show exposes \"the enemies of the 
revolution\" and \"resists the oligarchy.\"  When \"Amores\" 
director Roman Chalbaud spoke, the crowd erupted in Chavista 
cheers after Chalbaud\'s declaration that \"we are going to 
vote NO!\" (a reference to the presidential recall 
referendum).  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel also 
attended the premiere. 
 
3. (U) The storyline begins in December 2001 and features two 
families, one Chavista and one \"esqualido\" (middle and 
upper-class opposition), as the central actors.  The Chavista 
father (Juan) works in a factory and the daughter (Lucinda) 
is a university student, who actively participates in 
pro-Chavez marches.  The opposition father is a psychologist, 
who is depicted as a coup plotter, and the son (Alfonso) is a 
university student.  Both the opposition son and mother 
appear to have pro-Chavez sympathies, if not outright 
tendencies.  The connection between the two families will be 
the Romeo-and-Juliet romance between Lucinda and Alfonso.  In 
a moment of true romance, the two embrace and kiss after 
Alfonso is shot in the neck by (the opposition controlled) 
Metropolitan Police at a Chavista rally.  After a trip to the 
hospital and speedy recovery, the first episode ends outside 
Alfonso\'s house as Lucinda proclaims her love for Alfonso. 
 
--------------------------- 
GoV Propaganda Bubbles Over 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Political commentaries filled the soap opera. 
\"Amores\" ran one hour, but contained many commercials 
featuring GoV missions and other projects.  Juan, the 
Chavista father and factory worker, is promised by the 
opposition factory manager that he and his workers will 
receive their salaries during the upcoming December 
2001-February 2002 national strike in an effort to allay 
Juan\'s concerns.  The opposition father and his family appear 
to have prominent roles as coup plotters and dissidents. 
They roll tires through the living room, presumably to be 
burned in a street demonstration similar to the real events 
of March 2004.  The father and family prepare Molotov 
cocktails in the living room as they jokingly discuss their 
\"violence in Venezuela\" strategy.  Pedro Carmona\'s image is 
flashed on the television sets of the \"esqualidos\" on two 
separate occasions.  During a Bolivarian student march, 
Lucinda is seen having a pleasant, informative conversation 
 
with radical Chavista leader Lina Ron, making a cameo 
appearance.  During the same march, the Metropolitan Police 
fire upon innocent Chavista supporters, injuring numerous 
people, including Alfonso. 
 
5. (U) In the first episode, the characters were developed 
and storylines were set.  Three basic story lines will be 
engaged in \"Amores\": 1) the opposition are violent, 
coup-plotting dissidents; 2) love will unite pro-Chavez 
supporters, even across socio-economic lines (i.e. Lucinda 
and Alfonso); and 3) there will be clear divisions within 
opposition families when some family members support Chavez. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) \"Amores de Barrio Adentro\" is the first attempt by the 
Chavistas to put their own spin on Venezuela\'s problems 
through the popular \"telenovela\" format.  (Ironically, 
Venezuela is already a Latin American soap opera leader, with 
Venevision, owned by Chavez antagonist Gustavo Cisneros, the 
principal producer of the soap operas.)  \"Amores\" appears to 
have acting and production levels which meet the genre\'s 
standards, but whether Venezuelans want to watch something 
this close to real life is a question.  Nevertheless, it is a 
promising idea for the Chavistas to get their message out 
over the upcoming presidential referendum campaign.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s new automated voting system will make its 
premiere in the August 15 recall referendum against President 
Hugo Chavez.  The consortium behind the untested system, led 
by the U.S. company Smartmatic, has yet to finalize its 
contracts with the National Electoral Council (CNE).  The 
consortium has imported 16,000 of the 19,200 touch-screen 
machines that will be deployed to voting centers, and is 
installing the dedicated network throughout Venezuela to 
connect them.  Critics have attacked nearly every aspect of 
the system including the reliability of the machines, the 
vulnerabilities to \"backdoor\" tampering, and the expedited 
manner in which the CNE granted the concession to Smartmatic. 
 Consortium reps maintain that the system is highly 
auditable, dependable, and will have been fully tested before 
August 15.  But as this is Smartmatic\'s first venture into 
electoral technology, we cannot rule out significant problems 
during the referendum due to unforeseen technical or 
organizational problems.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
The Smartmatic-led Consortium 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) on February 16 
awarded the concession for a new automated voting system to 
the SBC Consortium (see ref).  The Consortium is led by 
Smartmatic, a Delaware-registered firm founded by Venezuelans 
with offices in Boca Raton, Florida.  The firm maintains a 
research and development office in Caracas and has offices in 
Mexico.  Smartmatic\'s owners are Antonio Mugica, Alfredo 
Anzola, and Roger Pinate, young Venezuelan computer engineers 
who went to the U.S. several years ago to make it in 
business.  There are diverse rumors over the true identity of 
Smartmatic\'s investors; among them are Caracas daily El 
Universal, owners of Caracas\' renowned Tamanaco Hotel, and 
even Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel.  Jorge Tirado, an 
electoral expert working with Smartmatic, told poloff June 23 
that Mugica and Anzola come from upper class anti-Chavez 
families -- Anzola\'s father is a member of the Coordinadora 
Democratica -- but the two engineers have kept quiet about 
their politics. 
 
3. (C) Tirado said Smartmatic is responsible for providing 
the networking technology (i.e., Smartmatic\'s high-speed, 
encrypted network platform), electoral software, totalization 
services, and 19,200 voting machines and the programming and 
warehousing thereof.  About 16,000 of the machines have been 
imported from Italian manufacturer Olivetti.  Tirado said 
Smartmatic also purchased 1,000 backup machines and several 
hundred display models for a public education campaign.  As 
Smartmatic has no previous electoral experience, the company 
formed a joint venture with Tirado\'s Caribbean Government 
Consultants (CGC), of Puerto Rico, to assemble the team that 
will operate the system.  CGC will total the votes on 
election day and deliver the results to CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez, said Tirado. 
 
4. (C) Venezuela\'s privatized telephone company, CANTV 
(28-percent owned by Verizon), will provide site support and 
transmission of data to the CNE.  CANTV General Manager for 
Businesses and Institutions Ramon Ramirez told poloff June 23 
they have hired 8,000 on-site representatives to connect the 
machines and attend to basic maintenance problems (paper 
jams, power supply, etc.).  CANTV reps will also be present 
at smaller centers that will use manual ballots (covering 
five percent of the electorate) and transmit the data by 
cellular telephone or satellite.  An additional 1,000 
technicians will be on call throughout Venezuela to handle 
other problems, such as removing a defective unit and 
 
 
transferring voting data to the replacement. 
 
5. (C) The final consortium member, Bizta, is a small 
Venezuelan software company run by a Venezuelan software 
engineer.  Smartmatic\'s owners, according to Tirado, were 
Bizta\'s principal investors.  As reported by the Miami 
Herald, Bizta had received a $200,000 investment from a 
Venezuelan venture capital fund last year and named a GOV 
science ministry official to Bizta\'s board.  Tirado described 
these as one-year loans, carried out in two $100,000 
tranches.  The final tranche was reimbursed, said Tirado 
around the time the Miami Herald story broke.  Bizta\'s role 
in the Consortium, said Ramirez, is to adapt Smartmatic\'s 
software and machines to Venezuela\'s electoral regulations. 
For the referendum, Ramirez said, this amounts to designing 
the touch screen image that will be displayed to voters.  For 
the more complex regional elections, Bizta will oversee the 
application of formulas for figuring the proportional 
representation of municipal councils. 
 
6. (C) Ramirez said the CNE held a private bidding process 
due to time constraints, which meant the CNE invited specific 
companies to present bids.  After winning the bid, Smartmatic 
signed a $63 million contract (vie a GOV letter of credit) 
with the CNE to buy the voting machines and other computer 
equipment.  Two service contracts -- about $24 million for 
the referendum and $28 million for the regional elections -- 
have not been signed.  Ramirez attributed the delays to 
budget shortfalls at the CNE, which by law cannot sign a 
contract unless the obligated funds are in its accounts. 
Ramirez said the CNE Director Rodriguez\'s recent purchase of 
fingerprint readers for the election (see para 11) caused the 
budget shortfall.  Of the approximately $52 million in 
services, Tirado said Smartmatic will receive 51 percent, 
CANTV 47 percent, and Bizta 2 percent. 
 
------------ 
How It Works 
------------ 
 
7. (C) The Smartmatic machines are re-engineered lottery 
machines with a six-inch touch screen, a built-in printer, 
and a network connection.  Machines are pre-programmed to 
accept a specific number of votes corresponding to its 
assigned electoral table.  Tirado said the maximum number of 
votes one machine can accept is 600 -- hence, a voting center 
with 1,500 votes will be assigned three machines, two with 
600 votes each, one with 300.  Voters will read the 
referendum question, press \"yes\" or \"no\" boxes on the screen, 
and lock in their votes.  The machine prints a receipt that 
confirms the vote.  The receipt is deposited in an electoral 
urn.  The Smartmatic system makes five electronic and two 
paper records of each vote.  At the end of the day, the 
machine prints a tally sheet of the votes (acta) to be signed 
by the poll workers.  The workers then transmit the results 
to the CNE via CANTV regional data centers. 
 
8. (C) The CNE continues to debate the referendum procedures, 
though CANTV\'s Ramirez said the system is designed to be 
\"highly auditable,\" in its software, hardware, and paper 
trail.  It remains unresolved, therefore, whether the poll 
workers will tally the paper receipts and match them against 
the computerized results, known as a \"hot audit.\" 
Representatives of the Coordinadora Democratica have told us 
they will insist on the \"hot audit,\" though CNE Director 
Rodriguez has suggested publicly that this extra step could 
delay the certification of results.  Tirado said the \"hot 
audit\" is not necessary and would probably cause more 
problems than it solves.  Tirado said the CNE may authorize 
an expanded acta that lists every vote cast on the machine. 
Tirado said the CNE does not plan to give actas to 
international observers, though the system could be 
programmed to do so (party representatives will get a copy). 
Tirado said if everything goes smoothly with the data 
transmission, his team would have preliminary results for the 
CNE by midnight on election day. 
 
------------------------- 
Critics Attack the System 
------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Electoral experts, some of them linked to Smartmatic\'s 
competitors, raised multiple questions about the system. 
Generally, there is doubt whether re-engineered lottery 
machines, never before used for an electoral event, can do 
the job, such as whether the touch-screens will be properly 
calibrated or the printers will function smoothly.  There are 
also doubts as to the electronic security of the machines and 
data network.  Since the votes are stored electronically, 
critics say, manipulation is possible no matter how 
sophisticated the machines.  (Tirado said a team of 20 
computer programmers -- 10 from the GOV and 10 from the 
opposition -- are currently testing the machines to ensure 
their reliability on this and other points.)  Software codes, 
to which the CNE will have complete access, can also be 
changed, critics charge.  Ramirez commented that some Chavez 
supporters have alleged the USG will \"use its satellites\" to 
manipulate the referendum results. 
 
------------------ 
Where\'s The Fraud?

10. (C) Consortium reps defended the security of their 
system.  Ramirez pointed out that the 19,200 machines will be 
sending their data on election night in short bursts of no 
more than two minutes, making widespread tampering nearly 
impossible.  Sumate representative Roberto Abdul told poloff 
June 23 he is not worried about the machines, but rather the 
computer server to which the machines report.  Tirado said 
his team -- not the CNE informatics department -- would total 
the results and give them to the CNE.  Abdul said Smartmatic 
can give whatever results they want to the CNE, but he did 
not rule out that the CNE could still change them.  Tirado 
discounted the possibility, saying it would be difficult for 
the CNE cover up documented results.  Asked whether he was 
prepared if the CNE decided to falsify the results, Tirado 
hinted that he had prepared a \"contingency\" plan to preserve 
the true results.  Tirado said that he has consulted on more 
than 60 elections worldwide under shadier conditions; he 
asserted it would be a clean election. 
 
-------------------- 
Fingerprints A No-Go 
-------------------- 
 
11. (C) Fraud aside, there is still a possibility that some 
unforeseen operational glitch crashes the system.  The 
Consortium plans to stage a simulation of the system on July 
18.  Tirado said he is confident the system will work, but 
said there are two backup plans if there are interruptions, 
one of which is a manual vote.  Ramirez said the CNE\'s 
insistence on using fingerprint readers to prevent multiple 
voting will jeopardize the system\'s success.  Ramirez said 
the CNE plans to purchase 12,000 to 16,000 readers, fewer 
than the number of voting machines.  The readers will scan 
the thumb and index finger prints from every voter, send the 
data to the CNE, where it will be checked against the prints 
of everyone who has already voted.  Ramirez said the 
fingerprint readers have a 1 in 120 error rate, which could 
result in thousands of Venezuelans being denied the right to 
vote.  Tirado said the plan is unworkable and doubted the CNE 
could get it deployed before the referendum.

Comment

12. (C) The touch-screen system is a fait accompli  The 
opposition has largely accepted it, and is now focused on 
imposing enough controls on the system.  The Consortium reps 
make good arguments to rebuff the criticisms, many of the 
which are not systemic, generalized issues.  A system 
collapse cannot be ruled out completely, however, due to lack 
 
 
of experience.  Fraud and manipulation are still possible, 
though it seems to be more likely at level of the CNE board 
rather than among the technicians.  All of this makes it more 
imperative than ever that the Carter Center, the OAS, and 
possibly the EU bring in as part of their observation team 
experts in automated voting systems and information 
technology.  The sooner they arrive, the better they will be 
able to prevent fraud through manipulation of the Smartmatic 
machines.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  Through budgetary and non-budgetary spending, 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) is now the primary agent for 
implementation of Chavez Administration social programs. 
Over $1.7 billion has been designated to social development 
programs in PDVSA\'s 2004 budget while up to an additional $2 
billion in PDVSA oil receipts will reportedly be used to 
establish President Chavez\'s \"Special Development Fund,\" 
supposedly for development of big ticket national 
infrastructure projects.  In recent months, PDVSA has also 
attempted to take over management of at least some part of 
the funds budgeted by international oil companies for their 
own corporate social responsibility programs in Venezuela. 
When money is channeled directly through PDVSA, however, the 
Chavez Administration is bypassing the accounting and 
budgetary control that should rest with the National 
Assembly.  A PDVSA debt buy-back program announced on June 28 
may also help PDVSA to evade the transparency required by 
U.S. financial sector regulations in the future.  The most 
troubling aspect of this emphasis on PDVSA\'s new role as a 
social welfare agency, however, is that it is deflecting the 
company\'s attention from its core mission, oil production. 
End summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
PDVSA:  DEVELOPMENT PIGGY BANK 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Recent developments have underscored that PDVSA is not 
simply \"connected to the national development program\" as 
Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez_ has put it, but is now the 
primary agent for implementation of Chavez Administration 
social programs.  This trend began in 2003 when PDVSA 
affiliate CVP started funding a program to build affordable 
housing called \"Oil for the People.\"  (NOTE:  In 2003, CVP, 
the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation, was put in charge of 
the 33 existing operating agreements under which foreign oil 
companies do business in Venezuela as well as the four extra 
heavy crude projects.  END NOTE)  Under this program, CVP, 
working with the State-owned Venezuelan development bank 
BANDES, created a $300 million trust fund (since augmented to 
$500 million).  The fund was designed to provide mortgages 
for the purchase of homes developed by the CVP.  Supposedly, 
BANDES will repay the CVP trust fund when the homeowner pays 
off the loan. 
 
3. (C) Starting in 2003, the Ministry of Energy and Mines 
(MEM) has also been designated either as the Ministry in 
charge or as a participant in a number of Chavez,s pet 
social plans.  These include \"Mision Ribas,\" the literacy 
plan; \"Mision Barrio Adentro\" (Inside the Neighborhood), the 
plan under which Cuban doctors provide medical services to 
the poor; \"Mision Sucre,\" a plan to provide grants for higher 
education; and \"Mision Vuelvan Caras\" (About Face), a plan to 
provide job training to the poor.  The funding for these 
efforts has come out of PDVSA.  PDVSA has also made 
contributions in kind to President Chavez\'s programs.  A 
number of Caracas properties formerly occupied by PDVSA have 
been turned over for the use of the recently formed 
Bolivarian University of Venezuela. 
 
------------------- 
PDVSA\'S 2004 BUDGET 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) This trend has accelerated in 2004 with the 
announcement in January of PDVSA\'s 2004 budget in which 
$1.716 billion was budgeted for social development.  These 
monies include $600 million earmarked to the CVP for a trust 
fund for agricultural development (the \"Zamora Fund\") as well 
as an additional $500 million, at least some of which will be 
allocated to the &Oil for the People8 housing program. 
 
These funds were included in the investment portion of the 
PDVSA budget.  An additional \"Social Development Plans\" line 
item under the \"Other Costs and Expenses\" portion of the 
PDVSA budget is budgeted at $616 million (Note:  the MEM\'s 
participation in the various programs listed in Para. 3 may 
well be covered by this budget item but we cannot verify 
that.)  In early 2004, PDVSA Gas also announced a new 
project, \"Gas Adentro,\" (Gas Inside, i.e., the neighborhood 
) a clear reference to the \"Barrio Adentro\" medical program) 
to provide bottled gas to poor sectors of Caracas and other 
major cities.  According to a local consultant, the proposed 
funding for \"Gas Adentro\" is about 15 percent of PDVSA Gas\' 
2004 budget and the project appears to be a virtual give away 
of the gas. 
 
5. (C) But there are other indicators of the change in 
PDVSA\'s role.  At the Latin American Petroleum Show, held 
June 15-17 in Maracaibo, econoff attended a presentation by 
PDVSA detailing its plans for the development of the Tomoporo 
field, the most significant new oil prospect in Venezuela. 
The presentation included a slide listing the social 
development projects that will supposedly be included in the 
development of Tomoporo, including artesanal fishing and 
tourism development projects.  The final slide revealed that, 
as part of the Tomoporo project, PDVSA will fund the 
development of a railroad in western Venezuela.  This raises 
the possibility that additional \"social development\" or other 
project financing will now be included as a matter of course 
in the budgets for the development of oil and gas projects. 
 
---------------------------------- 
DEEP POCKETS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In the past few months, PDVSA, and particularly CVP, 
have also attempted to take over some portion of the social 
development budgets of at least some of the private sector 
oil companies present in Venezuela.  The international oil 
companies (IOC\'s) have traditionally managed their own 
sustainable development programs to reflect their own vision 
of corporate social responsibility.  In fact, ChevronTexaco 
recently won an OAS award for its program in Maracaibo.  In 
early April, however, ChevronTexaco and the other companies 
that are expected to be involved in the development of 
off-shore oil and gas projects were summoned to a meeting in 
Sucre state.   According to a participant, the CVP 
representatives demanded that some percentage of company 
social development budgets be turned over to the CVP for 
project development.  Sucre state representatives at the 
meeting said the money would be used to foster the various 
Chavez Administration social programs in the state.  While 
IOC representatives have informed econoff that they are 
unwilling to simply give money to CVP, PDVSA and the MEM are 
pushing the companies to work on projects that will be 
defined by the GOV.  These discussions continue. 
 
------------------------------ 
THE &SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT FUND8 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Reftels reported on the diversion of an additional $2 
billion of PDVSA funds into a \"Special Development Fund\" 
announced by President Chavez on May 23.  At that time, 
Chavez stated that $2 billion in PDVSA funds would be 
transferred to BANDES to be used to finance national 
development projects such as a sugar mill, a new state 
airline, electricity projects, a subway line in a Caracas 
suburb, and an irrigation system in western Venezuela.  Since 
then, observers have noted that most of these projects were 
already covered in other parts of the GOV budget.  Most 
observers also commented that the proposed fund would be 
illegal under Venezuelan law that requires that PDVSA\'s 
dollar receipts be turned over to the Central Bank.  The GOV 
has responded that it sought and received authorization from 
the Central Bank Board for the establishment of the fund. 
 
8. (C) In a June 25 meeting with econcouns, Alejandro Dopazo, 
Finance Ministry Director General for Public Credit, 
underlined that, in his view, the most important issue is not 
that the money would not be run through the Central Bank but 
 
that there is not a coherent, on-budget system for accounting 
for it and spending it.  Dopazo reported that a small, high 
level committee is now working to get this back onto a more 
legal track.  He speculated that the means will be revision 
of the legislation governing the Macroeconomic Stabilization 
Fund (FIEM, a fund previously maintained by the GOV at the 
Central Bank, in theory to be built up during periods of high 
oil prices and drawn down when prices drop) so that some of 
the money placed in it can be spent on social projects.  In 
any event, Dopazo claimed that nothing has been done with the 
money and that it has not been given to state bank BANDES as 
has been reported in the media. 
 
------------- 
DEBT BUY BACK 
------------- 
 
9. (C) In another development that could have a negative 
impact on PDVSA, taken as it is with its \"social development\" 
mandate, on June 28 PDVSA announced an offer to buy back up 
to $2.6 billion of its external debt.  The offer is in the 
form of a \"tender and consent\" requiring all noteholders who 
accept the purchase price to agree to certain amendments to 
the current PDVSA Finance Ltd. transaction terms.  If the 
tender is completed successfully, all holders of outstanding 
notes after completion of the tender will be bound by the 
amendments.  The amendments include the removal of certain 
designated buyers for Venezuelan crude as well as a reduction 
in the volume of oil that must be sold through PDVSA Finance 
as collateral. 
 
10. (C) According to a knowledgeable local energy analyst, on 
its face it appears that PDVSA is simply doing what a normal 
company would do, i.e., paying down its debt in a time of 
high revenues.  However, this analyst believes that the goal 
of the buy back is an attempt to reduce the legal 
requirements on PDVSA to tell all about its operations. 
Depending on the type of bonds that PDVSA is successful in 
buying back, i.e., those that carry a requirement that PDVSA 
file an SEC report, the buy back could result in a reduction 
in the amount of financial information the company is 
required to give to U.S. regulators.  Another  Wall Street 
analyst questions whether the proposed amendments would also 
further open the door to the possibility of diversion of 
Venezuelan exports away from the U.S. market. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (C) In a time of high oil prices, it is reasonable to 
expect PDVSA to buy back debt and to contribute to GOV social 
programs (although in an earlier day it would have been to 
the FIEM, or Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund.)  However, 
when money is channeled directly through PDVSA, the Chavez 
Administration is bypassing the accounting and budgetary 
responsibility that should rest with the National Assembly. 
BANDES, so far the preferred conduit for the PDVSA 
development funds, is also free of any significant oversight, 
even by the Superintendent of Banks.  As noted above, it is 
also possible that PDVSA may in the future be able to evade 
the transparency required by U.S. financial sector 
regulations. 
 
12. (C) The most troubling aspect of this emphasis on PDVSA\'s 
new role as a social welfare agency, however, is that it is 
deflecting the company\'s attention from its core mission, oil 
production.  PDVSA Vice President Felix Rodriguez recently 
admitted publicly that PDVSA had invested only 30 percent of 
its 2004 investment budget in the first five months of the 
year.  A local energy analyst commented to econoff that, if 
this is true, PDVSA\'s capital investment in 2004 may well be 
less than in 2002.  This investment is urgently needed to 
off-set Venezuela\'s natural production decline rate to 
maintain production once oil prices drop.  With increasing 
resources given over to social development planning, PDVSA\'s 
management, already shorthanded, is being deflected away from 
managing Venezuela\'s oil industry to becoming a one-stop 
solve-all social welfare program funder/executor, a task for 
which none of the current managers has the training let alone 
 
the experience.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) After three weeks of wrangling, the Coordinadora 
Democratica (CD) on June 25 launched its presidential recall 
campaign committee and swore in members of its \'yes 
commands.\'  Enrique Mendoza, Governor of Miranda and likely 
presidential candidate in a possible follow-on election, said 
in a televised event that the opposition has approximately 
500,000 volunteers ready to participate in the CD\'s campaign 
effort, which will focus on national unity and expose 
Chavez\'s failure to combat rising crime and unemployment. 
Key opposition leaders told Poloffs that they think their 
message will resonate with undecided voters and moderate 
Chavez supporters.  The opposition has yet to deliver this 
message to those key groups, nor has it announced its much 
anticipated governance plan.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
CD launches campaign effort 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  On June 25, the CD announced its national campaign 
committee, its answer to Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta.  Enrique 
Mendoza led the televised event and claimed that several of 
hundreds of thousands of volunteers will work in \"Comandos 
por el Si,\" the opposition\'s local campaign committees.  He 
was joined by the other twelve members of the national 
campaign committee: 
 
Alejandro Armas--National Assembly (NA) Deputy from the 
Solidaridad party 
 
Albis Munoz--President of Fedecamaras 
 
Cesar Perez Vivas--COPEI Deputy from Tachira state 
 
Rafael Huizi Clavier--leader of the Institutional Military 
Front 
 
Pompeyo Marquez--an opposition wise man and a leader of Union 
party 
 
Juan Fernandez--President of Gente de Petroleo 
 
Jesus Torrealba--head of CD\'s public relations 
 
Henry Ramos Allup--President of AD 
 
Julio Borges--President of Primero Justicia 
 
Felipe Mujica--President of MAS 
 
Jorge Sucre--Proyecto Venezuela 
 
Manuel Cova--leader of the Confederation of Workers of 
Venezuela 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Slow Decision Making Process Hampering Opposition 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (C) On June 25, Juan Fernandez expressed his frustration 
with the CD\'s slow decision making process to Poloffs.  He 
stated that bickering among the parties and groups over the 
size and membership of the campaign committee delayed its 
launch by nearly three weeks.  Fernandez--who is in charge of 
the CD\'s communications committee--said that the CD\'s poor 
decision making process is also undermining the 
communications effort.  He gave the example of the recent 
 
 
television advertisements telling supporters that \"it\'s now 
or never\" in describing the signature appeals process. 
Fernandez claimed he bypassed the regular decision making 
process and got Enrique Mendoza to sign off on the 
advertisements.  Fernandez claimed that if he had worked 
within the regular process, the proposal would still be in 
the discussion phase.  Fernandez added that, despite the 
success of the ads, CD members are still debating whether it 
was the right message. 
 
 
----------------------- 
Getting the Message Out 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) Opposition leaders are confident that the opposition 
will win the recall vote, despite the recent Greenberg poll, 
which showed that the CD and the government are at a dead 
heat (ref a).  Fernandez stated that the opposition is going 
after undecided voters, the so called \"ni-ni,\" as well as 
moderate Chavistas.  In particular, the CD is targeting young 
people, women and the poor with a three-point message of 
reuniting the polarized country and highlighting Chavez\'s 
inability to control rising crime and unemployment.  (Note: 
This is the advice of the CD\'s Washington consultants, 
Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner.)  To deliver this three-pronged 
message, Fernandez said that the CD will not only use 
television advertisements, but also develop campaign 
literature and go to the poor neighborhoods where the 
majority of Venezuelans live.  At the same time, the 
opposition leadership is looking to reinvigorate its support 
base  Fernandez claimed that the June 25 event was designed 
in large part to reenergize CD\'s core followers. 
 
 
5. (C) Alejandro Armas told Poloffs on June 23 that the 
opposition would use SUMATE\'s telephone database of more than 
4 million supporters to rally the faithful.  Armas believes 
the opposition must give a vision to voters that they are 
capable of governing through 2006.  He noted the importance 
of making voters understand that Venzuelan democracy and 
institutions are at stake. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
What about the Governance Plan? 
------------------------------- 
 
   6. (C) The fanfare of the June 25 event failed to mention 
the anticipated governance plan nor the country consensus 
plan--a detailed proposal for a transitional 
government--despite previous claims from opposition insiders 
that the CD would do so on June 25 (ref b).  The campaign 
committee did not state when either plan would be announced. 
According to the CD literature, the political 
committee--whose 60 members were responsible for naming the 
campaign committee--is also responsible for the governance 
plan and the country consensus plan, as well as the method 
for selection a candidate for a possible follow on election. 
Details of both plans are sketchy and will probably focus in 
varying degrees of detail on similar issues of national 
unity, pledging to revive the economy while at the same time 
addressing social concerns. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) The opposition\'s campaign command is developing an 
electoral message that should resonate not only with its 
support base, but with moderate Chavistas and undecided 
voters.  However, the opposition has yet to demonstrate that 
it can translate these ideas into campaign actions.  The CD\'s 
slow decision making process will likely hamper its ability 
to compete against Chavez, who has direct control over his 
Comando Maisanta and has access to the government coffers. 
 
 
We do not meant to count the opposition out, as it is 
typically clumsy at the outset of its campaigns. And, while 
it is slow to reach internal agreements -- the opposition 
runs the gamut from right to left -- the opposition has shown 
its skill at organizing voting centers. But with just six 
weeks left before the referendum, the opposition needs to get 
moving.

----------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  ON JUNE 25, PRO-GOV PROSECUTOR DANILO ANDERSON 
FORMALLY PRESENTED CHARGES AGAINST FORMER BARUTA MAYOR 
HENRIQUE CAPRILES RODONSKI.  THE SIX CHARGES PRESENTED 
AGAINST CAPRILES, INCLUDING VIOLATION OF THE VIENNA 
CONVENTION, ALL RELATE TO THE APRIL 12, 2002 SIEGE AGAINST 
THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN CARACAS.  FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATION OF 
CHARGES, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE GRANTED THE 
PROSECUTION\'S REQUEST THAT CAPRILES BE DETAINED WITHOUT BAIL 
    FOR THE DURATION OF THE CASE.  CAPRILES\' LAWYER IS SEEKING TO 
HAVE THE JUDGE\'S ORDER REDUCED TO HOUSE ARREST INSTEAD OF 
DETENTION AT DISIP HEADQUARTERS.  CAPRILES WAS TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY ON MAY 11. 
 
-------------------- 
CLAIMS OF CORRUPTION 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  CAPRILES\' LAWYER, JUAN MARTIN ECHEVERRIA, ATTACKED 
THE PROSECUTION\'S CASE, NOTING THAT ANDERSON HAD 
INTENTIONALLY LEFT OUT SOME EVIDENCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE CASE 
FILE INCLUDES A DOCUMENTARY PRODUCED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
CONCERNING THE EVENTS AT THE EMBASSY, BUT EXCLUDES WELL-KNOWN 
VENEVISION FOOTAGE SHOWING CAPRILES INSIDE THE EMBASSY CALMLY 
DISCUSSING THE WELL BEING OF THE STAFF WITH THE CUBAN 
AMBASSADOR. 
 
4.  (C) ECHEVERRIA TOLD POLOFF JUNE 28 THAT JUDGE MARIA 
TERESA GOMEZ NIEVES, INITIALLY APPOINTED TO PRESIDE OVER 
CAPRILES, CASE, HAD OFFERED TO DISMISS ALL CHARGES FOR A 
BRIBE OF $100,000.  ACCORDING TO ECHEVERRIA, SHORTLY AFTER HE 
REFUSED TO PAY THE BRIBE, GOMEZ NIEVES DISMISSED HERSELF FROM 
THE CASE AND WAS REPLACED BY CHAVEZ LOYALIST, REGINO COVA. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  THE CAPRILES CASE CONTINUES TO BE RUN BY POLITICS. 
WE HAVE HEARD SPECULATION THAT SOME CHAVEZ ARE SEEKING 
    REVENGE AGAINST CAPRILES FOR ACTIONS HE TOOK AGAINST THE GOV 
IN APRIL 2002.  IT IS ALSO NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT CAPRILES IS 
A MEMBER OF THE PRIMERO JUSTICIA PARTY, WHICH IS POSITIONING 
ITSELF FOR FUTURE LEADERSHIP AND ENJOYING SOME SUPPORT IN THE 
POLLS.  IN ANY EVENT, THE CAPRILES CASE CONTINUES TO BE 
VENEZUELA\'S MOST HIGH PROFILE POLITICAL PRISONER.

2.  (SBU)  ON JUNE 23, GREENBERG, QUINLAN, ROSNER RESEARCH 
INC. (GQR) RELEASED THE RESULTS OF ITS NATIONAL PUBLIC 
OPINION STUDY.  GQR CONDUCTED ITS POLLING IN FOCUS GROUPS 
AFTER CHAVEZ AGREED TO CONVOKE THE REFERENDUM, BUT HAS NOT 
INDICATED HOW MANY PARTICIPANTS WERE INVOLVED.  THE GQR 
POLLING DATA SHOWED THAT NATIONAL OPINION IS SPLIT EVENLY 
48-TO-48 ON WHETHER TO RECALL PRESIDENT CHAVEZ.  GQR FIGURES 
ALSO INDICATE THAT CHAVEZ HAS A 53-TO-45 PERCENT APPROVAL 
RATING, BUT THAT NATIONAL OPINION IS MORE EVENLY DIVIDED OVER 
WHETHER OR NOT CHAVEZ IS LEADING VENEZUELA IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION, 42% APPROVAL TO 40% DISAPPROVAL. 
 
--------------------------------- 
THE GQR POLL: CHAVEZ AND THE POOR 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  ON ISSUES REGARDING THE VENEZUELAN POOR, CHAVEZ 
RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER PUBLIC OPINION FIGURES. 
SIXTY-TWO PERCENT OF THOSE PARTICIPANTS POLLED BY GQR AGREED 
THAT THE CHAVEZ ADMINISTRATION IS HELPING THE POOR, WHILE 
ONLY 36% DISAGREED.  ADDITIONALLY, GQR FIGURES INDICATED 
CHAVEZ,S SOCIAL WELFARE MISSIONS HAVE 58-TO-38 PERCENT 
APPROVAL RATING.  WHEN THE GQR POLLING DATA ON THE RECALL 
REFERENDUM WAS BROKEN DOWN INTO FIVE INCOME GROUPS, THE TOP 
FOUR INCOME STRATA WERE IN FAVOR OF RECALLING CHAVEZ. 
HOWEVER, CHAVEZ WON IN THE LOWEST INCOME GROUP, 59 TO 38 
    PERCENT. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
THE GQR POLL: MENDOZA AND THE OPPOSITION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  THE GQR POLLING DATA INCLUDES FIGURES FOR A 
POST-REFERENDUM PRIMARY FOR OPPOSITION CANDIDATES, WITH 
MIRANDA STATE GOVERNOR ENRIQUE MENDOZA LEADING WITH 40%, 
FOLLOWED BY PRIMERO JUSTICIA PARTY LEADER JULIO BORGES WITH 
24%.  IN ADDITION TO LEADING PRIMARY POLLING FIGURES, MENDOZA 
HAS A 52% APPROVAL RATING AND A 34% DISAPPROVAL RATING. 
HOWEVER, GQR FIGURES FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BETWEEN 
CHAVEZ AND MENDOZA SHOW THAT CHAVEZ HAS A COMFORTABLE LEAD AT 
52-TO-40. 
 
----------- 
OTHER POLLS 
----------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  OTHER COMPANIES HAVE RELEASED POLLING DATA WITH 
 
CARACAS 00002145  002 OF 002 
 
 ARE IN FAVOR OF RECALLING 
CHAVEZ AND 44% ARE OPPOSED.  FOR FIGURES RATING THE 
PRESIDENT\'S PERFORMANCE, CHAVEZ DID NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS HE 
DID IN THE GQR POLL, WITH ONLY A 37% APPROVAL RATING. 
ADDITIONALLY, 52% PARTICIPANTS POLLED BY CONSULTORES 21 
INDICATED THAT, UNDER CHAVEZ, VENEZUELA WAS CURRENTLY HEADED 
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.  CONSULTORES 21 CONDUCTED ITS POLLING 
AFTER THE REPAROS PROCESS AND HAD 20,000 PARTICIPANTS. 
 
6.  (U)  ON JUNE 27, MERCANALISIS RELEASED POLLING FIGURES 
THAT STATED 54% OF VENEZUELANS WERE IN FAVOR OF RECALLING 
CHAVEZ IN THE REFERENDUM AND 33% WERE OPPOSED.  MERCANALISIS 
FIGURES ALSO INDICATED THAT CHAVEZ HAS A 51-TO-42 PERCENT 
APPROVAL RATING.  MERCANALISIS CONDUCTED ITS POLLING AFTER 
THE REPAROS PROCESS AND INTERVIEWED 900 CITIZENS IN 
VENEZUELA\'S FIVE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS. 
 
------------ 
GOV REACTION 
------------ 
 
7.  (U)  MINISTER OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION JESSE 
CHACON HAS PUBLICLY ASSERTED THAT THE POLLING DATA PRESENTED 
BY MERCANALISIS ARE FALSE AND CRITICIZED PRIVATE MEDIA 
OUTLETS FOR PUBLICIZING THEM.  CHACON CONTENDED THAT THE 
FIGURES PRESENTED BY THE POLLING RESEARCH COMPANIES DATOS AND 
    INDAGA, WHICH SHOW CHAVEZ WINNING THE REFERENDUM 51-TO-39 
PERCENT AND 51-TO-42 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTED MORE 
TRUTHFUL DATA.  CHACON ALSO POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THE 
&FABRICATED8 MERCANALISIS FIGURES STILL SHOW THAT CHAVEZ 
HAS A POSITIVE APPROVAL RATING, WHICH HE TOUTED AS AN 
INDICATION THAT CHAVEZ WILL WIN THE REFERENDUM. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  THE POLLS DIFFER, BUT WE CAN SEE THAT CHAVEZ IS NOT 
AS BADLY WOUNDED BY THE CONVOCATION OF THE REFERENDUM AS THE 
OPPOSITION HAD HOPED.  THE SOCIOECONOMIC BREAK DOWN OF THE 
GQR REFERENDUM FIGURES IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH CHAVEZ 
IS ONLY FAVORED IN THE LOWEST INCOME GROUPING, HE STILL IS 
TIED IN THE OVERALL POLL.  OPPOSITION LEADERS HOPE THAT THERE 
IS SOME AMOUNT OF \"FEAR FACTOR\" IN THESE NUMBERS THAT 
PREVENTS ANTI-CHAVISTAS IN POOR AREAS FROM EXPRESSING THEIR 
SENTIMENTS.  ALTHOUGH THIS COULD HAVE MERIT, CHAVEZ\'S CONCERN 
FOR THE POOR IS SEEN AS GENUINE AND HE STILL MAINTAINS A 
FAVORABLE OPINION RATING IN NEARLY ALL OF THE POLLING 
FIGURES.  THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS A REAL 
HORSE RACE ON ITS HANDS AND NEEDS TO GET TO WORK.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) SUPREME COURT (TSJ) JUDGE FRANKLIN ARRIECHI SPOKE 
WITH PAO AND POLOFF JUNE 23, AFTER BEING REMOVED FROM THE TSJ 
(SEE REFTEL.) ARRIECHI REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY (NA) VOTE TO REMOVE HIM. HE STATED HIS INTENTION TO 
IGNORE THE RULING, AND CONTINUE TO REPORT TO WORK IN ORDER TO 
MAINTAIN HIS RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE. HE SAID THE NA VOTE TO 
REMOVE HIM, AND THE TSJ DECISION WHICH ACCEPTED IT, WERE 
POLITICAL ACTS OF REVENGE AGAINST HIM, AND TO TAKE CONTROL OF 
THE TSJ. ARRIECHI MADE CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE 
PRO-CHAVEZ JUDGES ON THE TSJ. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
ARRIECHI REJECTS REMOVAL 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) SUPREME COURT (TSJ) JUDGE FRANKLIN ARRIECHI, WHO WAS 
    REMOVED JUNE 16 THROUGH A VOTE BY THE PRO-CHAVEZ MAJORITY OF 
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA), ATTENDED A LUNCHEON HOSTED BY 
PAO, WITH POLOFF, JUNE 23. ARRIECHI REJECTED THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) TO REMOVE HIM USING PROVISIONS OF 
THE NEWLY PASSED TSJ LAW, ARGUING THAT SUCH AN EX-POST FACTO 
USE OF THE LAW WAS PROHIBITED BY THE CONSTITUTION, DESPITE A 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER DECISION TO ACCEPT THE MOVE. HE ALSO 
DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ERRORS IN HIS NOMINATION 
MATERIALS (NOTE: ALLEGEDLY THE REASON FOR HIS REMOVAL. END 
NOTE.), STATING THAT HE HAD NOT NOMINATED HIMSELF, AND HAD 
NEVER MADE ANY UNTRUTHFUL CLAIMS ABOUT HIS PAST. ARRIECHI 
SAID HE WOULD RESIST THE REMOVAL, AND CONTINUE TO GO TO WORK 
UNTIL THEY STOPPED HIM. HE REJECTED THE TERM \"CIVIL 
DISOBEDIENCE\" WHICH THE PRESS HAS USED, HOWEVER, AND STATED 
HE WAS SURE HE WOULD BE DENIED ENTRY TO THE TSJ SHORTLY. 
ARRIECHI SAID HE WOULD EVENTUALLY BRING A CASE BEFORE THE 
INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AFTER GOING THROUGH 
THE VENEZUELAN JUDICIAL APPEALS PROCESS. HE SAID HE WOULD 
SPEND THE SUMMER AT HIS HOUSE IN THE U.S., WITH HIS FAMILY. 
 
3.  (C) ARRIECHI SAID THE REMOVAL FROM THE COURT WAS INTENDED 
TO PASS HIS POSITION AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TSJ TO TSJ 
JUDGE OMAR MORA, ESTABLISHING HIM AS THE EVENTUAL REPLACEMENT 
FOR TSJ PRESIDENT IVAN RINCON. ARRIECHI CALLED MORA A 
CHAVISTA \"TALIBAN,\" AND CLAIMED HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
VENEZUELAN COMMUNIST PARTY. ARRIECHI CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN 
SINGLED OUT FOR HIS PRO-AMERICAN VIEWS, AND TIES TO FORMER 
AMBASSADOR DONNA HRINAK. HE SAID HIS ROLE IN WRITING THE 
PLENARY CHAMBER\'S DECISION REJECTING MILITARY REBELLION 
CHARGES AGAINST THE MILITARY OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE EVENTS 
OF APRIL 11, 2002, HAD ALSO MADE HIM A TARGET OF THE GOV. 

------------ 
GLASS HOUSES 
------------ 
 
4.  (C) ARRIECHI MADE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SEVERAL MEMBERS OF 
THE TSJ. HE ACCUSED RINCON OF CORRUPTION, SPECIFICALLY OF 
ACTING AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN BUSINESSMEN AND THE 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE, HELPING TO EXPEDITE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES 
RENDERED IN RETURN FOR A PERCENTAGE. HE ALSO ACCUSED TSJ 
JUDGE JOSE DELGADO OCANDO OF HAVING A BROTHER AND A SON 
WORKING AS LEGAL CONSULTANTS FOR PDVSA, WHO HE SAID WERE 
BEING PAID ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. HE SAID DELGADO 
IDENTIFIES HIMSELF AS A \"STALINIST\" COMMUNIST, AND IS A 
MEMBER OF VENZUELAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCV). HE ALSO ACCUSED 
TSJ JUDGES CARLOS OBERTO, JUAN RAFAEL PERDOMO, ALONG WITH 
 
SIPDIS 
MORA OF BEING MEMBERS OF THE PCV. FINALLY ARRIECHI ACCUSED 
TSJ JUDGE LUIS MARTINEZ HERNANDEZ OF HAVING OFFERED TO FIX 
 
SIPDIS 
DISCIPLINARY CASES AGAINST FEMALE JUDGES IN RETURN FOR SEXUAL 
FAVORS (NOTE: THE TSJ RUNS THE LOWER COURTS IN VENEZUELA, AND 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIRING, FIRING AND DISCIPLINING LOWER 
COURT JUDGES. END NOTE.) HE ALSO ACCUSED MARTINEZ OF HAVING 
DEALINGS WITH INTERNATIONALLY WANTED DRUG DEALERS, AND OF 
 
CARACAS 00002146  002 OF 002 
 
T FOR IDEOLOGY OR FINANCIAL/LEGAL 
REASONS, THESE JUDGES WOULD BACK CHAVEZ UNTIL THE END. 
ARRIECHI SEEMED SURPRISED THERE HAD BEEN SO LITTLE OUTCRY 
AGAINST HIS REMOVAL BY OTHER JUDGES ON THE TSJ, OR THE 
OPPOSITION. HE SAID THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF A MASS RESIGNATION 
OF TSJ JUDGES IN PROTEST, DUE TO PERSONAL FINANCIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS. ARRIECHI REPORTED THAT RETIRING TSJ JUDGE 
RAFAEL PEREZ PERDOMO (ANTI-CHAVEZ) IS RESISTING THE EFFORTS 
OF ANGULO TO REPLACE HIM WITH A CHAVISTA ALTERNATE JUDGE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND THAT ARRIECHI HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
AMCIT POLITICAL CONSULTANTS ABOUT GOING TO THE U.S. TO TELL 
HIS STORY. WHILE HE MAY BE WILLING TO GIVE MORE DETAILS THAN 
HE TOLD US, VENEZUELAN POLITICAL CIRCLES ARE FULL OF STORIES 
OF CORRUPTION ON THE TSJ, IMPLICATING RINCON AND OTHER 
JUDGES. IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY THAT ARRIECHI, WHO BROKE WITH 
CHAVEZ AFTER APRIL 11, 2002, IS WITHOUT STAIN HIMSELF. WHILE 
ARRIECHI\'S REMOVAL IS EXTREMELY DISTURBING IN TERMS OF THE 
RULE OF LAW IN VENEZUELA, IT HAS NOT BEEN A MAJOR POLITICAL 
    ISSUE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE REFERENDUM.

B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ IS PERHAPS THE 
CLOSEST INTERNATIONAL ALLY OF FIDEL CASTRO.  THE TWO NATIONS\' 
TRADE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON VENEZUELA\'S CONCESSIONARY 
PETROLEUM EXPORTS TO CUBA.  THE GOV HAS NOT TAKEN ANY STEPS 
OF WHICH POST IS AWARE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO ADVANCE 
DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS IN CUBA. 
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS LITTLE JUSTIFICATION FOR RECOMMENDING A 
WAIVER FOR VENEZUELA UNDER TITLE III OF THE LIBERTAD ACT. 
GIVEN CHAVEZ\'S AFFINITY FOR EXPLAINING WORLD EVENTS IN TERMS 
OF U.S. IMPERIALISM, ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE USG AGAINST A 
VENEZUELAN COMPANY IN VIOLATION OF TITLE III WOULD HEIGHTEN 
THE GOV\'S ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC DURING A CRITICAL JUNCTURE FOR 
VENEZUELA\'S DEMOCRACY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
    --------------------------- 
CUBA-VENEZUELA RELATIONSHIP 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ HAS WORKED DURING HIS FIVE YEARS 
OF RULE TO STRENGTHEN TIES WITH THE GOC.  CHAVEZ SIGNED THE 
CUBA-VENEZUELA COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN 1998, WHICH PROVIDES 
CUBA WITH PETROLEUM AT CONCESSIONARY TERMS.  IN EXCHANGE, 
CUBAN DOCTORS, TEACHERS, AND COACHES PARTICIPATE IN GOV 
SOCIAL PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE POOR, A MAJOR COMPONENT OF 
CHAVEZ\'S SO-CALLED \"BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION.\"  THE GOC IS IN 
ARREARS IN ITS OIL PAYMENTS TO THE VENEZUELAN STATE IN 
AMOUNTS POSSIBLY EXCEEDING $1 BILLION. 
 
3. (C) WHILE CLAIMING TO DISAGREE WITH CASTRO\'S COMMUNIST 
SYSTEM, CHAVEZ NEVERTHELESS SYMPATHIZES DEEPLY WITH CASTRO TO 
THE POINT OF ADMIRATION.  CHAVEZ VIEWS CASTRO AS BRAVELY 
STANDING AGAINST U.S. HEGEMONY IN THE HEMISPHERE.  THE GOV 
DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY REASON TO PRESSURE CUBA ON 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
------------------- 
IMPACT OF TITLE III 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) CHAVEZ WIELDS ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC TO SOLIDIFY HIS 
DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND ADVANCE HIS ANTI-\"NEOLIBERAL\" VIEWS. 
WERE THE TITLE III WAIVER BE ALLOWED TO LAPSE, CHAVEZ WOULD 
USE IT FOR HIS PROPAGANDA MESSAGE TO DECRY U.S. 
UNILATERALISM.  THIS COULD AFFECT U.S. INTERESTS IN KEEPING 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM AGAINST CHAVEZ FOCUSED ON 
    THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  HOWEVER, THE AUGUST 15 REFERENDUM IS 
LIKELY TO BE WON OR LOST ON THE BASIS OF DOMESTIC ISSUES. 
 
5. (C) WE ARE NOT AWARE OF SPECIFIC VENEZUELAN PRIVATE OR 
STATE-OWNED COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE 
IMPOSITION OF TITLE III.  THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT 
VENEZUELAN STATE OIL COMPANY PDVSA MIGHT TAKE OVER OPERATION 
OF THE CIENFUEGOS OILS REFINERY, BUT AS OF NOW THE 
ARRANGEMENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED.  IT IS ALSO REPORTED THAT 
THE CUBAN STATE FOOD PURCHASING AGENCY ALIMPORT ACTS AS AN 
INTERMEDIARY IN THE PURCHASE OF COMMODITIES BY THE GOV 
MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND RELATED AGENCIES.  NUMEROUS 
VENEZUELAN FIRMS ARE SAID TO HAVE TIES WITH CUBAN 
COUNTERPARTS BUT THESE APPEAR TO BE COMMERCIAL RATHER THAN 
THE INVESTMENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE 
\"TRAFFICKING\" CONTEMPLATED BY TITLE III. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) THE GOV UNDER CHAVEZ HAS DONE NOTHING TO IMPROVE 
CUBA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY RECORD AND CANNOT BE 
EXPECTED TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION, 
THEREFORE, TO SUPPORT A WAIVER OF TITLE III OF THE LIBERTAD

CLASSIFIED BY: MARK A. WELLS, ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR, 
FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) THE GOV\'S \"MISION IDENTIDAD\" (MISSION IDENTITY) IS 
PROVIDING CEDULAS (IDENTITY CARDS) TO MASSIVE NUMBERS OF 
UNDOCUMENTED VENEZUELANS AND FOREIGNERS.  THE GOV IS WORKING 
BUSILY VIA THE MISSION TO ISSUE IDENTITY CARDS TO POTENTIAL 
VOTERS BEFORE THE JULY 10 ELECTORAL REGISTRY DEADLINE FOR THE 
AUGUST 15 REFERENDUM.  WHILE THESE EFFORTS PURPORT TO CORRECT 
AN HISTORIC INJUSTICE OF DENYING IDENTITY DOCUMENTS (AND, 
THUS, THE RIGHT TO VOTE) TO THE POOR, THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THE 
CAMPAIGN IS TO REGISTER AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE FROM 
VENEZUELA\'S LOWER CLASS, WHICH IS DECIDEDLY PRO-CHAVEZ.  THE 
MISSION USES MILITARY BASES, MOBILE CEDULA UNITS, AND 
    CUBAN-TRAINED \"SOCIAL WORKERS\" TO PROVIDE THE CEDULAS AND 
REGISTER THE VOTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
MISSION IDENTITY - OIL MONEY AND CUBAN TRAINING 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C) THE GOV LAUNCHED \"MISSION IDENTITY\" IN EARLY 2004 WITH 
A GOAL OF  PROVIDING CEDULAS (NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS) TO SIX 
MILLION CITIZENS, PARTICULARLY POOR VENEZUELANS, WHO HAVE 
HISTORICALLY HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING IDENTITY DOCUMENTS. 
STATE-RUN OIL COMPANY PDVSA PROVIDED TRUCKS FOR MOBILE UNITS, 
A PROGRAM DUBBED \"CEDULA EXPRESS.\"  THE GOV IS USING AS MANY 
AS 100 OF THESE MOBILE UNITS, AS WELL AS MILITARY BASES 
AROUND THE COUNTRY AS OUTPOSTS FOR CEDULA DISTRIBUTION. 
DANIEL CORTEZ, A FORMER GOV SUPERVISOR OF IDENTITY CARD 
OFFICIALS WHO NOW WORKS WITH THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA, 
TOLD POLOFF ON JUNE 29 THAT 800 CUBAN-TRAINED FRANCISCO DE 
MIRANDA FRONT (FFM) \"SOCIAL WORKERS\" AND VENEZUELAN ARMY 
PERSONNEL RUN MISSION IDENTITY, RATHER THAN THE MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR AND JUSTICE\'S DIRECTORATE FOR IMMIGRATION (DIEX). 
LAPTOPS AND ON-SITE CARD MAKERS CREATE A QUICK SYSTEM OF 
DISTRIBUTION, ALLOWING VENEZUELANS TO OBTAIN A CEDULA IN LESS 
THAN 20 MINUTES.  DIEX DIRECTOR GENERAL CABEZAS TOLD 
REPORTERS IN JUNE THAT TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED 
CEDULAS SINCE THE NEW AUTOMATED SYSTEM STARTED IN OCTOBER 
2003.  CORTEZ CONFIRMED THIS ESTIMATE TO POLOFF, BUT 
CAUTIONED THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE NEW CEDULAS ARE 
MERELY REPLACEMENTS FOR OLD CEDULAS. 
------------------- 
PAPER-THIN SECURITY 
    ------------------- 
 
3. (C) RINCON ASSERTS THAT THE NEW VENEZUELAN CEDULAS ARE 
SOME OF THE MOST SECURE IDENTITY CARDS IN THE WORLD.  THE 
FINGER PRINT, SECURITY PAPER, AND LAMINATION GIVE THE CEDULAS 
\"AN ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE OF SECURITY,\" RINCON TOLD REPORTERS. 
DISPLAYING BOTH NEW AND OLD CEDULAS, CORTEZ POINTED OUT HOW 
SECURITY FEATURES HAVE DIMINISHED IN THE NEW CEDULA.  BEYOND 
THE PHYSICAL SECURITY FEATURES, THE CEDULAS ARE NOT RELIABLE 
BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  VENEZUELAN OR FOREIGNER, 
LITTLE DOCUMENTATION IS NEEDED AT THE MOBILE UNITS TO SECURE 
A CEDULA, SAID CORTEZ, WHO REPORTED THAT HE REPLACED HIS OWN 
CEDULA SIMPLY BY TELLING THE OFFICIAL HIS IDENTITY NUMBER. 
OPPOSITION GROUPS CLAIM THAT THE GOV IS GIVING CEDULAS TO 
FOREIGNERS WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION IN ATTEMPT TO ADD MORE 
CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS TO THE VOTING REGISTRY.  CAUSA R, A 
LEFT-WING OPPOSITION PARTY, HAS ACCUSED THE GOV OF ILLEGALLY 
NATURALIZING \"THOUSANDS OF FOREIGNERS AND THOUSANDS OF 
CRIMINALS TO FILL THE VOTING REGISTRY.\"  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE 
HEARD REPORTS THAT THE GOV IS USING A LIST OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
SIGNED THE REAFIRMAZO (THE PETITIONS TO RECALL PRESIDENT HUGO 
CHAVEZ) TO DENY CEDULAS AND, THUS, DISCRIMINATE AGAINST 
CHAVEZ OPPONENTS.  ONE PRESS STORY SHOWED TWO PEOPLE WHO 
SIGNED WHO WERE DENIED CEDULAS AT A MOBILE SITE.  THEY WERE 
TOLD THEY WOULD HAVE TO APPLY DIRECTLY WITH DIEX, A PROCESS 
THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS. 
 
CARACAS 00002153  002 OF 002 
 
--------------- 
 
4. (C) PART OF THE CAMPAIGN TO REGISTER MORE VOTERS INCLUDES 
THE NATURALIZATION OF FOREIGNERS.  CORTEZ, WHO LEFT HIS DIEX 
POST IN JANUARY, TOLD POLOFF THAT 16,000 FOREIGNERS WERE 
NATURALIZED IN MARCH.  IN JUNE, THE GOV NATURALIZED 105,000 
FOREIGNERS WITHIN ONE WEEK, PART OF ITS GOAL TO NATURALIZE 
200,000 BEFORE JULY 10.  (NOTE: THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF 
NATURALIZATIONS PER YEAR PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN 3,000 TO 4,000. 
END NOTE.)  THE NATURALIZED CITIZENS WILL RECEIVE CEDULAS AND 
BE REGISTERED TO VOTE IMMEDIATELY.  PART OF THE GOV 
REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN, THE NATURALIZATION EVENTS HAVE A CLEAR 
POLITICAL BENT.  AT A NATURALIZATION CEREMONY ON JUNE 25, 
VICE PRESIDENT JOSE VICENTE RANGEL ASKED THE NEWLY 
NATURALIZED CITIZENS HOW THEY WOULD VOTE IN THE AUGUST 15 
REFERENDUM.  AFTER EXHORTING EVERYONE TO VOTE \"NO,\" HE 
PROCLAIMED, \"THERE IS NOT ONE VOTE FOR \'YES\' (TO REVOKE 
CHAVEZ).\" 
 
----------------------- 
REFERENDUM IMPLICATIONS 
    ----------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE CNE ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE OVER THREE MILLION 
VENEZUELANS WHO ARE NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE.  MISSION IDENTITY 
PERSONNEL, AFTER ISSUING CEDULAS, ALSO FILL OUT CNE VOTER 
APPLICATIONS FOR THE RECIPIENTS.  CORTEZ ESTIMATED THAT GOV 
EFFORTS COULD INCREASE THE VOTER REGISTRATION POOL FROM 12 
MILLION TO 14 MILLION PEOPLE FOR THE AUGUST 15 REFERENDUM. 
MVR DEPUTY JUAN BARRETO TOLD POLOFF THAT VOTER REGISTRATION 
AND MOBILIZATION OF LOWER CLASS VENEZUELANS IS A PRINCIPAL 
PART OF THE GOV REFERENDUM STRATEGY (SEE REFTEL).  BARRETO 
SAID BARRIO ADENTRO (THE GOV MISSION TO PLACE CUBAN DOCTORS 
IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS) DOCTORS ARE IDENTIFYING PATIENTS 
WITHOUT CEDULAS AND FFM \"SOCIAL WORKERS\" ARE THEN HELPING THE 
PATIENTS ACQUIRE CEDULAS.  THE GOV IS ALSO RUNNING MULTI-PAGE 
ADVERTISEMENTS IN STATE-RUN NEWSPAPERS TO ENCOURAGE VOTER 
REGISTRATION AND PUBLICIZE THE 600 VOTER REGISTRATION CENTERS 
OPERATED BY THE CNE.  CARACAS DAILY TAL CUAL REPORTED JUNE 
29, HOWEVER, THAT ONLY 246,938 NEW NAMES HAD BEEN REGISTERED 
IN THE ELECTORAL REGISTRY IN APRIL AND MAY, SUGGESTING THE 
CHAVISTAS ARE RUNNING SHORT OF THEIR GOAL. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) HAVING AN IDENTITY DOCUMENT IS A MAJOR BOOST FOR 
FACILITATING THE DAILY LIFE OF VENEZUELANS.  MANY OF THE 
COLOMBIANS RECEIVING CEDULAS HAVE LIVED IN VENEZUELA FOR 
YEARS, EVEN DECADES, AND SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED CEDULAS LONG 
AGO.  THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT A CEDULA 
    CAMPAIGN BEFORE AN ELECTORAL EVENT IS VALID, BUT THE GOV IS 
UNABASHEDLY LINKING CEDULAS TO VOTES FOR CHAVEZ.  IT IS HARD 
FOR THE OPPOSITION TO DENOUNCE THE PROGRAM AT THE RISK OF 
APPEARING TO OPPOSE POOR PEOPLE HAVING IDENTITY CARDS.  WE DO 
NOT BELIEVE CHAVEZ WILL WIN THE REFERENDUM WITH THIS PLAN 
ALONE.  AS THE FIRMAZO DEMONSTRATED, MANY POOR PEOPLE ARE 
CAPABLE OF RECEIVING BENEFITS FROM THE GOV ON THE ONE HAND, 
AND STILL EXPRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GOV.  HOWEVER, GIVEN 
THE POOR\'S TENDENCY TO SUPPORT CHAVEZ, THE \"CEDULA EXPRESS\" 
PROGRAM COULD MEAN NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL NUMBERS OF VOTES FOR 
CHAVEZ ON AUGUST 15.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) A GROUP OF OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS ATTACKED A 
PRO-CHAVEZ COMANDO MAISANTA CAMPAIGN TEAM IN THE WEALTHY ALTO 
PRADO AREA OF CARACAS ON JUNE 27. A STATE TELEVISION REPORTER 
WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND, AND A CHAVEZ CAMPAIGN WORKER WAS 
HIT IN THE HEAD AND LEFT BLEEDING. THE INCIDENT IS BEING USED 
BY PRO-CHAVEZ MEDIA, AND BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ HIMSELF, TO 
PORTRAY THE OPPOSITION AS VIOLENT AND UNBALANCED. SOME 
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS AND JOURNALISTS HAVE BLAMED THE 
CHAVISTAS FOR THE ATTACK, CALLING THE ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH 
THEMSELVES IN AN OPPOSITION NEIGHBORHOOD A PROVOCATION. THE 
MEDIA HAS BEEN MIXED, WITH SOME OPPOSITION PAPERS STRONGLY 
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK AS A SIGN OF INTOLERANCE. SEVERAL 
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN IN MEETINGS 
WITH POLOFFS RECENTLY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ACTS OF 
VIOLENCE BY OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN THE EVENT CHAVEZ IS 
REVOKED. END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
VIOLENCE IN ALTO PRADO 
---------------------- 

2.  (U) A GROUP OF OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS ATTACKED A GROUP OF 
CHAVEZ CAMPAIGN WORKERS WHEN THEY TRIED TO MOUNT A BOOTH FOR 
THE COMANDO MAISANTA (CHAVEZ\' CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE) IN THE 
WEALTHY ALTO PRADO AREA OF CARACAS ON JUNE 27. A REPORTER 
FROM VENEZUELAN DE TELEVISION (VTV), THE GOVERNMENT STATION, 
WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND, ONE OF THE CHAVISTA CAMPAIGN 
WORKERS WAS LEFT BLEEDING FROM THE HEAD, AND AN ANGLICAN 
PRIEST PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT HAD TO BE LED AWAY BY THE 
LOCAL POLICE FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION. THE CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS 
ATTEMPTED TO SET UP A CAMPAIGN TENT IN A PUBLIC PARK, WITHOUT 
THE REQUIRED PERMITS ACCORDING TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THERE 
ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE CHAVISTAS WERE PLAYING LOAD 
MUSIC, TRYING TO HARASS DRIVERS, AND THROWING ROCKS AT CARS, 
CAUSING A CROWD TO FORM. OTHER REPORTS, HOWEVER, INDICATE THE 
PEOPLE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD REACTED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE 
CHAVISTAS IN A HOSTILE MANNER IMMEDIATELY. 
 
----------------- 
CHAVISTA REACTION 
----------------- 
 
3.  (U) CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS PORTRAYED THE OPPOSITION AS 
VIOLENT, FASCIST, RACIST, AND IRRATIONAL. PRESIDENT CHAVEZ, 
ON HIS \"ALO, PRESIDENTE!\" PROGRAM, ASKED GOD TO FORGIVE THE 
OPPOSITION, SAYING \"LORD, FORGIVE THEM, FOR THEY KNOW NOT 
WHAT THEY DO.\" CHAVEZ BLAMED THE PRIVATE MEDIA FOR \"PUTTING 
THE DEVIL INSIDE PEOPLE, DRIVING THEM MAD.\" CHAVEZ INSIDER 
AND MIRANDA STATE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE DIOSDADO CABELLO 
TOLD SUPPORTERS JUNE 30 THAT ONE DAY OF RULE BY THE 
OPPOSITION WOULD RESEMBLE THE EVENTS OF APRIL, 2002: 
    VIOLENCE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND REVENGE. THE ALTO PRADO 
INCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE DAY OF THE PRESS, AND THE CHAVISTA 
PRESS CONDEMNED THE FAILURE OF THE OPPOSITION TO RESPECT THE 
PRO-GOV PRESS. A PROSECUTOR WAS ASSIGNED TO THE CASE OF 
ROMELIA MATUTE, THE VTV REPORTER THROWN TO THE GROUND, AND 
SHE WAS GIVEN TWO POLICE ESCORTS TO PROTECT HER, BECAUSE SHE 
LIVES IN ALTO PRADO. IT IS POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE ARRESTS IN 
THE CASE. 
 
---------- 
OPPOSITION 
---------- 
 
4.  (U) THE REACTION OF THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN MIXED. 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) DEPUTY GERARDO BLYDE (PRIMERO 
JUSTICIA) AND EL UNIVERSAL COLUMNIST ROBERTO GUISTI CONDEMNED 
THE CHAVISTAS FOR PROVOKING THE VIOLENCE, AND RECALLED 
PREVIOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE BY CHAVISTAS AGAINST THE 
OPPOSITION. MOST OPPOSITION POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE NOT 
COMMENTED ON THE INCIDENT. THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP PROVEA 
CALLED THE ATTACK \"PROFOUNDLY IRRATIONAL,\" WHILE TEODORO 
 
CARACAS 00002158  002 OF 002 
 
IOLENT. EL GLOBO HARSHLY 
ATTACKED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE, CALLING IT 
\"UNACCEPTABLE,\" \"INFANTILE,\" AND \"A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT.\"  OTHER OPPOSITION PAPERS HAVE MADE NO 
EDITORIAL COMMENT, AND SOME HAVE NOT GIVEN THE INCIDENT MUCH 
COVERAGE. 
 
----------------- 
WHAT LIES BENEATH 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) NA DEPUTY PASTOR HEYDRA (ACCION DEMOCRATICA) TOLD 
POLOFF ON JUNE 28 THAT HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN THE EVENT 
CHAVEZ IS REVOKED. HE SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION IS POWERED BY 
LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NGOS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MORE RADICAL IN 
THEIR ANTI-CHAVISMO THAN THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES. HE 
SAID THE CD IS NOT GETTING ITS MESSAGE OUT ABOUT 
RECONCILIATION AND UNITY BECAUSE MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION\'S 
SUPPORTERS REJECT IT. NA DEPUTY ERNESTO ALVARENGA 
(SOLIDARIDAD) TOLD POLOFF JUNE 16 THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THAT 
THE OPPOSITION DID NOT TRULY ACCEPT EX-CHAVISTAS, AND THAT 
THE FEAR AMONG CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS OF A WAVE OF REPRESSION 
AGAINST THEM SHOULD CHAVEZ BE REVOKED WAS NOT UNFOUNDED. 

------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) THIS INCIDENT IS A REMINDER THAT OPPOSITION 
RANK-AND-FILE ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF VIOLENCE, THOUGH CHAVISTA 
VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN STRONGER AND MORE 
FREQUENT (E.G., THE JUNE 3 BEATING OF CONGRESSMAN RAFAEL 
MARIN -- WHICH PUT HIM IN INTENSIVE CARE -- AND GUNSHOTS 
FIRED THAT DAY MEDIA OFFICES AND THE CARACAS MAYOR\'S OFFICE), 
.  IT IS POSSIBLE THE ALTO PRADO PRO-CHAVEZ PRESENCE WAS 
INITIATED WITH THE HOPE THE ANTI-CHAVEZ NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD 
REACT EMOTIONALLY AND VIOLENTLY TO THE CAMPAIGN WORKERS.  WE 
CAN PROBABLY EXPECT THE CHAVISTAS TO TRY TO REPLICATE THE 
INCIDENT.  CHAVEZ WANTS TO PAINT THE OPPOSITION AS PRONE TO 
VIOLENCE AND REVENGE, THEREBY CREATING FEAR FOR WHAT WOULD 
COME SHOULD CHAVEZ BE REVOKED.  THIS WILL COMPLICATE THE 
COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA\'S EFFORTS TO CLAIM THEY ARE FOR 
UNITY AND RECONCILIATION.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2014 
TAGS: ECON, PGOV, VE 
SUBJECT: BOLIVAR: POLITICS AND ECONOMICS IN THE LAND OF 
HEAVY INDUSTRY 
 
REF: CARACAS 1549 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR RICHARD M. SANDERS FOR REASONS 1.5 B 
AND D 
 
1. SUMMARY: (SBU) THE STATE OF BOLIVAR, BY FAR THE LARGEST IN 
VENEZUELA IN AREA, IS A REGION WITH ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE MUCH 
HIGHER THAN ITS RELATIVELY LOW POPULATION WOULD INDICATE. 
(BOLIVAR PRODUCES 100% OF VENEZUELAN ALUMINUM AND GOLD, 90% 
OF ITS STEEL, AND ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF ITS ELECTRICITY.) 
DURING ECONOFF\'S VISIT TO THE STATE, CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
PRO-OPPOSITION GOVERNOR, HIS PRO-CHAVEZ CHALLENGER, THE HEAD 
OF GOV-OWNED INDUSTRIAL COMBINE CORPORACION VENEZOLANA DE 
GUAYANA (CVG), THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF PRIVATIZED FIRM 
SIDOR (VENEZUELA\'S MAJOR STEEL PRODUCER), AND REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PAINTED A PICTURE IN WHICH BIG INDUSTRY 
DOES RELATIVELY WELL WHILE THE REST OF THE ECONOMY STRUGGLES, 
AND IN WHICH PRO- AND ANTI-CHAVEZ POLITICAL FORCES BOTH CLAIM 
THE EDGE.  CVG\'S DOMINANCE MAY TIP THE BALANCE IN FAVOR OF 
CHAVEZ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
POLITICS IN THE PROVINCE 
------------------------ 
 
    2. (C) ECONOFF MET JUNE 29 WITH GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROJAS 
SUAREZ, ELECTED IN 2000 AS A PRO-GOV CANDIDATE, AND WHO 
OFFICIALLY SPLIT FROM CHAVEZ\'S FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT (MVR) 
LAST YEAR.  ROJAS HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION, BUT LAMENTED THE LACK OF FUNDS FROM THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  HE NOTED THIS IS A PROBLEM WHICH AFFECTS 
ALL STATES, NOT ONLY THOSE WITH GOVERNORS WHO OPPOSE CHAVEZ. 
THE GOV IS CONSTITUTIONALLY OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF ITS GROSS INCOME TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, BUT ROJAS 
SAID THE LAST PAYMENT WAS OVER THREE MONTHS AGO, AND 
DISBURSEMENTS THEN WERE LESS THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  IN 
ADDITION, HIS STATE HAS NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE BOLIVAR IN 3 
FULL YEARS FROM THE DECENTRALIZATION INVESTMENT FUND (FIDES, 
AN ENTITY CREATED IN 1993 TO ASSIST IN THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS 
TO THE STATES, AND LAUDED BY THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AS 
RECENTLY AS IN ITS JUNE NEWSLETTER). 
 
3. (C) ECONOFF ALSO MET JUNE 30 WITH FRANCISCO RANGEL GOMEZ, 
THE HEAD OF COMANDO MAISANTA (PRO-CHAVEZ RECALL CAMPAIGN 
STRUCTURE), WHO ALSO RECENTLY RESIGNED AFTER FOUR YEARS AS 
PRESIDENT OF STATE INDUSTRIAL COMBINE CVG TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR 
OF BOLIVAR LATER THIS YEAR.  HE COMPLAINED THAT ROJAS HAD 
DONE NOTHING IN HIS TERM, BUT THEN CONCEDED THAT THE BRAND 
NEW AIRPORT TERMINAL WAS IMPRESSIVE.  HE PRAISED THE WORKING 
OF THE VARIOUS GOV \"MISSIONS\" IN BOLIVAR, STATING THAT THEY 
WERE NOT RUN THROUGH EXISTING GOV INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THOSE 
AGENCIES WERE \"DISASTERS.\"  HE ADDED THAT CHAVEZ\'S FIVE YEARS 
IN OFFICE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TIME TO REFORM THOSE 
AGENCIES, GIVEN THE \"OIL STRIKE\" AND THE \"COUP.\"  WHEN 
ECONOFF POINTED OUT THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PLANNED FOR 
THOSE EVENTS, HE SAID \"FIVE YEARS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH 
    ANYWAY.\" 
 
4. (C) REFERENDUM.  BOTH ROJAS AND RANGEL EXPRESSED OPTIMISM 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM, LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. 
ROJAS THOUGHT ONLY A SLIM MAJORITY WOULD VOTE AGAINST CHAVEZ 
LOCALLY, GIVEN THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PRO-CHAVEZ STATES, 
WHILE RANGEL PREDICTED A LANDSLIDE FOR CHAVEZ BY A 
THREE-TO-ONE MARGIN.  RANGEL DISMISSED ALL CHANCES OF AN 
OPPOSITION WIN.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE FIRMAZO/REPARO PETITION 
PROCESS WAS \"THE BEST POLL OF ALL\" AND IT HAD PROVED THAT THE 
OPPOSITION WOULD GET LESS THAN 2.5 MILLION VOTES, ESPECIALLY 
GIVEN THAT THE FINAL NUMBER OF APPROVED SIGNATURES INCLUDED 
\"THE DEAD AND THE FRAUDS.\"  HE SAID THAT CHAVEZ TOLD HIM AT 
THE TIME OF THE REPAROS THAT HE WOULD GO TO REFERENDUM AS 
LONG AS IT WERE CLOSE, EVEN IF THERE WEREN\'T QUITE ENOUGH 
SIGNATURES TO TRIGGER IT.  ROJAS AVOIDED NUMERICAL 
PREDICTIONS, BUT THOUGHT THE OPPOSITION WOULD OVERCOME THE 
MANY OBSTACLES THAT THE GOV IS SURE TO PLACE BEFORE THEM, 
SUCH AS CVG DIVERTING MONEY FROM INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO FUND 
THE CAMPAIGN LOCALLY. 
 
5. (C) ELECTIONS.  ROJAS WILL RUN FOR RE-ELECTION, THIS TIME 
REPRESENTING THE OPPOSITION.  HE STATED THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO 
ACHIEVING AGREEMENT FROM ALL PARTIES TO BE THE CONSENSUS 
 
CARACAS 00002172  002 OF 003 
 
UT.  INDEED, HE EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT THE COPEI CANDIDATE MAY HAVE REACHED AN 
AGREEMENT WITH THE MVR TO RUN AND TIP THE BALANCE TOWARD 
RANGEL BY SIPHONING VOTES FROM ROJAS.  ROJAS CALLED RANGEL A 
SERIOUS CANDIDATE, GIVEN HIS EXPERIENCE (HE WAS A GENERAL 
BEFORE RUNNING CVG) AND POSITIVE RESULTS AT CVG.  RANGEL 
REFUSED TO CONSIDER DEFEAT A POSSIBILITY, AND DISMISSED ROJAS 
AS A \"NOBODY.\"  HE SAID THAT THE NEW COMANDO MAISANTA WAS 
\"TOTALLY DIFFERENT\" FROM COMANDO AYACUCHO AND PREVIOUS MVR 
CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATIONS, BUT LATER MENTIONED THAT IT WAS 
STAFFED BY VIRTUALLY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO RAN THEM. 
 
6. (C) RANGEL MADE THREE OTHER COMMENTS OF INTEREST.  THE 
FIRST, WHEN ECONOFF MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING 
OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, WAS 
THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY CERTAIN THAT CHAVEZ WOULD ACCEPT MORE 
OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH THE USG AS SOON AS HE RECEIVED \"ONE 
FRIENDLY SIGNAL\" FROM SOMEONE HIGHER UP IN THE USG, RATHER 
THAN STATEMENTS SUCH AS THOSE OF A/S NORIEGA.  THE SECOND WAS 
THAT SENATOR KERRY\'S MOST RECENT STATEMENT ON VENEZUELA WAS 
\"WELL RECEIVED\" BY THE GOV.  (RANGEL INTERPRETED IT AS 
SUPPORT FOR THE CNE AND ACCEPTANCE IN ADVANCE OF THE RECALL 
RESULT.)  THE THIRD WAS THAT THERE WAS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION IN VENEZUELA.  WHEN ECONOFF MENTIONED A JOURNALIST 
    (PATRICIA POLEO) WHO IS FACING CHARGES, RANGEL SAID \"BUT 
SHE\'S FREE.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
BIG INDUSTRIES BOOMING, OPTIMISTIC 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) MIGUEL DELFINO, CFO OF SIDOR (ORINOCO IRON AND 
STEEL, A FORMER CVG COMPONENT WHICH WAS 60% PRIVATIZED IN 
1997), PRESENTED A VERY POSITIVE PICTURE.  EFFICIENCY NEARLY 
DOUBLED FROM 1999 TO 2002, LEADING TO CURRENT PRODUCTION 
BEING AT NEAR-RECORD HIGHS.  DOMESTIC SALES IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF 2004 WERE UP 67% FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002 
(PRE-GENERAL STRIKE), THOUGH DELFINO ALLOWED THAT AN UNKNOWN 
PART OF THESE SALES WERE ENDING UP IN COLOMBIA.  (SINCE ALL 
SIDOR SALES ARE ALL BASED ON DOLLAR PRICES AT THE OFFICIAL, 
FIXED RATE OF EXCHANGE, A BLACK MARKET SALE FOR EXPORT WOULD 
BE PROFITABLE FOR LOCALS, GIVEN THE HIGHER PARALLEL RATE.) 
THE ONLY REASON THAT PRODUCTION IS NOT CURRENTLY AT AN 
ALL-TIME RECORD, ACCORDING TO DELFINO, WAS THE 2004 STEEL 
STRIKE (SEE REF), WHICH WAS ONLY RESOLVED WITH GOVERNMENT 
INTERVENTION.  (NOTE: TO END THE STRIKE, THE GOV, 40% OWNER 
OF SIDOR, AGREED TO TRANSFER 20% OF OWNERSHIP TO SIDOR 
EMPLOYEES.  THIS WAS A STIPULATION OF THE 1997 PRIVATIZATION 
AGREEMENT, BUT THE GOV HAD NEVER MOVED ON IT UNTIL THE STRIKE 
STOPPED CRITICAL STEEL DELIVERIES TO PDVSA.  END NOTE) 
 
8. (C) RAFAEL SANCHEZ MARQUEZ, THE GOV-APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF 
CVG, THE GOV-OWNED CONSORTIUM OF BASIC INDUSTRIES (WHICH 
DOMINATE BOLIVAR STATE AND INCLUDE HYDROELECTRICITY, GOLD, 
ALUMINUM AND LUMBER), WAS SIMILARLY OPTIMISTIC.  HE CITED THE 
    TURN-AROUND OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS FROM PREVIOUS 
MISMANAGEMENT (PRIOR TO RANGEL\'S TENURE, ONLY ONE OF CVG\'S 
BUSINESSES, THE ELECTRIC PRODUCTION, TURNED A PROFIT; NOW 
ONLY ONE IS OPERATING AT A LOSS) AND LISTED NUMEROUS NEW 
PROJECTS THAT WERE UNDERWAY OR ABOUT TO BEGIN.  HE WAS ALSO 
PROUD OF CVG\'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE GOV MISSIONS (ESPECIALLY 
THE NUMBER OF CUBAN DOCTORS - ONE THOUSAND - WHO ARE IN 
BOLIVAR WITH BARRIO ADENTRO), THOUGH SAID THAT CVG 
PARTICIPATION WAS LIMITED TO LOGISTICS, TRANSPORTATION, AND 
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN FUNDS. 
 
---------------------------------- 
PRIVATE SECTOR DISCOURAGED AT BEST 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES, IN A ROUND-TABLE 
MEETING, EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION, POSSIBLY BORDERING ON 
DESPERATION.  BOLIVAR SEEMS TO HAVE FELT THE ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN MORE THAN MUCH OF VENEZUELA, AT LEAST IN AREAS NOT 
DEPENDENT ON THE BASIC INDUSTRIES.  SOME PONDERED THAT THIS 
MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE CAPITAL.  SEVERAL 
EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HAVING U.S. REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
VARIOUS INDUSTRIES (TOURISM, MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURE, 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH) COME TO BOLIVAR FOR PROFESSIONAL 
 
CARACAS 00002172  003 OF 003 
 
 THE FACT THAT, DESPITE 
PROXIMITY, MORE TOURISTS CAME TO BOLIVAR FROM AT LEAST FOUR 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAN FROM THE U.S. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) WHILE BOLIVAR HAS ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF THE VENEZUELAN 
POPULATION, IT IS IMPORTANT AS AN ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 
FOR VENEZUELA.  THE STATE ECONOMY OVERALL SEEMS TO BE DOING 
FAIRLY WELL, CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE MAJOR 
INDUSTRIES (CVG AND PRIVATIZED), BUT THE SMALLER BUSINESSES 
ARE CLEARLY FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN, AND THE CONCOMITANT LACK OF FOREIGN INTEREST IN NEW 
INVESTMENT.  WHILE CVG AND SIDOR CAN EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO 
WELL, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE REST OF THE ECONOMY WILL 
APPROVE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE BY THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IN ITS MACROECONOMIC POLICIES OR 
WILLINGNESS TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO PRIME THE PUMP AT THE 
STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL.  POLITICALLY, THE SHEER DOMINANCE OF 
THE STATE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX GIVES PRO-CHAVEZ FORCES AN EDGE 
IN BOTH THE REFERENDUM AND GUBERNATORIAL RACE THAT MAY BE 
HARD FOR THE OPPOSITION TO OVERCOME.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, VE 
SUBJECT: CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL RECALL TIMELINE 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C)  AS VENEZUELA APPROACHES THE AUGUST 15 PRESIDENTIAL 
RECALL VOTE, UNCERTAINTY REMAINS OVER POSSIBLE DELAYS IN THE 
RECALL PROCESS AND EXACTLY WHICH EVENT--THE RECALL VOTE OR 
THE RELEASE OF THE OFFICIAL RESULTS--MUST OCCUR BEFORE AUGUST 
19 TO PREVENT TRIGGERING ARTICLE 233 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
ARTICLE 233 STATES THAT IF THE PRESIDENT IS REMOVED IN THE 
LAST TWO YEARS OF HIS TERM, HIS VICE PRESIDENT ASSUMES POWER. 
 WHILE SOME OPPOSITION LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT THAT SHOULD 
CHAVEZ LOSE THE RECALL VOTE, THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL 
(CNE) OR THE SUPREME COURT (TSJ) WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DELAY 
THE PROCESS, NEITHER INSTITUTION IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE ANY 
CLARIFICATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
DATE OF RECALL VERSUS DATE OF OFFICIAL RESULTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) ACCORDING TO THE CNE\'S TIMELINE, FOLLOWING THE 
    PRESIDENTIAL RECALL VOTE ON AUGUST 15, THE CNE HAS THREE DAYS 
TO TABULATE THE RESULTS AND WILL PUBLISH THEM BY SEPTEMBER 2. 
 SOME OPPOSITION MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED THAT IF CHAVEZ THINKS 
THAT HE IS LOSING THE REFERENDUM HE MAY ARGUE THAT IS NOT 
TECHNICALLY REMOVED UNTIL THE CNE PUBLISHES THE RESULTS.  A 
CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERT, TULIO ALVAREZ, STATED THAT IT IS NOT 
CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION IF THE PRESIDENT IS 
REVOKED ON THE DATE OF THE ELECTION OR WHEN THE CNE PUBLISHES 
THE OFFICIAL RESULTS.  IN ALVAREZ\'S OPINION, CHAVEZ\'S LAST 
TWO YEARS DO NOT START UNTIL JANUARY 10, 2005.  SO AS LONG AS 
THE RECALL IS HELD BEFORE JANUARY, HE ASSERTS, ARTICLE 233 
SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED. 
 
3.  (C) FELIPE MUJICA, PRESIDENT OF MOVIMIENTO AL SOCIALISMO 
(MAS) TOLD POLOFFS JUNE 17 THAT THE LAW IS ON THE 
OPPOSITION\'S SIDE AND THAT HE IS CONFIDENT THAT SHOULD CHAVEZ 
LOSE THE RECALL VOTE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TRY TO ARGUE 
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FOLLOW-ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
BECAUSE THE PUBLICATION OF THE RESULTS WILL OCCUR AFTER 
AUGUST 19.  BORGES STATED ON JUNE 18 THAT THE VENEZUELAN 
PEOPLE WOULD NOT PERMIT SUCH A MOVE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND 
CLAIMED CHAVEZ WOULD DO NOT ATTEMPT SUCH A STRATEGY FOR FEAR 
OF LOSING LEGITIMACY IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
 
----------------------- 
NO SIGN FROM CNE OR TSJ 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C)  THE CNE HAS BEEN SILENT ON THE DEBATE AND THE TSJ 
VAGUE.  TSJ RULING OF JUNE 15 DETERMINED  THAT CHAVEZ THAT 
    CHAVEZ COULD RUN IN 2006 IF RECALLED, BUT DID NOT ANNOUNCE 
WHETHER CHAVEZ COULD RUN IN THE IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-ON ELECTION 
SHOULD HE BE RECALLED.  (NOTE: TSJ PRESIDENT RINCON PRIVATELY 
TOLD THE AMBASSADOR EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT IF CHAVEZ WERE 
RECALLED, HE WOULD PERMIT HIM TO RUN IN THE FOLLOW-ON 
ELECTION.)  COPEI DEPUTY CESAR PEREZ VIVAS HAS REQUESTED 
CLARIFICATION FROM THE TSJ, BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT 
THE COURT WILL RESPOND. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
SPECULATIONS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUND 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE RELATIVE SILENCE IN THE CNE AND TSJ HAS LED TO 
SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES.  BORGES TOLD POLOFFS THAT HE 
BELIEVED THAT THE TSJ DID NOT RULE ON WHETHER CHAVEZ COULD 
RUN IN A FOLLOW-ON ELECTION TO UNDERMINE OPPOSITION EFFORTS 
TO UNITE AROUND A SINGLE CANDIDATE.  BORGES SPECULATED THAT 
IF MEMBERS OF THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA (CD) THOUGHT THAT 
CHAVEZ WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RUN, THEN THE THERE WOULD BE LESS 
 
CARACAS 00002183  002 OF 002 
 
THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN 
ARTICLE 233 SHOULD BE INVOKED TO WIN THE RECALL BECAUSE 
NEITHER CHAVISTAS NOR OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS WANT VICE 
PRESIDENT RANGEL TO BECOME PRESIDENT. 
 
6. (C) ANOTHER RUMOR SWIRLING AROUND THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT 
IS THAT CHAVEZ IS WORKING WITH LEFTIST MEMBERS OF THE CD, 
PROBABLY MAS OR CAUSA R.  ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY, IF CHAVEZ 
LOSES THE RECALL, HE WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE OPPOSITION TO 
NAME A TRANSITIONAL PRESIDENT, AND THUS BYPASS THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM FOR SUCCESSION.  PRESIDENT OF CAUSA 
R, ANDRES VELASQUEZ, ON JUNE 22 TOLD POLOFFS A DIFFERENT 
VERSION OF THE RUMOR, STATING THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT CHAVEZ 
WAS GOING TO DELAY THE RECALL UNTIL AFTER AUGUST 19 AND 
NEGOTIATE WITH UNKNOWN ELEMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION ON WHO 
WOULD BE THE TRANSITIONAL PRESIDENT. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C)  NEITHER THE CNE NOR THE TSJ ARE LIKELY TO PROVIDE ANY 
CLARIFICATION TO THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE PRESIDENTIAL 
RECALL PROCESS.  IT SERVES CHAVEZ\'S INTERESTS TO KEEP THIS 
    POINT FUZZY UNTIL THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM ARE KNOWN, 
AND WHEN CHAVEZ CAN JUDGE WHAT BEST SUITS HIS INTERESTS AND 
WHAT HE CAN AND CANNOT GET AWAY WITH.

CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES STEPHEN MCFARLAND; FOR REASONS 1.4(B) 
AND (D) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY ROGER RONDON (PODEMOS) 
ATTACKED THE RULING FIFTH REPUBLIC MOVEMENT (MVR) AND HAD HIS 
HANDS SLAPPED AS A CONSEQUENCE AFTER A WEEK-LONG MID-JUNE 
CAMPAIGN TO BRING A VOTE OF CENSURE AGAINST MINISTER OF 
ENERGY AND MINES RAFAEL RAMIREZ_.  RONDON FAILED TO BRING THE 
VOTE TO THE FLOOR OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND WAS STRIPPED 
OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION PRESIDENCY AS WELL AS HIS MEMBERSHIP 
IN HIS PRO-GOV PARTY.   SINCE THEN, THE MAVERICK RONDON HAS 
CRITICIZED OTHER CHAVEZ LOYALISTS, ALLEGING MOST RECENTLY 
THAT THE GOV HAD STAGED THE INCIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN 
\"PARAMILITARIES\" TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE RUN-UP TO THE 
AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ENERGY MINISTER RAMIREZ_ 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ON JUNE 10, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY ROGER RONDON, 
THEN PRESIDENT OF THE PERMANENT ENERGY COMMISSION OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, REQUESTED THAT THE ASSEMBLY\'S PLENARY 
CENSURE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINES RAFAEL RAMIREZ_.  RONDON 
    REPORTEDLY REQUESTED THE CENSURE VOTE BECAUSE RAMIREZ_ HAD 
FAILED ON FOUR OCCASIONS TO RESPOND TO SUMMONSES FROM THE 
COMMISSION TO TESTIFY ON ISSUES SUCH AS GAS PRICING AND 
DOMESTIC FUEL DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS.  AFTER A WEEK-LONG 
CAMPAIGN, HOWEVER, RONDON WAS UNABLE TO BRING THE VOTE TO THE 
FLOOR.  HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY STRIPPED OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE 
ENERGY AND MINES COMMISSION AND OF HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THE 
PODEMOS PARTY. 
 
3. (C) DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST RAMIREZ_, RONDON MADE A 
NUMBER OF OTHER ALLEGATIONS, CHARGING RAMIREZ_ (AND HIS WIFE 
AND MOTHER-IN-LAW) WITH CORRUPTION AND MISMANAGEMENT. 
ATTORNEY IVAN LARA, STAFF DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY AND MINES 
COMMISSION, TOLD ECONOFF JUNE 28 THAT CERTAIN OF RONDON\'S 
ALLEGATIONS, SUCH AS HIS CHARGE THAT THE MINSTER HAD 
ILLEGALLY SIGNED A DEAL WITH FREE MARKET PETROLEUM IN 2003, 
WERE ACCURATE.  (NOTE:  THE HYDROCARBONS LAW RESERVES THE 
MARKETING OF VENEZUELAN OIL TO PDVSA.  IN EARLY 2003, RAMIREZ_ 
SIGNED A CONTROVERSIAL CONTRACT WITH FREE MARKET WHICH WAS 
INTENDED TO COVER THE SALE OF VENEZUELAN OIL TO THE U.S. 
PETROLEUM RESERVE.  MANY QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT THE 
CONTRACT AND THE DEAL, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAS NEVER BEEN 
FINALIZED.)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS, 
HOWEVER, LARA SIMPLY SHRUGGED AND SAID THAT CORRUPTION IS 
RAMPANT IN BOTH THE MINISTRY AND PETROLEOS DE VENEZUELA 
(PDVSA).  (NOTE:  FOR THAT MATTER, LARA REPORTED THAT RONDON 
HIMSELF HAS AN OIL SERVICES COMPANY THAT IS RECEIVING 
PREFERENTIAL CONTRACTS FROM PDVSA IN EASTERN VENEZUELA.) 
RAMIREZ_, WITH HIS ACCESS TO THE VAST ASSETS OF PDVSA 
(INCLUDING COMPANY PLANES), IS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
CHAVEZ\'S REFERENDUM STRATEGY AND IS UNTOUCHABLE, SAID LARA. 
    RONDON HAD SOUGHT TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THE GOV AND HAD 
ULTIMATELY PLAYED AN EXTREMELY INEPT HAND WITHIN THE 
COMMISSION AND THE PLENARY, ACCORDING TO LARA. 
 
4. (C) LARA ASSERTED THAT RONDON WAS \"CARRYING THE WATER\" 
AGAINST RAMIREZ_ FOR A MOVEMENT CALLED THE \"CATEDRA JUAN PABLO 
PEREZ ALFONSO\" OR JPPA, WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE FORMER 
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO SAUDI ARABIA CARLOS MENDOZA 
POTTELLA, AND VICTOR POLEO, FORMERLY IN THE MINISTRY OF 
ENERGY AND MINES.  THE JPPA, NAMED FOR THE VENEZUELAN OIL 
MINISTER WHO PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THE CONCEPTION OF OPEC, 
ADVOCATES A HIGHLY NATIONALISTIC ENERGY POLICY THAT WOULD 
ELIMINATE THE PARTICIPATION OF FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES IN 
VENEZUELA.  MUCH OF THE FODDER FOR RONDON\'S ALLEGATIONS, SAID 
LARA, CAME FROM \"INSTITUTIONALISTS\" WITHIN PDVSA. 
 
-------------------- 
RONDON\'S ASPIRATIONS 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) PATRIA PARA TODOS (PPT) SECRETARY GENERAL JOSE 
ALBORNOZ TOLD POLOFF JUNE 25 THAT THE FIGHT BETWEEN RONDON 
AND MINISTER RAMIREZ_ IS LARGELY REGIONAL, STEMMING FROM THE 
 
CARACAS 00002197  002 OF 002 
 
TE IN ITALY (MARKETING 
VENEZUELA\'S PATENTED HEAVY OIL PRODUCT \"ORIMULSION\" TO 
ITALIAN POWER PLANTS) IS AT THE CENTER OF RONDON\'S 
ACCUSATIONS.  ALBORNOZ ALLEGED RONDON IS GETTING HIS 
INFORMATION ABOUT BITOR FROM ITS GENERAL MANAGER, WHO IS THE 
BROTHER OF DEPUTY LUIGI D\'ANGELO, A FORMER MVR DEPUTY WHO 
BROKE WITH THE PARTY EARLIER THIS YEAR.  D\'ANGELO JOINED THE 
\"FEDERAL BLOC,\" SIX DEPUTIES ALLIED WITH RADICAL ACTIVIST 
LINA RON, WHO HEADS THE PRO-CHAVEZ \"UNIDAD POPULAR 
VENEZOLANA\" (UPV).  ALBORNOZ PREDICTED THAT RONDON WOULD 
EVENTUALLY JOIN RON\'S UPV FACTION, WHICH HE DISMISSED AS A 
\"SCRAP HEAP\" FOR DISAFFECTED CHAVISTAS.  (NOTE:  RONDON HAS 
NOT INDICATED WHETHER HE WILL JOIN RON\'S FACTION, JOIN THE 
OPPOSITION, OR SIMPLY PLAY FREE AGENT.) 
 
6. (C) OTHER OBSERVERS ALLEGE THAT ROGER RONDON HAD HOPED TO 
BECOME THE PRO-CHAVEZ CANDIDATE FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF DELTA 
AMACURO STATE WHERE HE WOULD LIKELY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO 
WINDFALL BENEFITS WHEN THE WORK ON THE OFF-SHORE DELTANA 
PLATFORM NATURAL GAS BLOCKS BEGINS LATER THIS YEAR.  BUT 
RONDON WAS PASSED OVER FOR THE MVR\'S YELITZA SANTAELLA, WHICH 
REPORTEDLY LEFT HIM ANGRY AND DISSATISFIED. 
 
---------------------- 
AND RONDON ROLLS ON... 
---------------------- 
 
    7. (C) SINCE HIS DEMOTION, RONDON HAS CRITICIZED OTHER CHAVEZ 
LOYALISTS, ALLEGING MOST RECENTLY THAT THE GOV HAD STAGED THE 
INCIDENT OF THE COLOMBIAN \"PARAMILITARIES\" TO DISTRACT 
ATTENTION FROM THE RUN-UP TO THE AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM. 
IN REACTION, MVR DEPUTIES PROPOSED STRIPPING RONDON OF HIS 
CONGRESSIONAL IMMUNITY SO AS TO SUBJECT HIM TO POSSIBLE 
CORRUPTION CHARGES.  MVR NICOLAS MADURO CLAIMED THAT \"DARK 
INTERESTS\" WERE BEHIND RONDON\"S ACCUSATIONS THAT WOULD SOON 
BE MADE PUBLIC. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) RONDON\'S MOTIVES AND PERSONAL INTERESTS ASIDE, IT IS 
POSSIBLE HE DOES HAVE INCRIMINATING PROOF OF CORRUPTION 
WITHIN THE MINISTRY AND PDVSA.  THE THREAT BY HIS FELLOW 
CHAVISTAS TO STRIP HIM OF HIS CONGRESSIONAL IMMUNITY IS A 
WARNING TO OTHER WOULD-BE DEFECTORS.  THE PRO-CHAVEZ DEPUTIES 
HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR SLIM MAJORITY, AND HAVE USED IT TO 
MUSCLE THROUGH LEGISLATION IMPORTANT TO THE REVOLUTION. 
PLAYING HARD BALL WITH RONDON EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE THEY 
ATTACH TO MAINTAINING THEIR HOLD ON THE LEGISLATURE AND TO 
ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) THE PRESIDENT OF THE ELECTORAL CHAMBER OF THE SUPREME 
COURT (TSJ) ALBERTO MARTINI RETIRED FROM THE TSJ ON JULY 7, 
ALONG WITH JUSTICES RAFAEL HERNANDEZ AND RAFAEL PEREZ 
PERDOMO. MARTINI AND HERNANDEZ, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE ELECTORAL 
CHAMBER, WILL BE REPLACED BY PRO-CHAVEZ ALTERNATES. THE TSJ 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) CLOSED 
THE NOMINATIONS PROCESS ON JULY 1, WITH SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE 
CHAVISTAS INCLUDED ON THE LIST. FRANCISCO CARRASQUERO, 
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) WAS THE 
MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF THE NOMINEES, ALONG WITH MVR DEPUTIES 
LUIS VELAZQUEZ ALVARAY, EDUARDO FRANCESCHI AND OMAR MEZZA. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------- 
ELECTORAL CHAMBER CHANGES HANDS 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE PRESIDENT OF THE ELECTORAL CHAMBER OF THE SUPREME 
COURT (TSJ), ALBERTO MARTINI, RETIRED ON JULY 7, ALONG WITH 
JUSTICE RAFAEL HERNANDEZ AND RAFAEL PEREZ PERDOMO. BOTH 
    MARTINI AND HERNANDEZ WILL BE REPLACED BY PRO-CHAVEZ 
ALTERNATES. THE MORAL COUNCIL (ATTORNEY GENERAL, CONTROLLER 
GENERAL, AND HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSMAN, SITTING IN COMMITTEE) 
ACCUSED MARTINI AND HERNANDEZ OF A \"GRAVE FAULT\" ON JUNE 18, 
FOR WHICH EACH FACED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUSPENSION. PEREZ 
LEAVES THE TSJ\'S PENAL CHAMBER.  HIS REPLACEMENT IS NOT 
CLEAR, WITH A PRO-OPPOSITION ALTERNATE AND A PRO-CHAVEZ 
ALTERNATE DISPUTING THE POSITION. IF PEREZ IS REPLACED BY A 
PRO-CHAVEZ ALTERNATE, THE PRESENT CORRELATION OF FORCES IN 
THE PENAL CHAMBER, WITH TWO OPPOSITION JUSTICES AND ONE 
PRO-CHAVEZ JUSTICE, WOULD BE REVERSED. 
 
------------ 
244 NOMINEES 
------------ 
 
3.  (U) THE TSJ NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY (NA) CLOSED THE NOMINATIONS PROCESS ON JULY 1, WITH 
SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE CHAVISTAS INCLUDED IN THE LIST. THE NA 
SET UP THE COMMITTEE TO ACCEPT NOMINATIONS FOR THE 12 NEW 
SUPREME COURT SEATS, ESTABLISHED UNDER THE NEW TSJ LAW AND 
FOR THE 32 ALTERNATE SEATS ON THE TSJ. (NOTE: AT LEAST ONE 
MORE JUDGE WILL BE CHOSEN TO REPLACE FRANKLIN ARRIECHE, 
RECENTLY REMOVED BY THE NA UNDER THE NEW LAW, AND SEVERAL 
MORE MAY BE NAMED TO REPLACE RETIRING JUSTICES. END NOTE.) 
244 PEOPLE WERE NOMINATED IN ALL. AND THERE ARE NOMINEES FROM 
THE OPPOSITION IN ADDITION TO CHAVISTAS. MANY OF THE NOMINEES 
ARE FIGURES WHO HAVE SERVED IN ONE OF CHAVEZ\' PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENTS, OR RULED IN FAVOR OF CHAVEZ\' POSITIONS ON 
CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS AT LOWER LEVELS OF THE JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO NA DEPUTY CILIA FLORES (MVR), THE NA 
    WILL TAKE THE FINAL VOTE ON THE NEW JUSTICES ON AUGUST 12, 
AND THE SWEARING IN OF THE NEW JUSTICES WOULD BE AUGUST 13. 
(NOTE: THE NEW TSJ LAW ALLOWS THE TSJ JUSTICES TO BE CHOSEN 
BY THE NA WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY AFTER THREE ATTEMPTS TO GET 
THE TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY STIPULATED IN THE CONSTITUTION THE 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE EXPECTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT FOURTH 
VOTE ON AUGUST 12. END NOTE.) 
 
-------------------------- 
CARRASQUERO AMONG NOMINEES 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) FRANCISCO CARRASQUERO CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE), IS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
NOMINEE, BECAUSE OF HIS ROLE OVERSEEING THE RECALL 
REFERENDUM. JUSTICE ARRIECHE TOLD REPORTERS IT WAS 
INAPPROPRIATE THAT CARRASQUERO WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE 
VOTES OF PRO-CHAVEZ DEPUTIES TO BECOME A TSJ JUSTICE, WHILE 
OVERSEEING A RECALL REFERENDUM AGAINST CHAVEZ. FLORES 
CONTRADICTED ARRIECHE, SAYING THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT 
TO BE NOMINATED, AND THAT IF CARRASQUERO WERE NAMED TO THE 
 
CARACAS 00002199  002 OF 002 
 
LL BE READY.\" 
 
------------ 
MVR DEPUTIES 
------------ 
 
5.  (U) NA DEPUTY LUIS VELAZQUEZ ALVARAY (MVR) WAS ALSO 
NOMINATED. VELAZQUEZ WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING THE TSJ LAW 
THOUGH THE NA. THE DEPUTY WENT BEFORE A NOTARY TO DEMONSTRATE 
FORMALLY THAT HE WOULD NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN PARTISAN 
POLITICS, THOUGH HE INTENDS TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE NA TO 
PUSH THROUGH MORE JUDICIAL REFORM LEGISLATION. HE ASSURED 
REPORTERS THAT FROM NOW ON HE WILL VOTE ACCORDING TO HIS 
CONSCIENCE, \"AND NOT ACCORDING TO PARTY SYMPATHIES OR 
ALLEGIANCES.\" OPPOSITION PRIMERO JUSTICIA DEPUTY GERARDO 
BLYDE REJECTED THIS ARGUMENT, SAYING IT WAS \"PUBLIC AND 
NOTORIOUS\" THAT VELAZQUEZ ALONG WITH MVR DEPUTIES LUIS 
FRANCESCHI AND OMAR MEZZA, WERE FOLLOWERS OF CHAVEZ. BLYDE 
SAID THERE IS NO LEGAL PROHIBITION AGAINST POLITICIANS 
HOLDING OFFICE BECOMING TSJ JUSTICES, BUT SAID THEY WOULD 
VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT TSJ JUSTICES BE 
IMPARTIAL. 
 
----------------- 
CHAVISTA REACTION 
    ----------------- 
 
6.  (U) GOV VICE PRESIDENT JOSE VICENTE RANGEL DISMISSED THE 
CRITICISM OF THE NOMINATIONS BY SAYING, \"POLITICS IS PRESENT 
IN EVERYTHING. LET\'S NOT BE HYPOCRITES.\" HE SAID ANYONE COULD 
BE A TSJ JUSTICE, AS LONG AS THEY MET THE CRITERIA, AND THAT 
THE SELECTION PROCESS WOULD DETERMINE WHICH CANDIDATES WERE 
BEST QUALIFIED. FLORES, SAID THE OPPOSITION HAD NO RIGHT TO 
CRITICIZE ANYONE, SINCE THEY HAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN THE 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE (NOTE: THE OPPOSITION PARTIES BOYCOTTED 
THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ACCEPT THE TSJ LAW WHICH 
AUTHORIZED THE NOMINATING PROCESS. END NOTE.) 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) THE RETIREMENT OF MARTINI AND HERNANDEZ GIVES CHAVEZ 
FULL CONTROL OF THE ELECTORAL CHAMBER, AND THE PLENARY 
CHAMBER WITHOUT RECOURSE TO THE NEW TSJ LAW. IF PEREZ IS 
REPLACED BY A CHAVISTA, IT WILL GIVE CHAVEZ CONTROL OF THE 
PENAL CHAMBER AS WELL. BOTH ARE CRITICAL BLOWS TO THE 
OPPOSITION, WITH THE JUSTICES WHO HAVE STOOD UP TO CHAVEZ 
RETIRING QUIETLY ON THE EVE OF THE REFERENDUM, AND THEREBY 
GIVING CHAVEZ A TREMENDOUS TOOL IN THE EVENT HE LOOSES THE 
REFERENDUM. 
 
8. (C) THE TSJ NOMINATION PROCESS IS ONE MORE INDICATION OF 
THE COLLAPSE OF INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENCE UNDER CHAVEZ. 
NAMING CARRASQUERO, VELAZQUEZ, MEZZA AND FRANCESCHI TO THE 
TSJ WILL FURTHER ERODE THE INSTITUTION\'S CREDIBILITY. 
 
SIPDIS 
    ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THE TSJ NOMINEES FROM THE LOWER COURTS 
ARE ALSO CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITH CHAVEZ THROUGH CONTROVERSIAL 
CASES THEY HAVE DEALT WITH, OR ARE POLITICAL APPOINTEES FROM 
THE PAST. LOYALTY IS LIKELY TO BE GIVEN THE GREATEST WEIGHT 
IN THE CHOICE OF THE NEW JUSTICES.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ\'S FORMER PARTNER DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF HIS POLITICS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) HERMA MARKSMAN, CHAVEZ\'S FORMER COMMON-LAW WIFE FROM 
1984-1993, SPOKE TO POLOFFS ON JULY 1 ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF CHAVEZ\'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.  SHE CLAIMS THAT CHAVEZ WAS 
INFLUENCED BY 1960\'S GUERRILLAS.  MARKSMAN DISAGREED WITH THE 
OPPOSITION\'S PORTRAYAL OF CHAVEZ AS AN IDIOT AND WARNED THAT 
HE IS A DETERMINED MAN WHO TRUSTS FEW PEOPLE.  WHILE WE 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF HER INFORMATION MAY BE BIASED, WE 
THOUGHT WASHINGTON MAY APPRECIATE AN INSIGHT INTO CHAVEZ FROM 
SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM INTIMATELY BEFORE HE ENTERED THE 
NATIONAL STAGE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
ROOTS OF CHAVEZ\'S BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) HERMA MARKSMAN, A HISTORY PROFESSOR AND CHAVEZ\'S 
    FORMER COMMON-LAW WIFE, DISCUSSED HOW CHAVEZ ARRIVED TO HIS 
CURRENT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.  (NOTE:  COMMON-LAW MARRIAGE IS 
A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE IN VENEZUELA.)  AS A POOR CHILD GROWING 
UP IN THE RURAL STATE OF BARINAS, MARKSMAN ALLEGES CHAVEZ WAS 
INFLUENCED BY A TEACHER, WHO ADMIRED FIDEL CASTRO AND CHE 
GUEVARA.  SHE CLAIMS THAT CHAVEZ WAS AMBITIOUS FROM AN EARLY 
AGE AND EVEN THOUGHT OF RUNNING THE COUNTRY AS A 20 YEAR-OLD. 
 
 
3.  (C) AS A JUNIOR OFFICER, CHAVEZ SOON FELL UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF DOUGLAS BRAVO, A FORMER COMMUNIST AND GUERRILLA 
LEADER DURING THE 1960S.  CHAVEZ\'S BROTHER, ADAN, PLAYED A 
KEY ROLE IN INTRODUCING CHAVEZ TO BRAVO, ACCORDING TO LOCAL 
PRESS REPORTS.  MARKSMAN STATED THAT IT WAS BRAVO, NOT 
CHAVEZ, WHO DEVELOPED THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE BOLIVARIAN 
REVOLUTION, WHICH IS ROOTED IN THE WORKS OF SIMON RODRIGUEZ, 
SIMON BOLIVAR, AND EZEQUIEL ZAMORA.  BRAVO\'S MOVEMENT 
STRESSED THE NEED FOR CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION TO IMPLEMENT 
THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION.  WHILE CHAVEZ BROKE WITH BRAVO IN 
1986, HE MAINTAINED BRAVO\'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, WHICH PLAYED 
A KEY ROLE IN CHAVEZ\'S FAILED COUP IN 1992.  MARKSMAN ALLUDED 
TO THE FAILED COUP--WHICH SHE HAS PUBLICLY CRITICIZED--AS A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HER ENDING THE RELATIONSHIP, THOUGH 
SHE DID NOT DIRECTLY STATE THE REASON FOR ENDING THE AFFAIR 
WITH CHAVEZ. 
 
 
----------------------- 
CHAVEZ IS NOBODY\'S FOOL 
----------------------- 
 
    4. (C) THROUGHOUT HER MEETING WITH POLOFFS, MARKSMAN ASSERTED 
THAT CHAVEZ SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.  SHE DESCRIBED THE 
PRESIDENT AS AN EXCELLENT STORYTELLER, WHO OFTEN 
CHARACTERIZES HIS OPPONENTS AS DEVILS, WHICH IS A POWERFUL 
RELIGIOUS SYMBOL AMONG THE POOR.  WHILE THE EDUCATED CLASS 
MAY SCOFF AT CHAVEZ\'S FIVE-HOUR TELEVISION BROADCASTS, 
MARKSMAN CLAIMED THAT THE POOR BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
INTERESTED IN THEIR ISSUES.  SHE ALSO STATED THAT CHAVEZ IS 
FOCUSED ON HIS GOAL OF TRANSFORMING THE COUNTRY AND IS 
WILLING TO WIN AT ANY COSTS.  CHAVEZ WOULD ONLY HAVE AGREED 
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD 
WIN, ACCORDING TO MARKSMAN. 
 
------------------------ 
CHAVEZ\'S INNER CIRCLE 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) MARKSMAN STATED THAT CHAVEZ IS LOYAL TO NO ONE AND 
DOES NOT HAVE TRUE FRIENDS.  IF HE HAS A PROBLEM, HE WILL 
ONLY CONFIDE IN HIS BROTHER, ADAN, WHOM SHE CHARACTERIZED AS 
A COMMUNIST, AND CUBAN LEADER FIDEL CASTRO.  SHE ALLEGED THAT 
 
CARACAS 00002200  002 OF 002 
 
OUPS IN LATIN AMERICA.  SHE 
STATED THAT CHAVEZ DOES HAVE SEVERAL OF ADAN\'S FRIENDS IN 
GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING GUILLERMO GARCIA PONCE--A POLITICAL 
ADVISER TO CHAVEZ, MEMBER OF THE DEFUNCT POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, 
EDITOR OF VEA NEWSPAPER, AND COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL. 
 
6.  (C) SHE LISTED SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHOM SHE CONSIDERED TO 
BE THE MOST DANGEROUS MEN IN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING DIOSDADO 
CABELLO (FORMER INFRASTRUCTURE MINISTER, NATIONAL LOGISTICS 
COORDINATOR FOR THE COMANDO MAISANTA AND GUBERNATORIAL 
CANDIDATE FOR MIRANDA STATE); AND ELIECER OTAIZA (FORMER 
DIRECTOR OF CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, DISIP, AND THE 
CURRENT DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COOPERATIVE 
EDUCATION, INCE).  AS CHIEF OF INCE, OTAIZA HAS RUN VARIOUS 
\"MISSION\" PROGRAMS, ACCORDING TO MARKSMAN.  SHE ALSO 
MENTIONED WILLIAM IZARRA, DIRECTOR OF IDEOLOGY FOR THE 
COMANDO MAISANTA, JESSE CHACON, COMMUNICATIONS AND 
INFORMATION MINISTER, AND RONALDO BLANCO LA CRUZ, GOVERNOR OF 
TACHIRA STATE. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
    ------- 
 
7. (C) WHILE MARKSMAN\'S STATEMENTS MAY BE BIASED, SHE DOES 
OFFER A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE INTO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT.  HER 
CHARACTERIZATION OF CHAVEZ AS AN AMBITIOUS, DETERMINED MAN 
CONTRASTS WITH THE OPPOSITION\'S PORTRAYAL OF HIM AT TIMES AS 
A BUFFOON.  CHAVEZ\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO TRUST OTHERS, HOWEVER, 
LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO HIS GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE IN EXECUTING 
MANY OF HIS INITIATIVES.

EASONS 1.4(B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) VENEZUELA\'S NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL (CNE) APPROVED 
ON JUNE 23 THE REGULATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DURING 
THE AUGUST 15 PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM.  THE RULES 
STIPULATE THAT OBSERVERS  WILL HAVE FULL ACCESS TO VOTING 
SITES AND CNE OFFICES, BUT MAY NOT MAKE PRESS STATEMENTS OR 
RELEASE INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA.  THE GOV RESERVES THE RIGHT 
TO DENY OR REVOKE THE ACCREDITATION OF ANY MEMBER OF THE 
OBSERVER MISSIONS.  WRITTEN TO AVOID REPEATING THE 
EXPERIENCES OF THE SIGNATURE DRIVE AND APPEALS PROCESS WITH 
THE OAS AND THE CARTER CENTER (TCC), THE REGULATIONS AS 
CURRENTLY DRAFTED WOULD HAMPER INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
CNE APPROVES OBSERVER REGULATIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) THE NATIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION (CNE) APPROVED ON 
    JUNE 23 (AND FINALIZED ON JULY 2) THE REGULATIONS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER MISSIONS DURING THE AUGUST 15 
REFERENDUM.  THE ELEVEN-ARTICLE RESOLUTION OUTLINES THE 
MISSION, SELECTION, ACCESS, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND 
RESTRICTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THE RESOLUTION 
HIGHLIGHTS FOUR MAJOR PRINCIPLES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS: RESPECT OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF VENEZUELA, 
IMPARTIALITY, NEUTRALITY, AND TRANSPARENCY.  THE RULES 
STIPULATE THAT OBSERVERS \"MAY NOT OPINE OVER THE INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS OF VENEZUELA.\"  OBSERVERS WILL BE PLACED UNDER THE 
SUPERVISION OF A CNE COMMITTEE HEADED BY PRO-CHAVEZ DIRECTOR 
OSCAR BATTAGLINI. 
 
--------------------- 
HAND-PICKED OBSERVERS 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) THE RULES EMPOWER THE CNE TO INVITE OBSERVERS, WITH 
THE FORMAL INVITATION TO BE RELAYED BY THE MINISTRY OF 
FOREIGN RELATIONS.  THE CNE MAY ALSO DENY OR REVOKE 
ACCREDITATION TO INDIVIDUALS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER 
MISSION WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS 
LAID OUT IN THE REGULATIONS.  OPPOSITION CNE DIRECTORS 
EZEQUIEL ZAMORA AND SOBELLA MEJIAS VOTED AGAINST THE ARTICLES 
WHICH GIVE THE CNE AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE OBSERVER 
STATUS AND THE LIMITATION ON THE OBSERVERS\' REPORTING ONLY TO 
THE CNE IN CONFIDENCE. 
 
--------------------- 
LOOK, BUT DON\'T SPEAK 
--------------------- 

4. (C) THE APPROVED RESOLUTION GRANTS OBSERVERS FREE MOVEMENT 
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH POLITICAL 
PARTIES AND PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFERENDUM PROCEDURES. 
 THE OBSERVERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE BUILDINGS, SITES, AND 
SPACES OF ALL ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES.  UPON REQUEST, THE 
OBSERVER MISSIONS HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS, 
AND ARCHIVES OF THE CNE.  TCC REPRESENTATIVE EDGARDO MIMICA 
TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON JULY 2 THAT THE CNE WANTED TO MAKE 
THEIR SCHEDULES AND ESCORT OBSERVERS, WHICH TCC FINDS 
UNWORKABLE. 
 
5. (C) THE RULES DO NOT MENTION WHETHER OBSERVERS CAN DO 
\"QUICK COUNTS\" OR PROJECTIONS ON ELECTION DAY.  THE 
RESOLUTION STATES, HOWEVER, THAT THE OBSERVERS \"CANNOT MAKE 
DECLARATIONS TO THE MEDIA, OR RELEASE STATEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS 
OF THE OBSERVER\'S OPINIONS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.\" 
THE OBSERVER MISSIONS ARE REQUIRED TO PRESENT THE CNE WITH 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMAL REPORTS AT THE END OF THE ELECTORAL 
 
SIPDIS 
PROCESS, WHICH THE CNE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH. 
OBSERVERS ARE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING SURPRISE VISITS TO SEE 
THE CNE BOARD (AS FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DID DURING 
THE APPEALS PROCESS) WITHOUT WRITTEN CONSENT.  OBSERVERS, 
 
CARACAS 00002201  002 OF 002 
 
--- 
OPPOSITION DECRIES \"GAG RULE\" 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (U) ON JUNE 29, ASDRUBAL AGUIAR, INTERNATIONAL LIAISON FOR 
THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA, ATTACKED THE OBSERVER 
REGULATIONS FOR THEIR EMPHASIS ON SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH HE 
CALLED AN EXCUSE FOR DICTATORIAL REGIMES SUCH AS THOSE OF 
PINOCHET, FUJIMORI, AND CASTRO.  AGUIAR ASSERTED THAT THE CNE 
RESOLUTION IS A \"GAG RULE\" BECAUSE OBSERVERS CANNOT COMMENT 
ON INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATE OR MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE 
PRESS.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE RESOLUTION VIOLATES THE MAY 29 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION AND GOV AND THREATENS 
CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.  AGUIAR 
QUESTIONS HOW INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WILL BE ABLE TO 
EVALUATE TRANSPARENCY AND THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, BUT ONLY BE 
ABLE TO PRESENT FINDINGS CONFIDENTIALLY.  WITHIN THE CNE, 
THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE NEW REGULATIONS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 

7. (C)  THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE 
ACCREDITATION PROCESS AND THE REPORTING ABILITY OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THE CONTENTIOUS POINTS -- PRESS 
STATEMENTS, APPROVAL OF INDIVIDUAL OBSERVERS, NO UNANNOUNCED 
VISITS -- ALL SEEK TO REDRESS THE CNE\'S EARLIER CONFLICTS 
WITH THE OAS/TCC OBSERVERS.  BATTAGLINI WAS CRITICAL OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS THEN AND WILL NOW HEAD THE COMMITTEE 
TO OVERSEE THEM.  THE OBSERVERS APPEAR TO BE WILLING TO WALK 
THE FINE LINE DRAWN BY THE CNE TO A POINT, BUT THEY WILL NOT 
COME JUST TO GIVE BLIND APPROVAL.  STILL, ONCE THE OBSERVERS 
ARE ON THE GROUND, IT WILL BE POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE 
CNE TO CONTROL THEM, ESPECIALLY LUMINARIES SUCH AS FORMER 
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER OR OAS SECGEN CESAR GAVIRIA.

SUBJECT: TRIAL BEGINS IN TACHIRA 9 CASE 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) JUDGE GERSON NINO OPENED THE TRIAL AGAINST NINE 
OPPOSITION LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN PRISON FOR THE LAST YEAR 
IN TACHIRA STATE ON JULY 6.  THE NINE ARE CHARGED WITH CIVIL 
REBELLION FOR THE EVENTS OF APRIL 11, 2002 IN SAN CRISTOBAL, 
TACHIRA. AT THE OPENING OF THE TRIAL, PROSECUTOR JAIRO 
ESCALANTE ACCUSED DEFENSE LAWYER PEDRO REY OF BRIBING ONE OF 
THE TWO LAY JUDGES IN THE CASE. NINO REFUSED TO SUSPEND THE 
TRIAL, THOUGH HE GAVE THE PROSECUTORS UNTIL JUNE 8 TO SHOW 
THEY HAD EVIDENCE OF THEIR CHARGES. END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
TRIAL BEGINS IN TACHIRA 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) JUDGE GERSON NINO OPENED THE TRIAL OF NINE OPPOSITION 
LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR THE PAST YEAR IN TACHIRA 
STATE ON JULY 6. JUDGE NINO WILL TRY THE CASE IN TRIUMVIRATE, 
WITH TWO LAYMEN. PROSECUTOR JAIRO ESCALANTE REQUESTED JUNE 6 
THAT THE TRIAL BE SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF AN ACCUSATION AGAINST 
DEFENSE LAWYER PEDRO REY FOR BRIBING ONE OF THE TWO LAYMEN 
    ASSIGNED TO THE CASE. JUDGE NINO REFUSED TO SUSPEND THE CASE, 
AND GAVE THE PROSECUTORS UNTIL JUNE 8 TO PROVE THAT TAMPERING 
HAD OCCURRED. 
 
3.  (U) THE NINE ARE ACCUSED OF CIVIL REBELLION FOLLOWING THE 
EVENTS OF APRIL 11, 2002 IN SAN CRISTOBAL, TACHIRA. THE 
CHARGES STEM FROM THE ALLEGED ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE 
DETAINEES TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF TACHIRA FOLLOWING 
THE \"COUP\" IN CARACAS ON APRIL 11, 2002. THE ACCUSED CLAIM 
THERE WAS A VACUUM OF POWER, AND THAT THEY WERE ONLY TRYING 
TO MAINTAIN ORDER WHEN THEY BRIEFLY TOOK CONTROL OF THE STATE 
GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE THREE OTHER SUSPECTS, WHO HAVE NOT 
TURNED THEMSELVES IN. TO DATE THIS CASE HAS HAD THREE 
DIFFERENT JUDGES AND FOUR DIFFERENT PROSECUTORS IN CHARGE. 
NA DEPUTY FOR TACHIRA CESAR PEREZ VIVAS (COPEI) TOLD 
REPORTERS THAT TACHIRA GOVERNOR RONALD BLANCO LA CRUZ (MVR), 
AND NA DEPUTIES FOR TACHIRA IRIS VARELA (MVR) AND LUIS TASCON 
(MVR) WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE YEAR LONG DELAY IN THIS CASE, 
BY ORGANIZING THE CHANGING OF JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS. ON JUNE 
10 THE PENAL CHAMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT (TSJ) ORDERED JUDGE 
NINO TO BEGIN THE TRIAL WITHOUT DELAY. ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS, THE HEALTH OF SEVERAL OF THE DETAINEES HAS 
DETERIORATED WHILE IN PRISON. 
 
--------- 
REACTIONS 
--------- 
 
3.  (U) SUPPORTERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE NINE EXPRESSED 
JOY AND RELIEF AT THE INITIATION OF THE TRIAL, ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS. DEFENSE LAWYER PEDRO REY TOLD REPORTERS THE 
    TRIAL, \"WILL ALLOW US TO PROVE THE INNOCENCE OF EACH AND 
EVERY ONE OF OUR CLIENTS.\" THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THE DETAINEES 
SAID, \"FINALLY THE TRIAL IS GOING TO BEGIN; FINALLY WE ARE 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THE INNOCENCE OF ALL THE DETAINEES.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (C) THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE POLITICAL CASES TO MAKE IT TO 
TRIAL. UP TO NOW THE GOV HAS USED A STRATEGY OF DELAYING 
TRIALS AND HOLDING PEOPLE ON LITTLE EVIDENCE. NOW, THANKS TO 
THE TSJ RULING, THEY MUST GO TO TRIAL. THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT 
ABOUT THE POLITICAL ALLEGIANCES OF THE PROSECUTOR OR THE 
JUDGE IN THE CASE. WHAT MUST BE CLOSELY WATCHED IS TO WHAT 
DEGREE THE GOV STILL FEELS BOUND BY THE RULE OF LAW.

AGAINST PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ BEGAN ON JULY 2.  AFTER TAKING 
NEARLY A MONTH TO ORGANIZE, THE OPPOSITION HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF 
STARTING TO CAMPAIGN, ALBEIT AT A LOWER PROFILE.  OPPOSITION 
    LEADER JUAN FERNANDEZ, THE COORDINADORA DEMOCRATICA\'S (CD) 
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE RECALL REFERENDUM, 
TOLD POLOFF JULY 8 THAT SECURING FUNDING IS A CENTRAL 
PRIORITY FOR THE OPPOSITION.  FERNANDEZ SAID THE CAMPAIGN 
BUDGET CALLED FOR 8 BILLION BOLIVARS (ABOUT USD 2.9 MILLION 
AT THE INFORMAL EXCHANGE RATE), BUT ONLY 2.5 BILLION BOLIVARS 
(USD 890,000) HAD BEEN COLLECTED.  FERNANDEZ SAID TRADITIONAL 
DONORS FROM THE BUSINESS SECTOR HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO GIVE 
BECAUSE OF DOUBT WHETHER THE OPPOSITION CAN WIN THE 
REFERENDUM -- BASED ON THE GREENBERG POLL SHOWING THE RACE AT 
A 48-48 TIE.  FERNANDEZ SAID THEY HAD RECEIVED REPORTS THE 
GOV IS LEANING ON COMPANIES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY SUPPORTED 
THE REFERENDUM TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM GIVING. 
 
----------------------------- 
MOBILIZATION EFFORTS UNDERWAY 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) FERNANDEZ SAID THE GET-OUT-THE-VOTE PROGRAMS ARE WELL 
UNDERWAY.  POLITICAL PARTIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS ARE 
WORKING AT THE GRASSROOTS FOR VOLUNTEERS TO REACH OUT TO 
POTENTIAL VOTERS.  THE CD IS ORGANIZING A TRANSPORTATION 
PROGRAM (\"OPERATION KANGAROO\") AND INFORMATION CENTERS 
(PROVIDING LEGAL AND LOGISTICAL AID) TO COVER THE VOTING 
CENTERS ON AUGUST 15.  VOLUNTEERS ARE BEING GIVEN TEN VOTERS 
TO CONTACT AND ASSURE THEIR VOTE FOR THE REFERENDUM. 
FERNANDEZ SAID THE NGO SUMATE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING 
THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON THE VOTERS FOR THE 
MOBILIZATION EFFORT.  THE CD\'S REFERENDUM EXECUTIVE 
COORDINATOR, ENRIQUE NAIME, TOLD A/DCM JULY 7 THAT THE CD 
WOULD EXPLOIT THE INFRASTRUCTURE (\"CUEVAS DEL  GUACHARO) THAT 
    THEY HAD DEVELOPED FOR THE APPEALS PROCESS. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
MESSAGE BETTER, BUT DISCIPLINE A PROBLEM 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) FERNANDEZ SAID THE CD WILL EMPHASIZE SOCIAL UNITY, 
JOBS, AND CRIME AS THEIR KEY THEMES.  HE CONCEDED THERE ARE 
STILL TOO MANY VOICES SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE OPPOSITION, 
AND HE DOES NOT SEE IT PRACTICAL TO SILENCE MOST OF THEM. 
FERNANDEZ IS TRYING TO KEEP THE SPEAKERS ON THE SAME PAGE BY 
PRODUCING A DAILY MESSAGE EMPHASIZING THE THREE CENTRAL 
THEMES AND OTHER POLITICAL MESSAGES.  FERNANDEZ SAID THERE IS 
A RIGOROUS CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE FOR KEY LEADERS.  FERNANDEZ ALSO 
COORDINATES SPEAKERS AND THEMES FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO NEWS 
COMMENTARY PROGRAMS.  HE NOTED THAT THE OPPOSITION PLANS 
RELEASE ITS \"NATIONAL CONSENSUS PLAN\" ON JULY 9. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CAMPAIGN MATERIALS SCARCE, BUT COMING 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) FERNANDEZ SAID THE CD HAS BEEN SLOW TO GET CAMPAIGN 
 
CARACAS 00002203  002 OF 002 
 
D THAT POSTER AND PAMPHLET 
DESIGN WAS FINISHED, AND THE DEMAND FROM VOLUNTEERS IS GREAT. 
 CD ADVISORS CONFIRMED THE FINANCE CRUNCH TO POLCOUNS JULY 7, 
NOTING THEY HAD TO SCALE BACK PRINT RUNS AND ASK FOR CREDIT 
FROM THE PRINTERS.  FERNANDEZ SAID ON JULY 8 THEY HAD REACHED 
AN AGREEMENT WITH A COMPANY TO DO ALL OF THEIR PRINTING FOR 
THE REFERENDUM. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
MEDIA CAMPAIGN SOLID, BUT LIMITED BY RULES 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) FERNANDEZ SAID RADIO AND TELEVISION ADS ARE ALREADY 
RUNNING ON PRIVATE MEDIA OUTLETS.  HE SAID RADIO AND 
TELEVISION ARE THE OPPOSITION\'S PRINCIPAL METHOD FOR REACHING 
POORER NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ADS WILL KEY ON THE VOTER\'S RIGHT 
TO CHOOSE, USING TESTIMONIALS FROM, FOR EXAMPLE, A POOR 
UNEMPLOYED PERSON HOPING A CHANGE WILL IMPROVE THE ECONOMY. 
FERNANDEZ SAID THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL\'S (CNE) 
PUBLICITY RULES ARE A HANDICAP FOR THE OPPOSITION, LIMITING 
THEM TO JUST THREE MINUTES PER TELEVISION STATION PER DAY. 
THE CNE RULES PERMIT PRO-CHAVEZ ADS TO RUN ON PRIVATE MEDIA 
AS WELL, WHICH COVERS 95 PERCENT OF THE AUDIENCE.  FERNANDEZ 
SAID HIS \"EQUAL TIME\" ON STATE TELEVISION, WITH JUST FIVE 
    PERCENT OF THE AUDIENCE, WAS NOT A FAIR EXCHANGE.  HE ALSO 
COMPLAINED THAT CHAVEZ\'S \"CADENA\" BROADCASTS, WHICH PRE-EMPT 
ALL PRIVATE RADIO AND TELEVISION, CONTINUE ALMOST DAILY, AND 
DO NOT REFRAIN FROM POLITICAL MESSAGES AS THE RULES 
STIPULATE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) FERNANDEZ BELIEVES THE OPPOSITION\'S CAMPAIGN IS 
BUILDING MOMENTUM SLOWLY AND WILL PEAK IN THE DAYS JUST 
BEFORE THE AUGUST 15 REFERENDUM.  WE SEE SIGNS THAT THE 
OPPOSITION IS INDEED WORKING.  THE OPPOSITION HISTORICALLY IS 
BEST AT MOBILIZING PEOPLE, SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO OBSERVE 
OR MEASURE UNTIL ELECTION DAY.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Carter Center (TCC) representative Edgardo Mimica told 
poloffs July 8 TCC will not accept an invitation from the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) to observe the August 15 
presidential recall referendum without agreement to minimum 
conditions that guarantee the freedom and autonomy of the 
observers.  Mimica said the Carter Center has coordinated its 
position with the OAS.  CNE Director Oscar Battaglini, a 
Chavista hardliner, plans to limit the number of all 
observers to 100, provide schedules and escorts for every 
observer, and prohibit their talking to the press.  Despite 
expressions of support for international observers from 
President Hugo Chavez and his Comando Maisanta campaign 
committee, Battaglini seems determined to discourage -- or at 
least control -- observer participation.  End summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Carter Center Gets Tough 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) A/DCM and poloff met with Carter Center (TCC) 
representative Edgardo Mimica July 8 to discuss the National 
Electoral Council\'s (CNE) regulations for international 
observers approved on June 23 (ref).  Mimica said, that based 
on their discussions with the CNE, the Carter Center would 
not accept an invitation to observe the August 15 
presidential recall referendum.  Mimica said they would only 
do so if the CNE agreed to conditions that are basic to any 
electoral observation.  CNE Director Oscar Battaglini, who 
will oversee international observer participation, indicated 
he intends to mount \"a Chinese elections observation 
mission,\" according to Mimica.  The CNE plans to invite 
officials from foreign electoral authorities in the region as 
well as sympathetic legislators from Europe and Latin America 
to observe the signature drives and appeals process. (Note: 
Similar observers made short, protocolary visits to signature 
sites and the CNE during the appeals process, often praising 
the CNE\'s performance to the press and on state media.  These 
observers had no contact with the OAS/TCC missions and did 
not undertake statistical analyses or quick counts.) 
 
3. (C) The Carter Center, according to Mimica, is asking the 
CNE for conditions that most basic international observation 
missions enjoy, including free circulation within Venezuela 
and freedom to make reports to the Venezuelan public and the 
international community on the referendum process.  The 
Carter Center wants to bring 50 observers and 15 technicians 
(both informatics and logistical), 45 more persons than the 
CNE is contemplating allowing it.  The Carter Center insisted 
it would need to receive the CNE\'s invitation by July 9.  The 
TCC also presented 12 technical points that include access to 
tally sheets from the election tables, access to the 
electoral registry, and permission to observe the quality 
control certification of the electoral machines. 
 
-------------------------- 
Battaglini Plays the Tough 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The CNE rules established a committee headed by 
Battaglini and comprised of other CNE directors to be 
determined and CNE Secretary General William Pacheco. 
Battaglini harshly criticized the international observers 
during the signature appeals process, specifically the Carter 
Center and OAS for being \"biased toward the opposition.\" 
Battaglini told reporters July 8 he would permit no more than 
100 observers, with a limit of 20 per delegation.  He said 
the CNE would provide escorts for all observers, possibly 
police officials, to ensure security.  He assured that 
observer movements would not be restricted, but insisted they 
be \"programmed\" ahead of time.  The CNE director emphasized 
 
that he wants the observers to show \"discretion, objectivity, 
and respect for our sovereignty.\" 
 
5. (C) Battaglini, a sociology professor with no previous 
electoral experience, had been a relatively quiet pro-Chavez 
member of the CNE board since it was inaugurated September 
2003.  (Far to the left, Battaglini had been a close 
associate of CNE Director Rodriguez\'s father before his 
murder by security forces in the 1970s.)  Edgardo Mimica 
opined that Battaglini\'s new prominence on the observer issue 
stems from hardline Chavez supporters\' irritation with CNE 
Director Jorge Rodriguez for allowing the referendum to go 
forward.  Battaglini, Mimica said, is seen as \"harder than 
Rodriguez.\"  Mimica said Rodriguez had told him not to worry 
about Battaglini\'s program, that the conditions would be 
worked out once the observers were on the ground.  Mimica 
said they did not trust Rodriguez, or his authority in this 
area, and therefore decided to put it in writing to the CNE. 
 
---------------------------- 
But Chavistas Want Observers 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Mimica said he was puzzled by Battaglini\'s willingness 
to risk international observer participation when senior GOV 
officials have expressed desire to have the observers.  He 
said President Chavez had told Francisco Diez and him July 2 
that he wanted international observers present for the 
referendum.  Mimica said he parlayed Chavez\'s endorsement of 
observers immediately into a meeting with William Lara, 
member of the Chavez campaign committee, Comando Maisanta. 
Lara also told Mimica the Comando supported having observers, 
confident observation would be necessary to convince the 
opposition that Chavez beat them fairly in the referendum. 
 
---------------- 
OAS Coordination 
---------------- 
 
7. (C) Mimica said the Carter Center had coordinated its 
position with the OAS.  As poloffs left the meeting with 
Mimica, in fact, they encountered OAS elections official 
Edgardo Reis, who confirmed he was aware of the Carter 
Center\'s actions.  Reis, who worked on the signature drives 
last year, said he was making a quick visit to talk with the 
CNE about OAS participation.  He said he planned to go to 
Washington July 9 to brief SYG Gaviria. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Chavez hardliners worry the observers will control or 
limit the CNE in the referendum.  Battaglini seems to be 
carrying the torch for this faction within Chavismo, playing 
the \"bad cop.\"  Chavez and the Comando Maisanta may 
talk-the-talk on observers, but Battaglini is squeezing the 
observers in a torturous negotiation in the meantime.  In the 
end, the GOV may not exclude the Carter Center and OAS from 
the process, but making things difficult diminishes the 
potential effectiveness of the observers.

SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON THE USAID/OTI VENEZUELA PROGRAM 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (U) USAID\'s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) began 
its Venezuela program in August 2002 to support a democratic 
solution to Venezuela\'s political crisis as part of an 
overall USG strategy.  USAID\'s overall goal in Venezuela is 
to support a political process that is democratic, 
constitutional, electoral and peaceful. Specifically the 
program focuses on: support to electoral processes, support 
of a favorable electoral environment, facilitating 
opportunities for dialogue between government and opposition 
supporters, public civic education, and human rights. To 
support this program, USAID is funding the following partner 
organizations:  The National Democratic Institute for 
International Affairs, the International Republican 
Institute, the Carter Center, Development Alternatives, 
Inc., and a large number of Venezuelan civil society 
organizations. The program is scheduled to run through FY 
2005.  End Summary. 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
2. (U) Since the failure of the national strike more than a 
year ago, the opposition has chosen a path for political 
change based on the constitutional right of citizens to 
recall elected public officials half-way through their terms 
of office.  This strategy resulted in a signature-gathering 
exercise November 28 to December 1, 2003 to recall President 
Chavez.  The opposition announced that it had collected 3.4 
million signatures, significantly more than the 2.4 million 
needed. 
3. (U) The National Electoral Board (CNE), the government 
institution responsible for overseeing electoral events - 
including verifying the validity of the signatures - is 
widely believed to be composed of three government 
supporters and two opposition supporters, a split that has 
affected CNE decisions on the long and contentiously 
convoluted signature collection and validation process.  In 
late April, 2004, the CNE announced that of the 3.4 million 
signatures collected, 1.9 million were valid, 300,000 were 
invalid, and 1.2 million needed to be \"repaired\" - that is, 
reconfirmed in a separate process which was carried out May 
29 - 31. At the end of this process, the CNE found that the 
opposition had collected more than the 2.4 million valid 
signatures required for a referendum against President 
Chavez.  The referendum was subsequently scheduled for 
August 15.  If President Chavez were recalled, a 
presidential election would be held a month later. This 
would be followed by elections for governors and mayors in 
late September.  These electoral events will almost 
certainly be carried out in an atmosphere of mutual distrust 
and accusations by the government and the opposition. 
4. (U) The working environment for USAID is affected by the 
continued accusations of the GoV that the U.S. Government is 
directly involved in efforts to overthrow the Chavez 
government.  President Chavez frequently alleges that 
President Bush is personally heading this effort, and that 
one of the mechanisms utilized is working through the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  These accusations 
are frequently coupled with threats to cut off oil shipments 
to the United States.  Thus far, the GoV has not made any 
statements regarding USAID\'s involvement in \"Venezuela\'s 
internal affairs\". At minimum, the ongoing attacks on NED 
grantees have made clear to local NGOs that accepting USG 
funding carries with it great risk, including the 
possibility of jail. 
--------------- 
USAID Support 
--------------- 
5.  (U) USAID is supporting two cooperative agreements with 
the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs 
(NDI). The first agreement provides $770,000 to work with 
civil society to help ensure the transparency and integrity 
of electoral processes through domestic observation.  This 
project will be implemented through a consortium of 
individuals and groups affiliated with both the government 
and the opposition. Specifically the consortium will focus 
on observing:  political/civil/human rights, the quality of 
the electoral process, and the implementation of a quick 
count. Progress on this project has been much slower than 
anticipated due to the ongoing attacks of President Chavez 
on organizations that have received USG funding.  This has 
resulted in the reluctance of individuals and organizations 
affiliated with this project to accept USG funding (albeit 
via NDI) out of concern that this could potentially 
compromise the perceived neutrality of the observation 
effort. For months NDI has been working with numerous 
embassies in an attempt to secure non-USG funding for the 
project, with limited success to date beyond promises.  This 
funding issue is coupled with the slowness and caution with 
which the project\'s board of directors has been operating in 
Venezuela\'s highly politicized environment.  NDI, however, 
remains confident that the conditions for electoral 
observation efforts - including the quick count - will be in 
 
place by August 15, although not of the scale initially 
envisioned.  This project is scheduled to end September 
29,2004. 
6.  (U) The second cooperative agreement with NDI provides 
$550,000 to strengthen political parties.  This project got 
off to a late start given that the project manager did not 
assume his position until January, 2004.  In his absence, 
however, there were - and continue to be - periodic visits 
by Latin American electoral specialists who have advised 
political leadership, primarily from the opposition, 
regarding strategy.  In the remaining months of the project, 
the two NDI in-country electoral specialists - in 
conjunction with visits by international electoral 
specialists - will continue to meet with party leadership, 
in Caracas and in the provinces, to provide technical 
assistance where possible and appropriate.  Involvement of 
government supporters in this project has been negligible 
despite ongoing efforts by NDI to reach out to the 
government.  This project is scheduled to end September 29, 
2004. 
7.  (U) USAID is also supporting two cooperative agreements 
with the International Republican Institute (IRI).  The 
first, for $450,000, is to provide training to political 
parties on the design, planning, and execution of electoral 
campaigns.  This is being done through \"campaign training 
schools\" targeting campaign managers, emphasizing the 
development of viable campaign strategies and effectively 
communicating party platforms to voters.  Divided into five 
two-day modules, the training is being offered in five 
regional centers which also accommodate surrounding states. 
By the end of June, the first four modules will have been 
completed in Caracas (including representatives from the 
states of Vargas, Aragua, Guarico and Amazonas), Zulia 
(Tachira, Falcon, Barinas, Merida, Trujillo and Apure), 
Anzoategui (Amacuro, Monagas, Sucre, and Nueva Esparta)and 
Carabobo (Lara, Cojedes, Guarico, and Yaracuy).  Given that 
a presidential referendum is now scheduled, the planned 5th 
module - which was to focus on fund-raising - has been 
revised to include efforts to encourage voter participation, 
and public education regarding the difference between a 
referendum and a normal electoral event. Participant 
response continues to be uniformly enthusiastic - while 
participation by government-leaning parties has been 
insignificant despite IRI\'s efforts to encourage government 
participation, including offering separate sessions for 
government supporters.  IRI is working with NDI to study the 
possibility of offering training tailored to specific parts 
of the country in the lead-up to the regional elections in 
September.  This project is scheduled to end September 17, 
2004. 
8.  (U) The second cooperative agreement with IRI, for 
$285,000, is to support the training of political parties in 
the observation of electoral processes.  Working through a 
local NGO, Hagamos Democracia (HD), and in collaboration 
with the CNE, IRI/HD have developed educational materials 
for the training of poll watchers with the focus on 
observation - per CNE norms - assessment, and reporting. 
The strategy involves training-of-trainers affiliated with 
participating political parties - who will then carry out 
the actual training of the political party observers. An 
important expected outcome of this project is the 
establishment of a formal network of contacts and volunteer 
trainers throughout the country.  To date, Hagamos 
Democracia has completed training the trainers of COPEI and 
Bandera Roja. There is no participation of the government in 
this project despite IRI/HD offering to hold separate 
courses for government-affiliated parties - the last 
invitation being in mid-January.  USAID has requested that 
IRI reinvigorate its efforts to reach out to government- 
affiliated parties due to the importance of their 
participation to the success of the overall project and the 
referendum. This project is scheduled to end September 17, 
2004. 
9.  (U) USAID has awarded five grants to the Carter Center 
for both institutional support and observation efforts.  The 
grants total $1.4 million.  USAID will also support Carter 
Center observation of the presidential referendum, as well 
as the regional elections (mayoral and gubernatorial) which 
are to take place in late September.  The institutional 
support grant is scheduled to end December 31, 2004. 
10.  (U) With Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI), USAID 
Venezuela is implementing a program of small grants, 
primarily in partnership with Venezuelan civil society.  The 
main focus has been to facilitate dialogue between segments 
of society that would be unlikely to sit down together to 
discuss issues of mutual interest.  The 100 plus grants to 
date have mostly supported workshops dedicated to specific 
issues (e.g. family violence, municipal planning, conflict 
resolution, and the role of the media in a democratic 
society) which serve as fora for dialogue and bridge 
building. 
11.  (U) While providing venues for dialogue will continue 
to be one of the objectives of the small grants program, DAI 
is also working with a local partner to develop a national 
agenda/vision for the future. Currently there are more than 
 
30 existing national agendas, an indication that there are a 
significant number of individuals and organizations - 
including the Coordenadora Democratica - who recognize the 
pressing need to have a viable and attractive vision for the 
future.  This project is working with the authors of the 
existing national agendas to develop a consensual vision 
that will then be validated in a series of workshops held 
throughout the country.  The objectives are to increase 
citizen participation in the development of a national 
agenda - to encourage ownership, to involve key sectoral 
stake-holders (e.g. media, business) in moving national 
priorities beyond discussion - and to make a clear statement 
to political leaders regarding expectations of the citizens 
of Venezuela. 
12.  (U) Another DAI project is a nation-wide campaign to be 
launched in late June - \"Venezuela Convive\" - which will 
encourage the concept of peaceful coexistence between 
individuals and organizations with strongly contrasting 
opinions - a value that is strongly held by most 
Venezuelans, and which is perceived as being under attack by 
the current climate of political intolerance.  This campaign 
will include a media component (TV, radio and newspapers) 
and strong support by civil society who will implement 
numerous projects throughout the country in support of 
\"convivencia\" - living together in peace.  Reaction to the 
project has been overwhelmingly positive - including strong 
support by chavismo - a clear demonstration that Venezuelans 
are tired of political and economic turmoil and want to move 
forward. 
13.  (U) A complement to this project is a national effort 
to work with 7,000 of the political party observers who 
participated in last year\'s signature-gathering exercise and 
this year\'s \"repairing\" process.  The project is a series of 
workshops focused on political tolerance as an essential 
element of a healthy democracy.  Observers from government 
parties have been given authorization from Caracas to 
participate in these workshops, which is a first for USAID 
whose events are normally weighted towards participation by 
opposition supporters despite strong outreach efforts to 
government supporters.  An interesting outcome of most of 
these workshops has been requests by government-leaning 
participants that the training be extended to government 
supporters who are not electoral observers - a request 
mirrored by the opposition participants, but intriguing 
coming from government supporters given the GoV\'s ongoing 
attacks on organizations that accept USG funding.  This 
demonstrates the hunger that Venezuelans have for concrete 
actions that can help bridge the current political divide. 
14. (U) Planned for the coming months will be a campaign of 
civic education on the roles and responsibilities of 
citizens in a democratic society.  As a result of the events 
of the past 18 months, Venezuela has been forced to mature 
as a democratic society - the major lesson being that 
democracy is the responsibility of each idividual; that 
democracy is not something externl imposed on the 
individual.  Education regardin democratic values is 
constantly cited by Venezulans as an area that needs 
reinforcement.  This poject will be carried out by a 
consortium of NGO which specialize in civic education.  As 
a compement, continued emphasis will be placed on the roe 
of the media in a democracy. 
15.  (U) Anothe sector receiving increased emphasis by 
USAID is uman rights, in response to the human rights 
abues of late February / early March, 2004.  Two projects 
have been recently unded through DAI with local human 
rights organizations to support human rights education: 
education on human rights working with the Catholic Church 
and local NGO Ventana por la Libertad. (Note: The director 
of Ventana por la Libertad recently received a visit from 
three members of Venezuela\'s political police who questioned 
him, among other things, about his organization\'s receiving 
funding from the USG.  End note.)  Several more projects 
with local human rights organizations are in the process of 
being funded. In addition, USAID is studying the possibility 
of funding projects with Freedom House and the Inter- 
American Institute for Human Rights. 
16.  (U) Given the nature of the USAID Venezuela portfolio - 
and the complicated and fluid nature of the Venezuelan 
political landscape - USAID\'s measurable impact to date is 
hard to assess.  Certainly the USG is better engaged as a 
result of project activities carefully coordinated in the 
embassy in support of USG objectives.  Funding for the 
Carter Center continues to support critical activities, 
which was especially evident during the reparos process.  At 
minimum, as a result of the DAI activities there has been 
increased dialogue between groups that would not normally 
interact - with very encouraging results.  For example, the 
head of the state tourism board in Anzoategui State recently 
told the USAID Country Rep that at a meeting of the 
municipal tourism boards in late June he wished he\'d had a 
camera to record the presence of representatives of all the 
municipalities - something that he would have deemed 
impossible before the USAID-funded dialogue project which 
brought together municipal representation from both the 
government and the opposition.  In addition, there have been 
 
a number of interesting initiatives that have come out of 
the DAI activities. 
------------ 
Future Role 
------------ 
17.  (U) USAID/OTI normally works in a country for two or 
three years before handing off the program portfolio - 
normally to the USAID Mission (which does not exist in 
Venezuela), or to another donor organization.  USAID/OTI is 
currently anticipating handing over its activities in FY 
2005.  It is clear, however, that there will be a need for a 
USAID/OTI-type program in Venezuela through FY 2006 as 
Venezuela proceeds through the scheduled elections for 
national legislators and the presidency.

Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), and Movimiento Trabajo in 
Carabobo state complained about the lack of cooperation of 
Proyecto Venezuela in the recall referendum drive in talks 
with PolOffs July 8 and 9. Lucio Herrera, head of the 
Coordinadora Democratica in Carabobo, and regional head of 
COPEI, asserted that Proyecto Venezuela is not participating 
enthusiastically in the campaign. Not sending high level 
people to the Coordinadora Democratica meetings in Carabobo 
makes it impossible for Proyecto Venezuela to participate in 
Coordinadora decisions, he said. Herrera pointed out that 
Proyecto Venezuela has the most resources in the state, due 
to its long control of the state government. Herrera said 
parties such as Accion Democratica and Movimiento Trabajo are 
taking a strong line against Proyecto Venezuela for its 
failure to assume its responsibilities in Carabobo. Herrera 
said Proyecto Venezuela had failed to fulfill the 
responsibilities the Coordinadora gave it during the appeals 
process leaving many sites abandoned. He said that in the 
referendum, all parties would be involved in the running of 
all the electoral sites, in part to keep an eye on Proyecto 
Venezuela. 
 
3.  (C) Francisco Gonzalez and Francisco Bello, regional 
leaders of the Movimiento Trabajo repeated Herrera\'s 
complaints. Bello said the failure of Proyecto Venezuela to 
meet its responsibilities forced other parties to make up the 
difference, which put serious pressure on their finances. 
Gonzalez said Henrique Salas Roemer was running for President 
instead of supporting the referendum, in violation of the 
Coordinadora\'s strategy to make the referendum Chavez vs. 
Chavez. The local Accion Democratica leadership, and a local 
MAS leader also echoed the complaints. 
 
-------------- 
Salas Responds 
-------------- 
 
4.  (C) Salas told PolOffs that he did not believe the 
opposition could defeat Chavez in the referendum without an 
alternative candidate. Salas said he thinks there is only a 
20% chance Chavez would be defeated, and a 60% chance there 
would be no referendum or the result would not be recognized. 
Salas said Proyecto Venezuela had conducted a poll in one 
million households to see their receptivity to a presidential 
campaign by him. He reported only 25% rejection, leading him 
to believe the referendum will do better with a candidate. He 
said his success running Carabobo, and the need to move 
beyond Caracas to find a candidate, made him a logical 
choice. 
 
5.  (C) Proyecto Venezuela Deputy Pedro Diaz Blum said 
Proyecto Venezuela referendum propaganda would be 
presidential campaign material for Salas because the proposed 
 
primaries are one week after the referendum. Presuming that 
Miranda state Gov. Mendoza would be the prime candidate, Diaz 
Blum said he believed Salas would run if the Coordinadora did 
not agree to a primary election process to choose the 
candidate. Diaz said the Coordinadora\'s message to the poor, 
that they had to get rid of Chavez, was bound to fail. He 
said Chavez was the only person who had given poor people 
anything, and the opposition had to try to co-opt his 
programs, not take him on head on. He admitted that Salas\' 
biggest problem was his difficult personality. 
 
------- 
MVR POV 
------- 
 
6.  (C) PolOffs spoke with MVR Regional Coordinator Felipe 
Medina July 8. Medina called Proyecto Venezuela a \"state 
bureaucracy at the service of a personal dynasty.\" He said 
that Proyecto Venezuela\'s power in Carabobo could not be 
under-estimated, and that the opposition would be strong. He 
said he had never seen the \"people\" so enthusiastic, and said 
there was no way Chavez could lose the referendum. If he did 
lose, it would be fraud, which might lead to violence. There 
might also be violence if the opposition refused to recognize 
a Chavez victory, he said. 
 
--------- 
CNE Ready 
--------- 
 
7.  (C) Javier Armas, head of the National Electoral Council 
in Carabobo, told PolOffs that the timeline for getting the 
voting and fingerprint machines ready, closing the electoral 
rolls, and setting up the voting centers was tight, but that 
he thought everything would be ready. He reported that the 
new voting centers being set up are only for people who have 
never been registered, or who have asked to be moved. Other 
voting centers will be split into two or more centers, but 
they will be within blocks of each other. He said CANTV had 
wired the voting centers, though there was only one 
Smartmatic machine in Carabobo on July 9. He reported 84 
machines would arrive the week of July 12. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The dispute between Proyecto Venezuela and the 
Coordinadora Democratica does not appear to be a serious 
threat to the recall referendum in Carabobo. Salas and 
Proyecto Venezuela will work for the referendum, but for 
Salas it will be in his own manner, and for his own benefit 
as well.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On June 9, the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) launched 
\"Plan Consenso Pais\" (National Consensus Plan), a set of 
proposals that address the key social problems in Venezuela. 
The four major points of the plan are employment, security, 
health, and education.  The plan serves as a guide for 
reconciliation and reconstruction for a potential unified 
opposition government.  The official unveiling of this plan 
is a positive, pro-active step for the opposition.  President 
Chavez and other GoV officials strongly attacked the Plan, 
calling it a Consenso Pa\' Bush (Consensus for Bush) financed 
by the U.S. government.  Chavez supported his criticism by 
referring to the work of Venezuelan think tank CEDICE, which 
influenced the Coordinadora\'s plan, but was more neoliberal 
and capitalist in scope.  End summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Rally for the \"Yes\" Vote 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Poloff attended the launching of Plan Consenso Pais on 
June 9 by the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) in Caracas.  The 
CD distributed color pamphlets describing the four main 
points of the Plan (employment, security, health, and 
education) and 117-page white booklets that outline the 
ideas, proposals, and mechanics of the Plan.  To begin the 
event, the CD played ominous music while showing a short 
video depicting violence, poverty, and the social problems of 
Venezuela.  Diego Bautista Urbaneja, director of Plan 
Consenso Pais, then officially unveiled the Plan and its 
major points.  Behind Urbaneja, civil society leaders sat in 
bleachers.  In an organized manner, the leaders stood up and 
described the current social problems and the Plan\'s 
response.  To conclude, the CD played upbeat Venezuelan music 
and a video depicting hopeful Venezuelans and beautiful 
places around the country.  The civil society leaders stood 
in unison, raised their Plan booklets, and shouted \"Claro que 
Si!\" (Yes of course!).  While key CD political leaders sat in 
the first two rows of the audience (i.e. Juan Fernandez, 
Pompeyo Marquez, Enrique Mendoza), no prominent leader spoke 
during the event. 
 
----------------- 
The Plan of Plans 
----------------- 
 
3. (U) The main pillars of the Plan, featured in a one-page 
pamphlet, are employment, security, health, and education. 
The pamphlet describes each problem and then offers a concise 
opposition response and action plan.  The CD considers this 
Plan as a guide for a transition government, \"a proposal for 
a better Venezuela.\"  After an introduction describing the 
overall vision and leadership of this Plan, seven chapters 
provide action plans on the following specific issues: 
employment, security, social issues (i.e. health, education), 
decentralization, reconciliation, foreign relations, and 
petroleum. 
 
 
4. (U) Along with the \"governance pact,\" Plan Consenso Pais 
is designed to ensure a smooth transition process and an 
effective governance strategy.  Within the seven chapters, 
there are twelve themes that outline the economic, social, 
and political transition plans. 
 
Economic themes 
-- employment: proposals to create and promote jobs in all 
sectors 
-- telecommunications: increase global access; keep current 
Organic Law of Telecommunications 
-- petroleum: promote investment; reform policies to improve 
 
production 
-- debt reduction: reduce internal and external debt 
-- economic security: fiscal reform; improve tax collection; 
reduce tax evasion 
 
Social themes 
-- education: create a decentralized educational system that 
promotes school autonomy 
-- social development: create new ministry of social 
development; decentralize efforts 
-- physical security: increase police forces 
 
Political themes 
-- reconciliation: promote an inclusive political process 
-- decentralization: give money and power to states and 
municipalities 
-- transition and continuity: maintain public policies and 
works through the transition period 
-- rule of law: respect institutions, ensure the integrity of 
the judicial system 
 
The entire Plan is at http://www.consensopais.com. 
 
5. (U) Urbaneja described the year-long process to create 
this Plan, saying the CD organized town meetings and met with 
numerous political parties, civil society groups, and 
experts.  The introduction of the booklet describes the Plan 
as a combination of many plans, providing a unified plan for 
an opposition-led government.  The booklet lists the members 
of the CD commission who organized the Plan, but it does not 
name the organizations or parties involved in the Plan\'s 
creation. 
 
---------------------------------- 
A Positive Step for the Opposition 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) After the event, Enrique Mendoza, Miranda state 
governor and CD leader, asserted that employment will be the 
major goal of the plan as well as decentralization and 
reconciliation.  Juan Fernandez, opposition leader and 
President of Gente de Petroleo, told poloff on June 8 that 
the Plan and its launch are meant to satisfy the middle and 
upper-class voters who want to see a concrete plan.  He 
recognized, however, that the CD expects the Plan to be an 
ineffective tool to reach poorer voters. 
 
------------------------------ 
Other Plans of the Opposition 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Plan Consenso Pais was first published in March 2004. 
Other plans, developed by opposition-aligned groups and 
organizations, existed before Plan Consenso Pais.  Most 
notably, a group of researchers from private and public 
universities presented the \"Social Agreement for Development 
and the Elimination of Poverty\" in August 2003 (reftel). 
Social scientists from Andres Bello Catholic University, 
Simon Bolivar University, Central University of Venezuela, 
and the Institute for Graduate Studies in Management produced 
a 138-page report that addressed policy reforms in economics, 
social programs, and institutions.  The Social Agreement\'s 
coordinator described the plan as \"a post-referendum 
governance plan centered on job creation as the focus of 
eliminating poverty.\"  While this document shares common 
themes with Plan Consenso Pais, it received little publicity. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Immediate GoV Reaction - Consenso Pa\' Bush 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (U) Dario Vivas, MVR Deputy and Comando Maisanta leader, 
talked with a reporter from state-run Venezolana de 
Television on July 9 after the launching of Plan Consenso 
Pais.  While he applauded the opposition\'s move away from its 
alleged violent past of coups and strikes, he warned that 
this plan is a return to the past, particularly economic 
reforms highlighted in the Plan.  Beyond attacking the plan, 
Vivas made several ad hominem attacks on opposition figures, 
 
including billionaire Gustavo Cisneros.  The pro-government 
tabloid Diario Vea asserted that the Plan will eliminate the 
Missions (GoV social programs), reinstate coup-plotting 
military leaders, and privatize PDVSA (the state-run oil 
company). 
 
9. (U) President Hugo Chavez attacked the Plan Consenso Pais 
on June 10 and 11, calling it the \"Consenso Pa\' Bush\" (The 
Consensus for Bush).  He said the plan was anti-Christian and 
from the devil.  On June 11, he devoted close to an hour of 
his weekly national radio-television address, Alo Presidente, 
to criticism of the Plan.  Chavez claimed that the Center for 
International Private Enterprise (CIPE), one of the National 
Endowment for Democracy\'s (NED) core institutes, gave 
$316,000 to the Venezuelan Center for Dissemination of 
Economic Information (CEDICE) to work on this plan in 2003. 
He asserted that CEDICE directly worked with the CD to create 
the \"interventionist\" Plan Consenso Pais.  Chavez read to his 
audience from a 2003 report to CIPE by CEDICE, titled 
\"Project Consensus to Build a National Agenda,\" and claimed 
that this was evidence of US hands in the current Plan 
Consenso Pais.  Diego Bautista Urbaneja, the Plan Consenso 
Pais director, denied Chavez\'s allegations and said that 
Chavez confused Plan Consenso Pais with Construyendo 
Consensos Para Una Venezuela Libre (Building Consensus for a 
Free Venezuela). 
 
10. (C) CEDICE reports, made public through a FOIA request by 
Chavez supporters in the U.S., show that Diego Bautista 
Urbaneja met with CEDICE leaders.  In addition, CEDICE 
asserts that the CD Commission did use the consensus document 
as a \"basis\" for its Plan Consenso Pais.  However, the CEDICE 
and Coordinadora documents differ in scope and 
recommendations.  There are common themes, such as 
reconciliation, reconstruction, and decentralization, but the 
timeframe of Plan Consenso Pais is the transition period 
while Construyendo Consensos is a longer-term vision.  Also, 
Construyendo Consensos outwardly supports more neoliberal, 
capitalist policies, such as privatization and fiscal 
austerity measures, than the proposals in Plan Consenso Pais. 
 While some opposition political parties and civil society 
organizations participated in both Construyendo Consensos and 
Plan Consenso Pais, there appears to be no money used by 
CEDICE to fund Coordinadora efforts to create Plan Consenso 
Pais. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) The opposition has provided a concrete set of 
proposals in Plan Consenso Pais.  The Plan provides over 200 
goals for a unified opposition transition government, which 
cover a comprehensive list of political, social, and economic 
issues.  The opposition is improving its organizational 
capacity and beginning its mobilization for the August 15 
referendum.  President Chavez\'s attacks and attempts to 
discredit the Plan indicate concern about the opposition\'s 
focus on issues such as security, health care, and jobs. 
Rather than rebut the points on substantive grounds, Chavez 
instead resorted to his favorite whipping boy, the U.S., a 
formula that works with his core constituency, and possibly 
with some uncommitted voters.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) continued 
preparations for the August 15 recall referendum against 
President Hugo Chavez.  Citing logistical difficulties, the 
CNE decided July 13 not to expand the number of voting 
centers, primarily in poor neighborhoods, as contemplated 
previously.  The CNE board reportedly approved invitations 
for international observers, but as of July 15 no invitations 
had been issued.  According to a contractor for the 
Smartmatic consortium supplying election machines, CNE 
officials tried to take over operation of parts of the 
automated voting system, which will be tested in a nationwide 
simulation July 18.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
CNE Closes Voting Center Lists, Agrees On Observers 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) announced July 13 
it would not add 1000 voting centers to poor areas or 
reconfigure voting table distribution in an effort to 
increase voting there as previously contemplated.  CNE 
Director Jorge Rodriguez said the change would have required 
the redistribution of two million voters, which would have 
been too hard to do before the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  With the list of voting centers finalized, the 
Smartmatic consortium can now finish wiring the existing 
voting centers for the automated voting system.  Smartmatic 
is still waiting for the CNE to give them the numbers of 
voters registered at each of the 19,200 electoral tables so 
the voting machines can be programmed. 
 
3. (C) The CNE approved on July 14 the list of international 
observers for the referendum.  The list reportedly contains 
47 organizations and 17 international personalities who will 
participate, including Nobel Prize winners Nelson Mandela, 
Mikhail Gorbachev, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rigoberta Menchu, 
and Joseph Stiglitz.  Carter Center representative Edgardo 
Mimica told poloff July 15 they still had not received the 
formal invitation from the CNE.  He said CNE officials told 
him \"maybe next week.\"  Pro-Chavez CNE Director Oscar 
Battaglini said in a press interview that the Carter Center 
and OAS would be invited, but added they must accept the 
sovereignty of the CNE and the conditions the CNE has for 
observer missions.  He said in no case would an observer be 
permitted to make public statements or contradict a decision 
by the CNE like the OAS and Carter Center had done in the 
past.  State television director Vladimir Villegas told 
Charge July 13 that OAS and Carter Center would be invited -- 
but that the GOV really wanted an additional observer 
presence. 
 
-------------------------- 
Simulation Set For July 18 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The CNE announced it would hold a referendum 
simulation July 18 to test the automated voting system and 
the fingerprint capture system.  The test will use 4,768 
voting machines the state capitals and major cities.  Twenty 
fingerprint machines will be tested in Caracas and a handful 
of states.  CNE Alternate Director Tibisay Lucena told 
reporters July 13 that international observers would be 
invited to watch the simulation (Note:  Though the OAS and 
CNE have not been formally invited, other international 
observers have been visiting the CNE, such as representatives 
of the Andean Electoral Council, the Ecuadorian electoral 
authority, and CAPEL, the regional electoral organization 
 
 
located in Costa Rica.) 
 
------------------------------------- 
Mejias Gives Testimony About Registry 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Pro-opposition CNE Director Sobella Mejias complied 
with a summons to be interviewed July 13 in the Attorney 
General\'s office (Fiscalia General).  Rodriguez filed a 
complaint in June alleging Mejias, in her capacity as head of 
the CNE\'s electoral registry commission, had failed to remove 
more than 50,000 deceased persons from the registry prior to 
the signature appeals drive.  Mejias spent six hours with 
prosecutors, with delays caused by errors in the official 
complaint that required correcting.  Pro-opposition Director 
Ezequiel Zamora told reporters later that it is odd that the 
Attorney General chose to follow up on this complaint when 
there are thousands of others that are not addressed. 
Rodriguez is scheduled to give testimony July 16. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
CNE Signs With Smartmatic, But Not Without Wrinkles 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. (C) The CNE signed on July 14 the $27 million service 
contract with the Smartmatic consortium for the automated 
electoral system.  Additionally, Smartmatic contractor Jorge 
Tirado told poloff July 12 the CNE had sought to replace the 
8,000 CANTV voting machine operators with CNE personnel.  The 
Smartmatic consortium refused citing the necessity to have 
its own trained people on the ground during the referendum. 
Tirado said a compromise had been worked out that would allow 
the CNE to have 8,000 workers watching the 8,000 CANTV 
operators, and inform poll workers of any irregularities with 
the voting machines.  Tirado also said a group of 32 software 
professors from public universities continued to audit a 
portion of Smartmatic\'s software codes. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) International observation continues to be the Chavez\'s 
Achilles\' heel, so we can expect the CNE to continue to 
foot-drag over invitations to respectable entities like the 
OAS and Carter Center while they showboat other so-called 
observers like the Andean Electoral Council or Rigoberta 
Menchu.  Each day that passes without the OAS and Carter 
Center observer missions on the ground erodes the 
effectiveness of international observation and, hence, the 
transparency of the referendum.

for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV is catering to evangelical Christians, who 
make up nine percent of Venezuela\'s population, to build the 
support base of President Hugo Chavez and to win the August 
recall referendum.  Some Evangelicals have plugged into 
Chavez\'s coffers and his social message, at times reflecting 
an anti-USG bias.  Chavez himself sympathizes with 
Evangelicals, and at least once claimed to be one.  Like many 
his efforts to incorporate segments of Venezuelan society 
into Chavismo, Chavez\'s attempt to win over Evangelicals is 
poorly planned and executed, based more on payoffs than 
conviction.  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Evangelicals in Venezuela 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Evangelicals estimate their numbers at around nine 
percent of the population, or fewer than two million 
Venezuelans.  (Note:  Venezuelan Catholics call \"Evangelical\" 
all Christian non-Catholics, including Mormons and Jehovah\'s 
witnesses.  Venezuelan Evangelicals use it as a doctrinal 
description that includes many mainline Protestant groups 
which emphasize aggressive evangelization and 
church-planting.)  Samuel Olson, President of the Evangelical 
Council of Venezuela (ECV), told poloff the number of 
evangelicals is not growing exponentially as in other 
countries in the region because of Venezuela\'s historic high 
cost of living, which has limited expansion efforts by 
foreign missionaries. 
3. (C) Olson, a Princeton-trained minister and son of Amcit 
missionaries to Venezuela, told poloff June 14 Venezuela\'s 
Evangelical movement is afflicted by \"post-modernism,\" which 
he said is characterized by lax personal morals and an 
emphasis on money and power.  Olson also noted that 
Venezuelan Evangelicals adhere to an \"apostolic movement\" in 
which popular Evangelical pastors claim authority over large 
numbers of churches (or all of Venezuela), often using titles 
such as \"Bishop\" or \"Apostle.\"  Aside from this relatively 
new phenomenon, Evangelical churches in Venezuela are largely 
independent and only loosely affiliated among themselves or 
with foreign religious organizations. 
 
------------------------- 
Evangelical Organizations 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) There are three evangelical confederations in 
Venezuela that, according to one estimate, incorporate less 
than half of the evangelical churches in Venezuela.  Unlike 
their Catholic counterpart, the Episcopal Council of 
Venezuela, the Evangelical confederations do not supervise or 
regulate member churches.  The confederations mostly advocate 
for religious freedom, collaborate on the training of 
pastors, and only sparingly wade into doctrinal questions. 
The confederations, Olson claimed, try to remain apolitical, 
though Venezuela\'s acrid political environment often forces 
responses.  For example, Olson was forever branded as an 
opposition member when he appeared on stage with other 
religious leaders during the events of April 2002 praying for 
the victims of the Miraflores slayings.  Olson said the 
prayer event was carried split-screen with the swearing-in of 
short-lived interim President Pedro Carmona, giving rise to 
subsequent allegations that Olson had supported Carmona. 
 
5. (C) Olson\'s ECV was founded in 1964 as a reaction to the 
signing of the concordat between the GOV and the Catholic 
Church.  The evangelicals worried, Olson said, that the 
Catholics\' relations with the state would prejudice 
evangelicals.  The CEV currently has 160 members, some of 
which, like the Baptists, have hundreds of individual 
churches.  Olson estimated the CEV represents 4000 individual 
churches.  Among these members are many groups with U.S. 
 
origins, such as the Baptists and Assemblies of God.  Olson, 
who has presided over ECV for six years, is frequently 
invited to appear with catholic and Jewish leaders at 
ecumenical events. 
 
6. (C) The Confederation of Evangelical-Pentecostal Pastors 
of Venezuela, with around 90 members and 4000 churches, broke 
from the ECV in 1984.  Olson claimed the schism came when 
some conservative Pentecostal leaders became worried over the 
ECV\'s relations with non-Christian religions.  Finally, the 
Union of Christian Churches of Venezuela (\"Unicristiana\") was 
formed in the 1990s under the guidance of \"Apostle\" Raul 
Avila, an Argentine who pastors the Christ for the Nations 
Center in Caracas, a church that openly supports President 
Hugo Chavez.  Unicristiana President Elias Rincon told poloff 
June 18 the confederation comprises some 200 churches. 
 
---------------------------- 
Chavez Courting Evangelicals 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Olson claimed that certain Evangelical ministers have 
received large amounts of money for their churches in return 
for their support of the GOV.  He said he had spoken with ECV 
pastors who have been offered housing and pension benefits in 
exchange for open political support for Chavez.  The state 
television station carries two programs -- free of charge -- 
of popular evangelical ministers (Note: A Catholic priest 
also hosts a state television program).  State television 
also carries GOV ads with images of Evangelical church 
services and of the ten commandments and scripture 
references.  Evangelical Bishop Jesus Ramon Perez, whose 
program airs Saturday mornings on state television, denied to 
poloff June 16 that he had received large sums of money.  He 
said his only funding from the GOV came from a work program 
in which 300 of his congregation members received grants to 
form work cooperatives from the state development bank, 
Bandes.  (Note:  The president of Bandes is Nelson Merentes, 
a member of Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta campaign committee.) 
 
8. (C) Unicristiana\'s Rincon said his church had received 
grants from the GOV to help homeless people in Caracas.  He 
claimed that more than 300 people had been reintegrated into 
regular society via their program, which utilizes Chavez\'s 
social \"missions.\"  The homeless people, for example, are 
sent to Mission Robinson\'s literacy and education classes, 
and later participate in \"Mission Vuelvan Caras\" to get job 
training. 
 
-------------- 
A Common Cause 
-------------- 
 
9. (C) Bishop Perez described his support for Chavez (he 
reportedly called Evangelicals to rally to Miraflores Palace 
to support Chavez during the events of April 2002) as one of 
a common social agenda.  In 1994, Perez signed a \"Spiritual 
Declaration of Independence\" with 600 other Evangelical 
pastors denouncing the GOV\'s rampant corruption and 
inattention to the plight of the poor.  Perez, who lived on 
the streets of Caracas as a child, sees Chavez as an answer 
to his prayer.  Perez claims the Catholic Church used its 
influence with previous governments to persecute 
Evangelicals, including falsely imprisoning him in 1999 
(press reports say the Bishop was involved in a stolen car

Anti-American Bias 
------------------ 
 
10. (C) Rincon and fellow \"Apostle\" Ramiro Torres admitted 
their church leans toward support for Chavez, and church 
teachings have a clear tint of Chavez\'s social class 
diatribe.  The church\'s website, in fact, carries 
anti-American (and anti-Bush) stories taken directly from GOV 
media sources.  Asked why a church website contains only 
pro-GOV links and news, the two said it was a question of 
justice:  private media is anti-Chavez and the church felt 
 
the need to provide balance to its congregation members. 
Torres went on to say that the United States is suffering the 
\"wrath of God\" for its immorality, citing same sex marriages 
and the invasion of Iraq, which he said his church opposed. 
He predicted that the Evangelical Christians of \"the South\" 
would help \"the North\" find its way. 
 
------------------------------- 
Chavez:  Evangelical For A Day? 
------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Claims that Chavez is an Evangelical have surfaced on 
several occasions.  Chavez himself commented in January 2002 
that he was an Evangelical, only to backtrack once the media 
began to scrutinize his claims.  Perez, who claims to have 
had meetings with Chavez, says Chavez had \"an encounter with 
God\" while in prison after his failed coup attempt in 1992. 
Perez claimed a group of Evangelicals meet regularly in 
Miraflores, though he did not know if Chavez attended the 
meetings. 
 
--------------------------- 
GOV Denies Evangelical Bias 
--------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Gonzalo Gonzalez, Director of the Office of Worship 
of the Ministry of Interior and Justice (MIJ), told poloff 
June 23 that the GOV is not trying to play to Evangelical 
interests.  He said the GOV is attempting to apply the 1999 
Constitution, which guarantees religious expression.  The 
traditional GOV funding of the Catholic Church (a by-product 
of the concordat) is inconsistent with the new constitution, 
Gonzalez argued and must be expanded to include other groups. 
 Evangelical Bishop Perez told poloff the amounts offered by 
MIJ are \"offensive\" in the size of the amounts. (Note:  The 
money from MIJ is only a portion of the funding the GOV makes 
available to churches, as other ministries such as health and 
education also fund religious projects.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) Chavez\'s catering to Evangelicals has all the 
earmarks of the tendency to seek Bolivarian alternatives to 
the status quo, in this case the Catholic Church which is one 
of Chavez\'s greatest critics.  Like many Chavista ideas, 
however, it seems to be applied with less-than-full 
efficiency, targeting a few controversial Chavista ministers 
(whom Olson calls \"rejects\" of traditional Evangelical 
groups).  Additionally, there is little evidence that the 
Evangelicals constitute a monolithic voting bloc that Chavez 
and his supporters could readily exploit.

SUMMARY

1. (C) Energy Vice Minister Luis Vierma told Emboffs July 12 
that Venezuela is currently producing 3 million b/d of oil. 
He also provided a glowing overview of upcoming projects, 
both for Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and the private 
sector.  Most industry analysts, however, continue to put 
Venezuelan production at 2.5 million b/d and believe it is 
dropping slowly.  We are also skeptical that PDVSA has the 
managerial or the technical capacity to push many new 
projects forward.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On July 12, Econcouns, accompanied by Petroleum 
Attache, met with Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma 
to discuss a wide range of issues.  His comments on the GOV\'s 
vision of \"PetroAmerica\" are presented in septel. 
 
------------- 
WHAT\'S COMING 
------------- 
 
3. (C) Vierma repeated the GOV claim that Venezuelan 
production is approximately 3 million b/d and offered a 
glowing tour d\'horizon of projects included in the 2004 PDVSA 
budget and beyond.  Starting his summary in western 
Venezuela, Vierma said that the engineering for the cryogenic 
complex, a gas liquefication project designed to help 
alleviate gas shortages, is underway.  He verified press 
reports that PDVSA had recently started drilling a well in 
the Tomoporo oil field (more details on this important field 
follow in septel) and said the company also plans to explore 
for gas in the southern part of Lake Maracaibo. 
 
4. (C) Moving east to the giant Paraguana refinery complex, 
the world\'s largest, Vierma said a debottlenecking is planned 
as well as a new refinery line and a new coker.  He added 
that the Ico Project, the gas pipeline planned to 
interconnect the gas production areas in eastern Venezuela 
with the gas-starved west, is also now underway.  Continuing 
in the theme of gas development, Vierma said that PDVSA plans 
to explore for deeper gas reserves in Anaco and to expand the 
natural gas liquids production capacity at the Jose 
Industrial Complex for processing that gas.  In eastern 
Venezuela, PDVSA will press ahead with the delineation of 
discoveries in the Tacata, Chaguaramal and Cotoperi oil 
fields.  In addition, Vierma said that PDVSA President Ali 
Rodriguez will shortly announce the positive results of a 
well drilled in the Travis field in northern Monagas state. 
Vierma asserted that by the end of 2004, PDVSA will have 120 
rigs at work, either drilling or performing well workovers. 
 
--------------------------- 
OFF-SHORE & OTHER PROSPECTS 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Turning to activities off-shore, Vierma said there 
will be a ceremony August 1 to mark the launch of drilling by 
ChevronTexaco in Block 2 of the Deltana Platform gas project. 
 The official license for Block 3 will be granted to 
ChevronTexaco at that ceremony, said Vierma.  Statoil is 
expected to begin drilling in Block 4 in November.  Vierma 
added that seven additional off-shore blocks (expected to be 
gas blocks) will be opened for bidding within the next few 
weeks:  five in the Gulf of Venezuela and two in waters off 
Falcon state.  When asked what the delay has been (the 
opening of this bid round has been long awaited), Vierma laid 
the delay at the feet of the Foreign Ministry, saying it has 
been carefully checking the coordinates of the proposed Gulf 
of Venezuela blocks to avoid areas in dispute with Colombia. 
Vierma said the GOV is also considering re-opening the five 
gas blocks that were not bid in 2001 (Note:  only two of 
seven gas blocks received bids at that time).  He added that 
the blocks would probably be expanded to make them more 
attractive to bidders. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE HYDROCARBONS LAW 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) In response to a question about the status of 
negotiations under the Hydrocarbons Law, Vierma confirmed 
that talks are continuing with Repsol over the migration of 
its operating contract for the Mene Grand field to a joint 
venture under the 2001 law.  (Note:  Rumors have held that 
the agreement is close to completion.  Vierma, however, was 
less positive, saying that the valuation of reserves is a 
sticky problem.)  He confirmed that besides U.S. independent 
Harvest International, Lukoil and Algeria\'s Sonatrach are 
also considering taking over the operation of small fields 
under the terms of the 2001 law. 
 
7. (C) With respect to the expansion of the extra-heavy crude 
projects in Venezuela\'s Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt, Vierma said 
the GOV has had discussions with the companies that now 
operate projects - ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, 
Statoil (Norway) and Total (France) - as well as others 
including Amerada Hess, Marathon, Eni (Italy) and Shell.  In 
order to make new projects possible under the Hydrocarbons 
Law, he said, they are being conceptualized differently. 
Instead of the current model in which each project has field 
production feeding directly into its own dedicated upgrader 
(i.e, to refine the tar-like crude into lighter synthetic 
crude), the new model would call for field production by a 
mixed company 51 percent owned by PDVSA while up to 100 
percent of the company handling refining and 
commercialization could be owned by the private sector. 
Vierma added that PDVSA has almost finished the work of 
determining how future blocks will be apportioned. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) Vierma repeated the GOV mantra of 3 million b/d 
national production and even said that PDVSA would increase 
its own production by the end of 2004.  This claim is greeted 
with skepticism by most industry analysts who believe that 
Venezuelan production is actually approximately 2.5 million 
b/d and dropping slowly.  Our own conversations with service 
company representatives who have first hand knowledge of 
activities in Venezuela\'s fields lead us to doubt the GOV 
claims.  Vierma\'s list of upcoming projects is also 
impressive but many of them have been on the drawing board 
for years.  We are skeptical that PDVSA has the managerial or 
the technical capacity to push these projects forward in 
accordance with Vierma\'s bright dream.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Energy Vice Minister Luis Vierma told Emboffs July 12 
that discussions with Caribbean nations on the formation of a 
\"PetroCaribe\" joint venture are at a preliminary stage. 
According to Vierma, the GOV\'s plans for the Hemisphere 
envision a holding company \"PetroAmerica\" that would have 
three subsidiaries, PetroCaribe, PetroSur, and PetroAndino. 
These companies would be involved primarily in the downstream 
functions of the oil industry, i.e. refining and 
commercialization.  Although Vierma made no reference to any 
political element to \"PetroAmerica\" or its would-be 
components, it is inescapable.  We believe Venezuela is 
aggressively pushing its plans for the integration of energy 
companies throughout the Hemisphere to gain political 
strength.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On July 12, Econcouns, accompanied by Petroleum 
Attache, met with Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma 
to discuss a wide range of issues.  His comments on 
Venezuelan production and upcoming projects are presented in 
septel. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
PETROAMERICA:  AN OIL COMPANY FOR THE AMERICAS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (C) On July 12, Reuters reported that on July 10 the GOV 
had signed \"a preliminary energy cooperation accord with 11 
Caribbean nations which aims to refine Venezuelan crude into 
cheaper products for the region.\"  According to the report, 
the signatories to the agreement were Guyana, Antigua and 
Barbuda, the Bahamas, Dominican, Jamaica, Trinidad and 
Tobago, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, 
Suriname, Grenada, Cuba and Venezuela.  Emboffs raised this 
story with Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma, who 
explained that the GOV\'s discussions with the Caribbean 
nations are at a preliminary stage.  Vierma described the 
July 10 meeting as one in which the Caribbean representatives 
described the serious impact of high oil prices on their 
economies.  He characterized the July 10 document as a \"joint 
communique\" rather than an \"accord,\" showing their intent to 
continue studying the concept.  If the talks are successful, 
Vierma said, the resulting joint venture, PetroCaribe, would 
be one of three subsidiaries of a holding company called 
PetroAmerica.  The other two would be PetroSur and 
PetroAndino. These companies would be involved in the 
downstream functions of the oil industry, i.e. refining and 
commercialization. 
 
----------- 
PETROCARIBE 
----------- 
 
4. (C) Turning first to PetroCaribe, Vierma, an engineer, 
drew a chart demonstrating the flow of products through the 
refinery process, to transportation, storage and 
commercialization.  In its initial phase, PetroCaribe would 
be a joint venture company that would harness the synergies 
in the refinery sector among Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago, 
and Jamaica.  Venezuela would ship oil to Trinidad & Tobago\'s 
160,000 b/d refinery and Jamaica\'s 35,000 b/d refinery.  The 
joint venture would then handle the marketing of the refined 
products to the smaller islands in the Caribbean by a fleet 
of boats.  Each island would invest in storage tanks and 
service stations which would give it an equity stake in 
PetroCaribe.  Pointing to the Bahamasas an example, Vierma 
said its gasoline is now $4/gallon.  PetroCaribe, he said, 
might eventually be able to subsidize that cost, depending on 
PetroCaribe revenues and the equity share of the Bahamas in 
 
 
the joint venture. 
 
5. (C) When Emboffs asked if the intent is for PetroCaribe to 
take over the market share of private sector companies, 
Vierma responded that companies now in the Caribbean market, 
such as Shell, would be invited to participate.  For one 
thing, he noted, the would-be partners do not have the 
tankers needed to transport the refined products through the 
island chains.  Vierma added that the entire Caribbean, 
including Cuba and \"even Puerto Rico,\" could participate. 
Energy Minister Ramirez subsequently announced to the 
Venezuelan press on July 14 that regional energy ministers 
will meet August 26-27 in Jamaica to work on creating 
PetroCaribe.  Ramirez is quoted in the press as having said 
that the venture seeks to cut out middlemen in the Caribbean. 
 
-------- 
PETROSUR 
-------- 
 
6. (C) \"PetroSur,\" said Vierma, would encompass the deal, 
signed April 6, under which Venezuela sells fuel oil and 
diesel fuel to Argentina in exchange for Argentine food and 
manufacturered products (see reftel).  Vierma added that the 
GOA has also approached PDVSA to propose that PDVSA join it 
in evaluating certain Argentine exploration blocks. 
 
----------- 
PETROANDINO 
----------- 
 
7. (C) With respect to the eventual formation of a 
\"PetroAndino,\" Vierma noted that Venezuela had signed a 
technical agreement with Boliva on May 13 and had also inked 
an agreement on LPG with Ecuador.  He characterized Peru as 
\"cold\" to the prospects of a joint venture, while  Venezuela 
and Colombia are still discussing the possibilities of a 
cross-border gas pipeline (this will reportedly be an issue 
in the July 14 meeting between Presidents Chavez and Uribe). 
This pipeline would be designed initially to carry Colombian 
gas to western Venezuela.  The flow would be reversed as 
Colombian stocks decline and what are expected to be robust 
Venezuelan stocks are brought on line. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) Although Vierma made no reference to any political 
element to \"PetroAmerica\" or its would-be components, it is 
inescapable.  In fact, Minister of Energy and Mines Rafael 
Ramirez was quoted in the July 12 Reuters report as saying 
with respect to PetroCaribe, \"it is important to understand 
that this type of accord is not a commercial accord....but 
fundamentally ...is a political agreement.\"  Petro-diplomacy 
has a long tradition in Venezuela, although it has usually 
been used with the Caribbean and Central American countries 
which are signatories of the San Jose and Caracas Energy 
Accords.  Venezuela\'s efforts to push its plans for the 
integration of energy companies throughout the Hemisphere, 
however, is in line with President Chavez\'s desire to gain 
political strength and to play a larger role in the 
Hemisphere.  The development of broader export markets for 
Venezuela\'s oil would also be a logical step toward President 
Chavez\'s goal of shifting Venezuela\'s oil away from its 
current market -- the U.S.

1. (U) The Episcopal Conference of Venezuela (CEV), comprised 
of Venezuela\'s Catholic bishops, July 12 exhorted all actors 
participating in the August 15 presidential recall referendum 
to act ethically. The bishops also urged them to ensure that 
the process remains free of corruption and fraud so that the 
results, regardless of whom wins, are accepted without 
violence, and all voters participate in the referendum. The 
statement will be read during mass at all Catholic churches 
on July 18. Chavez supporters reacted with allegations that 
the hierarchy of the Catholic Church is taking an 
inappropriate role in politics. End Summary.

CHURCH STATEMENT RELEASED 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Episcopal Conference of Venezuela (CEV) issued a 
15-point statement on July 12 urging voters to participate in 
the August 15 recall referendum against President Hugo 
Chavez. CEV President and Archbishop of Merida, Baltasar 
Porras, called on Venezuelan society to eradicate intolerance 
and exclusion, saying that at least minimum agreement was 
needed to build democracy. The document calls upon the 
military, political leaders, the media and telecommunications 
industry, and international observers to do their part in 
ensuring that the Revocatory Referendum process is 
transparent and just. It also specifically exhorts the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) to act impartially and to 
present the results of the referendum in a transparent 
manner. The CEV statement will be read to parishioners during 
Sunday mass July 18. 
 
3. (U) Ramon Viloria, Bishop of Puerto Cabello said, \"We are 
calling for transparency precisely because of the atmosphere 
that has been growing. We are bringing it to light now 
because we want absolutely no obstacles of any kind when the 
will of the people is manifest. That is why we are simply 
putting out a warning so that no organization, in this case 
the CNE, hampers the fulfillment of the will of the people.\" 
 
----------------------- 
CHAVEZ SUPPORTERS REACT 
----------------------- 
 
4. (U) Chavez supporters denounced the report as evidence of 
the Church\'s bias against Chavez. Willian Lara, National 
Assembly deputy for Chavez\'s Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) 
said, \"As a Venezuelan Catholic I am asking the bishops to 
understand that the Catholic Church belongs to the people of 
God and not to the clergy no matter how high their position. 
Neither the church nor it\'s leadership, like the CEV, should 
be used for political campaigning that favors one side over 
another.\" Lara also called Porras a \"politician in a 
hassock.\" MVR deputy Darios Vivas said the CEV should have 
warned the opposition parties, as they are the ones prone to 
violate Venezuelan law. Vivas accused the Church\'s leadership 
of having participated in the events of April 2002. In a 
later statement, Vice-President Jose Vincente Rangel reminded 
reporters that all Venezuelans are part of the Catholic 
\"flock\" despite their diverse ways of thinking. He urged the 
Church to avoid taking political sides. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Chavez\'s government and the CEV have a history of 
finding themselves at odds. The leadership of the Catholic 
Church has issued similar statements in the past, most 
recently in anticipation of the Reparo vote in May 2004. 
Chavez supporters have responded and continue to respond by 
attacking the Catholic Church leadership and appealing to 
 
ordinary Catholics to not allow themselves to be manipulated.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Coordinadora Democratica (CD) leaders worry they have 
insufficient funding and time before the recall referendum 
against President Hugo Chavez scheduled for August 15 to 
counter Chavez\'s campaign.  CD advisor Jorge Casado told 
A/DCM July 18 that Chavez appears to be succeeding in 
projecting the image of a winner, with polls showing him 
gaining strength.  The prime effect on the opposition is that 
businessmen are reluctant to give money, Casado said, which 
has limited the Coordinadora\'s campaign publicity and 
hampered their ability to mobilize people and show public 
support.  Casado said the political parties and NGOs in the 
Coordinadora are working at the grassroots, people-to-people, 
but the fear is that the effort will pale in contrast to 
Chavez\'s flood of money and publicity.  MAS President told 
Charge July 20 that, though there appears to be a void in 
Caracas, opposition leaders such as himself have full 
schedules, addressing groups usually ranging from 300 to 
1,000 people in the interior.  Mujica confirmed the 
opposition\'s money woes, but suggested that Chavez\'s flood of 
spending could backfire on the President. End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Coordinadora Democratica advisor Jorge Casado told 
A/DCM that the Coordinadora\'s leadership is worried about how 
well President Hugo Chavez\'s campaign is doing.  Casado said 
he had just come from a meeting with Coordinadora chief 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza in which they 
discussed recent poll results.  They show: 
--a 12% increase among Chavez sympathizers in willingness to 
participate in the August 15 vote (attributed to a response 
to Chavez\'s call to participate in the electoral battle); 
--a 4% increase in Chavez\'s core supporters, apparently in 
direct correlation to a decrease in the undecided \"Ni-Nis\"; 
and 
--a 5% lead by those who are going to participate in the 
referendum \"to give the government a chance (32%) over those 
who are doing so to get rid of Chavez (27.4%). 
 
3.  (C) Casado noted it is not just the polls that give the 
sense that Chavez is rising.  He said the ubiquitous red 
T-shirts worn by Chavez supporters catch the eye as the 
campaign workers work neighborhoods, and the red-and-white 
posters with the single word \"NO\" are pervasive in contrast 
to the lack of \"SI\" posters.  Casado asserted that the 
Government was paying for strategic, highly visible places to 
hang posters where the spot was not necessarily controlled by 
a Chavez sympathizer.  Casado said they had also learned that 
Chavez supporters were paying up to one million Bolivares 
($520) to bus operators to keep units idle rather than rent 
them to the opposition.  Meeting with Charge and A/DCM July 
20, Movement to Socialism (MAS) President and Coordinadora 
negotiator Felipe Mujica was not so convinced of the 
advantage that the polls appeared to give Chavez.  Mujica 
said he believes that the poll results are skewed because 
respondents believe the information they give will go to the 
government, and cited as examples the polls in Chile and 
Nicaragua giving the governments there the advantage prior to 
key electoral contests. 
 
4.  (C) The prime effect of Chavez\'s apparent winning tactics 
on the opposition, according to Casado, is that businessmen 
are reluctant to donate money and those that do donate, do so 
in lesser amounts.  Casado speculated that the businessmen, 
unconvinced that there will be a change, do not want to be 
identified with the opposition should the referendum fail to 
oust Chavez.  He noted, too, that Chavez has attempted to 
co-opt some business by bringing them into public appearances 
with him. 
 
5.  (C) The lack of financial support has the Coordinadora 
worried, Casado said.  The trend they see is Chavez on the 
upswing using all the resources of the state available to 
him, with the Coordinadora flat or on a decline for lack of 
resources. With four weeks to go before the vote, he said, 
more funding is essential to heat up the Coordinadora\'s 
campaign.  Already, Casado said, some events are suffering 
 
such as a rally that he is coordinating in Barinas State, the 
heart of Chavez country, this weekend.  They have had to 
scale it back by half because of lack of money. 
 
6.  (C) A/DCM asked Casado what toll the lack of funding was 
taking on the individual campaign work of the political 
parties and NGOs that makeup the Coordinadora.  Casado said 
COPEI, Accion Democratica, MAS, Proyecto Venezuela were all 
working diligently.  He said Sumate had fallen behind by some 
four days because of problems preparing their contact 
information. 
 
7.  (C) Mujica confirmed that donors, for a variety of 
reasons, have been reluctant to come forward with financial 
support.  Acknowledging that Chavez is outspending the 
opposition and can continue to do so, Mujica suggested that 
the flood of spending could eventually backfire on the 
President.  He also asserted that the government\'s 
triumphalism could work against it--both because it can turn 
people off and because it can lead to political mistakes that 
can be to the opposition\'s advantage.  Mujica noted that 
people do sense a void in the opposition\'s efforts because of 
inactivity in Caracas.  Opposition leaders have their agendas 
full, however, outside the capital, he said.  In his own 
case, he had addressed groups ranging in size from 300 to 
1,000 people nearly every during the past week.  He predicted 
that both sides\' campaigns \"would get red hot\" the after 
August 8. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The contrast between Chavez\'s campaign and the 
opposition\'s is indeed striking.  The President dominates the 
airwaves, using the mandated link-up of all radio and 
television stations in the country (cadenas) almost daily, 
and advertisements highlighting his government\'s programs, at 
times indistinguishable from advertisements sponsored by his 
campaign, appear in practically every newspaper.  Meanwhile, 
a Coordinadora representatives appears on one of the 
country\'s most highly rated television news-talk shows to 
inform Chavez opponents about how they can enter a webpage to 
find material they can individually print at their own 
expense and distribute.  An influx of funds to counter the 
Chavez campaign trove seems unlikely.  The test for the 
opposition will be how well they can do on the proverbial 
shoe string and how much strength the \"people power\" they 
have enjoyed to date can be sustained.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) successfully 
conducted a voting simulation on July 18 to prepare for the 
August 15 presidential recall referendum.  SBC, the 
consortium operating the new voting system, reported a 99.2 
percent success rate with the 5,200 machines distributed 
throughout Venezuela.  The voting simulation created live 
contingency planning session for SBC and served as a public 
information campaign for the new voting machines.  CNE, GoV, 
and opposition leaders were satisfied with the results.  The 
fingerprinting machines, however, have not been delivered and 
could become a technical and political issue on August 15. 
End summary. 
 
-------------- 
Voting Centers 
-------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff observed six voting centers throughout Caracas 
on July 18 with Gustavo Ruiz, Coordinadora Democratica (CD) 
representative to the National Electoral Council (CNE).  All 
sites were open to the public on July 18 to encourage voters 
to become acquainted with the new machines and ask questions 
about the voting process.  Poloff observed low participation 
in five of the six sites, however, CNE and political party 
officials did not consider voter turnout to be a major issue. 
 Many of the sites did not have the requisite five election 
workers.  Many centers poloff visited had only one or two 
voting center leaders, and some had none. 
 
3. (C) Smartmatic or CANTV (part of the SBC consortium) 
representatives were present at half of the sites poloff 
visited during the voting simulation.  These representatives 
set up the voting machine and assisted with technical 
difficulties.  From an operational and technical perspective, 
all sites appeared to be working well.  On August 15, there 
will be an SBC representative at every voting center to 
assist with technical and/or operational problems. 
 
-------------- 
Voting Process 
-------------- 
 
4. (C) One election worker explained to poloff the voting 
process for the August 15 presidential recall referendum from 
a CNE-provided guide.  At the center\'s entrance, voting 
center members will have the Electoral Registry (REP) list of 
eligible voters for that particular center.  If the person is 
not on the list, they cannot enter the center.  Once 
registration is confirmed, the voter\'s fingerprints are taken 
to assure that they have not voted at another center.  After 
the voter\'s registration and fingerprints are confirmed, they 
proceed to a table to present their cedula and dip their 
pinky in an ink jar and then move to the voting booth.  After 
the vote is registered, the machine prints out a small piece 
of paper, to be folded by the person and placed in a box as 
the voter leaves.  Regarding security, poloff observed two to 
five National Guard troops at every center. 
 
5. (C) In the voting simulation organizers guided voters 
through the entire process, explained how the new voting 
machines worked, and allowed the voters to use them.  Poloff 
observed no problems with the operation of the voting 
machines.  Voters appeared to have sufficient time, the 
machine was easy to operate, and printed verification slip 
worked well.  The simulation question, \"Which of the 
following baseball teams do you prefer?\" offered two options, 
Caracas (on the left, \"No\" side) and Magallanes (on the 
right, \"Yes\" side).  This question was not without 
controversy.  Caracas is considered the Venezuelan version of 
the New York Yankees and the team of the upper-class, 
opposition-aligned voters, while the Magallanes are the 
Boston Red Sox of the Venezuelan baseball world (and Chavez\' 
 
team). 
 
6. (C) On July 19, CNE directors reiterated their decision to 
not release the simulation results to avoid political spin. 
Pro-government newspaper Diario Vea, however, printed a 
front-page story on July 20 claiming that 400,000 people 
voted in the simulation and that the Magallanes received 60 
percent of the vote compared to 40 percent by Caracas. 
Diario Vea claimed that the Magallanes vote was associated 
with the \"No\" vote and it was one more time that the 
opposition had been dealt a blow.  The Diario Vea report is 
unsubstantiated and inaccurate because the \"Caracas\" option 
was in the same spot as the \"No\" and the \"Magallanes\" vote 
was in the \"Si\" spot. 
 
--------------------------- 
Public Information Campaign 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Beyond reviewing technical issues, the voting 
simulation served as a public information campaign to allow 
voters to ask questions about the voting process, use the 
machines, and dispel rumors about the process.  The CNE 
provided each center with a guide about the machines and the 
voting process.  Representatives, either from the voting 
center or the SBC consortium, explained the process to voters 
who visited the sites.  Voters were able to use the machines 
and familiarize themselves with the actual process.  Voters 
also asked questions to the SBC and voting center 
representatives.  Voters repeatedly asked about the secrecy 
of the vote, which prompted CNE President Francisco 
Carresquero to tell reporters, \"There is no way to know how a 
citizen voted.  The vote is absolutely secret.\" 
 
8. (C)  GoV and opposition media and leaders expressed their 
approval of the voting simulation.  In addition, both sides 
have begun public information campaigns for the August 15 
vote.  GoV-supported newspaper Diario Vea printed an article 
on July 19 explaining the voting process.  Venezolano de 
Television, the state television channel, is running CNE 
commercials that explain how to use the machine and reaffirm 
the secrecy and reliability of the voting machines.  Felipe 
Mujica, Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) President and 
Coordinadora Democratica representative to the CNE, asserted 
that the simulation will dispel rumors about the technical 
aspects of the referendum.  The Coordinadora delivered a 
detailed report to the CNE July 20 with its evaluation of the 
simulation, highlighting areas for improvement. 
 
----------------- 
Possible Problems 
----------------- 
 
9. (C) Possible problems still remain for the technical and 
operational aspects of August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  SBC reported that 99.2 percent of the voting 
machines functioned without problem.  Of the 47 faulty 
machines, SBC asserted that most problems were due to the 
operator, not the machine.  The voting simulation, however, 
did not include the use of the fingerprinting machines. 
Mujica told Charge July 20 that it appeared unlikely that the 
CNE could implement the untested fingerprint system. 
Opposition leaders expressed some minor concerns about the 
technical difficulties of the July 18 simulation, but their 
principal concern are the delays caused by the fingerprinting 
machines.  Also, the Electoral Registry (REP) lists were not 
yet available to the voting centers. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The July 18 voting simulation served its principal 
purpose: it helped identify faults and failures and helped 
many become familiar with the system.  All have initially 
expressed satisfaction with the results.  Nonetheless, 
questions remain.  The addition of the fingerprinting 
machines and the update of the REP lists could create lengthy 
delays on August 15.  The real purpose of the fingerprint 
 
machines may be to insinuate that the government will be able 
to know how the people voted.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) If the August 15 presidential recall referendum 
passes, opposition leaders propose a primary election, to 
select a unified opposition candidate for the follow-on 
presidential election.  Beyond the apparent front-runner, 
Miranda State governor Enrique Mendoza, other opposition 
leaders inside and outside the Coordinadora Democratica (CD) 
have indicated that they will run in the primary.  The 
biggest challenge for the opposition will be maintaining 
unity before, during, and after the primary.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Si \"Si,\" Opposition Primary Quickly Follows 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) If President Hugo Chavez loses the presidential recall 
referendum August 15, a follow-on presidential election must 
occur within thirty days according to the Constitution. 
Opposition leaders have proposed an open primary shortly 
after the August 15 referendum to elect a candidate to 
compete against Chavez in the presidential election.  (Note: 
Opposition leaders presume that Chavez will be able to run in 
the election although no official decision has been made by 
the Supreme Court.)  Fernando Martinez Mottola, consultant to 
the Coordinadora Democratica and leader of the group drafting 
the opposition\'s Governance Accord, told poloff on July 15 
that the Accord will define the process for the primary.  The 
Accord, released on July 25, is designed to provide a set of 
guiding principles for a transition government, but will also 
set guidelines for an opposition primary.  The Accord states 
that the unified candidate will be \"selected through a 
primary election and the candidate will promise not to seek 
immediate re-election in 2006.\"  The guiding political, 
economic, and social principles are more broad than Plan 
Consenso Pais (reftel), but it shares the same short-term, 
transition period time horizon. 
 
----------- 
Open to All 
----------- 
 
3. (C) Martinez asserted that the primary would be open to 
all Venezuelans.  Americo Martin, a CD leader and possible 
transition president candidate, told poloff on July 8 that he 
supported an open primary.  Martin discounted the possibility 
of Chavez supporters skewing an open primary by 
participating.  Alejandro Armas told poloff on July 16 that 
he supports a closed primary election where only people who 
signed the firmazo can vote.  Pompeyo Marquez_, a Coordinadora 
spokesman, told poloff on July 21 that he supports a primary 
restricted to the firmazo list as well.  He asserted that the 
unified candidate of the opposition should be selected by 
opposition supporters.  Alfredo Larrazabal, a Sumate leader 
and member of the \"Group for a Unified Candidate\" committee, 
told poloff on July 15 that the Group would recommend an open 
primary to promote a democratic, inclusive process to choose 
an opposition unified candidate. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
August 29 - Calm After the August 15 Storm 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Many opposition leaders, including Martinez, have said 
the primary would be held on August 22, one week after the 
referendum.  However, Martinez told poloff on July 15 that 
the Accord would recommend an August 29 primary.  The days 
immediately after August 15 will be chaotic, Martinez 
predicted, and will not allow the opposition to begin the 
primary election process until at least mid-week.  He said 
the opposition will need two weeks to process the referendum 
 
 
results and then proceed with the coordination of primary 
logistics and campaigning.  Larrazabal reaffirmed that the 
\"Group for a Unified Candidate\" would recommend August 29 as 
the date of the primary election. He said the Group is 
recommending a three-day candidate enrollment period and a 
nine-day campaign period between the August 15 referendum and 
the proposed August 29 primary. 
 
------------------- 
Meet the Candidates 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) Eight leading candidates have emerged for the 
opposition to date: Enrique Mendoza, Henrique Salas Romer, 
Americo Martin, Pompeyo Marquez_, Gerver Torres, Enrique 
Tejera Paris, Cecilia Sosa, and Antonio Ledezma.  Other names 
have been mentioned, but various factors make their candidacy 
unlikely.  Julio Borges, the Primero Justicia National 
Coordinator, is considered to be too young and prefers to 
wait for a later opportunity.  Alejandro Armas, a Solidaridad 
National Assembly Deputy, is in very poor health.  Manuel 
Cova, President of the National Workers\' Confederation (CTV), 
has publicly stated that he will not be a candidate in the 
primary (and he has been a lackluster public figure).  Of the 
eight candidates, Enrique Mendoza is the apparent 
front-runner, but 1998 presidential candidate and Carabobo 
state Governor Henrique Salas Romer is presenting himself as 
a strong candidate.  The other six candidates appear to be 
unlikely to win a primary if Mendoza and Salas run, but are 
presenting themselves as candidates to jockey for political 
positions in an opposition government and/or present a 
particular political agenda. 
 
------------- 
Front-runners 
------------- 
 
6. (C) Enrique Mendoza is the front-runner in a number of 
opposition polls.  The June 2004 Greenberg poll showed 
Mendoza as the clear winner in a opposition primary.  While 
Mendoza is considered an important leader of the opposition 
and the Coordinadora Democratica, his support among 
non-aligned and moderate Chavista voters is weak.  Armas 
believes Mendoza has legitimacy within the opposition ranks 
and should be able to win a primary.  However, Mendoza might 
wait for the 2006 presidential election due to the Governance 
Accord\'s clause that commits an opposition transition 
president to not seek re-election in 2006. 
 
7. (C) Henrique Salas Romer lost the 1998 presidential 
election to Hugo Chavez and has become an alienated voice 
within the opposition, particularly within the Coordinadora 
Democratica.  Salas, who is Governor of Carabobo state and 
patriarch of Proyecto Venezuela, is rallying support within 
Carabobo by campaigning for the proposed primary in 
conjunction with referendum campaigning.  Like Mendoza, Salas 
could win an opposition primary, but would face difficulty 
garnering support from non-aligned and moderate Chavista 
voters.  Larrazabal, the Sumate leader in charge of the 
primary, said Salas has given initial indications that he 
would support a primary.  A considerable fear within the 
opposition is that Salas would reject the primary and present 
himself as a candidate for the presidential election 
regardless of the primary\'s outcome.  Thus, Salas and the 
unified opposition candidate chosen in the primary would 
compete against Chavez, which would virtually guarantee a 
Chavez victory.  Like Mendoza, Salas has longer-term 
presidential aspirations.  Due to political maneuvering and 
the re-election clause in the Governance Accord, Salas could 
decide to wait until 2006 to run for president. 
 
----------- 
Dark Horses 
----------- 
 
8. (C) Americo Martin, a Coordinadora leader and former 
leftist revolutionary, told poloff on July 8 that he is 
preparing to present himself as a candidate for the primary. 
 
 
Martin said he seeks to gain support from Accion Democratica 
(AD) and Salas\' Proyecto Venezuela (PV).  Martin asserted 
that he can attract voters from the non-aligned and moderate 
Chavista camps, while securing the traditional opposition 
votes.  He sharply criticized Mendoza\'s campaign, asserting 
that Mendoza cannot attract voters outside traditional 
opposition parties.  While Martin could theoretically attract 
more left-oriented votes, his limited support within the 
opposition and nationally are inhibiting factors for his 
candidacy. 
 
9. (C) Pompeyo Marquez_, a Coordinadora spokesman, has not 
presented himself as a candidate, but his name is often 
mentioned.  Marquez_, an octogenarian and former leftist 
rebel, could use his less traditional opposition roots to 
solicit support from non-aligned and Chavista voters.  In 
addition, Marquez_ has broad support within the opposition. 
Group of Professionals for Yes, an organization that seeks to 
gain the support of 700,000 Venezuelan professionals, named 
Marquez_ its honorary director.  While Marquez_ may enjoy the 
support of many potential voting blocks, he is not a strong 
candidate.  Marquez_ emphatically told poloff on July 21 that 
he will not present himself as a candidate for the primary. 
 
---------- 
Long Shots 
---------- 
 
10. (C) Gerver Torres is the leader of A Dream for Venezuela, 
an NGO that promotes reconciliation and reunification through 
a long-term vision for Venezuela.  Torres told poloff July 13 
that he would present himself as a candidate, but he viewed 
his candidacy as mechanism to present his NGO\'s vision for 
Venezuela.  Torres, until recently affiliated with Harvard 
University and a former official in the Carlos Andres Perez 
government, is not part of the Coordinadora.  Enrique Tejera 
Paris, another octogenarian and career technocrat, has 
offered his candidacy, but has received little media coverage 
or opposition support.  Cecilia Sosa, former President of the 
Supreme Court, told poloffs on June 25 that she would present 
herself as a candidate if \"the people asked her to run.\" 
Antonio Ledezma, President of Alianza Bravo Pueblo, has been 
shunned by the Coordinadora and would present his candidacy 
as a means to advance his political career.  Tejera, Sosa, 
and Ledezma have been active to varying degrees in the 
Coordinadora. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) Two distinct opposition strategies exist for the 
primary and the unified candidate.  The opposition could 
shoot for their core constituency, particularly people who 
have signed the firmazo and are from traditional opposition 
parties.  However, the Coordinadora could launch a campaign 
to attract votes from non-aligned and moderate Chavista 
groups.  The above candidates represent both strategies.  If 
the opposition is focusing on its core constituency, Mendoza 
and Salas are the leading candidates.  If the opposition 
seeks to attract new votes, Marquez_ or Martin would be more 
inclusive candidates.  If there is a primary, that vote will 
decide the candidate.  If all candidates discussed present 
themselves, then a Mendoza or Salas victory is a likely bet. 
It is possible, however, that Mendoza and/or Salas will 
choose not to participate and recommend one of the other 
candidates.  Considering that this is a transition 
presidency, political jockeying and \"saving oneself\" for a 
future election are distinct possibilities.  In addition, the 
recently-released Governance Accord calls for the 
opposition\'s unified candidate to commit to not seek 
re-election if elected to the transition presidency. 
 
12. (C) The first priority of the opposition, reflected in 
its strategy and campaigning, is the August 15 presidential 
recall referendum.  However, opposition leaders and Sumate 
are working to create the framework for an opposition primary 
on August 29.  An open primary two weeks after the referendum 
 
 
will limit campaigning to the benefit of better known 
candidates such as Mendoza and Salas.  While uncertainty will 
envelope the process until the actual primary, the opposition 
is working to develop a strategy that will select a candidate 
in an open manner and maintain unity.

Classified By: ACTING DCM ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  Since its formation, President Hugo Chavez\'s 
anti-recall referendum campaign committee, Comando Maisanta, 
has balanced its activities between concentrated lobbying and 
widespread propaganda dissemination.  Comando Maisanta has 
pushed for redistributing voting centers and purifying the 
electoral registry in their meetings with the National 
Electoral Council (CNE).  Finalizing the formation of citizen 
electoral patrols has most recently been a central component 
of the campaign, with President Chavez traveling around 
Venezuela to induct the members personally.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
REDISTRIBUTION AND PURIFICATION 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  President Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta, the campaign 
committee established to win the recall referendum, has 
continuously called for the redistribution of and an increase 
in the number of voting centers around Venezuela.  On June 
22, Maripili Hernandez, national director of events and image 
for Comando Maisanta, publicly asserted that there is a 
profound disequilibrium in the distribution of voting centers 
that negatively affects the poorer, more populous areas. 
Despite a July 13 decision by the CNE to not add 1000 
additional voting centers in poorer neighborhoods, the issue 
continues to resurface.  During their July 16 meeting with 
members of the CNE, Minister of Information and Communication 
Jesse Chacon and Samuel Moncada, a member of the Comando 
Maisanta brain-trust, once again called for an increase in 
the number of voting centers. 
 
3.  (U)  In his July 16 meeting with the CNE, Moncada also 
questioned the purity, transparency and trustworthiness of 
the national electoral registry.  He claimed that although 
the CNE removed 160,000 deceased persons from the registry, a 
significant, but unnamed, quantity of the dead still needed 
to be removed.  Moncada also contended that more than 5,000 
Venezuelans living abroad had effectively renounced their 
citizenship and should also be removed from the registry. 
 
----------------- 
ELECTORAL PATROLS 
----------------- 
 
4.  (U)  To reach into the communities, Comando Maisanta has 
established electoral patrols.  These groups of ten 
individuals are a central component of the President\'s 
anti-recall campaign.  President Chavez has conducted rallies 
in major metropolitan areas across Venezuela to induct 
members personally.  Patrol members are responsible for 
mobilizing voters for the August 15 referendum and organizing 
local-level events in support of Chavez.  Comando Maisanta 
hopes to establish 130,000 patrols with a total 1.3 million 
members; the ideal number, they say, needed to manage 13 
million voters.  On July 14, Fifth Republican Movement (MVR) 
deputy and national director of organization for Comando 
Maisanta, William Lara claimed that only 100,000 patrols had 
been established.  He further admitted that all of the 
existing patrols were not completely efficient and that 
Comando Maisanta would be conducting an audit of the patrols 
to evaluate their performance. 
 
---------------------------- 
PROPAGANDA AND SMEAR TACTICS 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Comando Maisanta\'s campaign strategy is focused on 
maintaining a steady flow of electoral propaganda.  Members 
of the patrols hand out leaflets that claim Venezuelan 
sovereignty is under attack by the United States and also 
tout the successes of Chavez\'s presidency, focusing 
specifically on PDVSA, the social missions and improvements 
to the health system.  Additionally, Chavez supporters have 
 
hung large \"Vote No\" signs every 15 feet in the median of the 
central highway in Caracas.  The blanket coverage of \"Vote 
No\" signs took place the day after the National Guard 
prevented pro-opposition activists from placing their 
propaganda in the very same locations. 
 
6.  (U)  The Comando Maisanta has also used unfounded 
allegations to discredit and defame the opposition.  During a 
July 4 public address on Margarita Island, William Lara 
accused the opposition of formulating a plot to sabotage the 
voting machines that will be used for the August 15 
referendum.  In the July 11 episode of \"Alo Presidente\", 
President Chavez asserted that the National Endowment for 
Democracy funded the Coordinadora Democratica\'s \"Plan 
Consenso Pais\" (National Consensus Plan).  On July 13, Samuel 
Moncada publicly stated that the font and color scheme used 
by the opposition for its \"Si\" propaganda are identical to 
the format used by the United Self-Defense Forces (AUC) in 
Colombia, and therefore was evidence of links between the two 
groups. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.   (C)  As the date of the referendum approaches, the 
campaign is picking up momentum and will continue to 
intensify.  Members of Comando Maisanta have latched on to a 
number of key issues, which they believe will help determine 
the outcome.  The issue of \"insufficient\" numbers of voting 
centers in poorer neighborhoods, in concert with 
complications that may arise from the voting and fingerprint 
machines, potentially provides Chavez and Comando Maisanta 
with ammunition should they choose to contest the results of 
the referendum if the results are in favor of the opposition. 
 For now, the issue has been sidelined as the National 
Electoral Council contemplates the addition of voting 
machines at established centers instead of opening new ones. 
That said, however, it does not mean that the Comando 
Maisanta has abandoned it.  A for the electoral patrols, 
where they operate, they appear to be effective.  The test 
for Comando Maisanta will be how many they eventually 
constitute and the breadth of their coverage across the 
nation.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s Asambleas de Ciudadanos (Citizen 
Assemblies), as outlined in Article 70 of the 1999 
Constitution, are a means through which civil society can 
organize itself to address political concerns and attempt to 
establish government accountability.  The opposition\'s answer 
to President Chavez\'s grassroots organizing, the Asambleas 
have become a functional component of the Coordinadora 
Democratica\'s (CD) campaign to recall President Chavez in the 
August 15 referendum.  The Red de Asambleas (Network of 
Assemblies), the central leadership structure for the 
Asambleas de Ciudadanos, is currently working to marshal 
opposition support for the recall referendum.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
FORM AND FUNCTION 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Article 70 of Venezuela\'s 1999 Constitution provides 
the legal foundation for the creation of Asambleas de 
Ciudadanos (Citizen Assemblies).  Maxim Ross, editorialist 
for \"El Universal\" and key founding organizer for the 
Asambleas told poloff July 16 that the Asambleas de 
Ciudadanos were designed to serve as an instrument through 
which civil society could attempt to establish government 
accountability.  Asambleas exist predominantly in the major 
metropolitan areas throughout Venezuela.  There are 
approximately 130 to 150 Asambleas in Caracas.  While there 
are no prerequisite conditions to start an Asamblea de 
Ciudadanos, each Asamblea produces a charter to formalize its 
existence.  An elected coordinator and alternate coordinator 
head each Asamblea.  The general agenda for an Asamblea 
meeting is one hour of comments by guest speakers followed by 
one to two hours of open floor dialogue. 
 
3.  (C)  Thus far, opponents of President Hugo Chavez have 
been the only sector of the population to invoke the 
constitutional right to organize Asambleas de Ciudadanos. 
Irene Romanchuck, the Red de Asambleas representatives to the 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD), told poloff July 22 that the 
Asambleas are the opposition\'s counterpart to Chavez\'s 
Circulos Bolivarianos and grassroots organizing.  While 
Asambleas are political entities, they are not dominated by 
any one political party.  The Asambleas organized 
mobilization campaigns for the opposition signature drive and 
the appeals process, and are currently working to marshal 
electoral participation for the August 15 recall referendum. 
 
---------------- 
RED DE ASAMBLEAS 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The Red de Asambleas (Network of Assemblies) is the 
central leadership structure for the Asambleas, and is 
comprised of the coordinators from each of the Asambleas. 
The Red meets weekly and collectively works to set the 
thematic agenda of the individual Asamblea meetings.  The Red 
serves as an intermediary between civil society and the CD 
and the government.  The Red has one official representative 
in the leadership structure of the CD.  Maxim Ross told 
poloff that the Red also has lobbied members of the National 
Assembly on behalf of civil society to protest the new 
organic law governing Venezuela\'s Supreme Court. 
 
-------------------- 
ASAMBLEAS AND THE CD 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  The relationship between the CD and the Asambleas de 
Ciudadanos is strong but unbalanced.  Irene Romanchuck told 
poloff that the Coordinadora Democratica continuously uses 
the Asambleas as an audience for opposition leaders and a 
forum to disseminate information and propaganda, but does not 
permit the Asambleas representation to have a voice in 
 
opposition\'s campaign agenda.  Romanchuck also commented that 
the Asambleas are committed to opposition\'s campaign to 
recall President Chavez, but tensions exist between the Red 
de Asambleas and the leadership of the CD. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  The Asambleas are valuable to the CD as a means to 
publicize and generate grassroots support for its campaign to 
recall Chavez.  While the Asambleas tend to only attract 
those individuals who were already faithful to the 
opposition\'s agenda, they are still provide a legion of 
willing volunteers who will take the campaign to the streets 
to rally participation for the recall effort.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  With little more than two weeks to go before the 
scheduled Presidential recall referendum, Venezuela\'s 
National Electoral Council (CNE) refused July 29 to consider 
requests to changes in voting locations which the opposition 
claims were done fraudulently.  The more than one million 
changes, according to Accion Democratica\'s Henry Ramos Allup, 
affected persons who the government had identified as signers 
of the petition to recall the President.  Sumate, however, 
believes the changes will not/not have a major effect. 
Separately, the OAS observer mission began operations after 
signing its agreement with the CNE.  Despite the agreement, 
mission members do not expect things to go smoothly as they 
approach the referendum.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
Where to Vote? 
-------------- 
 
2.  (U) CNE director Jorge Rodriguez announced July 29 that 
the CNE would not consider requests to correct changes of 
voting location submitted after midnight July 26.  Accion 
Democratica Deputy and Secretary General Henry Ramos Allup 
told reporters July 26 that the CNE had fraudulently changed 
the location where more than one million persons (1.16 
million) are to vote.  In response to the allegations, 
Rodriguez said CNE offices around the country would be open 
until midnight to address the problem. 
 
3.  (U) Ramos said the number is nearly four times the number 
of voluntary changes they would normally expect over a 
six-month period.  Ramos highlighted the case with the names 
of some municipal officials who have not moved, are in 
office, and whose voting location has been changed to distant 
points.  Media reports publicized numerous cases of 
Venezuelans who have been finding the changes as they check 
their registration via Internet and an 800 number.  (The 
divergent information from these two sources has led to 
opposition charges that the CNE is working with duplicate 
electoral registries.)  Some examples were changes within a 
city, but others were more egregious, such as a person who 
had been moved from one end of the country to another (Zulia 
to Amazonas). 
 
4.  (C) CNE President Francisco Carrasquero called the 
changes routine, the result of citizens\' changes of address. 
He cited himself as an example, noting that he had always 
voted in Zulia and now the electoral registry shows him 
voting in Caracas.  Aragua State Governor Didalco Bolivar 
told Charge July 27 that the government\'s switch some one 
million voters\' voting place will be seen for what it is (an 
attempt to reduce opposition votes). 
 
5.  (C) Opposition representatives told reporters they would 
bring the matter to the attention of the international 
observers.  Edgardo Rheis, the number two under Brazilian 
Ambassador to the OAS Valter Pecly in the observers mission, 
told A/DCM that he knew of the allegations, but the 
opposition had not approached the OAS yet.  He noted that the 
electoral registry had not been finalized and that such 
changes are not unusual.  He said the number of changes 
alleged, however, and the distances cited as examples smacked 
of something wrong. 
 
6.  (C) Sumate\'s Luis Enrique Palacios said the NGO is 
conducting a study to see how many people have been moved 
against their will.  Palacios said that the Governance Accord 
event for August 1 is designed to inform people about the 
Accord, but more importantly to get people to figure out 
where they are registered to vote.  Sumate also plans a poll 
for July 31-August 1, where volunteers will visit over 1,000 
people around the country to ask them about the change of 
voting centers.  The Sumate hypothesis is that the change in 
voting locations will not have a major effect on the 
referendum. 
 
 
---------------- 
Why the Changes? 
---------------- 
 
7.  Fernando Bazua, National Democratic Institute consultant 
working with the Coordinadora, told A/DCM July 27 that 
Coordinadora leaders believe the changes are part of 
President Chavez\'s strategy to bring down the number of 
guaranteed yes votes for the recall.  (Ramos alleged that the 
people who had been changed had been identified as signers of 
the petition calling for a presidential recall referendum.) 
Bazua noted that, although the number of the fraudulent 
changes may not total the AD number, even half the alleged 
1.1 million would be significant.  He also  pointed out that 
while the opposition appears to have discovered the 
phenomenon early, the possibility of confusion on August 15 
will favor Chavez.  Former Supreme Electoral Council 
President also did not discount that Chavez supporters had 
resorted to the maneuver.  He told A/DCM July 29 that Accion 
Democratica itself had manipulated the electoral registry to 
redistribute its known supporters during gubernatorial 
elections, albeit unsuccessfully. 
8.  (C) Bazua acknowledged that, as the poll numbers showed, 
Chavez had done well in boosting his support, and the voter 
location changes would help bring the opposition numbers 
down.  That, however, would not be enough, he said, and 
asserted that another Chavez fraud effort involves the growth 
of the electoral registry.  Bazua asserted that contrary to 
what some Chavez opponents espouse, all the new voters cannot 
be Chavez supporters.  The trick, he said, is that a portion 
of the new voters are only names.  Using different identity 
cards issued by the government, one person could assume 
various identities and vote multiple times, Bazua asserted. 
He said that is why the CNE is insisting on using the untried 
fingerprint comparison machines to spot possible multiple 
voting instead of indelible ink. 
 
9.  (C) Aurelio Concheso, President of the libertarian think 
tank Center for the Dissemination of Economic Information 
(CEDICE), told PolOff July 29 that the President\'s polling 
people had told Chavez July 22 that he would lose the August 
15 referendum, probably by 10 percentage points.  According 
to Concheso, Chavez responded by criticizing Vice president 
Jose Vicente Rangel, who had recently mounted a campaign to 
delay and obstruct the referendum (i.e. CNE announcement of 
voting center changes, international observer obstruction). 
 
10.  (C) Gov. Bolivar told Charge July 27 that although he is 
confident Chavez can win, it\'s not in the bag.  Bolivar said 
he looks not only at polls that measure intent to vote in the 
referendum, but also polls that look at the regional 
elections.  He says the latter has bad news for Chavez: 
Voters in a number of Chavista states -- primarily those led 
by the most radical Chavistas -- show flagging support.  This 
includes Tachira, Merida, Portuguesa, Cojedes, as well as 
opposition states of Zulia, Miranda, Carabobo, and 
Anzoategui.  Chavez has a clear message, according to 
Bolivar, but it is not enough.  The various \"misiones\" are 
important, but at most they reach 1.2 million out of some 13 
million voters.  And, some 385,000 of these persons actually 
signed the referendum, and only 50,000 recanted in the 
reparos, which means that voters will take the money, but not 
necessarily give their allegiance.  Chavez has a problem 
reaching younger voters, and his choice of campaign image -- 
the battle of Santa Ines -- will not convince younger voters. 
 
 
--------- 
OBSERVERS 
--------- 
 
11.  (C) OAS observer mission leader Rheis told A/DCM July 28 
that they do not expect things to go smoothly with the 
National Electoral Council (CNE).  Rheis said the agreement 
the OAS signed with the CNE provides the conditions they need 
to do their job.  The CNE, he said, will of course try to 
rein the international observers, and the observers will push 
the envelope to get their work done.  Rheis said they would 
abide by certain CNE conditions, such as the limitation on 
 
 
the number of observers (50-51), providing the CNE biographic 
data, having one person participate in CNE director Oscar 
Battaglini\'s program for observers. 
 
12.  (C) They will not, however, abide by Battaglini\'s date 
of August 9 to begin their work.  Rheis said personnel will 
come in before that, and if questioned, the mission would 
refer to them as \"advance workers\" rather than observers. 
(Rheis said President Chavez had told him and Pecly the week 
before that he understood their need to have people in 
earlier.)  Rheis also noted that the agreement says the OAS 
accepts that the CNE reserves the right to make public the 
content of the Mission\'s reports and (the OAS) will abstain 
from making public its final report.  Rheis said there is no 
problem with that since there is no \"Final Report\" per se, 
only a report to the Secretary General, and they will issue 
statements not reports. 
 
13.  (C) As for the Mission\'s composition, Rheis said it 
would include two people each from Japan, U.K. and Spain plus 
three from Canada.  Unlike the delegation for the May appeals 
process, the OAS will not include government officials on 
this occasion.  Asked whether this applied to officials from 
the legislative as well as the executive branch Rheis said 
unfortunately, yes. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.  (C)  President Chavez and his supporters have been 
confident that they have the winning numbers.  They are not, 
however, leaving things to chance Chavez has been down the 
road where they have underestimated opposition strength twice 
this year, and they appear to be unwilling to leave anything 
to chance.  The CNE\'s refusal to address the concerns about 
the changes in voter locations, regardless that the real 
dimensions of the issue may are not clear, is a set-back for 
the opposition, but can serve as one more negative they can 
attribute to the President.   The CNE\'s attitude toward the 
international observers also gives us pause.  The OAS 
attitude, however, appears to be the right approach.  There 
is fortunately still a reluctance among Chavez and his 
supporters to shun international opinion completely, which 
gives the OAS and Carter Center some additional room to 
maneuver.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica is calling on Venezuelans 
to sign its National Accord for Social Justice and Democratic 
Peace August 1.  Coordinadora leaders publicly signed the 
document, which establishes a broad framework for an 
opposition-led transition government, should President Chavez 
be recalled, on July 25.  The concise document outlines 
principles of unity, reconstruction, reconciliation, and 
peace and recommends broad political, economic, and social 
reforms.  The Accord formally recommends a primary election 
to determine the unified opposition candidate in a follow-on 
presidential election, who would promise not to seek 
immediate re-election in 2006.  End summary. 
 
--------------- 
A United Accord 
--------------- 
 
2. (U) Coordinadora Democratica leaders from 60 political 
parties and civil society organizations signed the National 
Accord for Social Justice and Democratic Peace, also called 
the Governance Accord or Pact, on July 25.  The opposition 
leaders sat on the stage as actress Eva Gutierrez read the 
four-page document, which outlines broad themes and goals for 
an opposition-led transition government.  Unity is the 
overall theme, while reconstruction, reconciliation, and 
peace are core principles of the Accord.  The Coordinadora 
leaders then called upon all supporters to sign the Accord on 
August 1 at any of the 8,330 voting centers around the 
country.  Beyond signing the Accord, this opposition event 
will allow people to verify where they are to vote August 15. 
 (Note: This verification is a major opposition concern since 
it was learned that the National Electoral Council (CNE) had 
changed the location where more than one million voters are 
to go.) 
 
3. (U) The Accord, designed to \"establish the foundation to 
the solutions of the significant problems of Venezuela,\" 
outlines broad goals in five major areas: social issues, 
economic recovery, political and constitutional reforms, the 
judicial system, and international relations.  The Accord 
proposes immediate social programs to relieve hunger and 
unemployment, an improvement in health and education systems, 
and an emergency plan to protect citizens\' security.  The 
economic goals focus on the recovery of the petroleum sector, 
but avoid direct mention of privatization or foreign 
investment. 
 
4. (U) The Accord\'s proposed political reforms focus on 
constitutional reform, such as the reduction in presidential 
power, the focus on decentralization, and the reform of the 
military.  In addition, the proposed political reforms call 
for the re-establishment of a bicameral legislature and the 
creation of a run-off presidential election.  The judicial 
goals include a declaration of emergency on the judicial 
system, a referendum on the Supreme Court law, and a 
reassessment of the appointment process for judges.  The 
Accord also recommends a foreign policy strategy that 
advances the strategic interests of the country and respects 
international conventions.  The Accord and Plan Consenso 
cover many common themes (reftel).  However, the Accord makes 
broad recommendations and sets out guiding principles for an 
opposition-led transition government compared to the more 
specific, action-oriented Plan Consenso Pais. 
 
------------------------------- 
Opposition Primary Implications 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Accord states that the opposition will hold a 
primary election to choose a unified, opposition candidate 
for a follow-on presidential election.  It requires that the 
 
chosen candidate commit to not seek immediate re-election in 
2006.  Alfredo Larrazabal, Sumate leader in charge of the 
primaries, told poloff on July 28 that this re-election 
commitment is a \"moral obligation\" and that it will have 
little effect on who is a candidate for the opposition 
primary.  The Accord, however, does not specify whether the 
primary will be open or closed, nor when it will take place. 
(Note: An open primary would permit all registered voters to 
participate while a closed primary would only allow persons 
who signed to recall the President to participate.) 
Larrazabal said the group organizing the primary has 
maintained their recommendation of August 29 as the date of 
the referendum. 
 
--------------------- 
The Opposition Unites 
--------------------- 
 
6. (U) At the Accord\'s unveiling, opposition leaders joined 
and raised hands in a symbolic show of unity after the 
official release of the Accord.  Media reports portray a 
unified opposition, determined to address the issues and 
present a viable alternative to the Chavez administration. 
Henrique Salas Roemer, Carabobo State governor and possible 
primary candidate, said that this Accord unites the country 
and creates a legitimate process to choose an opposition 
unified candidate.  Julio Borges, President of Primero 
Justicia, said the Accord focuses the referendum campaign on 
the problems of Venezuela and provides solutions. 
 
7. (C) Aurelio Concheso, President of the libertarian think 
tank Center for the Dissemination of Economic Information 
(CEDICE), told poloff on June 29 that the Governance Accord 
is a tangible sign of the opposition\'s unity.  He asserted 
that the Accord is a political strategy that unites the 
opposition.  More important than the Mendoza-Borges-Salas 
embrace, Concheso believes that the unity demonstrated by 
leaders from Bandera Roja (a left-wing, former guerrilla 
party), Fedecamaras (Venezuela\'s umbrella business 
organization), and the CTV (the Venezuelan Workers\' 
Confederation) is essential to opposition success.  Concheso 
prognosticated that the left-leaning parties would be given 
socially-sensitive ministries (i.e. health and education), 
the center-based parties would control national security and 
international relations ministries (i.e. Defense, Foreign 
Relations), and the right-aligned parties would lead fiscal 
and monetary institutions (i.e. Finance Ministry). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The Governance Accord is a tangible demonstration of 
unity by a politically diverse opposition.  The broad scope 
of the Accord provides a framework and a set of principles to 
guide an opposition-led transition government.  The most 
controversial point in the Accord will be the statement that 
an opposition transition president must commit to not run for 
re-election in 2006.  This small clause, if honored, would 
influence the electoral primary landscape, most likely 
eliminating Henrique Salas Roemer (who wants to run also in 
2006) and further elevating Enrique Mendoza\'s candidacy.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Court cases against various opponents of President 
Hugo Chavez are at different stages in the judicial process. 
The case of Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles, though he has 
been in custody for more than two months, is in its initial 
stages, while the case of National Guard Gen. Carlos Alfonzo 
Martinez is at trial. This cable gives a basic overview of 
Venezuela\'s trial system, highlighted with the status of 
several political cases now before the courts. End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Adversarial System 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) The Venezuelan penal system changed radically in 1998 
when the Organic Penal Procedures Code (COPP) came into 
effect. It changed Venezuela\'s justice system from an 
accusatorial to an adversarial system. This required the 
creation of a new system of public prosecutors and changed 
the role of the judge as well. Under the COPP, the judge 
handles procedural issues and, alone or with the 
participation of lay judges, decides the case. Trials are 
public, and defendants are protected by the presumption of 
innocence and the right to be free while on trial, under most 
circumstances. 
 
----------- 
Prosecutors 
----------- 
 
3.  (C) In Venezuela\'s justice system prosecutors begin 
investigations primarily based on complaints submitted by 
citizens. For complaints submitted during regular hours, the 
prosecutor to handle the case is chosen by lot. Complaints 
entered after hours are taken by the duty prosecutor (The 
lottery system was implemented with the COPP to avoid venue 
shopping and is similarly used in the assignment of cases to 
control and trial judges.) According to Juan Martin 
Echeverria, defense lawyer in the Capriles and SUMATE cases, 
there is a group of seven prosecutors  given all the 
political cases in which the GoV had an interest, in 
violation of the case distribution system which is supposed 
to operate in the prosecutors office, as in the courts. They 
included Danilo Anderson, prosecutor in the Capriles case, 
Luisa Ortega, prosecutor in the SUMATE case, and Jose Benigno 
Rojas, responsible for the accusation of bribery in the 
Tachira 9 case. Martin argued that these prosecutors act 
under strict orders from Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez, 
and not with the independence required by the COPP to search 
for evidence of innocence as well as guilt, and make a good 
faith effort to uncover the truth. 
 
 
-------- 
Imputado 
-------- 
 
4.  (U) The first stage in a trial in Venezuela is the public 
prosecutor\'s investigation of the alleged crime. During the 
preliminary investigation of a crime, the prosecutor\'s office 
acts without judicial supervision. When the prosecutor 
decides to begin a formal investigation of criminal 
responsibility against an individual, that individual is 
advised that he or she is the subject of an investigation 
(imputado). At this time, the prosecutor may request that a 
judge order the suspect be detained if all three of the 
following conditions are met: 1) there is sufficient evidence 
that a serious crime has been committed; 2) there is 
sufficient evidence that the suspect may have committed the 
crime; 3) there is sufficient reason to believe the suspect 
may flee, or try to interfere with the investigation. The 
prosecutor in Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles\' case has 
successfully argued these points to keep him in custody since 
 
May 11. 
 
------------------- 
Pre-trial Detention 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The COPP states that pre-trial detention should be an 
exception, but one half of all Venezuelan prisoners have not 
yet been convicted of any crime. According to Caracas Appeals 
Court Judge Cesar Sanchez, there is resistance among many 
control judges to accept this aspect of the COPP (NOTE: 
Control judges oversee procedures in cases prior to the trial 
itself. End note.) Sanchez told PolOff April 26 that many 
control judges ignore the rules in the COPP, and their 
decisions must be contested in Appeals Court to be 
overturned. 
------------------- 
Assignment of Cases 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The COPP states that when the prosecutor\'s office 
brings a case forth, the selection of the control judge is by 
lot. If the prosecutor brings his case forth between 7 p.m. 
and 7 a.m., however, the case goes to the control judge on 
duty. Important political cases such as the case, against 
Baruta Mayor Capriles and the case of nine opposition leaders 
in Tachira state, being tried for civil rebellion for alleged 
deeds in April 2002, have been brought to the courts after 
regular hours, according to Appeals Court Judge Jesus 
Ollarves, whose court twice ruled the practice of after hours 
assignment was improper. (Note: The Supreme Court overruled 
Ollarves\' court on both occasions.) Ollarves told PolOff June 
21, that prosecutors have taken advantage of this system to 
make sure high profile political cases go to judges who are 
allies of the GOV. 
 
--------------- 
Long Detentions 
--------------- 
 
7.  (U) Once a prosecutor has opened an investigation against 
an individual he has 45 days, if the suspect is jailed, to 
decide whether to make a formal accusation before a judge (if 
the suspect is not jailed the period is ten months). Once the 
formal accusation is filed with the court, a trial judge is 
selected in the same manner as the control judge. If the 
suspect is under detention, the judge must have a hearing to 
determine if the detention should continue. This is the type 
of hearing that was scheduled for Capriles July 26, though it 
was canceled after an Appeals Court sent the case back to a 
new control judge. 
 
8.  (U) Suspects detained throughout their trial can be in 
jail for years due to the inefficiency of the judicial 
system. Hearings are frequently suspended because witnesses 
or lawyers do not come, and prisoners frequently miss 
hearings because the system of transportation for prisoners 
is inefficient and corrupt. National Guard Gen. Carlos 
Alfonzo Martinez was ordered from prison to house arrest July 
20 after being in custody since December, 2002. His trial 
began on July 19. The Tachira 9 have been in prison awaiting 
the beginning of their trial for civil rebellion for over a 
year. Their trial began July 26. 
 
------------- 
Public Trials 
------------- 
 
9.  (U) The COPP guarantees suspects the right to a public 
trial, except when a public trial: 1) would violate the right 
to privacy of one of the actors; 2) would endanger national 
security or public morals; 3) would reveal commercial or 
industrial secrets; 4) when a minor is testifying. The judge 
in the case of Gen. Alfonzo closed the trial to the press and 
public on July 19, for reasons of national security. The 
defense unsuccessfully objected that all the evidence had 
already been discussed publicly in a Supreme Court hearing. 
 
-------------------- 
Judges and Escabinos 
-------------------- 
 
10.  (U) Trial judges in Venezuela render decisions as well 
as ensure proper trial procedures are followed. In cases with 
a maximum penalty of less than four years, the judge decides 
on guilt or innocence, and sentences the defendant. In cases 
with a maximum sentence of more than four years, the judge 
presides over a mixed court, consisting of himself and two 
lay judges (escabinos). The two escabinos have the same right 
as the judge to question witnesses. Decisions can be made by 
a two-thirds majority. Delays in identifying escabinos cause 
subsequent delays in trials. The accused can request a trial 
without them after four failed attempts to form a mixed 
court. An accusation of bribery against a defense lawyer and 
the escabinos in the trial of the Tachira 9 caused the latest 
delay in the case. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) The Venezuelan judicial system is a case study on 
the limits of progressive law. The previous division of the 
justice system between the AD and COPEI provided for a 
balance of power, but did not strengthen the idea of judicial 
independence.  The Venezuelan Constitution and the COPP take 
very progressive views on human rights, and the rights of the 
accused. In practice, however, respect for these rights falls 
short. Chavez and his loyalists control the prosecutors 
office and much of the court system. The failure to insulate 
prosecutors and judges from outside pressure and the 
excessive authority exercised by a politically partial 
Supreme Court over the entire court system, have made it more 
possible for criminal persecution in Venezuela to be the 
continuation of politics by other means.

antagonism towards the United States is well documentd and 
makes GOV support for a democratic transition in Cuba 
unfeasible. The cooperation that exists between Castro and 
Chavez is extensive, as evidenced by the over 10,000 Cuban 
doctors and teachers working in Venezuela and the amount of 
subsidized oil flowing from Venezuela into Cuba. Chavez,s 
regard for Castro is deeply rooted and unlikely to change in 
the foreseeable future. 
 
2. (C) Chavez and his supporters, as well as those who oppose 
his presidency, are furiously campaigning for the August 15 
presidential referendum to determine if Chavez is to finish 
out the last 2 years of his presidency. Venezuelan civil 
society and NGOs, who might otherwise be supportive of 
efforts to hasten democracy in Cuba, are concentrating their 
efforts on a democratic resolution to the political tensions 
in Venezuela. While the political situation remains unstable 
in Venezuela, local NGOs are unlikely to divert resources to 
Cuba. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
3. (C) Chavez,s relationship to Castro and political 
tensions in Venezuela rule out GOV and NGO participation to 
hasten democratic reform in Cuba. The August 15 referendum 
and possible presidential election a month afterwards are the 
focal point of Venezuela,s political energy. In the 
aftermath, Venezuela will likely face some degree of 
political uncertainty or instability. The GOV and local NGOs 
are unlikely to participate in any democratic efforts in Cuba 
through the end of 2004 regardless of the outcome of the 
referendum and possible elections.

Summary

1. (C) Supporters of President Hugo Chavez and the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) conducted separate voting simulations 
August 1, while the opposition Coordinadora Democratica 
rallied supporters to sign its Governance Accord and verify 
electoral registry entries.  Each side of the referendum 
question remains convinced of its inevitable victory two 
weeks prior to the August 15 Presidential recall referendum. 
One prominent political analyst, however, told the Ambassador 
August 1 that Chavez\'s poll upswings had peaked and the 
opposition\'s standing was improving.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Sunday Political Events 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) August 1 organized 
8,500 booths close to voting centers throughout Venezuela 
staffed by 50,000 volunteers.  Voters verified the electoral 
register to insure they were registered and whether the 
location of the voting center to which they are assigned for 
August 15 is correct.  The opposition also collected 
signatures in support for its \"Governance Agreement\", 
unveiled July 25, which outlines the directives of a possible 
transition government if Chavez is voted out of office. 
Statements by various opposition leaders indicated that the 
simulation went well. 
 
3. (U) Supporters of President Hugo Chavez conducted a 
referendum vote simulation August 1 to familiarize people 
with the voting procedures and to check voters, electoral 
register information.  The Chavez supporters said the purpose 
of the simulation was also to continue promoting the 
achievements of the &Bolivarian revolution8, and to assess 
the effectiveness of Comando Maisanta, the organization in 
charge of Chavez\'s campaign. Regional organizers and National 
Assembly representatives who support Chavez issued general 
statements that they were pleased with the results. 
 
4. (U) Also on August 1, the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
held a logistical test to analyze the efficiency of material 
distribution and reception, operations, technical support, 
and transmission of results for the computerized electoral 
machines. The trial included 8,000 voting machine operators 
(out of 45,000), 1,000 technical supporters (out of 4,000), 
300 supervisors and 50 control operators from CANTV, the 
Venezuelan telephone company whose lines will be used to 
transmit the electronic results of the Referendum.  CNE 
vice-president Ezequiel Zamora said that Organization of 
American States (OAS) and Carter Center (CC) representatives 
were present.  Zamora qualified the tests as satisfactory and 
told reporters that he did not foresee logistical problems 
during the Referendum.  Zamora told reporters that as a 
result, he downgraded his level orange alert about possible 
Referendum delays to yellow. 
 
------------ 
Win or Lose? 
------------ 
 
5. (C) Each side on the recall referendum continues to 
believe it will win the vote August 15.  Political analyst 
and El Universal columnist Carlos Blanco told the Ambassador 
August 1, however, that he believes the opposition would win 
the recall referendum by 10%.  Blanco said Chavez appears to 
have peaked in July, and a poll conducted at the end of the 
month by Felix Seijas coming out the first week of August 
will show Chavez dropping.  Blanco also noted there are 
indications of Chavez supporters making plans to get their 
families out of the country, signaling that Chavez supporters 
are aware that their prospects are waning.  Blanco argued 
that Chavez cannot realistically expect to gain more votes 
than those that brought him into office in 2000 -- 3.8 
 
million votes, whereas the opposition had obtained 4.7 
million signatures in its signature drives.  If anything, he 
said, the number of persons who would vote for Chavez has 
diminished because of the President\'s failure to deliver. 
Carter Center representative Francisco Diez told the 
Ambassador that Chavez supporters believe they will win by 
12-14%.  Chavez opponents, using reasoning cited by Blanco, 
believe they will win by 10%, according to Diez.  The Carter 
Center representative would not predict which side was 
correct in its estimation. 
 
------------------------- 
CNE Contingency Planning 
------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The CNE failed to meet August 2 to begin evaluating 
contingency plan proposals to be implemented if there are 
voting machine failures on August 15.  Three versions of 
draft rules for resolving possible problems are under 
consideration.  CNE vice-president Zamora hopes that any 
problems that arise and cannot be resolved within an hour 
will lead to a manual vote. CNE Legal Counsel Andres Brito 
proposes a 2-hour lapse time and a decision issued by the 
National Electoral Board (JNE) to determine if a change to 
manual voting should occur.  CNE president Francisco 
Carrasquero supports suspending the voting process at a 
center if technical failures cannot be resolved within an 
hour and resuming the voting there only if the votes in 
question would have significant bearing on the election 
results.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez suggested July 30 that 
if there are failures in 20% of the voting machines, the 
referendum should be postponed. Coordinadora Democratica 
representatives oppose Carrasquero\'s proposal and rejected 
Rodriguez\'s suggestion as anti-democratic. 
 
----------------------- 
Opposition Leader Dies 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) Opposition negotiator at the 2003 OAS talks and 
National Assembly deputy Alejandro Armas died July 31.  Armas 
was a former Chavez supporter turned opposition leader in 
early 2002.  He led the Solidaridad political party.  Armas 
was also a possible candidate for the opposition\'s transition 
government if Chavez were to loose the Referendum.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) While the Coordinadora Democratica in Merida is 
divided about local politics and how to run the campaign for 
the August 15 Referendum, the leaders of several parties 
agree that President Chavez will be recalled. A barely 
visible &Si8 campaign for the recall contrasts starkly with 
overwhelming &No8 advertisements on the streets of the 
regional Andean capital. The varied opposition 
representatives concur that on a national level the people 
will first unite to oust President Chavez and then require 
that the opposition unite behind one presidential candidate. 
Chavez supporters and opponents worried about possible 
violence after August 15 regardless of the outcome of the 
vote. End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The August 15 Campaign 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In the Andean regional capital of Merida, President 
Hugo Chavez\'s &No8 campaign has an overwhelming visual 
presence compared to the Coordinadora,s weak media campaign. 
\"No\" posters, banners, flyers and graffiti appear everywhere. 
Comando Maisanta also organized door-to-door visits 
throughout many neighborhoods. Chavez supporters are seen 
patrolling neighboorhoods and talking to people. In contrast, 
the \"Si\" campaign has a few posters that appear throughout 
the city. The \"Si\" campaign is much more mobile with some 
meetings, marches or caravans taking place interspercedly 
around the city. 
 
3. (C) Fernando Soto and Ruben Avila of Merida state,s 
Comando Maisanta told Poloffs July 22 that in the state of 
Merida there are 364 electoral battle units, each with 10-12 
people per unit. The roughly 4,000 members go door-to-door to 
both Chavista and opposition households to convince 
registered citizens to vote for Chavez on August 15. Using 
door-to-door visits, posters, banners, flyers and graffiti 
urging the populace to vote &No8, they said, the Comando 
Maisanta hopes to have between 160-170,000 &No8 votes, 
about 40-42% of eligible voters. 
 
4. (C) Representatives of Primero Justicia, People from the 
University of the Andes, Movimiento de Trabajo, Accion 
Democratica, Movimiento Federal and academic leaders in 
Merida agree that despite their not being as organized as 
Comando Maisanta, the vote will show the people are against 
Chavez. Like the Maisanta campaign, the opposition uses 
door-to-door outreaches (scheduled to begin the week of July 
26), and posters and some graffitti. They also use forums, 
small community meetings and car caravans to garner \"Si\" 
support. Primero Justicia (PJ) mayoral candidate Carlos 
Masini said the mood among the opposition is the most 
optimistic it has been since January 2004. Some, like Marcos 
Pino, the campaign manager for the Coordinadora Democratica 
in Merida, claimed that the people are not out marching and 
plastering posters because they already know they are going 
to vote &Si8 August 15. 
 
5. (C) The various opposition representatives estimated the 
&Si8 votes expected in Merida also to reach between 
160-180,000 voters, 40-45% of total voters registered.  Most 
of the Merida opposition representatives agreed that Merida 
would mirror the national vote. Some others foresaw a smaller 
victory, but a victory nonetheless.  All agreed that an 
important campaign strategy for the Coordinadora Democratica 
to increase the number of people voting &Si8 is to dispel 
rumors and inform people the vote is secret. 
 
6. (C) According to Pino of the Coordinador Democratica 
voters who support neither Chavez nor the opposition 
reportedly are actually a small minority of people in Merida 
and nationwide. He said some of them do not support the 
opposition or its candidates perse but will vote for whatever 
candidate is presented as an alternative to Chavez. In 
contrast, Luis Loaiza of the University of Los Andes claimed 
that the possibility of a win was still good, but said the 
opposition campaign strategy needed to change and to focus on 
 
C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y CORRECTING PARA NUMBERING 
 
the undecided voters. 
 
--------------------------- 
Primary Possibilities 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Assuming a &Si8 win, many opposition representatives 
in Merida are looking forward to a presidential primary to 
determine who the opposition candidate will be. On a national 
level, opposition representatives agreed that there will be 
no dissensions and only one candidate will appear as a result 
of the primary. Gilberto Belandrini of Movimiento al Trabajo 
asserted that the people will support whoever wins the 
primary and punish any other candidates who enter the race by 
not voting for them. 
 
8. (C) Masini said the primary is the only feasible option if 
the &Si8 wins, because the opposition candidate will not be 
one of the well-known names being thrown around now. The 
candidate, Masini predicted, will be &second string8 since 
it is the policies that are important, not the personality of 
the candidate. Masini claimed that Miranda state governor 
Enrique Mendoza, will not &politically castrate8 himself by 
running for this limited presidency. He claimed that if 
Chavez were to lose the referendum, he would lose his 
momentum and the people would turn against him. 
 
9. (C) Comando Maisanta leaders believe that in the unlikely 
event that Chavez were to lose the referendum, his candidate 
would still win the presidential elections afterwards. Soto 
and Avila saw the opposition as fractured and claimed that 
opposition supporters would not be able to agree on one 
candidate. They claimed that Chavez supporters were united 
and would support the candidate chosen to run. By running 
multiple candidates against one Chavista candidate, Avila and 
Soto claimed, the opposition would be guaranteed to lose. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
After the Vote*Possibility of Violence 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Comando Maisanta\'s regional leaders Soto and Avila 
said if Chavez wins and the opposition is not willing to 
accept the decision, which Chavez supporters see as likely, 
then those who support Chavez will &use any means necessary 
to ensure the future of Venezuela for their children and 
grandchildren.8  Chavez opponents thought fraud, or claims 
of it, would lead to violence regardless of the decision. 
Many opposition representatives said that even if Chavez were 
to accept a &Si8 vote, there are politically extreme 
factions and &imported guerillas8 who will not accept a 
peaceful transition. They alleged that Chavista politicians 
and civil leaders who have gained under Chavez\'s government 
think they have too much to lose and will stir the people 
into violent revolt. Both sides fear that if Chavez 
supporters are persecuted when the opposition wins, this will 
play into the hands of political extremists and increase the 
risk of violence. 
 
------------------------ 
Inclusion Solution 
------------------------ 
 
11. (C) Unanimously, opposition leaders said that if the 
opposition were to win the presidency for the next two years, 
they would have to insure tolerance, inclusion, 
decentralization and cooperation with factions of Chavez,s 
supporters to avoid violence and insure govern ability. They 
said that there were some politicians, even those who support 
inclusion, who say that those who committed crimes under 
Chavez,s rule would have to be prosecuted. They did not see 
the need for prosecution and acceptance as mutually 
exclusive. Some of the representatives of the opposition 
believed that leaving Chavez supporters in control of some 
institutions and political seats like the CNE, Supreme Court, 
and some gubernatorial and mayoral seats would demonstrate 
tolerance and acceptance of opposing ideals and give the new 
government legitimacy. Others believed that having Chavistas 
with power would be one more problem to be solved.

C O R R E C T E D   C O P Y  CORRECTING PARA NUMBERING 
 
12. (C) Merida opposition representatives agreed that the 
current less organized and less visible &Si8 campaign would 
still be enough to vote Chavez out of power, although some 
disagreed about the margin by which the opposition would win. 
Leaders foresaw possible problems to be govern ability and 
violence. While they recommended inclusion as a means of 
resolving the potential for violence, most disagreed on 
exactly what inclusion might mean. Chavez opponents claimed 
that if Chavez were to win, it would be a no-holds-barred 
attack on the opposition and democracy.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) In accordance with a decree issued by President 
Chavez in May, the minimum wage rose 10% on August 1, after 
having increased 20% on May 1.  Meanwhile, the parallel 
dollar rate remains steady at lower levels than before, much 
more foreign currency is available than at any time since 
exchange controls were instituted, and Venezuelan oil prices 
continue to hover near record levels, which has facilitated a 
significant increase in government spending.  Some business 
activity may be slowing down, as retailers in particular face 
pre-referendum jitters.  But two weeks before the referendum, 
President Chavez could hardly ask for anything more from the 
economy, given its structural flaws. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS GOING FOR STIMULUS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) August 1 marked the implementation of a 10% increase 
of the minimum wage to 321,235.20 bolivars per month, the 
second and last phase of a May presidential decree that 
raised it 20% at that time (ref a).  This puts it ahead of 
inflation, which according to GOV figures is running at 12.6% 
for the year to date.  The new minimum wage, USD 167 per 
month at the official exchange rate, however, is still 0.3% 
less than the most recent (June) official value of the basic 
food basket for a family of five. 
 
3. (SBU) Meanwhile, there are plenty more US dollars 
available in the economy, thanks to the Commission for 
Foreign Exchange Administration (CADIVI).  June liquidations 
by the Central Bank, while only 46% of what CADIVI approved, 
were still 56% greater than in May, and preliminary July 
results are show a pace to more than double June.  This may 
be a temporary surge only, as the GOV just increased (from 
USD 2000 to 3000) the amount Venezuelans traveling abroad can 
spend each calendar year, and also approved up to USD 1500 
annually for purchases via the internet.  Since this has just 
taken effect, this amount may be high as people rush to take 
advantage.  (Caracas newspapers are full of advertisements 
from banks selling debit cards to allow consumers to access 
these dollars.) 
 
4. (U) The GOV is even more directly involved, with spending 
growing briskly.  (See ref c.)  In just the first two weeks 
of July, primary government spending was equal to the entire 
amount spent in April of this year (USD 1.4 billion), and 
three-quarters of what was spent in June.  Budgeted primary 
spending for all of 2004 was only USD 18.0 billion (1.5 
billion per month) at the current exchange rate.  The GOV is 
giving no sign that it will stop soon, as it has recently 
announced USD 364 million will be spent from the new PDVSA 
social fund (ref b). 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
WHILE THE REST OF THE ECONOMY MOSTLY COOPERATES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (U) Other economic indicators show good news, as well. 
The parallel exchange rate continues to appear strong for the 
government, as it has fallen fully half the distance from its 
high of 3350 in early March to its current rate of 2620. 
While up a bit from 2525 in early July, it has remained close 
to its current level for about two months.  This is somewhat 
surprising, considering that monetary liquidity has increased 
10% over roughly the same period.  It is partly attributable 
to oil prices, which continue to float at record levels, 
putting the average price for the Venezuelan basket of crudes 
at USD 35.71 per barrel, the highest price of 2004.  The 
average price for 2004 to July 17 was USD 30.66.  The 
Venezuelan stock market is booming, up over 22% in 2004 after 
a 177% climb in 2003.  CANTV, the principal Venezuelan phone 
 
company, announced on July 29 that its second quarter 
revenues increased over 15% since 2003, and looking up in the 
future, as rate increases had just been approved by the GOV. 
 
6. (SBU) There are, however, some signs that some economic 
activity is being adversely affected by the lead-up to the 
recall referendum.  An executive with a U.S. bank which 
handles correspondent banking relationships for several 
Venezuelan banks (principally letters of credit for imports) 
said that in the last two weeks business had begun to 
slacken.  Similarly, a businessman whose firm produces 
cosmetics advised us that orders were off.  Both individuals 
suggested that retailers were not re-stocking supplies for 
the time being, mainly because of a fear that post-referendum 
violence could lead to some of that stock being destroyed by 
looters. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) Combined with the recent VAT tax reduction (ref d) 
(which, though passed into law, has yet to take effect since 
it has not been published in the Official Gazette), the 
aggressive government spending and increased foreign exchange 
conversion demonstrate that Chavez is pulling out all the 
short-term stops to create an atmosphere of economic 
well-being ahead of the referendum.  With oil prices so high, 
he can afford it.  Any throttling back will have to await the 
end of the current cycle of political events (referendum, a 
possible presidential election, gubernatorial elections), 
and/or a break in oil prices.

---------------------- 
  Summary: 
------------------------ 
 
1. (C)  DCM (charge at the time) met July 30 with Venezuelan VP Rangel. 
Rangel was upbeat and dispassionate on broad range of issues: 
the referendum, which the GOV will win; international observers, 
whom he welcomed; campaign violence and intimidation, which he 
agreed that the  GOV and opposition should work to end; 
extradition; foreign exchange for US companies; the alleged USG 
role in the April 2002 coup; USG concerns about passports; and 
the Capriles and Sumate/NED court cases.  On the last issue, the 
VP insisted that the judiciary and prosecutors were independent; 
he did, however, hear out USG concerns, and subsequently noted 
them publicly.  Rangel urged that the USG and Venezuela talk the 
day after the referendum to mend their political relationship. 
DCM said the proposal was interesting, but that events of the 
next two weeks would influence strongly our ability to improve 
our relations.  The discussion of the Capriles arrest and the 
Sumate/NED treason accusations established a useful precedent 
that we hope other governments will follow.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
Referendum: 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Rangel, accompanied by chief of staff Rene Arreaza, was 
confident the GOV will win handily.  GOV polling and grassroots 
presence in the barrios indicated that Chavez would win by 10 or 
15 percentage points.  The opposition is disorganized and its 
message unclear; many persons who are not Chavistas will vote to 
keep Chavez because there is no alternative. The GOV\'s big 
concern is that the opposition will not accept the results. 
The DCM said that we believed that either side could win; this 
was why there had to be a strong international observer 
presence.  No one disputed Venezuelan sovereignty nor the 
authority of the CNE, but there was a large sector of the 
population that needed to hear the opinion of the international 
observers.  Rangel agreed, and said that they were welcome.  The 
DCM also said that the USG believed it was in both the GOV\'s and 
opposition\'s best interests to make every effort to end any 
intimidation or violence.  Rangel agreed, but said he believed 
that the opposition, or at least part of it, would not accept a 
loss, whereas the GOV would respect an adverse result.   The DCM 
replied that the USG believed that everyone would have to accept 
the results of a fair, transparent process.  The USG had made 
clear that it would do so. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Capriles and Sumate/NED cases 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (C)  The DCM told Rangel that he needed to discuss two 
sensitive cases:  the incarceration of opposition mayor Henrique 
Capriles, and the accusations of treason against NGO (and NED 
grantee) Sumate.  While the DCM was not going to comment 
directly on a judicial case, the arrest of a prominent 
opposition mayor, and the allegations of treason against an NGO, 
sent a very strong message in this electoral environment to 
foreigners (note:  Washington Post editorial had appeared that 
morning).  Was this really the message the GOV wanted to convey? 
Rangel replied drily that the prosecutors and judges were 
independent of the executive branch, just as the DCM had earlier 
noted regarding the US judicial system (see below).  The DCM 
said that in the case of Sumate,  the accusations also involved 
the NED, therefore we -- and senior members of both parties in 
the US -- felt the need to respond.  He stressed the bipartisan 
nature of the NED; its focus on democracy; its similarities to 
the German stiftungs.  Rangel responded that Venezuelan 
democracy didn\'t need such programs; if there were carried out, 
then they should be carried out in accordance with local law, 
which Sumate failed to do.   The DCM  ended by reminding Rangel 
that the NED accusation would be a prominent part of our 
bilateral relationship, no matter which party was in power in 
Washington.  He said he  understood the GOV\'s stance, and would 
transmit it to Washington, but that it was important that the 
GOV know how much these actions resonated throughout the US, 
 
 
including prominent leaders in both parties and inside and 
outside government.  The GOV needed to appreciate the 
implications of pursuing these cases. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Extraditions and Alleged anti-government action in Florida: 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
4. (C)  The DCM noted that MVR Deputy Maduro had made yet again 
some outrageous statements about the U.S. and the extradition 
process.  The USG rejected such statements.  Extradition and 
asylum requests were judicial processes; they were not 
politicized, and the USG had a clear interest in keeping it this 
way.  The DCM said that, following up earlier GOV expressions of 
concern about alleged anti-Chavez activities of the F-4 group in 
Florida, the FBI was pursuing the issue, but had not yet 
uncovered any violation of the law.  The DCM urged the VP to 
share with us any information they might have to the contrary. 
Rangel agreed, and then said that the July 25 Carlos Andres 
Perez interview was extremely worrisome.  CAP was in Miami, and 
was calling for the violent overthrow of the GOV and for 
violence against Chavez.  He wished that the USG had said 
something about his interview\'s prediction/endorsement of 
violence.  The DCM  said the USG was on record as denouncing 
violence and endorsing the terms of OAS res. 833.  The DCM 
reiterated  that an effective international observer presence 
was critical to election results being accepted by whoever 
loses.

U.S. Companies and Foreign Exchange Controls 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The DCM reminded the VP that he had told the Ambassador 
that he would help us contact CADIVI (GOV foreign exchange 
controls) regarding US companies that needed dollars at the 
official exchange rate.  There were some $64 million of 
outstanding US company requests, and CADIVI was putting off 
meeting with us.  The VP instructed his chief of staff to get us 
a meeting with CADIVI. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Venezuelan Document Control 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The DCM expressed our concerns about the integrity of 
the Venezuelan passport issuance system; Rangel replied that he 
shared those concerns.  He hoped that a new contract to provide 
additional and more tamper-proof passports would reduce the 
corruption in the passport issuing agency.   DCM noted the TDY 
assistance provided to Venezuelan immigration and customs 
through INL funded DHS personnel. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
Rangel Pitches Improved Relations, and Shrugs Off GOV \"Anti- 
Imperialism\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
 
7. (C)  Rangel said that the day after the referendum, Venezuela 
and the U.S.  needed to start discreetly to resolve our 
differences; there already was a healthy relationship in oil, 
commerce, and counternarcotics; we needed to put the political 
relationship on the same footing.  If Bush won, he said, he 
might want to start his new term with an improved relationship 
with Venezuela; if he did not, he might in any case want to turn 
over the relationship in better shape.  The DCM  responded that 
the events leading up to and after the referendum would be 
crucial to any improvement our entire relationship, and he 
reiterated the need to have a fair, transparent referendum 
process.  Rangel understood.  The DCM asked how far the two 
countries  could progress on the political side, when the 
President had announced a few months ago that the revolution was 
in its \"anti-imperialist phase?\"  Rangel demurred, saying that 
not all Americans were imperialist.  The DCM asked how the GOV 
could characterize any of us as imperialist, when it was 
Venezuela, not the USG, that owned refineries and gas stations 
in the US, when it was Venezuela that could say whether we could 
or couldn\'t use their air space for the (CN support) FOL 
flights? Perhaps the anti-imperialist analysis made some sense 
 
 
30 or 40 years ago -- but no longer. Rangel smiled, and he said 
that Venezuela was in an electoral campaign, and that afterwards 
we could improve our relations. 
 
------------------------------ 
And Raises April 2002 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Rangel said that we needed to keep the past in the 
past; he noted the GOV\'s concern about U.S. intervention, 
including the USG role in the April 2002 coup, for which he had 
proof.  The DCM  said that if the GOV had proof, it should 
publish it; Rangel said he might \"put all the cards on the 
table,\"  but that he didn\'t want to create another stir.  The 
DCM said it would be better to have all the cards on the table. 
He told Rangel that while he didn\'t doubt the VP\'s sincerity, 
the USG had investigated the allegations and found nothing; our 
recent investigations into 9/11 and into the WMD issue showed we 
could do an honest investigation. 
 
----------------------- 
9.  (C)  Comment: 
------------------------ 
 
Rangel was confident and unusually dispassionate.  He, like most 
other Chavistas we\'ve met with in the last weeks, says he\'s 
confident the GOV will win -- and he appears to believe it.  So, 
if the GOV loses, or wins by a hair, they will be extremely 
suspicious and combative.  On Capriles and Sumate, Rangel didn\'t 
budge -- but we expected no less, given Chavez\' personal stake 
in these cases.   Rangel\'s hearing us out on these cases, 
however,  suggests that he\'s aware of the cases\' negative impact 
on GOV image.  In any case, we have established a precedent of 
talking with him on these issues that we hope other governments 
will follow.  The fiscalia and to varying degrees the courts are 
of course beholden to the GOV, and the cases\' outcome will 
depend upon Chavez.  Should the GOV win the referendum cleanly, 
Rangel\'s reiteration of previous proposals for meetings to 
discuss the bilateral relationship could be useful.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELA\'S VP DISCUSSES REFERENDUM AND HR CASES, 
PROPOSES IMPROVEMENTS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM Steve McFarland, for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
---------------------- 
SUMMARY 
--------------------- 
 
 
1.  (C) DCM (charge at the time) met July 30 with Venezuelan VP Rangel. 
Rangel was upbeat and dispassionate on broad range of issues: 
the referendum, which the GOV will win; international observers, 
whom he welcomed; campaign violence and intimidation, which he 
agreed that the  GOV and opposition should work to end; 
extradition; foreign exchange for US companies; the alleged USG 
role in the April 2002 coup; USG concerns about passports; and 
the Capriles and Sumate/NED court cases.  On the last issue, the 
VP insisted that the judiciary and prosecutors were independent; 
he did, however, hear out USG concerns, and subsequently noted 
them publicly.  Rangel urged that the USG and Venezuela talk the 
day after the referendum to mend their political relationship. 
DCM said the proposal was interesting, but that events of the 
next two weeks would influence strongly our ability to improve 
our relations.  The discussion of the Capriles arrest and the 
Sumate/NED treason accusations established a useful precedent 
that we hope other governments will follow.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
Referendum: 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Rangel, accompanied by chief of staff Rene Arreaza, was 
confident the GOV will win handily.  GOV polling and grassroots 
presence in the barrios indicated that Chavez would win by 10 or 
15 percentage points.  The opposition is disorganized and its 
message unclear; many persons who are not Chavistas will vote to 
keep Chavez because there is no alternative. The GOV\'s big 
concern is that the opposition will not accept the results. 
The DCM said that we believed that either side could win; this 
was why there had to be a strong international observer 
presence.  No one disputed Venezuelan sovereignty nor the 
authority of the CNE, but there was a large sector of the 
population that needed to hear the opinion of the international 
observers.  Rangel agreed, and said that they were welcome.  The 
DCM also said that the USG believed it was in both the GOV\'s and 
opposition\'s best interests to make every effort to end any 
intimidation or violence.  Rangel agreed, but said he believed 
that the opposition, or at least part of it, would not accept a 
loss, whereas the GOV would respect an adverse result.   The DCM 
replied that the USG believed that everyone would have to accept 
the results of a fair, transparent process.  The USG had made 
clear that it would do so. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Capriles and Sumate/NED cases 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (C)  The DCM told Rangel that he needed to discuss two 
sensitive cases:  the incarceration of opposition mayor Henrique 
Capriles, and the accusations of treason against NGO (and NED 
grantee) Sumate.  While the DCM was not going to comment 
directly on a judicial case, the arrest of a prominent 
opposition mayor, and the allegations of treason against an NGO, 
sent a very strong message in this electoral environment to 
foreigners (note:  Washington Post editorial had appeared that 
morning).  Was this really the message the GOV wanted to convey? 
Rangel replied drily that the prosecutors and judges were 
independent of the executive branch, just as the DCM had earlier 
noted regarding the US judicial system (see below).  The DCM 
said that in the case of Sumate,  the accusations also involved 
the NED, therefore we -- and senior members of both parties in 
the US -- felt the need to respond.  He stressed the bipartisan 
nature of the NED; its focus on democracy; its similarities to 
the German stiftungs.  Rangel responded that Venezuelan 
democracy didn\'t need such programs; if there were carried out, 
then they should be carried out in accordance with local law, 
which Sumate failed to do.   The DCM  ended by reminding Rangel 
that the NED accusation would be a prominent part of our 
bilateral relationship, no matter which party was in power in 
Washington.  He said he  understood the GOV\'s stance, and would 
transmit it to Washington, but that it was important that the 
GOV know how much these actions resonated throughout the US, 
 
 
including prominent leaders in both parties and inside and 
outside government.  The GOV needed to appreciate the 
implications of pursuing these cases. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
-------------- 
Extraditions and Alleged anti-government action in Florida: 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
--------------- 
 
4. (C)  The DCM noted that MVR Deputy Maduro had made yet again 
some outrageous statements about the U.S. and the extradition 
process.  The USG rejected such statements.  Extradition and 
asylum requests were judicial processes; they were not 
politicized, and the USG had a clear interest in keeping it this 
way.  The DCM said that, following up earlier GOV expressions of 
concern about alleged anti-Chavez activities of the F-4 group in 
Florida, the FBI was pursuing the issue, but had not yet 
uncovered any violation of the law.  The DCM urged the VP to 
share with us any information they might have to the contrary. 
Rangel agreed, and then said that the July 25 Carlos Andres 
Perez interview was extremely worrisome.  CAP was in Miami, and 
was calling for the violent overthrow of the GOV and for 
violence against Chavez.  He wished that the USG had said 
something about his interview\'s prediction/endorsement of 
violence.  The DCM  said the USG was on record as denouncing 
violence and endorsing the terms of OAS res. 833.  The DCM 
reiterated  that an effective international observer presence 
was critical to election results being accepted by whoever 
loses.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Representatives Cass Ballenger, Gregory Meeks, Bill 
Delahunt and Butch Otter, accompanied by the Ambassador, met 
with Organization of American States (OAS) representative 
Patricio Carbacho at the Ambassador\'s residence August 3. 
Carbacho said he believed the OAS observer mission could do 
its job under current conditions. He was concerned Chavez 
might find a way to delay the referendum until after August 
19, possibly using electronic voting machine failures as a 
pretext since no contingency plan currently exists.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------- 
OAS Advantage Point 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) Representatives Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Gregory Meeks 
(D-NY), Bill Delahunt (D-MA) and Butch Otter (R-ID) met 
Organization of American States (OAS) representative Patricio 
Carbacho at the Ambassador\'s residence August 3.  Carbacho 
contrasted the process by which the OAS received its 
invitation to observe with the European Union (EU) attempts 
to do the same.  He asserted that the lack of EU observers is 
beneficial to the democratic process in Venezuela because it 
heightens the reliance of the GOV on the OAS and Carter 
Center (CC) as the only technically experienced observers of 
the election. 
 
3. (C) Carbacho lauded OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria\'s 
appointment of Brazilian Ambassador to the OAS, Valter Pecly 
Moreira, to lead the OAS observer mission.  According to 
Carbacho, Chavez\'s well-publicized respect for Brazil will 
make it difficult for him to dismiss Ambassador Pecly, and 
therefore, any statements made on behalf of the OAS 
observation mission.  Carbacho said that the OAS believes it 
has several advantages and will be able to adequately perform 
its duties as an international observer. 
 
----------- 
Quick Count 
----------- 
 
4. (C) Carbacho told the Congressmen that the OAS quick count 
could accurately predict, with a 3% margin of error, the 
outcome of the referendum and reveal inconsistencies if they 
existed.  He indicated that in 61 previous electoral 
observations, including the signature collection in November 
2003 and the appeals in May, the OAS was accurate.  For the 
August 15 referendum, the CNE surveys and chooses the tables 
for the quick counts, he said, and the OAS will then select 
their quick count tables from among the CNE\'s choices. 
Jessica Lewis, democratic staffer for the Western Hemisphere 
sub-committee of the House International Relations Committee, 
reiterated Sumate\'s concerns about CNE involvement in the 
quick count to Carbacho. Carbacho said he was not concerned, 
and the process would be statistically reliable.  He said 
that the major difference between the August 15 referendum 
and previous processes would be that the OAS would make no 
announcements as the process develops. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador and Congressmen asked if software 
problems and the 200 electronic voting machines that no one 
appears to know the location of could cause problems during 
the referendum.  Carbacho said that the OAS quick count would 
be valid and indicate inconsistencies if any tricks were 
used.  Carbacho remarked there would be 45 OAS observers 
present.  The Ambassador noted that the Carter Center would 
have a similar number.  When Representative Delahunt asked if 
the OAS and Carter Center would be working together, Carbacho 
said that while there might be coordination, each 
organization was separate.  The Ambassador pointed out that 
when former President Jimmy Carter came to Venezuela, Carter 
 
insisted upon his independence from the Embassy, as it should 
be.  Carbacho pointed out that the OAS observer mission was 
also independent of the permanent OAS mission in Venezuela. 
 
----------- 
Predictions 
----------- 
 
6. (C) Carbacho predicted 5.9 million people would vote for 
the \"Si\" on August 15 while only around 3 million people 
would vote for the \"No\". The range should be wide enough to 
make GOV accusations for fraud unbelievable. The Ambassador 
pointed out that both sides were absolutely convinced they 
would win the referendum. He thought that the voter turn out 
would be unprecedented for Venezuela, perhaps higher than 
Carbacho was predicting.   Carbacho concurred with the 
Ambassador, citing Venezuelans high turn out on August 1 to 
sign the opposition\'s Governance Agreement without much 
political organization. The Ambassador compared it to 20% of 
the United States population turning out to sign the 
Democratic or Republican platform. 
 
---------------------------- 
To Be or Not To Be Concerned 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Responding to questions, Carbacho said he was 
concerned that Chavez knew what the numbers were and would 
find a method to make the CNE fail for the August 15 
referendum.  He said that the OAS still had not received any 
indication there was a contingency plan for machine failure, 
and that could be a possible glitch.  He said a possible 
solution to the concern about fingerprint machine failures is 
to have people fingerprinted after they voted, but he 
expressed doubt that the CNE would accept that solution. 
When asked if a higher-than-expected turnout could produce 
logistical problems, Carbacho was confident that there would 
be more than enough time for anyone interested to vote.  He 
said that the voting centers would open at 7 am and be open 
at least 10 hours.  Since each center should have no more 
than 600 voters per machine, he did not foresee a problem. 
 
8.(C) Carbacho implied that the neutrality of the CNE was 
questionable. He noted that Francisco Carrasquero, the 
President of the CNE, was applying for one of the 10 new 
positions at the expanding Supreme Court (TSJ).  Carbacho 
said that since the National Assembly was going to choose the 
additional judges, and Chavez\'s Quinta Republica party (MVR) 
had a majority, it was likely they would choose Carrasquero 
for a plum 12-year appointment to the TSJ. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Carbacho was confident the OAS\'s observation team 
would be able to do its job adequately under the present 
conditions. He expressed some concern about August 15 delays, 
but did not appear overly worried. He agreed with the 
Ambassador that there might be a higher-than-expected voter 
turnout. 
 
10. (U) Codel Ballenger did not have the opportunity to clear 
this message before its departure.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The U.S.-Venezuela Interparliamentary Forum 
(informally known as the \"Boston Group\") met at the 
Venezuelan National Assembly August 4.  At the meeting, which 
was open to the press, U.S. Representatives Cass Ballenger, 
Bill Delahunt and  Gregory Meeks noted the Boston Group\'s 
role in strengthening democracy and respect for democratic 
institutions in Venezuela.   During their brief speeches, the 
Venezuelan legislators spoke highly of the Boston Group and 
the positive contributions the group has made in 
strengthening democracy in Venezuela.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Importance of Institution Building 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) U.S. Representatives Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Gregory 
Meeks (D-NY) and Bill Delahunt (D-MA), speaking at the 
U.S.-Venezuela Interparliamentary Forum (informally known as 
the Boston Group) August 4, reiterated that the primary 
mission of the group is to focus on institution building as a 
requisite for a strong and vibrant democracy.   Additionally, 
the U.S. Representatives emphasized the need to strengthen 
legislative bodies not only in Venezuela, but throughout the 
countries of the Western Hemisphere.   Delahunt noted that 
the Boston Group could serve as an example for other Latin 
American countries about the importance of working together 
to strengthen and build democratic processes and 
institutions.  The U.S. Representatives also noted that the 
August 15 recall referendum is historic not only for 
Venezuela but for the rest of the Hemisphere and that this 
process itself is evidence that democracy is alive and 
vibrant in Venezuela.  They advocated that the presidential 
recall referendum be transparent and fair and that all 
sectors of Venezuelan society respect the  referendum results. 
 
--------------------------- 
THE BOSTON GROUP OF FRIENDS 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy Calixto Ortega 
highlighted the importance of the Boston Group in providing a 
neutral forum where pro-GOV and pro-opposition members could 
meet to debate their political differences.   He called the 
Boston Group a true friend of Venezuela and suggested that 
the group consider expanding to deal with other issues and 
actors in Venezuelan society.   Fellow MVR Deputy Saul 
Ortega, echoed Ortega\'s statements and also called for the 
Boston Group to act as a facilitator with other actors within 
the political sphere.   Ortega proposed, and his colleagues 
approved by acclamation, that Rep. Cass Ballenger become the 
Honorary President of the Boston Group upon his retirement 
from the United States Congress and recommended that the 
group\'s next meeting be held in the Gran Sabana in Venezuela. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (U)  This Boston Group meeting reinforced the belief that 
Venezuelans can and should work together to strengthen 
democracy through the respect for the rule of law and 
institution building.  The comments of pro-GOV and 
pro-opposition deputies regarding the Boston Group were quite 
similar despite their different political perspectives.  All 
deputies were pretty much in agreement on the need to 
continue the Boston Group\'s mission of  strengthening 
democracy in Venezuela.  All 12 deputies appeared grateful 
for the work and assistance Reps. Ballenger and Meeks, and 
Senator Delahunt, have provided through the Boston Group thus 
far. 
 
5.  (U) Codel Ballenger did not have the opportunity to clear 
this message before its departure.

Capriles on August 4. Villanueva was assigned the case when 
an Appeals Court ruled the case be reassigned and defense

1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) unanimously 
agreed to go to a manual vote if the electronic voting 
machines fail August 15.  The CNE also finalized plans to 
audit the electronic voting machines on August 8. 
Unidentified persons attacked a pro-Chavez campaign office in 
Maracaibo August 5, and in Caracas Chavez supporters attacked 
government opponents as they attempted to set up a campaign 
point in a square in the capital.  Venezuelans who petitioned 
the CNE between July 24 and August 4 to correct the change of 
their voting location done without their consent by the 
electoral authorities will be allowed to vote manually August 
15, according to CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez.  The 
Coordinadora Democratica urged the CNE reconsider how to use 
fingerprint machines at voting centers because, among other 
things, the machines have an error rate of more than 2% and 
thus would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters 
outright.  The ex-president of the Venezuelan Workers 
Confederation (CTV) Carlos Ortega said he returned from Costa 
Rica where he enjoyed political asylum to Venezuela because 
he is concerned about the August 15 referendum and wanted to 
join opposition efforts to oust President Hugo Chavez. 
Despite worries about Chavez performing small acts of fraud 
that are undetected, opposition leaders still feel confident 
that the \"Si\" will win on August 15.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
Contingency Plan 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) unanimously 
agreed August 5 that if electronic voting machines failed 
August 15 and could not be repaired or substituted, the CNE 
would decide if voting center would go to a manual vote. 
Under the rules, the CNE technicians will have half an hour 
to fix failed machines.  If the machines cannot be fixed, the 
CNE has one hour to substitute the failed machine with one 
that works.  If after one hour and a half, the electronic 
voting machines are still not working, the CNE directors must 
decide if voting at the center will proceed manually.  CNE 
director Jorge Rodriguez reporters that on August 15, the CNE 
directorate will be in permanent session to attend to 
problems that arise immediately.  If any problems arise with 
the transmission of data or audit after the election, the 
removable memory drives of the machine will be transported to 
CNE headquarters with the escort of the armed force\'s Plan 
Republica. 
 
--------------------- 
Agreeing to the Audit 
--------------------- 
 
3. (U) Rodriguez also announced August 5 that the CNE will 
audit 200 electronic voting machines on August 8 to ensure 
there is nothing inside the program that could modify the 
results of the August 15 referendum.  Technical experts from 
the opposition\'s Coordinadora Democratica and President Hugo 
Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta will participate.  If the CNE 
discovers inconsistencies between the preset number of votes 
for each machine and the audit results, it will announce a 
manual vote for referendum. 
 
-------- 
Violence 
-------- 
 
4. (U) Violence broke out in Caracas and Maracaibo on August 
5, according to press reports.  In Caracas\' Plaza Candelaria, 
opposition supporters who were putting up a \"Si\" campaign 
booth said they were attacked by Chavez supports who 
reportedly were not from their neighborhood.  Four people 
were injured, but no one was killed.  The opposition 
 
supporters accused the National Guard of siding with the 
attackers and launching tear gas at the opposition booth 
while allowing Chavez supporters to fire upon the booth with 
guns.  A National Guard tank was installed and the military 
took over control of the plaza. 
 
5. (U) In Maracaibo, unidentified persons attacked a 
pro-Chavez campaign office while Minister of Labor Maria 
Cristina Iglesias worked inside with other high-ranking 
Chavez supporters on the referendum campaign.  The government 
claims the attackers were opposition supporters, but local 
journalists report that the incident was a conflict between 
rival groups of Chavez supporters.  Iglesias dismissed the 
possibility that Chavez supporters were involved.  Four 
people where injured, one with a bullet wound in the chest, 
but no one was killed.  Amateur video footage broadcast on 
all-news channel Globovision showed a man coming out of the 
campaign offices armed with a sub-machine and minutes later 
another man interceding between two groups of people standing 
near the damaged cars parked outside the building.  The 
unknown attackers were heavily armed with machine guns. 
 
---------------- 
Voters Go Manual 
---------------- 
 
6. (U) Venezuelans who petitioned the CNE between July 24 and 
August 4 to correct the change of their voting location done 
without their consent by the electoral authorities will be 
allowed to vote manually August 15, according to Jorge 
Rodriguez of the CNE.  These voters will be allowed to vote 
at their original voting location, with their information 
will be included in supplementary notebooks provided to each 
voting centers on August 15.  Military personnel assigned to 
voting centers as part of Plan Republica will also vote by 
paper ballot, according to press reports.  The CNE estimates 
that about 30 people per voting table will vote manually 
because of the limits on the capacity of the voting machines. 
 To accommodate manual voting, the CNE ordered 30% of the 
electoral registry, approximately 4.5 million, paper ballots 
printed for August 15. 
 
--------------------- 
Fingerprint Machines 
--------------------- 
 
7. (U) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) urged international 
observers to address with the CNE the issue of possible 
irregularities with the use of fingerprint machines.  CD 
representative Carlos Quiroz told reporters that taking at 
face value the statements by the purveyors of machines that 
they count a two percent error rate, using the machines would 
mean hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans would be 
disenfranchised randomly.  The CD used a legal study prepared 
by university rectors to back its position. 
 
-------------------- 
Union Leader Returns 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV) President 
Carlos Ortega told reporters via telephone that he returned 
to Venezuela because he is concerned about the August 15 
referendum and wanted to join opposition efforts to oust 
President Hugo Chavez.  Ortega, who did not disclose his 
location, faces charges of treason for his role in the 
two-month national strike from December 2002 to January 2003. 
 He was given political asylum in Costa Rica in 2003, but 
Costa Rican officials asked him to leave in March 2004 after 
he reportedly said he would return to Venezuela to work 
clandestinely to oust Chavez.  Costa Rican officials, 
according to press reports, confirmed Ortega departed the 
country July 30 but could not confirm his destination. 
Manuel Cova, the current Secretary General of CTV, told 
reporters that he had spoken with Ortega and could confirm 
that he was in Venezuela.  (Comment: We are convinced the 
Coordinadora Democratica did not approve of Ortega\'s move; 
 
his return only serves to remind voters of the failed 
2002-2003 strike. End Comment.) 
 
---------------------- 
It\'s the Little Things 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) Fernando Martinez Mottola, member of Coordinadora 
Democratica, told Poloffs August 2 he is concerned that 
Chavez is committing small acts of fraud that are hard to 
criticize, but when aggregated amount to major 
irregularities.  His examples included the continuing 
incidents of threats against government employees, last 
minute changes in voting stations, the rumor that the 
fingerprint machines will allow the government to track 
votes, efforts to stymie international observer missions and 
the CNE\'s refusal to conduct an immediate audit.  Mottola 
said he is not very worried bout the voting machines 
themselves because he felt it would be hard to interfere with 
the data trnsmission, a sentiment Juan Fernandez of the 
oppsitions Petroleum People echoed in a conversation ith 
PolOff August 4. 
 
---------------------------- 
Opposition Leaders Confident 
---------------------------- 
 
10. (C) In meetings with the Ambassador August 4, former 
Carabobo State Governor Henrique Salas Roemer and Juan 
Fernandez were optimistic about the referendum.  Salas and 
Fernandez said Chavez\'s support peaked with the barrage of 
propaganda and will fall off some before the recall vote. 
Meanwhile, because of limited funds, the \"Si\" campaign has 
held back and has just begun to ramp up their efforts, which 
will result in a noticeable push as August 15 approaches. 
Second, the two opposition leaders questioned the validity of 
Venezuelan polls, asserting that some people are afraid to 
speak honestly for fear that the government or their 
neighbors might find out.  They feel that there are people on 
both sides who fall into this category, but that the majority 
are those who tell pollsters \"No\" but plan to vote \"Yes.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Both pro-GOV and pro-opposition National Assembly 
Deputies meeting with Codel Ballenger August 3 predicted 
victory in the August 15 referendum to unseat President Hugo 
Chavez.  According to various deputies, participation of 
uncommitted voters, particularly in poor and rural areas, 
will make or break the recall.  Legislators from both camps 
expressed concern about violence following the referendum, 
but many discounted widespread, systematic violence.  Pro-GOV 
Deputy Hector Vargas told Emboff the GOV had a renewed 
interest in the Boston Group based on hopes for improved 
US-Venezuelan relations following the recall and US 
presidential elections.  Vargas claimed a group of 
legislators complained about the incarceration of opposition 
Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles Radonsky, but were rebuffed by 
GOV leaders.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Ballenger Honored for Boston Group Efforts 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Members of the Boston Group and the Ambassador honored 
Rep. Cass Ballenger for his work creating and sustaining the 
group of US and Venezuelan legislators the Residence August 
3.  The Ambassador gave Rep. Ballenger the flag that flew at 
the Embassy that day and praised his efforts to build bridges 
between the US and Venezuelan and between the political 
parties of both countries.  Representatives Bill Delahunt and 
Gregory Meeks, and National Assembly Deputy Calixto Ortega 
also spoke. 
 
------------------------------- 
Recall Speculation Runs Rampant 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Speaking with Emboff, Pro-GOV Deputy Hector Vargas 
predicted a relatively easy win for President Hugo Chavez 
against the August 15 recall referendum.  He acknowledged, 
however, Chavez supporters \"could\" lose his home state of 
Zulia.  He told Emboff that even with an \"unprecedented\" low 
25 percent abstention rate, the opposition would not be able 
to mobilize enough voters to remove Chavez.  Although he 
conceded the opposition has the numbers \"on paper\" to defeat 
Chavez, he predicted they would fail to motivate them due to 
lack of a clear, symbolic leader and the indecisiveness 
inherent in an organization that relies on consensus.  He 
claimed this contrasted favorably for the GOV with Chavez\'s 
strong, single-minded leadership in the minds of uncommitted 
Venezuelans. 
 
4. (C) Opposition Deputy Leopoldo Martinez told Emboff he was 
concerned voters in poor neighborhoods might sit the recall 
out because the opposition has not done enough to offer them 
a clear alternative to Chavez.  He said the GOV\'s well-funded 
campaign blitzkrieg is engulfing voters in poor areas with 
pro-GOV banners, songs, and events, making a pro-Chavez 
outcome seem inevitable and the risks of voting against the 
GOV appear pointless.  He added that a less visible GOV 
campaign is underway using neighbors to intimidate voters, 
insinuating that they should vote to keep Chavez \"if they 
know what\'s good for them.\"  He complained that the 
opposition was \"not doing enough to reassure these people\" 
that they will be protected or that they have a reason to 
participate. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Wide-Spread Violence Unlikely, Says Opposition Deputy 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (C) Opposition Deputy Angel Vera agreed with GOV-allied 
Saul Ortega and several other deputies who expressed concern 
about, but ultimately discounted, the possibility of 
wide-spread violence following the recall.  Vera said 
whatever the outcome of the recall, the military could be 
trusted to keep the peace.  Although top leadership was 
firmly pro-Chavez, he asserted the rank and file represented 
a broad cross-section of Venezuelan society.  Because 
Chavista elements are present, there will likely be isolated 
 
examples of military heavy-handedness, but these will not be 
representative of the larger situation, which will be 
peaceful.  He claimed the opposition largely underestimates 
the military\'s sense of professionalism and its underlying 
disposition to stay out of politics. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
How Venezuela-Cuba Relationship Is \"Good\" for US 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (C) Deputy Vargas later criticized the US \"fascination\" 
with the GOV\'s relationship with Cuba, claiming it was no 
more important to the GOV than its relationship with Colombia 
or any of its neighbors.  He also proposed that the US should 
encourage the Venezuela-Cuba relationship, as Venezuelan is 
\"having more of an influence on Cuba\" than Cuba is having on 
Venezuela.  He said the thousands of Cuban professionals sent 
to Venezuela to participate in GOV social programs (largely 
Cuban doctors participating the \"Barrio Adentro\" medical 
program) are exposed to US values and viewpoints through 
contact with Venezuelans, and that the expatriates acted as a 
sort of Trojan Horse for US interests upon returning to the 
island. 
 
7. (C) Pro-GOV Deputy Luis Acuna blasted the Venezuelan 
medical establishment for  complaining that the GOV was 
supporting the \"Barrio Adentro\" program at the expense of 
medical clinics.  Acuna asserted medicine shortages and 
under-funding of clinics was a chronic problem that predates 
the Chavez administration and complained that only 29 of 
13,000 doctors participating the \"Barrio Adentro\" program 
were Venezuelan.  \"Venezuelan doctors do not want to work if 
they cannot have air conditioning and cable TV,\" Acuna said. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
GOV Can\'t Back Away From Capriles Case 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Vargas also expressed dismay at the imprisonment of 
Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles Radonsky, a \"friend\" and 
colleague when both men were deputies in the 90s.  According 
to Vargas, a handful of GOV legislators complained to the 
prosecution about the incarceration, but were slapped down by 
GOV leadership.  He lamented that the case was out of control 
and that it would be difficult for the GOV to back away from 
it without losing face.  Although he admitted the 
incarceration may have made a martyr out Capriles and boosted 
his support, he predicted that would not matter \"when he is 
convicted,\" since convicts cannot run for office. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Renewed Interest in the Boston Group 
------------------------------------ 
 
9. (C) Saul Ortega told Emboff that GOV-allied legislators 
were taking a renewed interest in the Boston Group because of 
potential new directions in political leadership in both 
countries following the recall referendum in Venezuela and 
the presidential elections in the US.  He emphasized the deep 
Venezuelan social and economic ties with the US that will 
endure \"regardless of who the (Venezuelan) president is.\" 
Ortega claimed the GOV was hoping a new \"respectful\" and 
\"less interventionist\" US foreign policy would emerge toward 
Latin America, even if the current administration stayed on. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) This event was symbolic of the importance of the 
Boston Group and vindication of the efforts of Boston Group 
architect Cass Ballenger.  Getting pro-GOV and opposition 
legislators together in a social setting is always desirable, 
especially less than two weeks before the polarizing recall 
vote.  Although legislators from both sides confidently 
predicted an outcome in their favor, they also seemed to be 
thinking beyond August 15 to efforts to constrain violence. 
The underlying message: the aftermath of the recall may be 
more divisive and potentially violent than the recall itself.

EASTERN CARACAS 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard Sanders, for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ChevronTexaco (CTX) downstream managers confirm they 
believe the GOV will seek to cut off gasoline supplies in the 
eastern (opposition) part of Caracas before the August 15 
referendum.  Such an action could cost the opposition a 
(very) few votes, but would raise tensions immediately 
before, during, and after the referendum.  CTX managers also 
believe a Ministry of Energy and Mines Price Commission will 
recommend price increases for leaded and unleaded gasoline 
after August 15.  These price increases are needed to ensure 
the continued viability of service station operations that 
are suffering with the current 1.1 cent/gallon margin.  The 
service station owners association has proposed that service 
stations fire 20,000 employees and begin self-service because 
they cannot pay the August 1 ten percent wage increase.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
GASOLINE LIKELY TO BE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN EAST CARACAS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (C) Following an August 6 report by a Political Section 
FSN that she had been warned by her local service station 
owner that the GOV would cut off gasoline supplies in eastern 
Caracas over the August 14-15 weekend, econoff raised the 
issue August 9 with CTX Venezuela Downstream Manager Maurico 
Pulido and visiting CTX Andean Regional Downstream Manager 
Adrien Bendeck.  Pulido confirmed that CTX and other service 
station operators anticipate that the GOV will once again 
attempt to \"dry out\" the opposition parts of the city in 
advance of the August 15 election.  El Universal columnist 
Nelson Bocaranda also reported the \"rumor\" of a gasoline 
cut-off in his August 9 article. 
 
3. (C) Pointing to the May appeals process, in which eastern 
Caracas began to have a gasoline shortage at the end of the 
three-day period, Pulido commented that the GOV had learned a 
lesson from that experience.  In May, he said, the GOV had 
not calculated the supplies stations would have on hand and 
had not suspended shipments early enough to cause serious 
disruption.  Despite subsequent public claims by PDVSA that 
the disruption in deliveries occurred because of delays in 
receiving company sales orders, Pulido said that contacts in 
PDVSA\'s Supply and Distribution Department had admitted to 
him that they had been ordered to suspend deliveries to 
eastern Caracas.  This time, said Pulido, PDVSA has already 
requested that it receive all sales orders for August 
11-August 16 by August 11.  Usually, he said, these orders 
are submitted 24 hours in advance of delivery.  CTX plans to 
hand deliver the sales orders so there can be no claim that 
they were not received by PDVSA but Pulido and Bendeck also 
noted that they have instructed all CTX service stations to 
top up their tanks on August 10 in anticipate of six days 
without deliveries.  The gas station owner told Pol FSN that 
he was told that after August 13 he should not expect 
deliveries until August 17. 
 
------------------------ 
GASOLINE PRICES TO RISE? 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Pulido also informed econoff that the Ministry of 
Energy and Mines (MEM) formed a commission to consider 
gasoline prices two months ago.  This Price Commission was 
charged with developing a proposal for handling gasoline 
price increases for the GOV.  Much to his surprise, he said, 
the study has already been completed. 
 
5. (C) According to Pulido, there has been no change in the 
wholesale margin since 2002.  The companies that entered the 
market as a result of the 1997 opening had been promised that 
the margin would grow to 5 cents/gallon between 1998-2000. 
The margin was then supposed to remain stable at 5 
cents/gallon which would ensure a good business according to 
Pulido and Bendick.  Currently, the margin is 5.7 
 
bolivars/liter or 1.1 cent/gallon (the lowest in the world 
according to Bendeck) and service station operators are 
suffering.  Bendeck noted that the \"thru-put\" of Venezuelan 
gas stations is so high that even with a 1.1 cent/gallon 
margin the larger stations can operate at a profit.  Smaller 
stations cannot.  Shell announced early in 2004 that it will 
pull out of the market while Pulido informed econoff that BP 
and ExxonMobil have also sought to pull out of the market and 
have been blocked by the MEM. 
 
6. (C) Pulido believes the Price Commission has proposed to 
the MEM that the sales price of unleaded fuel be increased 
from 97 bolivars to 150 bolivars/litre.  The price of leaded 
gasoline would increase from 70 to 90 bolivars/litre, while 
the price of diesel would not be changed so as not to affect 
public transport costs.  These products represent 25, 50 and 
25 percent respectively of CTX\'s Venezuelan sales.  The 
increase in the price of unleaded gasoline would yield a 2.2 
cents/gallon margin.  Pulido reported that the MEM is also 
studying alternatives such as resuming support for a natural 
gas vehicle program and using the moribund train network to 
transport cargo. 
 
-------------------------- 
SERVICE STATION EMPLOYMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Pulido also informed econoff that FENEGAS, the service 
station association, sent a letter to its members the week of 
August 2 in which it urged that they turn their stations into 
self-service operations.  This would, it said, allow 
association members to fire 20,000 of their 43,000 direct 
employees.  FENEGAS urged this because its members cannot 
afford to pay their employees the 10 percent pay increase 
mandated on August 1.  In fact, said Pulido, 80 percent of 
service stations are not paying their employees the increase 
mandated in 2003.  He added that the only reason the sector 
has not gone on strike is that the GOV has passed a decree 
stating that the stations are a public utility.  The owners 
fear the GOV would simply take over their stations.  Despite 
this, the FENEGAS letter appears to be a pressure tactic with 
little chance of success. 
 
------------------- 
DELIVERY OPERATIONS 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) Pulido then turned to the issue of the cooperatives 
set up by the GOV to handle gasoline deliveries during the 
January 2002-February 2003 strike.  The cooperative drivers 
are still driving older gas trucks from the PDVSA fleet, 
according to Pulido and Bendeck, as well as gas trucks seized 
from private sector transport companies during the strike. 
PDVSA is paying the private truck owners \"rent\" for the use 
of their vehicles, they said, but the companies are still 
called on to service their trucks when maintenance is needed. 
 The companies provide the service because they still hope to 
reclaim their trucks sometime in the future. 
 
9. (C) Pulido said bluntly that the cooperatives are not 
working.  For one thing, he said, the accident rate has 
increased.  He added that there are 113 drivers operating out 
of the Guatire plant that supplies Caracas who believe that 
they will own one of these trucks sometime in the future. 
This is highly unlikely he said but, in the meantime, the 
drivers attend a daily course on \"cooperatismo.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) It is not surprising that the GOV would seek to use 
anything it can - including gasoline sales - to annoy the 
opposition and hopefully shave some votes from its totals. 
We do not think that many opposition supporters would 
actually be prevented from voting as a result of this tactic. 
  However, a run on gasoline stations in eastern Caracas 
while gasoline remains plentiful in the west would serve to 
increase tensions immediately before, during, and after 
August 15.  It is also not surprising that the GOV would only 
unveil any plans it may have to increase gasoline prices 
 
 
after August 15.  If Chavez loses the referendum and goes to 
an election any price increase on gasoline would be further 
delayed.

2. (U) Jorge Rodriguez of the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) announced that the technical audit performed August 8 
on 150 electronic voting machines was a success and had a 
zero percent error rate.  Rodriguez declared the data 
transmission through the phone lines was also successful and

Rally Sunday

3. (U) Chavez supporters and opponents held large and 
peaceful campaign rallies on August 8 in Caracas.  Speaking 
at the \"No\" rally, President Chavez urged everyone to vote, 
and vote early, on August 15 regardless inconveniences like 
bad weather and lack of public transportation.  Chavez denied 
there was any fear factor leading up to the referendum vote, 
saying that for the first time no one was afraid to say what 
he thought.  Chavez said that the opposition had created the 
appearance of fear with the help of the media. 
Vice-president Jose Vincente Rangel declared the pro-GOV 
event a success, challenging the opposition to produce even 
one third as many supporters for a public gathering.  The 
opposition held a concert/rally also attended by thousands at 
three points in the eastern part of Caracas.  Speaking at the 
opposition\'s event, governor of Miranda state Enrique 
Mendoza, assured voters that a \"Si\" win was inevitable and 
urged voters to vote early to avoid any sabotage attempts by 
Chavistas. The Chavista University student federation sent 
100 people to demonstrate peacefully outside the US. Embassy 
August 8.  The leader accused the US of sending troops to 
Venezuela.  The DCM rejected this claim and stressed the US 
supported the referendum process.

Announcing Results 
------------------ 
 
4. (U) During the opposition rally on August 8, Miranda State 
Governor Enrique Mendoza announced the Coordinadora 
Democratica would begin publicizing referendum result trends 
at 3 pm on August 15 and would continue with hourly updates. 
He assured those at the event the decision did not violate 
the CNE agreement that only prohibits announcing numbers to 
the media.  Mendoza said that the opposition would find a way 
 
of legally informing the people early so Chavez and his 
supporters could not steal the vote.  Rodriguez leveled 
personal attacks against Coordinadora Democratica leader 
Enrique Mendoza and Accion Democratica (AD) leader Henry 
Ramos for comments the two made questioning the objectivity 
of Rodriguez and the CNE. Vice-president Rangel told the 
assembled diplomatic corps on August 9 that the GOV would 
disrupt any television channel that would broadcast Mendoza\'s 
3 pm update. The law, Rangel said, is clear. The election 
results may not be commented upon before the polls close. 
 
----------- 
Accusations 
----------- 
 
5. (U) CNE Director Rodriguez presented a criminal complaint 
to the Attorney General\'s office alleging the opposition 
perpetrated fraud during the November 2003 signature drives 
to petition for the recall of President Chavez.  Rodriguez 
claimed that the fingerprints of more than 10,000 people 
appear multiple times in the petition forms.  Rodriguez 
claimed that the immigration office (ONIDEX) had matched some 
of the fingerprints with their records.  A Chavez supporter 
appearing with Rodriguez at the Attorney General\'s office 
claimed the alleged fraud amounted to 250,000 - 300,000 bogus 
signatures. 
 
6. (U) Rodriguez further suggested that a car fire in his 
sister\'s parking garage August 6 was purposefully set to 
intimidate him and his family.  Coincidentally, authorities 
discovered a Smartmatic voting machine in the vehicle next to 
the one that burned.  Smartmatic officials told the press the 
machine was in the rightful possession of Smartmatic\'s 
training coordinator for Caracas and that the machine carried 
only test software. 
 
-------------------- 
Missed Opportunities 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) A political consultant advising the Coordinadora 
Democratica told the Ambassador the opposition missed several 
opportunities in its campaign.  The consultant said the 
Coordinadora convinced itself that is was sufficient to have 
Chavez run against Chavez despite the polling data to the 
contrary.   The opposition never campaigned to the undecided 
voters, for example, only to those already committed. 
Meanwhile, the economy is improving, Chavez\'s \"missions\" are 
very popular, and Chavez is running a good campaign.  The 
opposition, according to the consultant, could win, but the 
vote would be close.  So close, in fact, that it is within 
the margin that Chavez and the CNE could steal. 
 
---------------------------- 
Sumate Moderately Optimistic 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Sumate representative Maria Corina Machado told 
PolCouns August 8 she is moderately optimistic that the 
opposition will succeed in recalling President Chavez August 
15, but is concerned that opposition political leaders may 
bungle the victory a la the Carmona debacle.  Machado said 
the problems with persons being relocated from one voting 
center to another without their knowledge was of minor 
proportions.  Of greater concern, she said, was the 
intimidation factor, especially related to the unresolved 
issue of the use of fingerprinting machines.  Sumate found 
that among voters in the lower economic strata there is fear 
\"based on the myth of the machines\' capabilities\" that the 
government will indeed learn how people voted, according to 
Machado. 
 
9.  (C) Machado said the opposition may have the rules for a 
primary to choose its presidential candidate before August 
15.  She said four former electoral council presidents had 
agreed to form a pseudo electoral council that would oversee 
the process.  The opposition is now looking at September 5 as 
the date for the primary.  Machado recognized that the date 
 
 
would theoretically leave a candidate almost no time to 
campaign if the CNE stuck to the 30-day post referendum vote 
timeframe. 
-------------------------------------------- 
Possible Outcome Has Violence Under Control 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Movimiento Quinto Republica (MVR) Deputy Roberto 
Quintero from Zulia state told PolOff on August 9 that 
President Chavez would accept the results of the Presidential 
recall referendum.  He said many people had advised Chavez to 
claim fraud and reject the referendum after the signature 
affirmation process, but that Chavez had rejected this 
advice.  Quintero said that there were elements in the MVR 
that were not democratic, ranging from communist to fascist 
in his view, but that Chavez himself was committed to a 
democratic project. 
 
11. (C) Quintero said the organizational weakness of the MVR 
in Zulia had allowed radical elements to take a leading role. 
 The violence in Maracaibo on August 5, he said, was an 
attack by Chavista radicals against the local Maisanta 
offices.  Quintero insisted that violent groups were a small 
minority in Chavismo, and that they would not be able to act 
during the referendum, due to the presence of the army in the 
streets.

1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero August 9 warned the opposition and the media not 
to violate rules prohibiting the announcement of referendum 
results before the votes are officially counted August 15. 
Chavez supporters attacked opposition campaign workers in 
downtown Caracas on August 9, tearing down the opposition 
awning and burning campaign material.  The CNE moved up its 
test of the fingerprint machines to August 10 and 11 to test 
the efficiency of changes made to the network system.  OAS 
chief observer Ries and told Poloff August 10 the observer 
mission is proceeding normally.  Primero Justicia Secretary 
General Jose Luis Mejias expressed cautious optimism while 
Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR) Deputy Calixto Ortega is 
\"100% certain\" that Chavez will win the referendum.  CANTV 
President Gustavo Roosen testified before a special 
commission of the National Assembly August 9 for six hours. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Warning from the CNE 
-------------------- 
 
2. (U) Reacting to Governor Enrique Mendoza\'s announcement 
that the Coordinadora Democratica would give out results the 
afternoon of August 15, National Electoral Council (CNE) 
President Francisco Carrasquero warned the opposition and the 
media not to violate rules that prohibit the announcement of 
referendum results before the votes are officially counted. 
Carrasquero told reporters August 9 that the CNE, \"will not 
hesitate to activate the legal mechanisms and punish those 
responsible.\"  According to the CNE regulations any 
television or radio channel transmitting referendum results 
in violation of the law is subject to having its signal cut 
or closed.  Carrasquero reminded reporters that the CNE is 
the institution responsible for counting the votes and 
announcing the results of the referendum.   Carrasquero 
asserted that the Coordinadora \"announcement was made to 
create unease and restlessness so that next Sunday there will 
be disorder and the authority of the CNE will be in 
question.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
Violence in Caracas Repeated 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Supporters of President Hugo Chavez attacked 
opposition campaign workers when they set up information 
booths at a public square in downtown Caracas August 9.  The 
National Guard and Military Police intervened, but the Chavez 
supporters nonetheless succeeded in destroying the opposition 
awning and burned opposition campaign materials.  The Chavez 
supporters also later attacked an adjacent municipal 
government building, seizing the flag and throwing objects at 
the building.  Opposition deputy Julio Borges (Primero 
Justicia) said the violence was an isolate incident, and that 
the referendum campaign was proceeding in large part 
peacefully. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Fingerprint Machines Being Tested 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The CNE moved up its test of the fingerprint machines 
to August 10 and 11 to test the efficiency of changes made to 
the network system.  Carlos Silva, a CNE technician, told 
reporters the fingerprint machines exceeded expectations and 
proved much faster and easier to used than predicted during 
the August 10 simulation.  Organization of American States 
(OAS) chief observer Edgardo Ries told Poloff August 10 the 
OAS computer specialist Celio Santos was satisfied with the 
capacity of the fingerprint system.  While Santos said the 
 
system was technically capable of carrying out the task, he 
admitted it could be used to slow down the process depending 
on how it is used. 
 
----------------------- 
OAS Keeping Low Profile 
----------------------- 
 
5. (C) OAS chief observer Ries and told Poloff August 10 the 
observer mission is proceeding normally.  Ries said the OAS 
had avoided most of the CNE\'s strict rules for international 
observers through quiet negotiation and accommodation of the 
CNE\'s bureaucratic requirements.  Ries said the OAS would 
have 57 observers in the field on referendum day, including 
five observers sent separately by the Government of Spain. 
He said the OAS observers will have freedom of movement 
during the referendum and will not participate in the CNE\'s 
official observer program.  Ries said the rules prohibit 
observers from performing a quick count, but the OAS would 
perform an informal check of results for internal use. 
Gustavo Nogueira, a Brazilian diplomat working for OAS 
mission chief Ambassador Valter Pecly, said the mission 
expected to have access to the totalization process at the 
CNE after polls close.  Nogueira said Pecly\'s comments to the 
press, prohibited by the rules, thus far had not been 
challenged by the CNE because Pecly\'s comments were positive. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Canadian Ambassador Comments on Observation Missions 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6. (C) At the Ambassador\'s residence on August 9, Canadian 
Ambassador Allan Culham described the current international 
observers\' participation in the referendum as an \"act of 
faith.\"  He said they could help ensure a fair process even 
though they are under restrictions that fall below the norm 
of what observers are permitted to do.  Culham said he 
understands why the EU decided not to observe, but he 
believes the decision by the OAS to participate is the right 
one.  He also expressed regret that the international 
community never dealt with OAS mission coordinator Fernando 
Jaramillo\'s report regarding the fraud/irregularities in the 
administration of the signature collection and repair 
processes.  Culham was the only ambassador resident in 
Caracas to participate as an international observer of the 
signature collection and repair processes with the OAS 
mission. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Cautious Optimism from the Opposition 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Primero Justicia Secretary General Jose Luis Mejias 
told Poloff August 9 the opposition would win the referendum, 
but by a small enough margin that the GOV might employ fraud 
to steal the election.  Mejias said Chavez\'s rise in the 
polls had peaked, according to the Coordinadora\'s daily 
tracking poll.  The poll has shown the winner flip-flopping 
in a 46-44 race among registered voters, with 10 percent 
still undecided.  Mejias said there are four evenly split 
categories represented in the undecided:  1) those who refuse 
to answer, probably due to fear (Mejias said these are 
probably \"Yes\" votes); 2) those who really do not intend to 
vote; 3) those who will vote with the perceived winner; and 
4) those who really are undecided and looking at the 
positions of both sides.  Mejias said the Coordinadora had 
failed with this last group of voters, making the race very 
tight.  He estimated that the race would be decided by 
300,000 - 400,000 votes, which makes the undecided voters 
critical.  Of course, he admitted, the GOV could still use 
fraud to close the margin.  He said mobilization will be the 
key to winning, and if at least eight million voters turn 
out, he predicted the opposition would win. 
 
---------------------------------- 
MVR Deputy Certain of a Chavez Win 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR) Deputy Calixto 
Ortega is \"100% certain\" that Chavez will win the referendum 
due to the recent polling data, the success of their events, 
the desperation of the opposition, and current economic 
growth in Venezuela.  Ortega told Poloffs August 9 that 
winning the street is very important in Venezuelan politics, 
and the massive pro-government march August 8 proved that the 
\"NO\" campaign has won on that score.  Of the 14 million 
registered voters, Ortega believes 20-30% will abstain, 
leaving approximately 10 million voters in the referendum. 
He believes 3.7 million will vote \"Si\" to recall Chavez and 
between 5-6 million will vote \"No\" to maintain Chavez in 
office.  Although most opposition supporters think they will 
win, Ortega said, there are some opposition politicians who 
know Chavez will win but can\'t admit it for political 
reasons. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
National Assembly Grills CANTV President 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) CANTV President Gustavo Roosen went before a special 
commission of the National Assembly August 9 to discuss his 
company\'s handling of the automated voting for the 
referendum.  At a dinner at the Ambassador\'s residence later 
that night, Roosen said he testified for six hours on trumped 
up accusations of the bias of CANTV in favor of the \"Si\" 
campaign.  According to Roosen, the Chavistas assert a USG - 
CIA link to the company by virtue of Verizon\'s 28% share in 
the company.  Chavez supporters believe that because so many 
CANTV employees signed to petition for the recall referendum, 
CANTV will attempt to manipulate the vote.  Other Chavistas, 
he said, believe the results could be manipulated by remote 
control satellite messages \"as was done by INTESA in its 
strike sabotage of PDVSA.\"  Roosen said he was asked ignorant 
questions and overwhelmed the deputies with information. 
Planted questions by opposition legislators, however, were 
knowledgeable ones.  Roosen believed the point of the hearing 
was to create a \"political floor\" to allow Chavez to 
\"intervene\" in CANTV ahead of the vote, if he wanted to.  The 
congressional committee subsequently told Roosen that they 
had backed down from taking any kind of action, and the 
hearing closed without any specific finding.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) An August 6 ceremony to mark the opening of drilling 
by ChevronTexaco in the off-shore Deltana Platform natural 
gas project provided President Chavez with an opportunity to 
posture for the nation and to send a message to the United 
States.  Chavez publicly tasked Ali Moshiri, ChevronTexaco 
Vice President for Latin America Upstream, to take the 
message to the people and government of the U.S. that 
\"although they do not understand us well, we are your 
friends.\"  The ceremony, broadcast by presidential order on 
all/all television and radio stations, capped a round of 
meetings between Chavez and the business sector, including 
the oil sector.  Chavez also announced that the GOV would 
soon open a bid round on additional off-shore exploration 
blocks.  While ExxonMobil has resisted pressure to sign a 
project document in a similar public ceremony (see septel), 
the GOV has succeeded in using the energy sector to create a 
sense of momentum in the run up to August 15.  However, 
Chavez\'s message of friendship for the U.S. subsequently 
slipped when, in front of a gathering of the faithful, he 
once again returned to the theme of cutting off oil sales to 
the U.S. in the face of supposed U.S. aggression.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------ 
THE CEREMONY 
------------ 
 
2. (U) On August 6, econoff attended a ceremony at Miraflores 
Palace marking the launch of the first exploratory well in 
the off-shore Deltana Platform natural gas project (see 
septel for details about the project).  The ceremony, carried 
by presidential mandate on all/all of the country\'s radio and 
television stations, featured Chavez talking by satellite 
hookup to Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma and 
Venezuelan members of the drilling crew on the drill 
platform.  In their remarks both Chavez and Vice Minister 
Vierma emphasized that the administration is not \"giving 
away\" Venezuela\'s natural resources (a charge this government 
has frequently lodged against the governments of the 1990\'s 
that sponsored projects mounted by international oil 
companies) and underlined the employment benefits that will 
flow from the new gas project as well as other social 
development projects underway in Sucre and Delta Amacuro 
states. 
 
3. (U) In addition to hailing the launch of drilling in Block 
2 of the Deltana Platform, Chavez formally awarded the 
exploration license for Block 3 to ChevronTexaco.  He also 
announced that the GOV would soon open a bid round on 10 
off-shore exploration blocks off Falcon state and in the Gulf 
of Venezuela. 
 
----------- 
THE MESSAGE 
----------- 
 
4. (U) At the end of the ceremony, President Chavez directed 
ChevronTexaco Vice President Ali Moshiri to take the message 
to the people and government of the U.S. that \"although they 
do not understand us well, we are your friends.\"  Continuing 
with his remarks Chavez said, \"Because there are elections in 
November, if President Bush is re-elected, we hope that those 
who advise him will reflect, because we don\'t understand why 
a country like this, a strategic ally and partner, has been 
subjected to the pressure, and to much more than pressure, 
that we have received from Washington, putting the stability 
of the country in danger.\"  If Kerry is elected, said Chavez, 
he looked forward to \"starting ... frank, sincere, 
cooperative relations between the two governments....\" 
 
5. (U) Chavez contrasted how things might be, noting that, 
\"if we can do this business...despite the terrible weight of 
the permanent problems in the relationship between the two 
governments ) not because we want it, we have done nothing 
to damage the relationship.  The offenses...have come from 
 
there, because I think they are not well informed about what 
it happening here.\"  Chavez ended by saying that he offered 
his remarks \"with respect but with frankness,\" and repeating 
a line he frequently uses, \"we are the brothers of the people 
of Walt Whitman, Abraham Lincoln....\" 
 
-------------------- 
OUTREACH TO BUSINESS 
-------------------- 
 
6. (U) The ceremony capped a round of weekly meetings between 
Chavez and the business sector that have been held in 
Maracaibo, Valencia, Caracas, and Puerto La Cruz.  Although 
other sectors have been included, the energy sector has 
figured prominently in these events with figures such as 
Moshiri, Shell President Jaoquin Moreno, and Venezuela 
Petroleum Association President Grisanti addressing President 
Chavez about the needs of the sector. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
SOME COMPANIES TAKING A DIFFERENT TACK 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) It was interesting to note that there were no 
representatives of ConocoPhillips, ChevronTexaco\'s partner in 
Block 2, at the ceremony.  ChevronTexaco employees told 
econoff that ConocoPhillips had declined to participate in 
the ceremony, saying they wanted to keep a low profile. 
ExxonMobil (see septel) has also resisted GOV pressure to 
sign a project document for a major petrochemical investment 
in the same type of public ceremony. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C)  With this ceremony and the series of business sector 
fora, the GOV has deftly succeeded in using the energy sector 
particularly to create a sense of momentum in the economy in 
the run up to August 15.  Despite the fact that large scale 
energy projects create little employment for the uneducated 
workers who are most likely to be Chavez supporters, these 
ceremonies create expections and, Chavez hopes, votes. 
However, Chavez\'s message of friendship for the U.S. 
subsequently slipped when, in front of a gathering of the 
faithful, he once again returned to the theme of cutting off 
oil sales to the U.S. in the face of supposed U.S. aggression.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark Ward told the 
Ambassador August 9 that the company is likely to sign the 
Preliminary Development Agreement (PDA) for a multi-billion 
dollar petrochemical project with the GOV on August 12.  Ward 
reported that the signing will take place in PDVSA President 
Ali Rodriguez,s office.  Although the company has firmly 
refused to participate in a public signing ceremony at 
Miraflores palace, they now have agreed to coverage of the 
signing by state television.  End Summary 
 
----------- 
THE PROJECT 
----------- 
 
2. (SBU) The project, a joint venture with PDVSA chemical 
affiliate Pequiven, has been under discussion since 1996.  It 
would see the construction of an ethane-based, ethylene 
cracker that would create feedstock for the plastics 
industry.  The integrated facility, to be located in the Jose 
Industrial Complex in Anzoategui state, would convert 1.3 
million metric tons of ethane (derived from natural gas) into 
1 million tons of ethylene.  The ethylene in turn would be 
converted into high-and low-density polyethylene and ethylene 
glycol, used respectively in grocery bags, garment bags, and 
polyester clothing.  According to Ward, the capital 
investment for the project is now estimated at approximately 
$3 billion.  ExxonMobil expects that the plant once built 
would be a major supplier to Latin America\'s plastics 
industry.  The GOV would obtain a big project consistent with 
its economic/ideological goals of directing foreign 
investment downstream. 
 
3. (SBU) Ward said he wanted to explain to the Ambassador 
what the PDA is and is not. 
 
--------- 
THE EVENT 
--------- 
 
4. (SBU) Ward said he would sign the PDA on behalf of 
ExxonMobil while Pequiven President Saul Ameliach would sign 
on behalf of the GOV.  An ExxonMobil staffer informed econoff 
separately that PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez would also sign 
because the PDA includes commitments made by PDVSA.  Although 
Ward told the Ambassador August 9 that there would be no 
public press coverage of the event and the two sides would 
issue a joint press statement, ExxonMobil subsequently 
informed us August 11 that it has now agreed to coverage of 
the signing by state television. 
 
-------------------------- 
WHY SIGN BEFORE AUGUST 15? 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) When the Ambassador asked why the company had agreed 
to sign the PDA the week before August 15, the scheduled date 
of the referendum on Chavez\'s tenure in office and the event 
that has convulsed Venezuela\'s political life, Ward responded 
that ExxonMobil is satisfied with the content of the 
agreement.  He said bluntly that ExxonMobil could not think 
of any other issues to raise with the GOV and that the GOV 
has been pressuring the company to sign immediately, 
including questioning its commitment to the project if it 
refused to go ahead.  Ward said the company has firmly 
refused to participate in a public signing ceremony at 
Miraflores palace. 
 
5. (SBU) Despite the signature of the PDA, the final 
investment decision will not be made for another 18-24 
months, Ward said.  In the meantime, ExxonMobil expects to 
spend approximately $2 million to revalidate the economics of 
the project (and particularly the availability of sufficient 
natural gas feedstock), negotiate detailed agreements with 
the GOV, do the preliminary engineering up to the point where 
ExxonMobil could let the construction project for bids, and 
 
secure financing.  The actual investment would be spread out 
over six years beginning with the signing of contracts with 
the GOV. 
 
------ 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Ward was anxious to notify the Ambassador about 
ExxonMobil\'s motives for signing the project agreement in 
advance of August 15.  He also noted that ExxonMobil Chairman 
Lee Raymond would be notifying senior Washington officials as 
well.  However, this project has been under discussion for 
nine years (through four changes in the presidency of 
Pequiven since the December 2002-February 2003 strike) and it 
is doubtless a relief for the company to take this step. 
While ExxonMobil has apparently successfully avoided a high 
profile ceremony ahead of the referendum, the GOV will carry 
the signing on state television and use it as part of its 
campaign against the recall referendum.  See septel for other 
politically generated \"outreach\" campaigns to the petroleum 
sector it has been undertaking.

1. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) approved the 
Venezuelan NGO \"Electoral Eye\" as the only national 
observation group for the August 15 referendum.  Beginning 
from six different points throughout Caracas and culminating 
on the highway, opposition supporters will begin a march to 
conclude the \"Si\" campaign August 12 in the afternoon. 
Coordinadora Democratica technicians who participated in the 
audit of the electronic voting machines August 8 announced 
their satisfaction with the security of the voting machines 
and the data transmission lines provided by CANTV August 11. 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza complained that the 
CNE planned to use numbered manual voting ballots, and thus 
would violate secrecy, to Organization of American States 
(OAS) representative Valter Pecly Moreira.  Pablo Castro, 
Executive Secretary of the Confederation of Workers of 
Venezuela (CTV) and CTV representative in the Coordinadora 
Democratica, told Poloff August 10 that anti-Chavez unions 
plan to form \"brigades\" of workers nationwide to counter 
harassment of election centers by Chavez supporters on 
referendum day.  End Summary.

National Observers 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) approved the 
Venezuelan NGO Ojo Electoral (Electoral Eye) as the only 
national observation group for the August 15 referendum. 
According to Eleazar Diaz Range, one of the directors of the 
Electoral Eye and editor of the daily newspaper Ultimas 
Noticias, the organization was formed at the suggestion of 
the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and is considered to 
be an unbiased electoral organization.  The group has 
accepted technical assistance but not funding from NDI to 
maintain its credibility.  The Electoral Eye board is 
considered by both the GOV and opposition to be bipartisan 
because of its pro-Chavez and anti-Chavez membership. 
Collaborating with other NGO\'s like Faith and Joy, the 
Electoral Eye will deploy around 500 national observers 
throughout Venezuela. In addition to verifying the validity 
of the referendum process, the Electoral Eye is also the only 
organization sanctioned by the CNE to perform a quick count 
on August 15.

Opposition Campaign Finale 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Beginning from six different points throughout Caracas 
and culminating on the capital\'s central highway, opposition 
supporters will march to conclude the campaign to recall 
President Hugo Chavez August 12 in the afternoon.  The 
opposition organizers promised surprises, political speeches, 
concerts, and fireworks.  Carlos Valero of the Coordinadora 
said several municipal police forces would provide security 
for the marchers.  He claimed the opposition expects a 
peaceful march with around one million supporters attending. 
Valero said, \"We will not march on Miraflores because we will 
be there on August 16.\"

Opposition Gives Voting Machines the \"All Clear\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (U) Coordinadora Democratica technicians who participated 
in the audit of the electronic voting machines August 8 
announced their satisfaction with the security of the 
Smartmatic machines and the data transmission lines provided 
by CANTV August 11.  CNE representatives announced their 
satisfaction with the machines August 9. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Opposition Denunciations 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza complained that 
the CNE planned to use numbered manual voting ballots, and 
thus would violate secrecy, to Organization of American 
States (OAS) representative Valter Pecly Moreira.   Mendoza 
said the manual ballots violate the secrecy of the vote 
because there are numbers imprinted on the ballots that can 
be used to track a voter\'s choice.  Upon departing the 
meeting with Mendoza, Pecly said the OAS would communicate 
the opposition\'s concerns to the CNE.  CNE President 
Francisco Carrasquero denied there were any identifying marks 
on the manual ballots charging opposition members of becoming 
accustomed to making false statements. 
 
 
---------------- 
Insiders\' Views 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) At an August 11 breakfast, Carmelo Lauria, former 
chief of staff for Carlos Andres Perez, President of 
Congress, and banker, told Emboffs August 11 he was concerned 
about the possibility of the opposition being robbed of a 
referendum victory by fraud, and that together with SUMATE, 
he had been gaming out potential scenarios.  Lauria suggested 
that Chavez is convinced he has the majority on his side, and 
that his \"manipulators\" (notably Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel) have commissioned multiple polls distorted to show 
him to be ahead, and create the atmosphere for Chavez to 
consider an adverse result to be fraudulent.  Jesus Alberto 
Lauria, Carmelo\'s brother and President of one of Venezuela\'s 
largest insurance companies, was more upbeat, suggesting that 
the opposition\'s victory would be large enough that Chavez 
would not be able to challenge it without resorting to fraud 
on a scale too great to be convincing. 
 
7. (C) Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) President Felipe 
Mujica told Poloff August 11 he was confident of a 60-40 win 
for the opposition, dismissing polls to the contrary as 
efforts at campaign spin.  Mujica discounted the possibility 
of violence during the voting, saying that the massive 
numbers of people in line will dissuade partisans from 
harassing voters.  He suggested the Coordinadora Democratica 
(CD) would try to establish contact with the GOV to ensure a 
peaceful election day, and that that mechanism could be used 
to fix a date for the presidential elections if the 
opposition wins on August 15.  Assuming a decisive win for 
the opposition, Mujica doubted President Chavez would ignore 
the results and try to stay in office. 
 
------------------ 
Union Strikes Back 
------------------ 
 
8. (C) Pablo Castro, Executive Secretary of the Confederation 
of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) and CTV representative in the 
Coordinadora Democratica, told Poloff August 10 that 
anti-Chavez unions plan to form \"brigades\" of workers 
nationwide to counter harassment of election centers by 
Chavez supporters on referendum day.  Castro said the groups 
would be armed mostly with sticks and stones -- even frozen 
oranges.  The groups, he said, will respond to reports of 
harassment with a superior number of opposition brigades. 
Asked whether the opposition would be armed, Castro said they 
would not have \"weapons of war.\" 
 
9. (C) Castro also confirmed that CTV President Carlos Ortega 
is in Venezuela as reported by the press.  Castro said 
Ortega\'s arrival was a surprise to CTV leadership, including 
to Secretary General Manuel Cova.  Castro said the CTV had 
agreed to support Ortega\'s return through a carefully managed 
media event in which Ortega would present himself to the 
Attorney General\'s office to face charges of conspiracy and 
treason related to the December 2002 national strike.  Castro 
 
said Ortega himself had backed away from the deal and since 
then talks between the CTV and Ortega have been minimal. 
(Comment: Coordinadora Democratica leaders and we agree that 
Ortega\'s return hurts the opposition. His presence in 
Venezuela is a gift to President Chavez).

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Carter Center delegation representatives, including 
former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin and former Costa 
Rican President Rodrigo Carazo, met with resident ambassadors 
August 10 to discuss the Carter Center\'s role as 
international observers of the referendum.  They outlined 
observation mechanics and discussed the political dimension 
of the mission.  The ambassadors voiced concern about the 
polarization and potential for violence as well as the 
politicization of the CNE.  Following the meeting, many of 
them also expressed concern that Alfonsin seemed willing to 
bless the vote, no matter the process.  Diez later stressed 
to poloff that former President Carter would not/not certify 
results unless he felt confident in the judgment. End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Carter Center Briefs on Observation Mechanics 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Acting as heads of The Carter Center (TCC) observation 
mission until former President Carter arrives in Caracas 
August 13, former Presidents Alfonsin and Carazo briefed 
resident ambassadors August 10 on the Carter Center\'s 
preparation for the referendum.  TCC representative in 
Caracas Francisco Diez and head of TCC\'s technical 
observation effort Edgardo Mimica also participated.  They 
explained they are operating under \"minimum conditions\" but 
that they expect to have the capacity to observe the 
installation of the voting machines, visit various voting 
centers throughout the day, observe the closing of the polls, 
and the counting and transmission of the results. 
 
3. (C) The Carter Center observer mission is comprised of 
observers from 14 different countries arriving August 11-13. 
Diez and Mimica told the ambassadors they were not used to 
restrictions on the number of observers in their missions and 
hoped to have at least enough TCC observers for teams of two 
to travel to each of the 24 states in Venezuela, plus an 
extra team for Caracas. They said they were working with the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) to expand the TCC mission to 
match the size of the Organization of American States (OAS) 
mission comprised of 68.  Diez later told the Ambassador the 
Carter Center received the number of observers they sought. 
 
4. (C) The mission includes technical observers who will work 
with OAS technicians as well as with SMARTMATIC and CANTV 
representatives operating the fingerprint and voting 
machines.  Mimica said the TCC had a \"superficial review\" of 
the machines and was impressed by the advanced technology. 
He warned, however, that the machines were not programmed 
with the latest voting registration.  Therefore, 
approximately two million new registered voters would have to 
vote by paper ballot.  Asked if they will be able to carry 
out a quick count, the TCC representatives said yes, but it 
would just be for the mission to verify the results tabulated 
by the CNE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
TCC Discusses Political Dimension of the Mission 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (C) Many of the ambassadors expressed their concern about 
polarization and the fact that neither the opposition nor the 
government is prepared to lose the referendum.  Alfonsin said 
such polarization happens in every country in every election 
throughout Latin America. The Mexican and Chilean ambassador 
emphasized that there is a possibility of violence on the 
part of the state, referring to VP Jose Vincente Rangel\'s 
threat of violence if the opposition releases its preliminary 
numbers before the CNE.  Alfonsin responded that former 
Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde was here in Caracas and 
 
met with all the political parties to ensure a fair and 
peaceful process.  Diez acknowledged the possibility of 
violence but noted that the campaign period had not been 
nearly as volatile as expected. 
 
6. (C) The Chilean ambassador raised the issue of CNE 
politicization, noting that its bias toward the GOV would 
make the observation mission very difficult.  The Costa Rican 
ambassador added that there were some who thought the Carter 
Center would not be willing to confront the CNE if it had to. 
 Alfonsin and Carazo acknowledged the concern and said they 
are here to facilitate and give the Venezuelan people 
confidence in the process.  Mimica acknowledged the difficult 
job and expressed regret that the experienced hands from the 
European Union were not there with them. 
 
7. (C) Diez later told poloff that there would be pressure on 
the international observers to certify the results, whether 
or not they have had sufficient information, but that former 
President Carter would not/not certify results unless he felt 
confident in the judgment.  Diez also told poloff he did not 
think the GOV would attempt any \"tricks\" with so many 
international observers and journalists as well as the 
Venezuelan press and the recently CNE- accredited national 
observers from \"Ojo Electoral\" watching the process.  He said 
it would also be difficult for the GOV to play games with six 
former heads of state, including Presidents Carter, Alfonsin, 
Carazo, Duhalde, Cesar Gaviria, and Belisario Betancur, in 
Venezuela.  He said they would meet together with President 
Chavez August 14. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Ambassador Reiterates U.S. Policy 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Referring to the August 6 Financial Times article, 
Alfonsin asked the Ambassador if U.S. policy toward Venezuela 
or the referendum had changed.  The Ambassador responded that 
our policy has been consistent, supporting a fair and 
transparent referendum process.  He explained to Alfonsin and 
the ambassadors that the U.S. has emphasized the importance 
of international observation and supported the efforts of the 
Carter Center and the OAS for that reason. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The Carter Center briefing left us and other 
ambassadors with the impression that Alfonsin and Carazo are 
willing to accept anything from the CNE and GOV.  Left unsaid 
but understood was also their presumption that Chavez would 
win the referendum.  With Alfonsin and Carazo seemingly 
unwilling to confront the CNE and outgoing OAS SYG Gaviria 
seemingly taking a back-seat to OAS mission head Pecly 
Moreira, it could be up to former President Carter - and 
Carter alone - to call the election.

SUBJECT: MAKING SENSE OF VENEZUELA\'S POLLS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Abelardo A. Arias for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
---------- 
 Summary 
 -------- 
 
1. (C)  The August 4 release of a poll reportedly by the 
Venezuelan Institute of Data Analysis (IVAD in Spanish) 
showing a majority favoring the recall of President Hugo 
Chavez, prompted a fierce response from Minister of 
Communication and Information Jesse Chacon, who said he had 
seen other polls from IVAD giving Chavez the lead.  Felix 
Seijas, president of IVAD, denied the poll came from his 
company, sparking a wave of speculation about the veracity of 
the poll and which side, the opposition or the government had 
planted it.  On 5 august the former dean of the Central 
University of Venezuela (UCV) solved the mystery when he 
claimed authorship.  Meanwhile, a series of polls have come 
out giving each side an advantage over the other.  The only 
thing that is clear is that Venezuelan polls are no help in 
predicting the outcome of the 15 August vote and while 
neither side will be surprised if it wins, the loser will 
tend to question a loss that contradicts its polling. End 
summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Mystery Poll Causes Confusion 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) A poll released 5 August, originally described as a 
poll conducted by the  Venezuelan Institute of Data Analysis 
(IVAD in Spanish), showed 50 percent were in favor of 
recalling President Hugo Chavez and only 44 percent in favor 
of retaining him, with 6 percent undecided.  The next day 
IVAD President Felix Seijas denied the poll came from his 
company and cited as proof the fact that his company, unlike 
the author of the poll, is on record as not believing in the 
so called ni-ni group (those that favor neither Chavez nor 
the opposition).  Communication and Information Minister 
Jesse Chacon immediately denounced the poll as the work of 
the opposition\'s laboratory and blasted the press for 
allowing itself to be used as an opposition propaganda tool. 
He said other polls in July, including previous IVAD polls, 
had Chavez ahead by 10 to 35 points.  Former dean of the 
Central University of Venezuela (UCV) Rafael Ramirez then 
claimed authorship of the poll on August 6.  Ramirez said the 
poll was an scientific study conducted by a team of highly 
respected professors who interviewed 1200 people in mid-June. 
 He said he did not know how the preliminary results from the 
poll were released. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Polling Predictions for 15 August 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Since then a series of polls have been released 
putting President Hugo Chavez and the opposition within 6 to 
9 percent of each other.  A Cifras Encuestadores poll (CECA) 
taken 1 August found 55.7 percent would vote to recall Chavez 
while 35.5 percent would vote to retain him.  Hinterlaces 
polled 1500 registered voters in 10 cities and regions and 
conducted focus groups with the working class and poor in 
five cities from 3 to 18 July.  It found 40 percent would 
vote to revoke Chavez while 51 percent would vote to retain 
him.  A Consultores 21 (C21) poll of 1500 registered voters 
taken during the last two weeks of July showed 43.5 percent 
planned to vote against Chavez while 49 percent favored him. 
During conversations with poloff Datanalisis president Jose 
Antonio Gil Yepes and Datos president Edmund Saade said their 
latest polls were similar to Hinterlaces and C21\'s results. 
 
4. (C) According to Gil and Saade, the important trend to 
focus on is that Chavez has considerably narrowed the 39 
percent lead the opposition had in July 2003.  The pollsters 
noted that Chavez has even gained among the ni-ni, although 
they admitted that most still tend to favor the opposition. 
Those who are truly neutral comprise about 4-5 percent of 
likely voters.  The Hinterlaces poll, which indicates Chavez 
 
gained 11 percent of the ni-ni between April and July of this 
year, corroborates this trend as well.  Both pollsters say 
those who are truly neutral comprise about 4-5 percent of 
likely voters, while Hinterlaces puts the figure at 14 
percent. 
 
--------------------- 
Why Chavez Would Win 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) According to the focus groups Hinterlaces conducted, 
Chavez,s steady rise in the polls can be attributed to 
rampant government social spending, the work Chavez is 
perceived to be doing for the poor, the economic recovery, 
and the image many have of the opposition as troublemakers. 
The C21 poll, which like Hinterlaces was conducted among 
registered voters, suggests Chavez is benefiting from 
perceptions rather than reality.  According to the C21 poll, 
the Mercal, Barrio Adentro, and Mision Identidad voter 
registration programs reached the most participants (42.2, 
26, and 25 percent respectively) while the other \"missions\" 
reached 10 percent or less.  Yet when participants were asked 
if enough Venezuelans benefited from the missions, more than 
half thought they did.  Saade said his company\'s polls showed 
a similar trend.  The apparent success of the economy also 
continues to be a significant factor as 48 percent of 
respondents to the C21 poll said their economic situation was 
good and 64.5 percent said it would likely improve a little 
or a lot. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Opposition Has Little Ability to Turn the Tide 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (SBU) When asked what the opposition could do to improve 
its chances of winning, Saade and Gil said it was probably 
too late.  Both faulted the opposition for its lack of clear 
leadership, its inability to stay on message and its failure 
to choose a standard bearer.   Gil and Saade rejected the 
idea that the &fear factor8 will have a significant impact 
on the outcome of the referendum.  If anything, according to 
Gil, Chavez runs the risk of making a mistake with his 
accusations of fraud, but he too was down on the opposition\'s 
prospects for turning things around. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
7. (C) The polls are confusing, but the message is clear: 
the outcome of the referendum will be determined on 15 August 
only and not by the polls.  The pollsters and politicians 
poloff has talked to say the close statistical race is one of 
the reasons political tension and pre-referendum violence has 
been low.  Nevertheless, each side\'s strong belief in the 
polls that predict their own victory will make it harder for 
the loser to accept defeat.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Plan Consenso Pais (\"National Consensus Plan\"), 
launched June 9 by the Coordinadora Democratica, has a very 
strong economic focus.  However, while long on optimism, it 
is short on details.  For example, while it emphasizes job 
creation, it provides no specific method to create jobs; it 
calls for increased investment, but doesn\'t indicate where 
the investment would come from.  Some of the creators of the 
Plan are very hopeful about its influence, while other 
contacts express doubts.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
WHAT\'S THE PLAN? 
---------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Coordinadora Democratica (CD) released on June 9 
the Plan Consenso Pais (see ref), a document which purports 
to guide the administration that would be put in place should 
President Hugo Chavez be revoked (and not win the subsequent 
presidential election).  Its economic portion gets strong 
emphasis (second only to recommending dialogue as a means to 
reach agreement on any issue), stating that \"the axis upon 
which the program of reconciliation and reconstruction turns 
is the massive creation of productive, stable and well-paid 
jobs.\" 
 
3. (SBU) It goes on to stress eleven areas: the importance of 
legal and economic certainty to stimulate investment; 
obtaining financing; modifying the national debt profile; 
combining public spending with private investment to 
reactivate the economy; designing a realistic and democratic 
job policy; starting a job creation offensive in 
construction, industry, agriculture and tourism; improving 
the electric sector; making telecom a factor in development 
and economic diversification; making science and technology 
(read: research and development) an integral part of 
development; job training; and making petroleum and petroleum 
products areas of high-impact investment.  The Plan notably 
lacks mention of certain politically sensitive subjects: it 
never raises the idea of privatization, and, though private 
investment is mentioned frequently, it never addresses the 
role of foreign investment per se. 
 
------------------------------ 
PLAN CREATORS THINK POSITIVELY 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Vicente Davila, head of the CD\'s Economic and Finance 
Commission, told econoff that jobs emphasis was considered 
central from the beginning.  He said that most of the CD 
leadership, being politicians, think of the government as the 
primary job provider, but Davila, a businessman, was able to 
steer the document to stress the importance of the private 
sector.  Efrain Velazquez, an economic consultant and one of 
the main architects of the Plan, said in a separate 
conversation that many of those jobs would come from oil - 
maintenance, field evaluation, trying to recover lost 
production - and that many of the new oil jobs would be 
filled by PDVSA employees fired after the general strike. 
 
5. (C) Velazquez believes the most important aspect of the 
Plan is to \"send a message\" that Venezuela is a good place 
for investment.  He stated that there will be foreign 
investment in oil in the near future, even with a change of 
government, but that investment would not increase in any 
other sectors until they can show results: a better overall 
political-economic climate.  He asserted that a new President 
would get very little support from other parts of the GOV, 
such as National Assembly and the courts, and therefore must 
focus on what is possible through the executive branch only. 
However, since Chavez has strengthened executive authority, 
much is possible.  He thought the short-term portions of the 
Plan can be implemented within 100 days, with a dual emphasis 
on recovery of oil production and keeping fiscal spending at 
around 28% of GDP. 
 
--------------------- 
OTHERS AREN\'T SO SURE 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Hugo Faria, an economics professor of strongly 
conservative bent at the prestigious Institute for Higher 
Business Studies (IESA), criticized the Plan, calling it \"a 
wish list to Santa Claus.\"  He pointed out to econoff that it 
is long on generalities but makes no mention of taxes or 
tariffs, for example.  (Note: those changes would require 
legislative action, hence Velazquez\'s statements may explain 
the omission.)  He called the Plan \"Chavismo without Chavez,\" 
as they are essentially the same, just as Chavez has recycled 
economic policies from prior administrations.  Faria also 
questioned how much support the plan really has among big 
business in Venezuela, since many have them have figured out 
how to profit in the current, distorted environment. 
 
7. (C) Miguel Angel Santos, chief economist of the 
US-Venezuela Chamber of Commerce (VENAMCHAM) who was 
consulted on some points of the Plan, said it only represents 
what could be reached by consensus, and that the oil portion 
is especially vague as a result.  He added that the Plan may 
never be implemented because the CD team that created it will 
not necessarily be part of any foreseeable new 
administration.  Each of the potential candidates seems to 
have his own economic team working on the details of policy. 
 
---------------------- 
THE FUTURE OF THE PLAN 
---------------------- 
 
8. (C) Davila said that the plan so far is just a framework, 
and that more details would be coming out in the near future, 
in time for a presidential campaign.  He called this the 
beginning of an actual campaign platform.  Davila added that 
much of the new portion would focus on the oil industry, but 
also on positions to be created by state governments when the 
federal government disbursed funds that are allocated to them 
by the Constitution, but have been withheld by the current 
administration.  He estimated this amount at about USD 2 
billion. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) The Plan, while painting an optimistic view of the 
Venezuelan economic future, consciously avoids discussing 
steps and procedures to turn its aims into reality.  Its 
chief political benefit thus far has been to allow the 
opposition in time for the referendum that it at least has a 
\"plan\" for what would follow a revocation.  The opposition is 
wise in staying away from discussion of the future of state 
oil company PDVSA and the role of foreign oil companies, 
since Chavez would doubtless paint any such program as a 
sell-out of national interests (even as his government does 
its own deals with the multinationals).  We expect that this 
issue will remain fudged in a subsequent Presidential 
campaign if it is held, but it will inevitably be at the top 
of economic concerns of a new government, should it come to 
power.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ChevronTexaco is pushing to expand its business 
opportunities in Venezuela.  The company received the formal 
license for Block 3 of the off-shore Deltana Platform project 
at an August 6 ceremony marking the opening of exploratory 
drilling in Block 2 (see reftel).  At that time, 
ChevronTexaco Vice President for Latin America Upstream Ali 
Moshiri confirmed rumors that the company has proposed a new 
$6 billion heavy oil project to the GOV.  Moshiri 
subsequently told econoff he hopes to sign an MOU on this 
project in October.  The heavy crude upgrader of the Hamaca 
project, in which CTX has a 30 percent stake, is expected to 
come on-line in September while Moshiri told econoff that the 
project has also proposed to the GOV that it increase field 
production in order to provide the GOV with an additional 
100,000 b/d of extra heavy crude.  This crude would be sold 
directly to PDVSA and would not go through the upgrader. 
Finally, the company is expected to consider bidding on 10 
new off-shore exploratory blocks now expected to be opened 
the week of August 16.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
CHEVRONTEXACO LEADING THE WAY 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ChevronTexaco (CTX) is aggressively developing its 
business in Venezuela.  The company currently operates the 
Boscan and LL-652 oil fields in western Venezuela.  It has a 
30 percent share in the Hamaca project, the fourth and last 
of the so-called Strategic Association joint ventures that 
upgrade the crude of the Orinoco heavy oil belt.  It is 
working to advance the proposal recently inked by Chavez and 
Colombian President Uribe to construct a gas pipeline between 
Venezuela and Colombia and is pushing ahead with other 
projects related to off-shore natural gas development and 
extra heavy crude. 
 
------------------- 
OLD GAS PROJECTS... 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) As reported in reftel, ChevronTexaco Vice President 
for Latin American Upstream Ali Moshiri participated in an 
August 6 ceremony to mark the opening of drilling in Block 2 
of the off-shore Deltana Platform natural gas project. 
Moshiri was also particularly pleased to receive the formal 
license for Block 3 in the same ceremony - in advance of the 
August 15 referendum on Chavez\'s tenure in office.  Although 
Block 3 had supposedly been awarded to CTX on March 8 in a 
similar public ceremony, the company had not yet received the 
actual license.   Moshiri informed econoff that the license 
had been held up by a GOV attempt to change its terms and 
conditions.  According to Moshiri, Bernard Mommer, a leftist 
economist now working out of PDVSA\'s London office who is 
credited with being the intellectual author of the 2001 
Hydrocarbons Law and more recently with having killed off 
Venezuela\'s orimulsion business (a branded mix of water and 
extra heavy crude used for boiler fuel), had been behind an 
attempt to change the license format.  Moshiri said he had 
fought back and eventually received a license with the 
original terms.  (Note:  Blocks 1 and 5 of the Deltana 
Platform project are still unassigned.  Although the GOV has 
been in direct discussions on Block 1 with BP because it 
operates a contiguous block in Trinidad & Tobago waters, 
Minister of Energy and Mines Ramirez responded that the block 
would be reserved for PDVSA when questioned directly by 
President Chavez during the August 6 ceremony.  The Minister 
also said that the deep water Block 5 would be reserved for a 
later date.  An ExxonMobil manager, whose company was 
popularly believed to be a shoo-in for Block 5 in the first 
Deltana Platform bid round in which it declined to 
participate, recently described the block to econoff as \"a 
dog.\"  End Note.) 
 
4. (U) Operating in 600 meters of water in the Atlantic, a 
GlobalSantaFe Corporation semisubmersible rig began drilling 
the Loran 2X well, the first of three exploratory wells now 
planned for Block 2, over the weekend of August 7-8.  CTX 
expects it will take 55 days to drill this first well; the 
company has said it will release the results in about 65 
days.  In his remarks at the August 6 ceremony, Moshiri 
pledged that the company will continue drilling until it 
completes its three-well minimum work program requirement in 
early 2005, a year in advance.  But Moshiri further expanded 
on this pledge, saying the Block 2 consortium \"is committed 
to expediting Plataforma Deltana so it can be the first 
Venezuela LNG project.\"  According to Moshiri, an LNG project 
usually takes six years from gas discovery to first shipment. 
 He said he believed the project could beat this record 
(always assuming it has enough commercial gas) and bring the 
first Venezuelan LNG to market in 2009/10.  This statement 
was a direct challenge to Shell and Mitsubishi which are 
still negotiating the license for the Mariscal Sucre gas 
project.  This project had been expected to develop 
Venezuela\'s first LNG train. 
 
-------------------- 
AND NEW GAS PROJECTS 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) Although we (and the industry) had expected the GOV to 
open the bidding on 10 new off-shore exploration blocks off 
Falcon state and in the Gulf of Venezuela before August 15 as 
part of the GOV\'s pre-referendum \"spin,\" Vice Minister for 
Hydrocarbons Vierma told econoff August 10 that the blocks 
will be bid the week of August 16.  Vierma added that 23 
companies have expressed interest in participating in the bid 
process and five more may yet buy data packets.  However, 
said Vierma, in the end he expects that the companies most 
interested will be ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Total.  We 
can confirm CTX\'s interest, particularly given the location 
of these blocks near Maracaibo, the traditional center of the 
company\'s Venezuelan operations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
MOSHIRI CREATES A STIR WITH CONFIRMATION OF HEAVY OIL PROPOSAL 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (C) Moshiri also confirmed rumors on August 6 that CTX has 
tabled a new project proposal for Venezuela\'s Orinoco heavy 
oil belt.  According to his announcment, the project would 
include exploration and production, a new pipeline and an 
upgrader to produce 200,000-400,000 b/d of high-quality 
synthetic crude and products.  Moshiri underlined that the 
project would be signed under the terms of Venezuela\'s 2001 
Hydrocarbons Law.  In a subsequent August 6 conversation, 
Moshiri told econoff he had made a public announcement 
because French major Total (among others) is also in 
discussions with the GOV.  Moshiri said he believed a public 
announcement might inject some transparency into the process. 
 (In fact, Vice Minister for Hydrocarbons Luis Vierma told 
econoff August 10 that Shell, spurred by CTX\'s example, had 
submitted its own proposal over the weekend.)  Moshiri added 
that he hopes to sign an MOU with the GOV on the new project 
in October.  (Note:  On August 10, Vice Minister Vierma told 
econoff that a proposal suggesting that the extra heavy oil 
belt be divided into 12 blocks for a new licensing round has 
been given to PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez.) 
 
8. (C) With respect to the Hamaca project, CTX\'s current 
extra heavy crude investment, Moshiri confirmed that the 
upgrader is on track to come on line in September.  He 
concurred that recent press reports that the Hamaca project 
is paying a 30 percent royalty to the GOV on its production 
are inaccurate.  (Note:  The Hamaca project inked a deal with 
the GOV in April to increase its early oil production from 
80,000 to 120,000 b/d.  The 30 percent royalty has been 
levied on that increased early oil.  Once the 180,000 b/d 
upgrader comes on line, Hamaca project field production will 
increase to about 190,000 b/d under the existing contract and 
the company will pay a 1 percent royalty for nine years or 
until it has re-couped some multiple of its original 
investment, whichever comes first.)  Most significantly, 
Moshiri also confirmed to econoff that the Hamaca project has 
proposed to the GOV that it increase field production in 
order to provide the GOV with an additional 100,000 b/d of 
 
 
extra heavy crude.  This crude would not be upgraded but 
would instead be sold directly by PDVSA as a blend crude such 
as Merey. 
 
------ 
COMMENT 
------ 
 
9. (C)  ChevronTexaco\'s Moshiri may be raising the hackles of 
some of his colleagues (challenging Shell for instance) but 
there is no doubt of his success in dealing with the GOV. 
Part of this success lies in the company\'s heavy involvement 
in the Deltana Platform project that has been largely 
conceived and brought to fruition by the Chavez government. 
Moshiri\'s pledge to do an extra heavy crude project under the 
provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law would also be very well 
received by this government.  It is clear that ChevronTexaco 
has calculated that it may well be dealing with the Chavez 
government for some time to come and that, if it wants to 
pursue a long-term expansion strategy in Venezuela, it must 
come to an agreement with this government.  Other companies 
have done the same but ChevronTexaco has been more public 
about it. 
 
10. (C)  The flip side of this is that if the opposition wins 
the referendum on August 15 and a subsequent election, CTX 
could be a target.  There are those in the opposition, 
particularly from the ranks of the ex-PDVSA employees, who 
still feel rancor against foreign companies which they 
believe contributed in some way to the failure of the 
December 2002-February 2003 oil strike by helping PDVSA to 
get production going.  The bid processes for Deltana Platform 
project blocks were a particular target for allegations of 
sweetheart deals by the opposition.  Although Moshiri 
throughout has emphasized the transparent nature of the 
process in which the company participated (and we agree), it 
is possible that a new government might review agreements 
with a critical eye.

SUBJECT: SECRETARY POWELL\'S STATEMENT ON THE VENEZUELAN 
REFERENDUM RECEIVES WIDE COVERAGE ON LAST DAY OF 
 
CAMPAIGN 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
SUMMARY 
----------------------------------- 
1.   On August 12, the last day of campaigning for the 
presidential recall referendum, the printed and 
electronic press are full stories on the various 
aspects of the referendum.   While \"El Universal\" led 
with the story on the Pope\'s remarks and prayers to 
Venezuela, it also picked up Secretary of State Colin 
Powell\'s remarks, as did all the printed and electronic 
press.  Perhaps the next most important theme was the 
need for transparency and most importantly the 
\"totally\" secret nature of the vote.   Editorials and 
television shows with a host of invitees from both 
sides, gave their parting remarks before the mid-night 
deadline. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SECRETARY POWELL STATEMENT ON VENEZUELA RECEIVES BROAD 
 
SIPDIS 
MEDIA COVERAGE 
----------------------------------- 
2.    The statement by Secretary Powell on Venezuela 
was broadcast minutes after it was read in Washington 
by Globovision, a CNN-type program.  \"El Universal,\" a 
major daily also placed it in its website almost 
immediately after it was read with the title, \"Powell 
Calls upon Venezuelans to Reject Violence.\"  By the 
time it reached the printed page, the emphasis was 
changed to the call for \"Rejection of Intimidation.\" 
Other newspapers followed by placing  it on their 
websites as well.   The \"El Nacional\" article emphazied 
the Secretary of State\'s call to Venezuelans to reject 
both \"inimidation and violence.\" 
 
3.  On Friday morning, all the major dailies both in 
the capital and all the provinces, carried the story. 
\"El Universal\" lead with the story of the Pope\'s 
blessing to the Venezuelans, but beneath that headline 
was the note which reads \"Colin Powell:  The Secretary 
of State Calls upon Venezuelans to Reject Violence and 
Intimidation and Exercise Their Right to Vote.\"    Both 
\"El Nacional\" and \"El Universal\" dedicated almost one 
whole page to the remarks of the Secretary, the Pope, 
and other international leaders.  The leading dailies 
carried news of the story on the front-page, although 
it was not the leading headline it did receive more 
coverage that than the remarks of the Pope.  The major 
TV news programs also ran the story.  News of the 
Secretary\'s message was not covered by the pro-Chavez 
 
SIPDIS 
\"Vea.\"  The majority of editorials also emphasised the 
need to vote. 
 
----------------------------------- 
 OTHER REFERENDUM THEMES 
----------------------------------- 
4.  Other stories with a referendum angle included news 
on 
a.  the pending arrival of President Carter and OAS 
Secretary General Gaviria; 
 
SIPDIS 
b.  the Wednesday press conference with Center Carter 
and ex-presidents of Argentina and Costa Rica; 
c.  the Center Carter press conference at the CNE; 
d.   doubts about the fingerprinting machine; 
e.   the possible manipulation of data by the CNE; 
f.   the call of the Episcopal Council for all 
Venezuelans to exercise their right to vote and reject 
violence; 
g.   the need for transparency; 
h.   and perhaps most important, the secrecy of the 
vote. 
 
5. Both \"El Universal\" and \"El Nacional\" printed full 
pages (the former in color) of instructions on how the 
voting process worked.  In the spirit of equality, 
opposition TV shows have invited pro-Chavez 
respresentatives as well.  Another topic which caught 
the headlines was the attack on the Globovision vehicle 
and crew and the  Spanish journalist who was caught up 
in the violence and wounded. 
 
----------------------------------- 
 TOP STORIES IN THE PRESS 
----------------------------------- 
6. a. OAS guarantees that the recall vote is secret. 
(El Nacional, El Diario de Caracas, Ultimas Noticias, 
El Globo, El Universal, 2001) 
 
b. Powell calls on Venezuelans to reject violence (The 
Daily Journal, El Universal, El Nacional, Ultimas 
Noticias, El Globo, El Nuevo Pas, Reporte, 2001, The 
Daily Journal) 
 
c. Pope prays for reconciliation in Venezuela. (The 
Daily Journal, El Universal, El Nacional, Ultimas 
Noticias, 2001) 
 
d. Venezuela\'s political opposition will close the 
recall campaign with a march on Caracas streets. (El 
Nacional, 2001, El Universal) 
 
----------------------------------- 
OTHER REFERENDUM STORIES 
----------------------------------- 
7. a. CNE approves of norms to tally up votes and for 
the use of the fingerprint-taking machines. (El 
Universal, 
 
b. Jimmy Carter and Cesar Gaviria arrive in Venezuela 
tomorrow. (El Universal) 
 
c. Venezuelan Government decided to address Cantv\'s 
American partners to warn them of the risk they will 
run if the telephone company is involved in an 
electoral fraud. (Reporte, Diario Vea) 
 
d. Foreign journalist snatched in downtown Caracas. 
(The Daily Journal, El Universal, El Nacional) 
 
----------------------------------- 
EDITORIALS AND OP-EDS 
----------------------------------- 
6. a. Today\'s top \"El Nacional\" editorial says that 
\"the Venezuelan people should not miss out on this 
opportunity to settle accounts with a leader that ended 
up not being [a leader] such, but an adventurer that 
made us lose five valuable years in the development of 
the country.\" 
 
b. \"El Universal,\" in an editorial, also called on 
Venezuelans to vote saying: \"voting on August 15, more 
than exercising a right is fulfilling a duty, an 
obligation with the future, with future generations, 
with a present committed to rebuilding and putting the 
country on the right course.\" 
 
c. Political analyst Alberto Garrido wrote in \"El 
Universal\": \"The nature of the revolution will be 
defined on August 15 once and for all.  Chavez has said 
that his revolution \'is a process to destroy the 
system, not to remake it.\'  He repeated those words in 
his speech last Sunday.  August 15 must mean, in his 
view, the extinction of the representative democracy.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
COMMENT 
----------------------------------- 
7. On this the last day of the campaign the media is 
full of referendum related articles and stories. 
Interestingly, except for \"Vea,\" the pro-Chavez daily 
and full-page pro-Chavez \"non-ads\" paid for the Union 
of Petroleum Workers, there was surprisingly little 
\"Si\" or \"No\" advertisement.  The Venezuelan referendum 
has arrived at the homestretch.

SUBJECT:  RICE LETTER ON SUMATE GETS ATTENTION 
 
 
--------------- 
Summary 
--------------- 
 
1.   On July 31, one of Caracas\' most important 
opposition dailies, \"El Nacional\" carried an article 
entitled \"Condoleezza Rice Criticizes the Political 
Persecution of Sumate Directors.\"  That same week the 
Venezuela press has included coverage of a letter from 
members of the House Committee on International 
Relations, remarks by State Department spokesman during 
the regular press briefing, and the \"Washington Post\" 
editorial that also expressed concern for Sumate\'s 
officers. On August 12, the \"Daily Journal\" printed an 
article whose first paragraph reads, \"The U.S. government 
has once again come to bat for Sumate.\" and cites both 
Dr. Rice and the House letter.  On The opposition press 
underscored these messages\' support for democracy and 
human rights.  The GoV reacted to these letters and 
remarks by saying that they were further proof that the 
U.S. was the leader of the opposition.  End summary 
 
----------------------------------- 
Dr. Rice\'s Letter 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  National security advisor Condoleezza Rice wrote a 
letter July 22, 2004, responding to a missive about 
Sumate from the president of the Venezuelan chapter of 
the Stanford alumni. The daily newspaper \"El Nacional\" 
extensively quoted rice\'s letter in an article entitled 
\"Condoleezza Rice Criticizes the Political Persecution of 
Sumate Directors.\"  The first quote was taken from the 
letter\'s last paragraph, \"we call on the Venezuelan 
government to cease its harassment of these individuals 
and others and to dedicate itself to guaranteeing the 
free exercise of democratic rights.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Remarks by Other Officials and U.S. Sources 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. \"El Nacional\" (July 31, 2004) carried a second article 
on the same page entitled, \"U.S. Condemns Intimidation of 
Civil Society.\"  This second article referred to July 31, 
2004 remarks by the department of state spokesman 
expressing concern \"about harassment and intimidation of 
civil society, whether it be in Venezuela or whether it 
be anywhere else.\"  This same article also referred to 
the \"Washington Post\" editorial on the same subject.  GoV 
media also reported Vice-President Rangel\'s 
acknowledgement that the then U.S. Charge had discussed 
the Sumate and Capriles cases with him on July 29. 
 
----------------------------------- 
House Committee Letter Gets Media Attention 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  A July 12 letter, to president Chavez from the House 
Committee on International Relations defending Sumate, 
also received significant play in the Venezuelan press. 
It was read in its entirety at least twice on 24-hour 
news channel Globovision and heard on Union Radio 
(opposition).  All the major Caracas dailies carried the 
letter, with \"El Nacional\" running the entire text. 
Beneath the letter was the response of the Venezuelan 
ambassador in Washington, who remarked, \" I must admit 
that it\'s unusual for U.S. legislators to give a legal 
opinion on a specific case in the judicial system of 
another country.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Pro-Chavez Reaction 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. President Chavez, Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy 
Nicolas Maduro, and other GoV officials and media have 
used the letter to criticize the USG, saying the USG 
 
letters are nothing more than an attempt to defend its 
lackeys.  Samuel Moncada, of the Chavista Comando 
Maisanta, held a press conference in which he noted that 
the letters sent by the National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice and comments by other officials \"put 
into question the mandate of the Venezuelan people, which 
will be tested in the referendum election of August 15.\" 
These accusations follow months of direct criticism and 
accusations by President Chavez during his Sunday Alo 
Presidente program.  He has used the program as a 
platform to accuse the USG of giving intellectual and 
financial support to the opposition.  Using 
\"declassified\" NED documents requested through the FOIA, 
he is convinced that he has \"presented proof.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Sumate Case 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  Sumate, an NGO founded in 2002, was founded to 
support individual freedom and the exercise of 
constitutional, specifically electoral, rights.  While 
not a party, its immediate goal is to recall Chavez.   On 
June 10, 2004 the GoV formally accused Maria Corina 
Machado, vice-president of Sumate of conspiracy and 
treason.  In July the prosecutor\'s office accused three 
more officers. A fifth official has been summoned for 
questioning, but has not been formally accused.  While 
currently free, they fear they could be taken into 
custody at any time. 
 
----------------------------------- 
The International Visitor Connection 
---------------  ------------------- 
 
7. Machado and another Sumate officer (Aldejandro Plaz) 
were nominated to participate in a FY 2004 multi-regional 
project on NGO management, but due to their activities, 
neither could travel.  One Sumate representative did 
participate in a voluntary visitor program to observe the 
2004 Florida presidential primary election.  On the other 
side, Luisa Ortega, the public prosecutor in charge of 
these cases, was nominated to participate in a FY-2004 RP 
on anti-corruption but she cancelled her participation at 
the very last minute. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Comment 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. President Chavez, party members, and official media 
have used the letter to renew criticisms of the USG.  Dr. 
Rice\'s letter complemented expressions of concern by U.S. 
congressmen and U.S. media.

Summary

1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) director Jorge 
Rodriguez made clear that the referendum campaign officially 
closes at midnight August 12, as was initially decided by the 
CNE, despite Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta\'s request to extend 
the deadline so its campaign closing event could be held 
August 13.  The CNE approved the preliminary announcement on 
August 15 of the results based on the automatic transmission 
of the votes.  Organization of American States (OAS) mission 
leader Valter Pecly Moreira reiterated his confidence in the 
secrecy of the vote and in the referendum preparation to the 
Venezuelan press and separately to the Ambassador.  The 
Carter Center Director Jennifer McCoy also told reporters its 
observation team was pleased with the process so far.  CNE 
director Rodriguez said that the second fingerprint machine 
test finished August 11 had once again proven successful, but 
opposition experts continue being doubtful.  Venezuelan 
religious leaders (Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant) issued a 
joint call for Venezuelans to maintain the peace, vote and 
respect the results of the August 15 referendum.  President 
Hugo Chavez\'s advisor for North America and an MVR deputy 
told Poloffs the outlook for the election and afterwards was 
good for Chavez.  End summary.

Campaign Closes 
---------------- 
 
2. (U)  National Electoral Council (CNE) director Jorge 
Rodriguez made clear that the referendum campaign officially 
closes at midnight August 12, as was initially decided by the 
CNE, despite Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta\'s request to extend 
the deadline so its campaign closing event could be held 
August 13.  Instead, Comando Maisanta will hold various 
closing events in every state throughout Venezuela consisting 
of caravans and public gatherings.  In Caracas, the \"No\" 
caravan is scheduled to end with a public gathering in front 
of Miraflores August 12 in the afternoon.  The opposition 
campaign closing event is also culminating in a march that 
will gather on the public highway in Caracas. In the 48 hours 
before the referendum, political parties are prohibited from 
campaigning through the media, in the streets or by 
distributing campaign material. 
 
----------------------- 
Results to be Announced 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) The CNE approved the preliminary announcement on 
August 15 of the results based on the automatic transmission 
of the votes.  CNE director Rodriguez explained that the 
official results should be issued around August 19, after 
12,351 voting acts are certified by the CNE.  The results of 
the voting acts signed by the president of the voting tables 
will be compared to the electronically transmitted results 
before being certified. 
 
----------------------------- 
OAS Representative Statements 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Organization of American States (OAS) mission leader 
Valter Pecly Moreira issued a statement reiterating his 
confidence in the referendum preparation process until now 
August 11. Pecly praised the technical audits, especially 
those involving CANTV, calling them well done and 
trustworthy.  He noted that the OAS will not implement its 
own quick count system nor announce results, but working 
within the CNE regulations, OAS observers will make their own 
evaluations hoping that the OAS results coincide with those 
 
of the CNE.  Pecly told reporters that he and the OAS mission 
were convinced that the referendum vote was secret and would 
remain so. 
 
5. (C) Pecly told the Ambassador he was pleased with the 
National Electoral Council\'s (CNE) performance, expressing 
confidence in the technological systems on August 12.  Pecly 
described the environment as peaceful, mostly because both 
sides are sure they are going to win.  Pecly said the 
opposition and pro-GOV CNE directors are working well 
together in private, though are conflictive when speaking 
publicly to please their constituencies.  Pecly believed he 
gained the trust of the CNE, and has been successful in a 
number of areas, including pumping up the number of OAS 
observers and getting the Carter Center observers all of 
their credentials.  The Ambassador noted the importance of 
international observers to be ready when the polls closed to 
support transparency in the process, lest delays in the vote 
count lead to violence. 
 
--------------------------- 
Carter Center Observations 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Seated with former Presidents Alfonsin and Carazo, 
Carter Center Director Jennifer McCoy told reporters August 
12 that the Carter Center mission has received the support 
and access from the National Electoral Council (CNE) it needs 
and that it has been satisfied with the process so far.  She 
said the Carter Center will deploy its observers in teams of 
two to various Venezuelan states August 13 and will use 
various mechanisms as they observer everything from the 
opening to the closing of the polls and the transmitting of 
results.  McCoy said the Carter Center agrees with the CNE 
rule not to announce any preliminary results or projections 
before the first CNE bulletin is released.  Likely, she said, 
former Presidents Carter would give a press conference with 
OAS Secretary General Gaviria August 16.  Asked by a reporter 
if the Carter Center believes the referendum will proceed in 
a fair and transparent manner, McCoy said no one can give 
guarantees, but that based on what the Carter Center has 
observed thus far, it has confidence in the process. 
 
-------------------- 
Worries Put to Rest 
-------------------- 
 
7. (U) CNE director Rodriguez said that the second 
fingerprint machine test finished August 11 had once again 
proven successful.  He announced that all the voting machines 
are now programmed and should be delivered to the voting 
centers August 12-13.  Rodriguez reported a 40 second delay 
between the time the first documents are presented for voting 
and fingerprints are taken until the results are returned. 
He told reporters this meant that more than 8 million people 
could vote (8 million possible voters constitutes under 60% 
of the total registered voters).  The opposition\'s 
Coordinadora Democratica telecommunication experts were not 
present at the fingerprint machine tests August 11. 
Coordinadora expert Luis Baez Duarte quarreled with 
Rodriguez\'s conclusion, saying the test sample was too small. 
 Baez said the Coordinadora also objected to the millions 
spend for the system. 
 
------------------- 
Religious Influence 
------------------- 
 
8. (U) Venezuelan religious leaders (Catholic, Jewish, and 
Protestant) issued a joint call for Venezuelans to maintain 
the peace, vote and respect the results of the August 15 
referendum.  They also called upon political leaders, both 
Chavista and opposition, to prevent any actions that might 
generate violence from their supporters.  Although they 
maintain good relations, the joint statement by Archbishop 
Baltazar Porras, President of the Catholic Episcopal 
 
Conference of Venezuela; Pynchas Brener, principal rabbi of 
the Ashkenazi Caracas; and Reverend Samuel Olsen, President 
of the Evangelical Council, is unusual.  At the same time, 
Pope John Paul II mentioned Venezuela in his weekly audience 
from the Vatican expressing his hopes, \"that a climate of 
peace, serenity and reconciliation reign\" in Venezuela. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Chavez Advisor on Possibilities and Post-Referendum Plans 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9. (C) Chavez\'s advisor on North American issues in the 
Office of the Presidency (and U.S./French/British citizen) 
Alexander Main told Poloff August 11 that everyone in the 
GOV, including himself, has been focused on the \"No\" 
campaign, but that once Chavez wins, the GOV will be able to 
focus more on their jobs and governing the country. Main 
asserted that there would be no violence because the 
Venezuelans are tired of it. Main said one of his principle 
responsibilities now is to advise Chavez on how to achieve 
better relations with the U.S. 
 
 
10. (C) Main said if the GOV won, it would continue with the 
\"misiones\" but would deepen their initiatives for poverty 
reduction, infrastructure, and fighting corruption.  Asked if 
these plans included peace and reconciliation efforts, he 
said sure but didn\'t elaborate.  Main said Chavez thrives on 
the crisis but has plans for the country that he would like 
to carry out.  Main said the hoped that when Chavez wins the 
referendum, the opposition will finally allow him to govern. 
 
11. (C) Asked what the GOV will do post referendum if Chavez 
loses, Main said Chavez won\'t lose. Main questioned if Poloff 
had seen the number of people at the pro-government march 
August 8.  Pressed, he said Chavez would accept the results 
from the National Electoral Council (CNE) as he had after the 
signature repairs in May 2004 (which he said was a \"real 
psychological blow\") and immediately begin campaigning, which 
Chavez is good at. 
 
-------------------------- 
MVR Deputy Offers Outlook 
-------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) National Assembly 
Deputy Luis Acuna told Poloff August 11 that whoever wins the 
referendum needs to win by a large margin to establish 
legitimacy. Acuna said the polls indicated Chavez was going 
to win; however, he did not appear confident.  If Chavez were 
to win the referendum, Acuna believes, the President would 
choose a policy of reconciliation and not retaliation. Acuna 
complained that the opposition abandoned the National 
Assembly as the legitimate forum for settling political 
disagreements and attacked the 2003 OAS talks as usurpation. 
The referendum would establish the real balance of forces in 
the country and, if Chavez won, allow the political debate to 
return to the Assembly.

------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1.  (C) On August 15, Venezuelans will take a decisive step 
in finding a peaceful, democratic electoral solution to the 
country\'s political crisis.  Nearly 15 months since the 
signing of the OAS agreement, Venezuelans will say whether 
President Hugo Chavez stays or goes.  The CNE appears ready 
for the vote, and the competing sides had their final rallies 
August 12.  Some doubts  about the National Electoral Council 
(CNE)\'s ability to conduct an impartial recall vote persist, 
and the opposition and government\'s strong belief in the 
polls will likely lead to accusations of fraud.  The ruling 
of the international observers will be key.  The streets are 
rife with rumors, some likely based on bravado, that 
opposition and government supporters are planning violence to 
begin as early as the afternoon of August 15 before the polls 
close. In addition to violence, the capacity of the voting 
and fingerprint machines, degree of transparency, and the 
weather will be important factors in determining the outcome 
of the referendum and the willingness of either side to 
accept the results.  Only preliminary results are expected 
August 15.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------- 
Referendum Day 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The polls will open on August 15 at 6 am and will 
remain open until 4 pm, although all who are in line by that 
time will be able to vote.  President Chavez and opposition 
leaders have told their supporters to line up as early as 
possible and are organizing caravans to ensure that voters 
get to the correct polling stations.  Pollsters and political 
party leaders we have talked to expect at least a 70 percent 
turn out.  Some opposition leaders also say party \"brigades\" 
will be out in force to prevent and/or counter anticipated 
voter intimidation by the government.  While the majority of 
the vote will be automated, due in part to the last minute 
reassignment of some voters to polling centers, approximately 
30 percent of the vote will be manual as well.  International 
Observers will be out nationwide, as well as, in National 
Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters when the votes are 
transmitted.  The CNE says they will be able to announce the 
results within 3 hours after the polls close.  OAS electoral 
mission head Edgardo Reis says that while the CNE prohibits 
taking a quick count, they will take an informal sample of 
the results that they will check against the formal results. 
To reduce charges of fraud and the possibility of widespread 
violence, the CNE will have to announce the results of the 
referendum Sunday night, the Carter Center and OAS will have 
to find the process completely transparent, and the winner 
will need a large margin of victory. 
 
3.  (C) The campaign period ends at midnight on August 12 
with each party sponsoring their final rallies in which they 
promise the largest turnout of the campaign season.  The 
Chavistas have overwhelmed the campaign period so far using 
government money to print signs  plastered all over cities, 
and routine presidential addresses that all television 
stations were required to broadcasts.  In comparison, the 
opposition\'s campaign was late to bloom and relied in some 
cases more on supporters painting their cars with \"SI\" 
instead of the placards, due in part to the reluctance of 
some businessmen to give to the opposition\'s cause.  The 
opposition campaign coordinators also sponsored local 
community meetings to get out the vote.  All media outlets 
showed government and opposition advertisements, according to 
CNE regulations.  Television shows, including local soap 
operas, also had themes that supported, respectively, the 
opposition and government positions. 
 
 
-------------------- 
What Could go Wrong 
 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Despite CNE demonstrations of the fingerprint and 
voting machines, we remain concerned that the use of two new 
technologies for such an important vote could cause 
unforeseen technical problems that delay the vote and prompt 
accusations of fraud and/or violence.  Technical experts tell 
us the fingerprint machines will take 5 to 30 seconds to 
process each voter.  If, as predicted, some 9.8 million 
people turn out to vote, this would present a real challenge 
to the new system and cause significant delays that could 
turn off some potential voters, particularly if it rains, as 
the weather forecast predicts.  These problems will also lend 
themselves to allegations of irregularities and fraud. 
 
5.  (C)  Although mid-July Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner poll 
suggests that a slim majority of voters believe their vote 
will be secret, there are fears that votes will not be 
counted correctly or that they will somehow be manipulated 
during transmission to the CNE.  There is a concern that if 
the government, either as a result of exit polls or advanced 
warning from the CNE, realizes it is losing, it may order the 
sabotage of the voting system or call on supporters to cause 
violence (to deter other voters and/or suspend the vote) that 
will then be blamed on the opposition.  Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel has already accused the opposition of planning 
\"acts of terrorism\" and the continuing mystery of missing C4 
and other explosives fuels this rumor among opposition 
supporters.  Others predict violence will occur August 16 as 
the winners take revenge against the losers.  In this 
scenario, opposition supporters believe  the military and 
international community will intervene and ask Chavez to step 
down. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
6.   (C) Both sides have had over a year to plead their case 
to the people and now is the hour of the Venezuelan people to 
decide who they want to govern them.  By now everyone has 
made up their minds if they will vote and for whom they will 
vote.  The belief that the vote is secret may be the ultimate 
swing factor.  Given the level of distrust the political 
parties have for each other and the CNE, international 
observation will be the key to keeping the process on track 
and improving the chances that the loser will accept the 
results.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The GOV continues to accuse CANTV, the 
telecommunications company handling the automated voting 
August 15, of attempting to manipulate the referendum 
results.  Vice President Jose Vincente Rangel warned CANTV 
and its \"North American associates\" that the GOV would act if 
the company and its opposition-affiliated executives tried to 
steal the vote from Chavez, and Podemos Deputy Ismael Garcia 
said CANTV President Gustavo Roosen\'s answers at the National 
Assembly were \"not sufficient.\"  CANTV employees fear a GOV 
take-over after the referendum and Verizon President of 
International Operations has expressed concern to the 
Ambassador about Verizon\'s investment in CANTV.  Still, CANTV 
is ready for the referendum August 15.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GOV Believes CANTV Could Manipulate the Vote 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) VP Jose Vincente Rangel warned CANTV executives and 
their \"North American associates\" August 10 that the GOV 
would act if the telecommunications company attempted to 
manipulate the results of the referendum.  Rangel told 
reporters there have been signs from the company that have 
led the GOV to believe CANTV might not \"honor\" its 
obligations to the State and the Venezuelan people.  He said 
CANTV would be taking a \"great risk\" if it perpetrated 
fraudulent activity during the referendum.  Rangel identified 
CANTV President Gustavo Roosen and CANTV board member Ricardo 
Hausmann as supporters of the opposition to justify his 
claims of potential sabotage by CANTV. 
 
3. (U) Podemos Deputy Ismael Garcia (who is trying to 
resurrect his image after his failing role in leading the 
Chavez effort against the signature appeals) told reporters 
August 10 that the answers given by Roosen to the special 
National Assembly commission August 9 were \"not sufficient\" 
and that the commission would continue to investigate CANTV\'s 
handling of the automated voting.  Roosen spent six hours 
testifying before the commission, addressing questions 
related to trumped up accusations of CANTV\'s bias in favor of 
the \"Si\" campaign.  Garcia and other pro-government deputies 
grilled Roosen on everything from opposition conspirators in 
CANTV to the possibility of Verizon counterparts in the U.S. 
manipulating the data. (reftel) 
 
4. (U) The Venezuelan military inspected CANTV cables along 
the regional highway in the state of Aragua this week to 
thwart any plans to destabilize the region before the 
referendum.  Aragua state Governor Didalco Bolivar said the 
presence of the military along the highway would help guard 
against any potential acts of sabotage by \"terrorists\" 
seeking to cut off light, gas, water, or telecommunication 
services.  Chavez opponents saw the action as a hint of the 
government\'s preparation to act against CANTV. 
 
---------------------------- 
CANTV, Verizon Concerned ... 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) CANTV employees (one working in the operations 
centers for the referendum and another advising Roosen) told 
embassy FSN August 11 that the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) has required that all CANTV operators remain in the 
operations centers August 12-16 without outside 
communication.  They said CANTV operators will be supervised 
by military officers at all times - this despite the fact 
CANTV is merely transmitting the data and will never have 
access to it. 
 
6. (SBU) According to these employees, CANTV is conscious of 
 
the GOV\'s capacity to intervene in the operations of CANTV. 
While the similarities with PDVSA are not exact, they said 
there could be a move to \"clean out\" CANTV as was done to 
PDVSA in 2003.  CANTV employees know Chavez sees the 
telecommunications sector as strategic and think he might try 
to take it over if he wins the referendum.  They believe the 
CANTV executives named by Deputy Garcia August 9 as part of 
an \"opposition conspiracy,\" including Roosen and Director 
Jorge Dominguez, would be the first to be fired. 
 
7. (C) Verizon\'s President of International Operations, Dan 
Petri, called the Ambassador August 11 to discuss his 
concerns for Verizon\'s investment in CANTV, given the 
government\'s accusations.  Verizon has 28% share of CANTV, 
while the GOV has 6% share. 
 
-------------------------------- 
... But Ready for the Referendum 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) CANTV communications official Amado Fugett told 
poloff August 12 the accusations against his company amounted 
to nothing more than \"political noise.\"  Fugett said CANTV 
had made some adjustments at the CNE\'s request based on the 
concerns expressed by the GOV and Chavez supporters.  He said 
the company hosted National Assembly deputies, 
telecommunications regulatory officials, and military 
officers to review the setup at CANTV\'s two operations 
centers that will be used during the referendum.  Tests of 
the system have been successful, he said, and it will be 
ready for the August 15 referendum. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) CANTV and Verizon have reason to be concerned by the 
GOV\'s threats and accusations.  In a television interview 
August 10, VP Rangel said he \"never agreed with the 
privatization of the telecommunications sector.\"  Still, the 
GOV is unlikely to use the referendum as an immediate pretext 
for nationalizing CANTV.  More likely, the GOV is laying the 
groundwork to cry CANTV foul and contest the results if 
Chavez loses the referendum.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S VIEWS ON VENEZUELA\'S REFERENDUM 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles S. Shapiro for reason 1.4 (d) 
 
1. (C)  By law, the Venezuelan recall referendum campaign 
ends August 12 at midnight.  Eighteen months ago the idea 
that Venezuelans could determine their own future through the 
ballot box seemed a dream, if not a mirage.  On August 15 
record numbers of Venezuelans will go to the polls and make 
their voices heard.  The credit for this democratic and 
mostly peaceful outcome belongs to the Venezuelan people, 
supported by the OAS, Carter Center, and the USG and other 
governments. 
 
2. (C)  The United States can be proud of the role we have 
played.  We have used our influence bilaterally and through 
the OAS and Group of Friends to help bring about a peaceful, 
democratic, constitutional and electoral solution.  We have 
worked to strengthen democratic institutions.  We have 
discouraged those who would use shortcuts, and above all have 
pressured the Chavez administration to play by the rules 
established in the Venezuelan constitution.  We have resisted 
Chavez\'s repeated efforts to bilateralize the referendum. 
Polling data is contradictory, and there are serious 
questions about the reliability of the polls.  Both sides 
explain with equal conviction how they are winning.  It is 
now up to the Venezuelan voters to make their voices heard. 
 
3. (C)  The Government and its majority on the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) have done everything they could to 
make it difficult for international observers to do their 
jobs.  The OAS and Carter Center have negotiated what they 
consider to be minimally acceptable conditions.  Only this 
morning did the Carter Center obtain all of the credentials 
and the unrestricted access it needs in order to do its job. 
If the Opposition wins by a narrow margin, the government 
will do everything it can to move one or two percent of the 
vote from Si to No.  There will be tremendous pressure on the 
OAS and Carter Center observers to bless the process even if 
it is flawed.  I spoke August 10 with former Argentine 
President Alfonsn and former Costa Rican President Carrazo. 
Both were already dismissing concerns of the Carter Center 
technical experts as the sort of normal background noise one 
sees in any election.  Their attitude makes the role of Jimmy 
Carter that much more important. 
 
4. (C)  The polls close at 4:00 pm EDT, but they will stay 
open until all of those in line at 4:00 cast their vote.  The 
CNE has committed to releasing preliminary results by 7:00 
pm.  The Carter Center and OAS technical experts should have 
their quick counts by then and are prepared to act if the 
CNE,s numbers vary significantly from their own. 
 
5. (C)  There is a chance of violence both from the victors 
and from the losers no matter what the outcome.  We have 
reviewed our security posture, issued a Public Announcement 
to American citizens, and battened down the hatches. 
 
6. (C)  The Opposition has worked wonders to get this far. 
It has directed its campaign to those already committed to 
the Opposition, attacking Chavez for all of his shortcomings, 
for polarizing the nation, and for his authoritarian style of 
governing.  Those messages worked well enough to get them 
through the reparos and they are sticking with what got them 
here.  They have developed a platform that tells people 
generally what they would do if they were to govern the 
country, but they have not been successful in conveying it to 
the voters in specific terms. 
 
7. (C)  Chavez has campaigned both to his supporters and to 
the undecided voters.  Using the entire government machinery 
- and intimidation and retaliation - his campaign has reached 
every corner of the country and is directed at convincing 
voters that their lives will be better and their children\'s 
future better by sticking with him rather than taking a leap 
of faith with the Opposition.  Chavez\'s repeated vitriolic 
attacks on the United States in his press conference today 
makes me wonder if he is not doing as well as he says he is. 
 
8. (C)  The voters go to the polls Sunday to chose between 
two very clear options.  For the Opposition to win, the most 
respected polling organizations would have to be wrong.  For 
Chavez to win, he will have to win more votes than he has in 
any past election; the newly registered voters, and the most 
 
marginalized of the poor in the shantytowns and remote rural 
settlements would have turn out in greater numbers than they 
ever have.  The imponderables include the weather, the 
willingness of voters to endure long lines, the reliability 
of new fingerprinting checking and touch-screen voting 
machines, whether there is fraud, and if so, the ability of 
the international observers to detect and act upon this 
fraud. This recall referendum is too close to call.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelans will vote August 15 on whether to recall 
President Hugo Chavez.  If the opposition wins, it plans to 
hold primaries to pick a candidate and then battle Chavez 
again in presidential elections.  Though removed from office, 
Chavez will still lead the country\'s largest political 
movement and expects to have the full support of the 
Venezuelan state to wage his campaign.  If Chavez wins the 
recall referendum, it will be a mortal blow to the 
opposition\'s current political leadership.  Chavez the victor 
will likely strike a conciliatory tone initially to attract a 
loyal opposition from the remains of the opposition, but will 
continue to persecute symbolic opposition.  The legitimacy of 
the victory for either side is crucial, making fraud 
allegations and the margin of victory key variables in how 
the results are accepted by the Venezuelan people.  Although 
the Constitution speaks of an election 30 days after the 
President leaves office, it is unlikely that the National 
Electoral Council will be able to stage one in such a short 
period of time.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
If The Opposition Wins ... 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) If the \"Si\" vote wins in the August 15 presidential 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez, the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) must, according to the constitution, 
hold convoke elections within 30 days.  Given the logistical 
requirements for such an election, the date is likely to slip 
up to 90 days.  The opposition plans to hold a presidential 
primary to select its candidate.  Although close to agreement 
on rules and a date for the primary, both are still under 
discussion. 
 
3. (C) The opposition will seek to maintain its united front 
against Chavez throughout the campaign, and will not field 
multiple candidates to face Chavez in the new election. 
Coordinadora Democratica (CD) leader and Miranda State 
Governor Enrique Mendoza is the front-runner.  If the 
opposition\'s candidate wins that election, he or she would 
complete the presidential term through 2006.  The new 
president would face the challenge of forming a government 
out of a diverse opposition, reuniting a deeply divided 
society, re-energizing an economy addicted to high oil 
revenues and unsustainable social spending, and reforming a 
Venezuelan state corrupted by five years of Chavez\'s 
Bolivarian Revolution. 
 
4. (C) If Chavez loses the referendum, he will be politically 
wounded and stripped of his claim to represent Venezuela\'s 
majority.  His control over four of the five branches of 
government (legislative, judicial, moral, and electoral) and 
leadership of Venezuela\'s largest political party, the Fifth 
Republic Movement (MVR), however, will give him room to 
maneuver and possibly negotiate with the opposition.  Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel would become president and is 
likely to continue to give Chavez complete support of the 
Venezuelan state.  Some note, however, that Rangel\'s personal 
ambition may temper his support for a beaten Chavez.  Though 
the Supreme Court (TSJ) has not definitely ruled that a 
recalled Chavez can run immediately in the new election, most 
politicians believe Chavez will be permitted to run.  TSJ 
President Ivan Rincon told the Ambassador in late 2003 that 
since the Constitution does not explicitly say a recalled 
President cannot run he should be allowed to do so.  He also 
thought it essential for political reasons. 
 
5. (C) If the opposition wins by a thin margin, political 
uncertainty will be heightened.  A voting system failure 
could have similar consequences if results are delayed more 
than 48 hours.  Chavez could react as he did during the 
November signature drive and claim the opposition had engaged 
 
in \"megafraud.\"  Chavez supporters have already set the stage 
for this accusation by suggesting that CANTV, Venezuela\'s 
privatized national telephone carrier, is capable of 
manipulating election data during transmission.  If Chavez 
supporters perceive they are losing the referendum due to 
fraud, there is likely to be some violence by Chavez 
supporters, both in the streets and against opposition 
targets such as media outlets. 
 
------------------ 
If Chavez Wins ... 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) If the \"No\" option wins, Chavez will probably call for 
reconciliation in the wake of his victory and try to reach a 
modus vivendi with some opposition parties.  Rumors have some 
opposition politicians already negotiating with Chavez. 
Chavez insiders predict that Chavez will make changes in the 
cabinet and moderate his rhetoric.  Such overtures are likely 
to be short-lived (as experienced post-April 2002), however, 
and Chavez will likely return to his persecution of key 
opposition figures (such as the NGO Sumate, former PDVSA 
managers, and Baruta Mayor Enrique Capriles).  Chavez will 
have political momentum going into the regional elections, 
and could win key gubernatorial and mayoral offices.  With a 
vanquished domestic opposition, Chavez will have a free hand 
to develop his foreign policy of challenging the USG, free 
trade, and globalization.  He will characterize his victory 
as a defeat for the United States and the imperialism he 
believes it represents, and will become more outspoken. 
 
7. (C) The leadership of the political parties, whom 
anti-Chavistas will blame for the loss, will suffer a mortal 
blow.  The Coordinadora Democratica is likely to cease to 
exist in its present form.  A new wave of opposition leaders 
will then have less than two years to regroup for a 2006 
presidential bid.  A few opposition politicians may answer 
Chavez\'s call for reconciliation or, at least, lessen their 
resolve to oppose him.  The opposition would also be 
fractured going into regional elections, perhaps costing them 
key positions throughout the country.  In sum, the opposition 
would endure its dark night, but could still recover in time 
to challenge Chavez in 2006 if they can generate fresh 
leadership. 
 
8. (C) If Chavez\'s victory comes via fraud or, more likely, 
manipulation by the GOV, the opposition would cry foul. 
Radicals in the Democratic Bloc would call for resistance to 
the GOV, and probably some civic groups and Coordinadora 
member groups would promote demonstrations and street 
blockades.  This type of resistance to a suspicious or clean 
win by the GOV would fizzle out.  A tainted victory would 
undermine Chavez\'s democratic credentials before the 
international community. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) An opposition victory would mean one more round of 
elections for Venezuela in which Chavez could yet again 
return to power.  The aftermath of an opposition victory 
would be fraught with challenges, and in many ways would 
present daunting challenges for governance.  There is 
concern, for example, about how institutions that have become 
accustomed to the centralized authority of President Chavez 
would behave.  If Chavez wins the referendum, Venezuela\'s 
crisis will continue to fester, especially if Chavez 
maintains his divisive leadership.  The referendum is a 
critical juncture for Venezuela, but it is just the beginning 
for finding real resolution of Venezuela\'s deeply-divided 
society.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) As the campaigns for the Presidential recall 
referendum closed August 12, supporters and opponents of 
President Hugo Chavez celebrated, each claiming future 
victory.  Chavez said he would extend dialog invitations to 
opposition leaders who accepted his victory and said he would 
step down if he lost.  The National Electoral Council (CNE) 
will audit one percent of the voting machines chosen at 
random August 15 and limit observers\' access to the vote 
tallying room.  Patria Para Todos (PPT) Secretary General 
Jose Albornoz, who supports Chavez, told poloff August 13 
that Chavez would win the referendum by 10 percentage points. 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza and Primero Justica 
President and assemblyman Julio Borges told the Ambassador 
they were confident the \"Si\" would win the referendum.  With 
the referendum just a couple of days away, Chavez criticized 
the U.S. August 12, alleging a plot against him/Venezuela. He 
told reporters that the battle was between the Bush 
administration and the Venezuelan people.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
Campaigns Close 
--------------- 
 
2. (U) Hundreds of thousands of opponents of President Hugo 
Chavez marched down Caracas highways to attend the opposition 
Coordinadora Democratica campaign closing August 12.  Smaller 
opposition gatherings occurred in four other states outside 
the capital.  Chavez supporters also gathered to celebrate 
the end of the \"No\" campaign throughout Venezuela on August 
12.  In Caracas, President Hugo Chavez told supporters during 
his campaign closing remarks that he was confident he would 
win.  He stated that on August 16, he would begin discussions 
with opposition leaders who were willing to acknowledge his 
victory.  Vice-president Jose Vincente Rangel also told 
reporters that a dialog was possible beginning August 16 but 
noted that a dialog did not mean an agreement.  Rangel made 
clear that while he was willing to listen to the opposition 
leaders\' concerns, the dialog would not include any 
discussions about sharing power.  President Chavez swore 
during his closing remarks that if he were to somehow lose 
the referendum, he would hand over the reins to VP Rangel, 
take a small vacation, and return to work after he was 
elected in the presidential election that would occur 30 days 
later. 
 
------------------------------- 
Private Media Faces Inspections 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (U)  The National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) 
inspected four private television without warning August 13. 
Minister of Information Jesse Chacon, speaking from 
Miraflores Palace to reporters as the inspections were 
concluding, claimed the \"routine and legal\" inspections were 
intended to confirm satellite and microwave transmission 
frequencies because of the high demand for such frequencies 
expected during election weekend.  When the inspections 
began, the Conatel personnel told reporters they were there 
only on a routine inspection.  CNE director told Globovision 
that \"only a fool (pendejo)\" would believe that the 
inspections were not related to the referendum. 
 
4.  (U) Chacon said Conatel would monitor media transmissions 
during the election to ensure they stayed within their 
assigned frequencies.  Globovision director Alberto Federico 
Ravell said the inspections were unusual coming only 48 hours 
before the referendum.  Ravell also said it was a surprise 
for the visits to be unannounced since the media stations 
have been in contact with Conatel all week.  The inspections 
were suspended, and the officials left abruptly without 
executing the proper legal paperwork. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
Information Minister Releases Polls 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Minister of Information Jesse Chacon told reporters 
August 13 that two polls showed Chavez winning the 
referendum.  Chacon said a poll from McDonough firm in 
Washington showed an eight percent lead.  A Seijas poll, he 
added, also gave the GoV reasons for celebration.  Chacon 
noted it is against electoral law after the end of the 
campaign to release poll data, a detail he skirted with a 
grin by not giving exact figures. 
 
---------- 
CNE Action 
---------- 
 
6. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) clarified the 
rules for the post-referendum audit, the role of the armed 
force\'s \"Plan Republica\", and the role of observers in the 
vote tallying room on August 12.  The CNE agreed that a CNE 
auditing commission would audit 1% of the voting machines, to 
be chosen at random at 1 p.m. on August 15.  After an Army 
General reportedly announced that military personnel would 
watch closely how people voted August 12, CNE vice-president 
Ezequiel Zamora reminded reporters the military working \"Plan 
Republica\" was not in charge of directing the voting process 
for the referendum and asked General Julio Quintero Viloria 
to distribute the electronic voting machines that were still 
located on military bases to legitimate voting centers. 
Zamora said \"Plan Republica\" was subject to the CNE\'s rules 
and decisions and could not interfere in the voting process. 
Zamora said \"the CNE has the ultimate authority in electoral 
material\" and \"they (Plan Republica) should maintain 
sufficient distance from the voting machines\". 
 
7. (C) CNE director Oscar Battaglini said the role of the 
referendum observers had its limits, and the observers would 
not be allowed into the rooms where the votes were tallied 
during a meeting with 150 international observers on August 
12. Organization of American States (OAS) mission leader 
Edgardo Ries told poloff August 10 the OAS had insisted in 
their written agreement on access to the totalization room, 
but the CNE demurred.  Ries changed the text of the agreement 
to include access to \"the totalization process.\"  Ries said 
he expected to have observers in or around the totalization 
room when necessary. 
 
8. (U) CNE President Francisco Carrasquero took time from his 
referendum work August 13 to participate in the presentation 
of an academic book he had written.  Carrasquero told 
reporters he would address the nation (in \"cadena\") on 
Saturday night to assure Venezuelans the vote would take 
place without incident.  Speaking to reporters afterwards, 
Carrasquero said that if the vote is close, results may not 
be ready to announce on August 15 and speculated that voting 
may continue until after midnight. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Chavez Supporter Predicts Victory 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Patria Para Todos (PPT) Secretary General Jose 
Albornoz told poloff August 13 that Chavez would win the 
referendum by 10 percentage points.  Albornoz said the 
opposition had committed several errors, especially on the 
regional level, during the campaign, and had changed focus 
three times.  He said the first priority for the government 
would be to build \"bridges of money\" (\"puentes de plata\") to 
the defeated opposition.  Albornoz hopes that AD would come 
to an understanding with the GoV to re-energize the National 
Assembly. 
 
-------------------- 
Pollster\'s Viewpoint 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) Consultant and pollster Alfredo Keller told poloff he 
was concerned about the high level of undecided voters that 
were showing up so close to voting day on August 12.  While 
he admitted that most of the undecided voters favor the 
opposition, he was not sure that they would turn out to vote. 
 He also pointed out that another way people hid their votes, 
in addition to saying they are undecided, is to lie 
altogether about their preferences.  Keller was sanguine 
about the opposition\'s prospects in Zulia and Carabobo 
States, where there is only a nine percent difference between 
the opposition and government. 
 
---------------------------- 
Opposition Exudes Confidence 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) The Ambassador had lunch with Enrique Mendoza, 
Alberto Quiros Corradi, Enrique Naime, Humberto Calderon 
Berti, Hiram Gaviria, Francisco Diez, Rabbi Pynchas Brener 
and various ambassadors August 13.  The purpose of the 
Coordinadora Democratica event was to give the ambassadors an 
opportunity to talk to Mendoza.  All opposition attendees 
were pleased with the campaign march August 12, saying that 
between 660,000 and 1 million people attended making it the 
largest march ever, even larger than April 11.  Mendoza cited 
polls and tracking data on the rise at the expense of the 
\"No\" vote.  Mendoza also asserted the vote is now 45.2% for 
\"Si\" and 42% for \"No\" with the rest undecided. 
 
12. (C)  Primero Justica (PJ) President and Deputy Julio 
Borges told the Ambassador August 13 he was confident Chavez 
would be recalled.  Borges was concerned, however, that there 
was no understanding between the government and the 
opposition in the event there are technical difficulties or 
violence breaks out on August 15, which Borges feared was a 
possibility.  The lack of dialog between the Chavez 
supporters and opposition leaders, Borges said, made 
Venezuelans more dependent on former President Jimmy Carter 
and the OAS to mediate and do so quickly if problems arise. 
Borges also said he was surprised by how close the polls say 
the votes are because it is not a reflection of what Primero 
Justicia has observed during their extensive campaigns 
throughout the country where they saw an overwhelming \"Si\" 
majority.  Borges said that a higher voter turnout would 
favor Chavez and increase the risk of a technical system 
failure or violence.  He noted that regardless of who wins 
the referendum, the country must be reunited, which means the 
winner must acknowledge the right of the losing side to exist 
and begin discussions. 
 
-------------------------- 
Chavez Criticizes the U.S. 
-------------------------- 
 
13. (U) With the referendum just a couple of days away, 
Chavez criticized the U.S., its plot against him/Venezuela, 
and told reporters at a Miraflores Palace press conference on 
August 12 that the battle was between the Bush administration 
and the Venezuelan people. Chavez again accused the Bush 
administration of financing the opposition and intervening in 
Venezuela.  Chavez criticized Secretary Powell saying that 
Powell had no right to lay conditions for the recognition of 
the results of the referendum.  Chavez told his audience 
during the 4 hour press conference, \"We do not expect much 
from Washington, and it doesn\'t really matter just to us, but 
rather the whole world, because that government (U.S.) has 
become the number one enemy of the world, number one.\"

----------------------------------- 
SUMMARY 
----------------------------------- 
1.      With the referendum just a couple of days away, 
on August 12, President Chavez held a marathon (four- 
hour-long) press conference for foreign and 
international press.  Chavez took every opportunity to 
criticize the U.S., its plots against him/Venezuela, 
and, more importantly, to tell his audience that the 
true battle was between the Bush administration and the 
Venezuelan people.  The pro-Chavez printed and 
electoral media picked up the accusations on the front 
page, the latter opening with various articles, among 
them one entitled \"Bush Will Be Defeated: a sovereign 
country or a colony, that is the question.\"  The 
opposition press also included articles on the 
accusations but several preferred to highlight Chavez\' 
promise to turn over the government if the referendum 
won.  End Summary 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
CHAVEZ QUESTIONS SECRETARY POWELL\'S AUTHORITY TO SET 
CONDITIONS 
----------------------------------- 
2.  The first question by Jose Carlos Villanueva, \"El 
Mundo de Espaa,\" asked for official collaboration of 
allegations contained in an article on CIA plots 
against Chavez. 
 
3.  President Chavez\' response is extremely lengthy, 
excerpts follow:  \". . . We have received some recent 
declarations from Washington with attention and 
interest; at least it looks like they are reasoning 
with a certain level of intelligence, a recognition of 
a reality, even as they continue to throw out some 
ideas of trampling the sovereignty of Venezuela; or 
they really want to trample it [referring to an alleged 
State document which alludes to softening of U.S. 
policy toward Chavez]. It\'s one thing to want to 
trample and another thing for a sovereign country to 
allow itself to be trampled. At this moment, so that I 
might respond to your question, it would not surprise 
me at all and we are always alert on this front, but at 
this time I have no proof, that is outstanding proof, 
to prove this, so that my government could affirm it, 
so that we and I can affirm it, that the CIA is making 
plans.  In fact you published the fact that they were 
in Chile [referring to media stories of the CIA 
director in Chile \"allegedly\" making plans against 
Chavez]. I read the remarks of a Chilean official 
denying everything. I believe. I am sure that the 
Government of Chile would not allow itself to be used 
as a launching pad to attack Venezuela.  I am sure.\" 
 
4.  \"Nonetheless, it would surprise me and I repeat we 
are always on the alert to the activities of the CIA in 
Venezuela. They have many ways.  The government of the 
United States independently from the CIA as a body, as 
an interventionist and imperialist arm has been 
intervening in Venezuela and we have denounced it, each 
time we have had proof of the gross intervention of Mr. 
Bush in Venezuela. The financing, for example of coup 
groups, the financing of what they call groups that are 
working for democracy, it is not that they are working 
for democracy but they are working toward 
destabilization, they have been working toward 
disavowing our constitution.\" 
 
5.  \"The Bush administration, and we have proof, 
documents, has been financing and spending millions of 
dollars to finance the Venezuelan opposition, in fact 
for this referendum, for the collection of signatures, 
to try to set up parallel bodies to the institutions of 
the State.  He has supported the Venezuelan opposition 
in many ways.   That is to say, the Bush administration 
will be defeat this Sunday.  I believe that they are 
trying to wash their hands so that they do not have to 
shoulder that defeat.  I have always said that the 
Venezuelan people\'s real confrontation in Venezuela it 
is not with the opposition.  This opposition has a 
master who is called Mister George W. Bush.  It is from 
there that the opposition is controlled.  This Sunday 
in truth [the question] is not, will Chavez go or will 
Chavez stay?  What is really being played is whether 
Venezuela will continue as a Sovereign State with a 
national plan, a plan of comprehensive development or 
will Venezuela again turn into a colony receiving 
orders from Washington. This is what is being debated 
in Venezuela.  The government of the United States, as 
they say, and their own words have confirmed it; high 
officials of the Bush administration have recently 
acknowledged, that here in Latin America, that yes they 
 
 
have been financing the opposition.  Brazenly they have 
acknowledged it, they violated our laws and the gross 
meddling is permanent.\" 
 
6.  \"Just yesterday, Mr. Powell was saying that they 
[the U.S.] would recognize the results of the 
referendum.  Who is this Mr. Powell so that he can lay 
conditions for the recognition of the results of the 
referendum?  Venezuela has its institutions, has its 
people, we do not need any conditions and, we not only 
don\'t need them, we absolutely reject and categorically 
reject them.  The conditions are set by our 
Constitution, in our laws and criteria, the rules, 
which have dictated the electoral arbiter, the 
Venezuelan institutionalism, the National Electoral 
Council.\"  The response continued. 
 
----------------------------------- 
EXPECTATIONS OF U.S. - NONE FOR THIS NUMBER ONE ENEMY 
OF THE WORLD 
----------------------------------- 
7.  President Chavez took every opportunity to 
criticize the U.S. (Bush/CIA/military) and highlight 
the \"fact\" that the Bush administration \"is controlling 
and bankrolling the opposition.\"  At one point he also 
said,  \"We do not expect much from Washington, and it 
doesn\'t really matter just to us, but rather the whole 
world, because that government (U.S.) has become the 
number one enemy of the world, number one.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
 THOMAS JEFFERSON ALSO THE \"DEVIL\"? 
----------------------------------- 
8.  Looking at the historical perspective, Chavez found 
roots for the Latin American/Venezuelan clash with the 
U.S. and for U.S. imperialism.  He argues that Bolivar 
did not want to invite the U.S. to the 1829 congress in 
Panama because he \"prophesized that `The U.S. seems 
destined by fate to plague the Americas with misery in 
the name of liberty.\'\"  Chavez argued, \"He was 
justified because Monroe was calling for an America for 
the Americans and Thomas Jefferson was saying that the 
U.S. should progressively absorb all the emerging 
nations, absorbing them, swallowing them. . . so this 
liberator of the U.S. began to see us as colonies . . . 
he wanted to create an alliance and when this did not 
work, they created the Monroe doctrine.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
COMMENT 
----------------------------------- 
9. President Chavez\' accusations are not new, nearly 
every Sunday Alo Presidente program for the last six 
months criticized the Bush administration, the CIA, and 
the U.S. ambassador to Caracas.   This was Chavez\' last 
opportunity to depict the referendum as a struggle 
between the Venezuelan people and the Bush 
administration, in order to cash in on the nationalism 
of the Venezuelan audience, much more than the 134 
accredited foreign press.

1. (U) Despite reported delays in the opening of voting

Lines Are Long But People are Determined 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Despite reported delays in the opening of voting 
locations, long lines of people (between 400-1,000 people) 
waited patiently to vote in the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  Communications and Information Minister Jesse 
Chacon predicted less than 30% of those registered would 
abstain from voting.  As of 10:30 am local, 99% of the voting 
centers had opened, according to CNE director Jorge 
Rodriguez.  Several centers reported opening late (about 1 
hour and a half delay) because of the lack of operators for 
the fingerprinting machines at centers and other reasons. 
CNE directors Ezequiel Zamora and Jorge Rodriguez announced 
voting should commence with our without fingerprint machines. 
 As the morning progressed, reports of bottlenecks mostly 
from fingerprint machine delays or problems were common, and 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza urged the CNE to stop 
using the machines if they continued to cause delays. 
Rodriguez simultaneously told reporters that the CNE expected 
to resolve the problems with the fingerprint machines \"within 
the hour.\" 
 
3. (U) Former President Jimmy Carter said told reporters that 
the voting centers he had visited that morning had opened on 
time, and  voting was orderly and progress was smooth.  He 
noted there were long lines of voters waiting patiently to 
vote.  Carter said it was important for people to comply with 
the directives of the CNE and avoid early projections of the 
results because that would only deter the process.  OAS 
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria also visited numerous voting 
 
SIPDIS 
places.  As of 9:50 am local, news reports showed 
international observers invited by the CNE still in lobby of 
the Hilton Hotel in Caracas. 
 
------------------------------- 
Carrasquero Reassures Reporters 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) CNE President Francisco Carrasquero told reporters 
that the CNE still plans to release preliminary results three 
hours after polls closed and dismissed reports that the 
voting machines were emitting receipts indicating a voter 
voted \"No\" when the voter pushed the \"Si\" button. Carrasquero 
said receiving the wrong vote from the automatic voting 
machines was \"impossible.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Chavez Reassures Carter and the OAS 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) During his meeting with former President Jimmy Carter 
and Secretary General of the Organization of American States 
(OAS) Cesar Gaviria August 14, President Hugo Chavez 
guaranteed he would respect the results of the August 15 
 
 
referendum regardless who won.  As he had done in his 
marathon press conference two days earlier, Chavez told 
reporters that he invited opposition leaders to a lunch at 
the Presidential Palace on August 16 so that both sides could 
recognize the results of the referendum.  Chavez\'s message to 
the people was to vote and vote early, avoid provocations to 
violence, and rest assured that both sides would accept the 
results of the referendum.  Chavez also told Carter and 
Gaviria he was concerned about opposition leaders announcing 
preliminary results starting early on August 15.  Carter and 
Gaviria reassured him saying that opposition leaders promised 
them to wait a reasonable amount of time (3 days) for the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) to make an announcement 
before they took it upon themselves. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Special Commission for Complaints 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) CNE director Ezequiel Zamora announced the CNE\'s 
creation of a special commission to resolve complaints or 
irregularities with the accreditation process on August 14. 
Zamora said the commission hoped to resolve all the 
outstanding complaints before the voting centers opened 
August 15. The commission was formed due to the large number 
of complaints originating in 6 of Venezuela\'s states, 
including the federal district. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Salas Roemer Accuses CNE of \"Abuses\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Jumping the queue to vote in his home state of 
Carabobo, Project Venezuela leader and presidential hopeful 
Henrique Salas Roemer said he was impressed with the \"great 
happiness\" of the Venezuelan people who have come out to 
vote.  He said he has never seen such a turnout, but at the 
same time, he has never seen such abuses committed by the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) authorities.  \"The 
Venezuelan people have the right to vote,\" he said, but the 
CNE is trying to make it difficult.  Referring to the many 
people lined up at his voting center in Carabobo and chanting 
\"We want to vote,\" Salas Roemer asserted that the Venezuelan 
people have decided affirmatively to change the direction of 
the country and are ready to celebrate a victory.

Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Long Delays Cause Extended Hours 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) director Jorge 
Rodriguez announced at 1:30 p.m. that polling hours have 
officially been extended until 8 p.m.  Persons still in line 
at the official closing time would still be allowed to vote. 
Citing delays with fingerprint machines, Rodriguez said 
voters could vote first and then register their fingerprints. 
 Rodriguez said the CNE had directed the military to reorient 
lines directly to each voting table. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
CNE Launched Investigation of False Voice Recording 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (U) CNE directors Francisco Carrasquero and Rodriguez told 
reporters they had obtained a CD with Carrasquero\'s voice 
falsely announcing the recall of President Hugo Chavez. 
According to Carrasquero, the voice recording was to be 
played in a national broadcast on all radio and television 
(cadena) at 8 p.m. to cause chaos.  He announced an immediate 
investigation would be launched to uncover the perpetrator/s 
and apprehend him/them.  The recording, apparently, is the 
work of reporter Fausto Malave who has broadcast the same 
recording for the past week on a humorous Caracas radio 
station program.  Causa R deputy Andres Velasquez, speaking 
from the opposition headquarters, called the 
Carrasquero/Rodriguez accusation \"infantile.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
Embassy Officials and CODEL Observe 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C)  Emboffs and Codel Weller acting as informal observers 
found: 
 
-- most centers opened late (average delay time 1 hour and a 
half); 
 
--voter turnout overwhelmed machine capacity leading to 6-8 
hour delays in voting and a voting time of 4-10 minute per 
voter rather than the one minute lapse foreseen by the CNE; 
 
--many centers received fewer machines (voting and 
fingerprint) than they were promised and several machines 
were reported damaged; 
 
--fingerprint machine problems were the worst culprits for 
additional delays; and 
 
--voters appear to be waiting to vote patiently despite long 
delays, but tensions are mounting in the afternoon as delays 
become longer. 
 
 
5. (C) Lack of fingerprint machines or voting table workers 
caused delays in opening voting centers.  In some locations 
in Caracas, National Guard officers drafted the first few 
voters in line to work the election tables.  The voting 
process was slow in all voting centers, but some were better 
organized than others.  At a voting center with 9 voting 
machines in Caracas, only 22 people voted in 10 minutes 
around 10:30 am (average 4 minutes per voter).  At centers in 
Valencia, Maracay, and Caracas, some centers were organized 
in lines by cedula number, but still experienced long delays. 
 In a center in Maracay, Aragua State, a broken voting 
machine resulted in voters being turned away and told to 
return later.  At 2:35 p.m., the machine had not been fixed 
and no one at that particular table had voted.  In Maracaibo, 
Emboffs found fingerprint machines worked sporadically.  Some 
centers allowed the voting to continue without the 
fingerprints while others halted the process until repairs 
were made.  Various reports from Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia 
and Maracay indicated one out of three voting and fingerprint 
machines were not delivered or not working per voting center. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Carter Center Observations 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Codel Weller observers met with representatives of the 
Carter Center who reported voting centers opening late, long 
delays in voting, and dramatically different levels of 
organization at the different voting centers.  The Carter 
Center expects voting to continue until 4 a.m. August 16, but 
they also expect initial results to be announced around 8-9 
p.m. to keep tensions from rising.  Carter Center 
calculations indicate 5,000 people are voting per minute 
throughout the country, meaning that 4.1 million of the 14 
million voters registered will be able to vote in 10 hours. 
 
7. (C) The Carter Center expects the quick count to be a 
\"long slow count.\"  Voters are being allowed to vote at 
machines they are not assigned to and one ballot deposit box 
is being used per voting center rather than per machine.  For 
the Carter Center, this will make the quick count process 
very slow as they will have to resort all ballots according 
to imprinted codes.  The Carter Center representative said 
they expect up to 85% turnout. 
 
--------------- 
The Famous Vote 
---------------- 
 
8. (U) President Hugo Chavez voted a little after noon in 
Caracas in Caracas.  He reiterated his pledge to respect 
whatever result was presented by the CNE and urged the 
opposition to do the same.  Vice-President Jose Vicente 
Rangel voted shortly after mid-day in Caracas.  Rangel said, 
\"The true heroes are the Venezuelan people who have turned 
out in mass and are stoically waiting in long lines to 
exercise their right to vote.\"  Rangel said that technical 
difficulties should not take precedence over the will of the 
people.  He said he agreed with temporarily discarding the 
use of fingerprint machines if it made the process quicker. 
Jailed Baruta mayor Henrique Capriles Radonski voted at the 
headquarters of the Intelligence Police in Caracas shortly 
before 2 p.m.  Other prisoners from the same prison were also 
allowed to vote.  The president of the Catholic Venezuelan 
Conference of Bishops Archbishop Baltazar Porras voted before 
noon in the Andean city of Merida.  He praised the civic and 
peaceful attitude of the Venezuelan voters saying, \"The 
massive participation generates a greater consensus for a 
future of inclusion, brotherhood and unity.\" 
 
--------- 
Violence 
--------- 
 
9. (C) A young woman wounded by a National Guard\'s randomly 
fired gunshot in the morning of August 15 at a voting center 
 
in eastern Caracas died on the way to the hospital, according 
to press reports.  In the same part of town, pro-Chavez gangs 
later reportedly fired shots and tear gas at a voting center. 
 The Carter Center reported the incident resulted in the 
closing of the voting center where some 12,000 people were to 
vote. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Coordinadora Democratica Outlook 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Coordinadora Democratica representatives told PolOff 
that about four million voters had voted as of 4:00 p.m. 
Exit polls conducted by the Coordinadora in various states 
showed the opposition leading by wide margins in the Zulia, 
Caracas, and Miranda.  Despite their projected lead, 
Coordinadora representatives worried that the number of 
voters would be insufficient to guarantee the threshold of 
3.7 million and intended to ask the CNE to extend voting 
hours to 11:00 p.m.  Coordinadora representatives were 
working to bring water and food to those in line, some of 
whom had been waiting for more than ten hours.  Electoral 
chief Amado Dounia said seven people had been detained around 
Venezuela for conducting exit polls, though he was not sure 
whether the people continued in custody. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Coordinadora Democratica Outlines Possibilities for Fraud 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
11. (C) An opposition advisor gave Carter Center and 
Organization of American States (OAS) observers an August 14 
outline of existing and possible irregularities in the 
referendum process related to actions taken by the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) to manipulate the vote.  According to 
the opposition, there are five main problems in the process: 
1) the permanent electoral registry, 2) the fingerprinting 
machines, 3) the administration of electoral bodies, 4) 
last-minute decisions by the CNE, and 5) Plan Republica. 
 
12. (C) The opposition faults the CNE for closing the 
national registry July 10, which was not 60 days before the 
electoral event as called for in the Organic Electoral Law, 
and for not publishing the registry in a timely manner.  The 
opposition also criticizes the CNE for irregularities in the 
assignment of voting centers for various individuals and for 
leaving some voters off the registry altogether.  As for the 
fingerprinting machines, the opposition notes that there is 
no oversight of the technology of the machines, and they 
could easily produce \"false matches\" to disenfranchise 
potential voters.  The opposition continues to question the 
secrecy of the vote with the fingerprinting machines and also 
notes that the Organic Electoral Law only allows for the use 
of a Venezuelan identification card (la cedula) to identify a 
voter. 
 
13. (C) In addition to the government\'s control over the CNE, 
pro-government entities control everything from the regional 
CNE offices to the electoral tables.  Last minute decisions 
by the CNE - regarding additional tables, manual voting 
cards, and additional \"blank\" voting books for military 
personnel - could also affect the vote in favor of the 
government.   Finally, the opposition claims that under the 
current Plan Republica, the CNE has given military personnel 
functions that should normally fall to civilian 
administrators.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelan National Electoral Council President 
Francisco Carrasquero announced August 16 that preliminary 
results showed 58% of voters chose not to revoke President 
Chavez.  Opposition leaders rejected the result, claiming 
their exit polls showed that 59% voted in favor of 
revocation.  International observers have yet to weigh in 
officially, but Carter Center representative Francisco Diez 
told the Ambassador that the results of their quick count 
coincide with the official preliminary results.  The 
Coordinadora Democratica headquarters was attacked with tear 
gas during the night, and workers at Sumate left their 
offices temporarily for a number of hours when secret police 
(DISIP) personnel deployed near their building.  The OAS and 
Carter Center planned a press conference at 11:30 AM.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
GOV ANNOUNCES A RESOUNDING VICTORY 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Long, slow-moving lines characterized the voting on 
Sunday.  The polls were originally set to open at 6:00 AM and 
close at 4:00 PM, but the sluggish process prompted the CNE 
to extend the closing first to 8:00 PM, and a second time 
until midnight.  Centers were required to remain open as long 
as voters were in line, and press reports indicate that votes 
were cast as late as 1:30 AM. 
 
3. (U) National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero announced at 3:47 AM local time August 16 on 
national TV, that nearly 5 million people had voted not/not 
to revoke President Chavez from office, while nearly 3.6 
million voted to revoke.  He stated that this represented 
results from over 94% of all automated voting centers. 
Chavez appeared to a crowd of his followers at the 
Presidential palace shortly after, claiming a \"clean, 
transparent and resounding victory,\" calling it \"gift for 
Bush\" that landed in the \"nerve center of the White House.\" 
He characterized the result as \"a victory that transcends the 
Venezuelan borders, and is also a victory for all Latin 
America.\"  He was conciliatory toward the opposition, 
inviting \"our brothers, come with us to this new period of 
moving forward and reconciliation.\" 
 
4. (C) Chavez then thanked international observers from many 
countries (including the U.S.), as well as the OAS and the 
Carter Center, implying that they supported the result.  At 
2:00 AM on August 16, Francisco Diez of the Carter Center 
(CC) told the Ambassador that the Carter Center\'s quick count 
(based on printed summaries from a limited number of centers 
where observers were present) matched the official 
preliminary results announced by Carrasquero.  The CC has not 
made a public announcement.  The OAS has not yet provided 
information, publicly or privately.  Gaviria and Carter are 
supposed to give a press conference at mid-day, August 16. 
As of noon, it has not started. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Sumate Briefs on Its Numbers late August 15 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) At 9:00 PM on August 15, Sumate representatives 
briefed the Ambassador and CODEL Weller and then the Carter 
Center and the OAS on their projections for the referendum 
results.  According to Sumate, the opposition had won 59% of 
the vote.  Sumate reported collecting data from 20,000 people 
from over 300 centers throughout the country.  Based on their 
data, approximately 7 million people voted by 7:30 PM August 
15 and about 8.5 to 9 million people would vote by night\'s 
end.  Their exit polls suggested that the \"Si\" vote garnered 
 
 
5.2 million votes, or 1.4 million more than the minimum 
required to revoke President Chavez.  Sumate representative 
Roberto Abdul told Chairman Weller and the Ambassador that 
Sumate feared that the government would commit fraud in the 
night and release false projections by morning.  Sumate 
presented a more detailed briefing to the CC and OAS at 11:00 
PM August 15.  Sumate\'s initial report given to the 
Ambassador and the international observers also criticized 
the CNE for the extraordinary delays in the voting process 
caused by the insufficient number of voting centers and 
tables at each center, the unnecessary use of the 
fingerprinting machines, and the last-minute changes in 
electoral officials at various voting centers. 
 
-------------------------------mRa(quCoordina tor leader Henry Ramos Allup 
 
publicly rejected the CNE\'s preliminary results in favor of 
\"No\" announced early August 16.  Referring to data collected 
by Sumate, which showed the \"Si\" campaign winning, Ramos said 
that the opposition numbers were exactly opposite of those 
announced by the electoral body.  He pointed out that for the 
CNE\'s numbers to be right, the opposition would have 
collected fewer votes in the referendum than it did 
signatures to convoke the referendum.  He expressed 
solidarity with the opposition-affiliated CNE members Sobella 
Mejias and Ezequiel Zamora, who denounced CNE President 
Carrasquero\'s preliminary results.  While Ramos Allup 
denounced the CNE for committing fraud, he did not call 
opposition supporters to the streets in protest.  Instead, he 
said the opposition would fight this peacefully, 
democratically and constitutionally.  He ended his statement 
noting that the opposition had shown their data to the 
international observer missions of the OAS and Carter Center 
and hoped they would acknowledge their version of the facts. 
 
------------------------------ 
COORDINADORA OFFICE TEARGASSED 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Daniel Thiman, aide to Miranda state Governor Enrique 
Mendoza, told poloff August 16 the Coordinadora\'s campaign 
headquarters in eastern Caracas was attacked with tear gas 
during the night.  Thiman said the gas forced the occupants 
to evacuate; he described the aftermath as \"very confusing.\" 
He said they believe the gas was launched from a street which 
runs just below the side wall of the Coordinadora\'s compound. 
 Thiman said he walked for several blocks with his wife away 
from the compound and finally got his car and returned home. 
He said National Guard troops had also been spotted close to 
a nearby opposition building before midnight.  Coordinadora 
representative Carlos Figueredo Planchart told Polcouns that 
members of the political police (DISIP) had also gone to the 
offices of the organization Sumate during the night.  The 
police deployment, Figueredo said, forced Sumate to evacuate 
its offices temporarily. 
 
8. (U) President Carter will meet with Ambassadors of the 
Group of Friends countries at 1700.

1. (U) In a press conference August 16, former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter and Organization of American States (OAS) 
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria announced that the results of 
 
SIPDIS 
their quick count coincide with the results announced by the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) giving President Chavez a 
victory in the referendum.  Coordinadora Democratica leader 
Alberto Quiros Corradi acknowledged the pronouncements by the 
Carter Center and OAS, but questioned the discrepancy between 
Sumate\'s exit polls and the quick counts.  Quiros insisted on 
an audit of the voters\' paper receipts.  National Electoral 
Council (CNE) Director Jorge Rodriguez denied opposition 
claims of tampering with the voting machine software and 
recalled that opposition representatives were present at all 
stages of the software process.  Representatives of Sumate 
said they had \"serious doubts\" that the will of the 
Venezuelan had been respected in the referendum at a press 
conference at 4:15 p.m.  Although the morning was quiet in 
Caracas, there were small demonstrations in the afternoon. 
At one, eight people were reportedly injured by gunfire, 
including opposition congressman Alvarado, and one woman was 
killed.  End Summary.

Carter Center and OAS Confirm CNE Results 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In a press conference August 16, former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter and Organization of American States (OAS) 
Secretary General Cesar Gaviria announced that the results of 
 
SIPDIS 
their quick count coincide with the results announced by the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) giving President Chavez a 
victory in the referendum.  The international observers noted 
that more than 10 million Venezuelans voted. According to 
Carter, the international observer missions worked together 
to conduct a quick count, using a methodology they have used 
in many other countries.  After auditing the data from the 
voting machines (actas) from 192 tables, their quick count 
matched almost exactly with the CNE\'s results.  Carter 
confirmed that he was in the totalization room at 1:00 a.m. 
with all five directors of the CNE. 
 
3. (U) Carter said Sumate also did a quick count based on the 
same voting machine data and showed 55% for \"No\" and 45% for 
\"Si,\" which was very close to the Carter Center and OAS 
results.  Gaviria said that they are getting closer to the 
exact results, and there is a clear tendency in favor of 
\"No.\"  Gaviria noted that in addition to the quick counts, 
the Venezuelan system allows for another type of control: the 
physical ballots.  Carter said the physical ballots would be 
available to be counted.  According to Gaviria, \"it would be 
very difficult to manipulate the numbers.\"  He said he 
understood that some might doubt about the results, but that 
is different from having evidence of fraud.  So far, he said, 
there has been no evidence of fraud in the referendum. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Opposition Calls for Count of Paper Ballots 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Coordinadora Democratica leader Alberto Quiros Corradi 
acknowledged the pronouncements by the Carter Center and OAS, 
but questioned the discrepancy between Sumate\'s exit polls 
and the quick counts.  According to Sumate exit polls, the 
\"Si\" vote had won a majority.  Quiros Corradi noted that 
there could be two explanations for the discrepancy: the 
numbers were manipulated in the transmission of the data, or 
the machine data does not reflect the physical votes in the 
ballot boxes.  Therefore, he said, the opposition is 
 
 
insisting on a count of the paper ballots.  He said at least 
180 ballot boxes selected at random should be counted and 
compared against the corresponding voting machine data (the 
actas).  He called on the international community and the 
international observers to ensure that the CNE counts the 
ballot boxes, saying that the opposition has \"reasonable 
doubt.\"  \"The only way to know the truth is to go to the 
boxes,\" he concluded. 
 
------------------------- 
CNE Releases More Results 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez announced the \"No\" 
carried all but two states (Miranda and Tachira) and the 
federal district of Caracas.  Rodriguez said the overwhelming 
75 percent turnout of registered voters -- a record for 
Venezuela -- was the main reason for delays in voting lines. 
He said statistics showed the fingerprint machines were 
responsible for only short delays in the morning; six million 
fingerprints were taken for use in future elections. 
Rodriguez recognized that the voting table procedure caused 
most delays and called for it to be re-designed to 
accommodate the pace of electronic voting.  He also said the 
distribution of voting centers needs to be re-engineered to 
be more democratic and better accommodate voters in poor 
areas. 
 
6. (U) Rodriguez denied opposition claims of tampering with 
the software for the voting machines and recalled that 
opposition representatives were present at all stages of the 
software process.  He said he would welcome further audits as 
proposed by the opposition if it would lead to increased 
tranquillity and but not as a basis for building a fraud 
case.  He reminded the opposition that it was they who pushed 
for quick counts from the OAS and Carter Center and for a 
quick release of results by the CNE, something he said 
opposition leaders are now complaining about. 
 
------------------------ 
Sumate Expresses Doubts 
------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Representatives of Sumate said they had \"serious 
doubts\" the will of the Venezuelan had been respected in the 
referendum at a press conference at 4:15 p.m.  Enrique 
Palacios said Sumate had conducted exit polls in 300 voting 
centers throughout the day on August 15, resulting in a 59-41 
tendency in favor of the opposition (with 20,382 interviews). 
 Despite the statistical validity of this sample, he said, 
Sumate\'s quick count of tally sheets (actas) showed a 55-45 
tendency in favor of the GOV.  Citing one center in a 
pro-opposition area of Caracas with 2,734 voters, Palacios 
said their exit poll showed an 85-percent lead, but the final 
acta showed only a 53-percent lead.  Further, Palacios noted 
that 1,750 persons registered to this center had signed the 
petitions against President Hugo Chavez, but the final acta 
showed only 905 \"yes\" votes.  Maria Corina Machado proposed a 
statistically valid audit of all the paper receipts generated 
by the referendum.  She asked international observers to take 
immediate custody of the voter receipts to preserve their 
integrity. 
 
------------------------------ 
Protests, Rallies and Violence 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Opposition groups closed a major avenue in Caracas and 
opposition leaders are calling for rallies in several parts 
of the city, but the turnout is small.  In Plaza Altamira, 
the site of previous opposition protests, several Chavez 
supporters on motorcycles began to fire upon a crowd that had 
gathered, and at least six people were injured and one woman 
was killed.  Solidaridad Deputy Ernesto Alvarenga, a former 
Chavez supporter turned opposition leader, was wounded in the 
shooting in Altamira.  A small group of protesters are still 
demonstrating outside the hotel where international observers 
 
 
from the OAS and Carter Center are staying, and where they 
have been since this morning.  Chavez supporters have 
interrupted occasionally some of Caracas\' major 
thoroughfares.  Metropolitan police directed people onto 
alternate routes.

Shooting Leaves One Dead, Recriminations

2. (U) The August 16 shooting at Plaza Francia in the 
Altamira section of Caracas left one dead and ten injured. 
Solidaridad National Assembly Deputy Ernesto Alvarenga was 
among the persons shot during the incident.  Nearly all 
Caracas daily newspapers (the exception was the pro-Chavez 
Diario Vea) had a front-page picture of the gunmen firing 
into the crowd.  The small group of Chavez opponents had 
gathered to protest the results of the recall referendum 
announced August 15 by the National Electoral Council (CNE). 
 
3. (U) President Chavez, giving a press conference to 
international reporters late August 16, blamed the violence 
on the opposition, suggesting the attack was staged by 
anti-Chavez radicals.  He said that if the gunmen were in 
fact Chavistas, then they should be punished.  (Comment:  We 
are sure that if the GoV wanted to, it could identify the 
gunmen.)  Chavez wondered how all news television channel 
Globovision was always on hand to witness the violence and 
accused the news station of trying to destabilize the 
country.  He called for action on the proposed media law that 
would make private media outlets like Globovision \"more 
responsible to the people.\"  Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel told reporters August 17 the shooters at Altamira are 
\"killers, criminals, and terrorists\" and said the President 
had ordered a complete investigation.  Leopoldo Lopez, mayor 
of Chacao municipality where the plaza is located, rejected 
Chavez\'s allegation of opposition complicity.  The mayor, 
whose 89-year-old grandfather was among the demonstrators, 
said it made no sense to think Chavez\'s opponents would 
deliberately put their relatives in harm\'s way.

Chavez Offers Olive Branch 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) During his press conference, Chavez called the 
opposition\'s 40-percent showing \"respectable\" and once again 
invited opposition leaders to negotiate with the GOV.  He 
said the opposition should accept his offer for their own 
good and for the good of all Venezuelans.  He said Vice 
President Rangel is preparing a paper for the opposition 
proposing a dialogue.  Chavez also predicted an overwhelming 
victory in the upcoming regional elections (currently 
scheduled for September 26) and announced the CNE would at 
the same time hold recall referenda on nine opposition 
deputies. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Catholic Cardinal Urges Reconciliation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Catholic Cardinal Jose Lara Castillo reportedly told 
Vatican Radio August 16 that the opposition should accept the 
results of the referendum, though a \"gigantic fraud\" had been 
 
perpetrated by the GOV.  Lara said the referendum results 
contradicted various exit polls indicating that the \"Yes\" 
option had won.  Lara accused the GoV of paying $60 to poor 
people for their votes.  The Cardinal said, however, the 
opposition should move one in the interest of soci1SQgp`lts 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Primero Justicia Deputy Liliana Hernandez August 17 
said the results of the recall referendum were fraudulent, 
and that Primero Justicia would not accept them.  She said 
international observers should safeguard the voting tickets, 
which are stored in the regional military commands at the 
moment.  Fernandez noted that in past elections requiring 
recounts, the ballots have been found in very poor condition, 
because there are no special storage locations and they are 
often exposed to the elements.  Primero Justicia Deputy Ramon 
Jose Medina suggested the opposition should attempt to create 
an institutional crisis, using mayors and governors, to force 
the Electoral Council to allow a manual recount of the 
ballots. He compared the situation in Venezuela today to that 
in Peru following the fraudulent 2000 election.

 ------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Using state finances and manipulation of the structure 
established in the media accords, President Hugo Chavez 
mounted a much more impressive campaign in the referendum 
than the opposition.  Pro-government advertising and 
propaganda filled Venezuelan newspapers, overshadowing the 
little opposition advertising to be found. The government 
hijacked the public purse to buy hundreds of pages of 
pro-Chavez, pro-\"revolutionary\" propaganda, a tactic the 
opposition could not match. On the electronic front, more 
opposition ads finally began getting through the CNE to be 
aired on private TV stations in early August, though still 
lagging behind the number of pro-Chavez ads. The opposition, 
however, had an edge in private TV and print media outlets in 
terms of editorial and opinion pieces, as well as in overall 
media coverage of the Chavez government and the referendum. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
PRINT ADVERTISING & PROPAGANDA 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) While Venezuela\'s four main private television 
channels have lost money throughout the presidential recall 
referendum campaign because of Chavez\'s use of presidential 
\"cadenas,\" most of the print media--many of them 
pro-opposition--have profited from campaign advertising and 
government \"announcements.\"  Full page color advertisements 
often run under the innocuous banner \"Venezuela: Ahora Es 
Para Todos\" (Venezuela: Now It\'s for Everyone).  At times 
warm and fuzzy, non-offensive, and not overtly-political 
(think Reagan\'s \"Morning in America\" campaign), they extol 
the virtues of the government\'s social and economic programs, 
especially the missions.  The message is clear enough: These 
benefits are brought to Venezuelans thanks to President 
Chavez.  The announcements are thinly-veiled pro-revolution 
advertisements funded by government ministries and agencies. 
 
3. (C) According to internal tracking research by El Nacional 
newspaper, the biggest government advertisers in seven 
leading newspapers are: the Ministry of the Secretary of the 
Presidency;  the National Electoral Council (whose 
advertising tends to focus on the voting process and is, 
therefore, not political in the same way as others), and 
state oil company PDVSA.  Other big spenders include the 
governments of the State of Miranda, the Office of the Mayor 
of Caracas, SENIAT (the tax authority), and the ministries of 
Finance, Energy and Mines, and Defense.  The ads covered in 
the research are not all political, but PAS monitoring 
confirms that many of the entities listed above regularly run 
ads related to the Chavez\'s anti-recall campaign. 
 
4. (C) By far the biggest beneficiary of the government\'s 
spending spree has been Ultimas Noticias, a working class 
news tabloid (in the vein of New York\'s Post or Daily News), 
which leans moderately toward the president in its editorial 
positions.  67% of the public-sector print advertising 
expenditures, for a total of almost 1,000 pages (92,500 
column centimeters) in July alone, went to Ultimas Noticias, 
according to the El Nacional research.  A senior executive of 
Cadena Capriles, which publishes Ultimas Noticias, reported 
that 75% of the company\'s July revenue ($2,083,333 at the 
official exchange rate) resulted from government advertising. 
 At this point, the executive said, Ultimas Noticias is only 
accepting these ads, turning away private-sector clients. 
 
5. (C) Other newspapers have also profited from the 
government\'s splurge on the anti-recall campaign, but to an 
exponentially lesser degree. In second place, El Universal 
 
has garnered approximately 16% of public sector advertising, 
followed by El Nacional (10%), Diario 2001, El Globo, and 
Meridiano (each with 2%), and El Mundo (1%). 
 
6. (C) PDVSA, despite being only the third most spendthrift 
public-sector advertiser, was the most notable advertiser, 
with daily, color, full-page ads in at least one newspaper, 
and usually in several.  The ads took one of two tactics: 
either PDVSA as reporter, or PDVSA as missionary.  As 
reporter, PDVSA informed the Venezuelan public about 
newsworthy events involving the president (one of his 
meetings with Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, for 
example).  This type of ad consists of a full-page ghosted 
picture of Chavez in a commanding pose or shaking the hand of 
a foreign dignitary, with a printed report over the picture. 
In the others, PDVSA promoted Chavez\'s social missions and 
the use of Venezuela\'s oil riches for \"the people.\" 
According to the El Nacional study, 72% of the oil company\'s 
July advertising ran in Ultimas Noticias, 19% in El Nacional, 
and 9% in El Universal, for a total of 137 pages. 
 
7. (C) Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta and his Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) also ran daily ads in most newspapers 
featuring the president and \"No\" slogans, often half pages in 
the broadsheets but also multiple fractionals sprinkled 
throughout a newspaper.  Compared to the pro-Chavez camp\'s 
healthy, full-color advertising campaign, the opposition\'s 
print campaign was meager at best. \"Si\" advertising appeared 
in the form of one or two small, black and white fractionals 
in each paper.  Easy to miss due to poor design and 
infrequency, the \"si\" ads were easy to miss and easy to 
forget. 
 
----------------- 
TELEVISION UPDATE 
----------------- 
 
8. (C) Private television executives charged that the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) held back most opposition TV 
advertising until the end of July.  Under the media accords 
that governed the electronic media campaign, the CNE approved 
the content of all TV ads before they went to the stations 
with the understanding that each side would have three (later 
changed to seven) minutes on each network each day, to be 
paid in credit by the CNE.  The CNE, however, approved many 
\"no\" ads  while approving only one \"si\" spot for most of the 
month of July.  The situation improved for the opposition as 
of August 10, when RCTV and Venevision received and aired 12 
of Coordinadora Democratica\'s spots and received 20 approved 
\"no\" spots.  Televen received 19 \"si\" spots and 39 \"no\" spots 
in the final stretch. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) Chavez and his government never intended this campaign 
to be a fair fight, and they got their wish. Despite having 
an edge in terms of editorial coverage and opinion pieces in 
the private media, under the media agreement the opposition 
was handicapped from the beginning by the CNE\'s requirement 
for approval of all television advertising, while the 
Chavistas suffered no such delays. As for the print media, it 
has been plain to anyone gleaning a Venezuelan newspaper that 
the state funded the Chavez campaign.

OAS and Carter Center Announce Audit 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria and former 
President Jimmy Carter announced August 17 that the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) had agreed to conduct a second audit 
of the voting results that would compare the paper ballots 
with the actas (tally sheets) generated after the results 
were transmitted to the CNE.  While President Carter 
reiterated that the Carter Center had no reason to doubt the 
integrity of the electoral system or the accuracy of 
preliminary the results he said he hoped the audit would 
relieve opposition concerns that fraud occurred.  The audit 
would be based on the paper ballots from a random sample of 
150 voting tables, and the actas from those machines. 
According to the Carter Center, the voting tables to be 
audited will be selected at 6 pm August 18 and the audit will 
begin at 8 am August 19.  All of the machines and 
corresponding data would be pulled in the presence of the 
international observers and government and opposition 
representatives.  Carter warned that it is possible that the 
ballots may not match the number of votes recorded on the 
actas since some people may not have deposited their receipts 
as they were supposed to.  He doubted, however, that a 
sufficient number would be missing to dramatically change the 
results. 
 
3.  (U) Gaviria noted that he was aware of the opposition\'s 
allegations that the machines were programmed with a ceiling, 
after which SI votes were converted to No votes once they 
reached a certain level.  Nevertheless, he described these 
allegations as vague and suggested that the opposition be 
more precise so the observers could better investigate the 
claim.  Both Gaviria nor Carter discounted the possibility 
that the urns into which voter deposited their paper receipts 
would be tampered with before the audit. 
 
------------------------------ 
Opposition/Government Reaction 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U)  The opposition reacted to the announcement with 
concern that the terms of the audit would not allow observers 
to detect the irregularities the opposition claims have 
occurred (septel).  Opposition spokesman Nelson Rampersad 
called for a more intense audit that would allow the 
machines, their memory and their software to be reviewed as 
well.  According to Rampersad, this request is based on 
information he says proves that approximately 25 percent of 
the machines (more than 5 thousand) were manipulated to 
record a similar total of Si and No votes in several voting 
centers.  Sumate President Alejandro Plaz recommended 
amplifying the sample to 200 machines to avoid finding a 
result within the margin of error and allowing government and 
opposition party representatives to choose the terms for 
selecting the machines to be audited. 
 
5.  (U)  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel and Commando 
Maisanta spokesperson Mari Pili Hernandez welcomed the audit 
on behalf of the government.  Rangel reiterated the 
government\'s belief that the vote was legitimate and cited 
the Carter Center and OAS\' original endorsement of the 
results.  He told the opposition they could run all the 
checks they wanted to, but that they would find nothing 
wrong. Smartmatic, the company who provided the machines for 
the vote, also welcomed the audit. Smartmatic President 
Antonio Mujica told poloffs he considered an audit vital to 
defend the reputation of his company. 
 
------------------------------------- 
OAS Reiterates Confidence in Results 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) In response to the opposition\'s claims of 
irregularities in the voting machines, the OAS released a 
statement August 18 reiterating their confidence in the 
results of the recall referendum as announced by CNE Director 
Francisco Carrasquero on August 16.  The OAS said the CNE 
gave the organization necessary access to adequately monitor 
the results and outlined the steps the OAS electoral mission 
took to ensure that the voting machines were secure.  The 
 
statement also repeated the electoral mission\'s confidence in 
the initial audit of the 192 machines conducted the day of 
the vote and the voting process, saying that all who wanted 
to participate could do so freely and without hindrance.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s business community has absorbed the 
unpleasant news of Chavez\'s referendum victory.  Albis Munoz, 
President of umbrella business confederation FEDECAMARAS, 
made a relatively conciliatory public statement (even as the 
opposition Democratic Coordinating Committee, with which it 
is linked, continued to charge fraud); she subsequently told 
econcouns that while her group would oppose Chavez\'s 
anti-business policies, it would look to rebuild lines of 
communication.  Antonio Herrera, executive director of the 
U.S.-Venezuela Chamber of Commerce (VENAMCHAM), stated that 
his group needed to re-establish the access it traditionally 
had at the highest levels of government even if that meant 
being viewed as \"collaborationist.\"  The oil sector has 
already made clear its desire to work with GOV, and a 
pro-Chavez agri-business leader insisted that the business 
sector must keep \"its seat at the table.\"  We expect that 
that over time some minimal relationship can be 
re-established between business and government.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
FEDECAMARAS Grits Its Teeth 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  On August 17, Albis Munoz, President of the 
Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(FEDECAMARAS), the umbrella group representing Venezuela\'s 
various sectorial business groups, held a press conference at 
which she called for reconciliation after the referendum, and 
the re-establishment of \"friendly environments for national 
survival and reconstruction,\" While not formally recognizing 
Chavez\'s victory and urging that the National Electoral 
Council resolve doubts about its validity, she stressed that 
Venezuela \"cannot remain in confrontation,\" and urged that 
the GOV undertake policy changes to improve the business 
climate such as moderating its threatening tone, modifying 
price and exchange controls, and improving \"juridical 
security\" and respect for private property. 
 
3.  (C)  In an August 18 meeting with econcouns, Munoz 
characterized her remarks as a response to Chavez\'s victory 
speech, which had both conciliatory and confrontational 
elements, and suggested that they were comparable to those of 
the Catholic Church (ref a).  FEDECAMARAS executive director 
Mario Tepedino separately told econcouns that they had been 
badly received within the Democratic Coordinating Committee, 
which is still pursuing the effort to prove fraud in the 
referendum vote counting; however, Munoz had felt she had no 
choice, given the pressures that Venezuelan businessmen face 
now that they have to continue to live with Chavez.  Munoz 
said that while FEDECAMARAS has been \"progressively 
distancing itself\" from a direct political role, it would not 
break from its institutional linkage to the Democratic 
Coordinating Committee, and that she would not shrink from 
telling Chavez that she opposes him \"as long as he keeps 
opposing the business community.\" 
 
4.  (C)  That said, FEDECAMARAS would look for vehicles to 
achieve some measure of normality in its relations with the 
GOV.  She did not see herself meeting with Chavez in the near 
future, but she planned to write to him, forwarding him a 
copy of her organization\'s plan for economic recovery, which 
had been adopted at the group\'s July annual conference.  She 
said that FEDECAMARAS would be pursuing initiatives to revive 
the tourism and construction section, where it could 
conceivably have common ground with the GOV.  It is working 
on outreach to labor, including the pro-Chavez UNT labor 
central as well as the anti-Chavez CTV, its traditional 
counterpart, perhaps through an event sponsored by the 
Central University.  While FEDECAMARAS would largely stick to 
economic issues in its public statements, there were lines 
that the GOV could not cross without the organization feeling 
impelled to speak out -- in particular arrests of opposition 
political figures. 
 
------------------------ 
VENAMCHAM Turns the Page 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Even more so than FEDECAMARAS, the U.S.-Venezuelan 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VENAMCHAM), the entity 
which represents not only major U.S. firms investing here, 
but a range of local firms with some U.S. connection 
(agents/distributors, large purchasers of U.S. inputs, etc.) 
also appears to be looking to re-position itself to deal with 
the continuation of the Chavez government.  (Note:  While 
VENAMCHAM, traditionally a higher profile organization than 
most American chambers in Latin America, had avoided 
officially supporting Chavez\'s temporary ouster in April 2002 
or the December 2002-February 2003 general strike, it has 
been seen by the GOV as largely oppositionist and, as such as 
been denied normal access to senior officials.  End note.) 
 
6.  (C)  VENAMCHAM executive director Antonio Herrera told 
econcouns on August 17, following a meeting of the 
organization\'s board of directors, that, even if it meant 
being seen as \"collaborationist,\" working relations would 
have to be re-established with the GOV.  He noted that the 
chamber had worked with authoritarian governments before and 
showed a tribute to dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in an old 
copy of its magazine.  VENAMCHAM, which is \"in for the long 
haul,\" would concentrate on business issues, leaving politics 
to the politicians.  If the National Assembly passes the 
draft law regulating the media, VENAMCHAM will criticize it 
only if it affects its the business interests of its 
media-owner members which include Venezuela\'s principal 
television stations and newspapers.  The freedom of speech 
question is one for political leaders and human rights 
groups, he insisted. 
 
7.  (C)  VENMAMCHAM was still considering ways in which to 
recover its relationship with the GOV.  Herrera said he was 
heartened by the fact that even before the referendum Capt. 
Jose Vielma Mora, head of customs and tax authority SENIAT 
had met with VENAMCHAM, which has a number of pending issues 
ranging from difficulties with pre-shipment inspection of 
goods entering the country to arbitrary tax inspections of 
multinational firms.  He noted that Finance Minister Nobrega 
has also agreed to a meeting.  He did not rule out that once 
the dust settles on the issue of the referendum fraud, 
VENAMCHAM might write to Chavez congratulating him and 
raising its range of business concerns.  Herrera said that a 
\"charm offensive\" on Chavez\'s part to the USG and American 
business was a distinct possibility and advantage should be 
taken of any opening.  (Comment:  Herrera, who can be 
intentionally provocative in his discourse, was probably 
exaggerating a bit for effect.  We expect that VENAMCHAM will 
be quite cautious in its efforts to re-establish 
relationships with the Chavez government.  End comment.) 
 
------------------------ 
Sticking with the Winner 
------------------------ 
 
8.  (C)  Some businesses had already placed their bets with 
Chavez ahead of the referendum.  International oil companies, 
although fully cognizant of the limitations of Venezuela\'s 
hydrocarbons regime and the political minefield involved in 
working with a leftist, \"anti-imperialist\" government, had 
worked long and hard to cultivate the GOV.  In the immediate 
aftermath of the referendum outcome, Ali Mosheri, 
locally-based head of ChevronTexaco\'s Latin American upstream 
operations, told energy officer that his greatest concern was 
that the USG not make any statement (i.e. supporting the 
charges of fraud) which would provoke an adverse reaction 
from Chavez.  And even before the referendum Luis Xavier 
Grissanti, executive director of the Venezuelan Hydrocarbons 
Association (AVHI), the industry association of foreign oil 
producers, made clear in a briefing for visiting U.S. 
Representative C.L. Otter that the oil sector was not waiting 
for any change in government but was engaged in a long-term 
campaign to persuade Chavez and state oil company PDVSA to 
improve the climate for foreign oil investment (ref B).  AVHI 
was willing to accommodate Chavez to the point of 
participating in a round of public fora with businessmen 
which he held prior to the referendum, despite its evident 
 
electoral intent. 
 
9.  (C)  One of the organizers of Chavez\'s series of public 
business fora was agri-businessman Alberto Cudemus, head of 
the Venezuelan Federation of Pork Producers (FEDEPORCINA). 
He had unsuccessfully run against Albis Munoz\'s predecessor 
as head of FEDECAMARAS, Carlos Fernandez (currently in Miami, 
to which he fled after the failed general strike led to his 
prosecution).  Cudemus, who confidently predicted a wide 
Chavez victory in conversation with econcouns on August 13, 
said that on economic issues, Chavez listens to a range of 
opinions, and that if the private sector (and the USG) did 
not remain \"at the table,\" their positions would be filled by 
others with more radical voices.  When it was suggested that 
some actions such as arrests of political opponents might 
make dialogue impossible, Cudemus said that under the right 
circumstance such matters could be \"negotiable\" for Chavez. 
(Note:  Cudemus has used his connections with the Chavez 
administration to evident advantage, most notably in 
frustrating the entry of U.S. pork into Venezuela.  End 
note.) 
 
---------------------------- 
Comment - Taking a Write-Off 
---------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  Venezuela\'s businessmen have read the numbers and 
written off the prospects for Chavez\'s departure any time 
within their planning horizon.  (Both Munoz and Herrera were 
clearly unwilling to tie their associations\' fortunes to the 
possibility that the opposition\'s effort to prove fraud at 
the referendum will be successful.)  Under those 
circumstances, they have little choice but to find some 
accommodation with him if they are to get any help on 
specific issues and contain any surge towards more radical 
policies.  Given the tools the GOV has at its disposal to 
reward or punish businesses (such as granting or withholding 
foreign exchange or contracts with state industrial giants 
PDVSA and CVG), their decision is understandable.  The pain 
of approaching the Chavez government, which remains 
authoritarian, corrupt, and ideologically biased, is somewhat 
lessened by the fact that many businesses which have survived 
the economic turmoil of recent years enjoy oligopolies, now 
that weaker competitors have failed, and with an oil boom 
kicking in, there is money to be made.  But Chavez, whose 
preference has always been to deal with individual, 
hand-picked businessmen rather than industry groups, and who 
owes the organized business community nothing, is likely to 
insist that the terms of any reconciliation be highly 
favorable to him.

August 18 the opposition would not participate in the audit 
of election results agreed to by the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) at the suggestion of the OAS and Carter Center. 
The Coordinadora instead wants an audit that would look at 
the software used in the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum. Chavez opponents found similarities in results at 
specific voting machines that they allege to be statistically 
highly improbable. A computer analysis of Baruta municipality 
results by the Coordinadora found other anomalies leading 
them to claim that an algorithm was at work that increased 
the number of no votes and capped the number of yes votes. 
Coordinadora representative presented part of the information 
to international observers.  CNE director called the 
opposition allegations irresponsible.  He said the CNE would 
proceed with the audit, noting that the audit would not

2.  (U) Miranda state Gov. Enrique Mendoza, leader of the 
Coordinadora Democratica, ordered Coordinadora supporters 
around the country August 18 not to participate in an audit 
by the National Electoral Council (CNE) of the August 15 
referendum results.  The audit, negotiated by the OAS and 
Carter Center, would involve a check of the paper receipts 
from 150 electoral tables with the information the electronic 
voting system transmitted during the referendum. Speaking to 
reporters, Mendoza showed alleged evidence of fraud the 
Coordinadora claims took place during the August 15 
referendum.  He showed statistics which allegedly indicate 
that voting machines were programmed to produce a 
pre-determined number of yes and no votes.  He also showed 
machine-by-machine results with the same number of yes votes 
in different centers in Baruta municipality (Caracas), which 
Mendoza said was the result of an algorithm which 
automatically increased the number of no votes in each 
center. (Note: Mendoza\'s public presentation was a disaster, 
with him tripping over his own explanation.)

advisor J.J. Rendon appearing on all news channel 
Globovision, showed several original tally sheets indicating 
that results from machines at the same voting table indicated 
the same number of yes votes or a lower number.  This pattern 
repeated for nine tables for which Rendon had the tally 
sheets, which he alleged is statistically highly improbable. 
Chavez opponents continue to examine tally sheets from around 
the country, and as of 1900 local August 18, similar 
anomalies had been found in Zulia, Aragua and Nueva Esparta 
states, according to press reports. Gov. Rojas and Rendon met 
with the Ambassador and PolOffs late on August 19 and 
presented much more detail. We urged them to make the 
presentation to OAS/CC. 
 
----------------------- 
Fooling the Quick Count 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U) A pattern was evident when looking at the results at 
the voting machine level, but is lost when numbers are 
examined at the mesa level.  This makes the discrepancy 
 
undetectable to the \"quick count\" method used by the national 
and international observers, according to Rendon, because the 
quick count looks at random tally sheets.  These random 
checks would not reveal this type of anomaly, since a 
different upper limit for the yes votes appear to have been 
set. The anomaly is only apparent if one looks at the tally 
sheet from machines at the same table, according to Rendon. 
Rendon said only a recount of the paper ballots would reveal 
the true results of the referendum. 
 
----------------------- 
Alleged Algorithm Found 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Coordinadora electoral control chief Amado Dounia 
August 18 showed PolOff an analysis of Baruta municipality 
voting results by machine.  (Transmitted to Department via 
e-mail.)  The study shows different voting machines 
throughout Baruta repeating the same number of yes votes and 
a determined number added to the no column.  Dounia 
speculated that the electronic voting machines may have 
transmitted their information to the CNE correctly, but then 
received a reverse transmission of data, either from the main 
CNE server, or another GoV server connected to the system. 
Dounia said the fraud may have affected as few as 4,000 of 
the 20,000 receipt boxes, and that the CNE or GoV elements 
involved in the fraud might be able to tamper with them to 
hide the evidence. 
 
----------------------------- 
Coordinadora Pushes for Audit 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) After the finding of the statistical anomalies by 
Chavez opponents August 17, National Assembly deputy, and 
Coordinadora CNE liaison, Nelson Rampersad told reporters on 
August 18 that the Coordinadora had asked the Carter Center 
and the OAS mission to conduct a more exhaustive audit of the 
August 15 presidential recall referendum.  Rampersad said the 
Coordinadora had asked the international observers to count 
the paper receipts from more than the scheduled 150 electoral 
tables, and to look at the electronic voting machines\' 
programming, as well as the programming of the central server 
of the CNE. 
 
--------------- 
CNE Says No WAY 
--------------- 
 
7.  (U) CNE director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters the CNE 
refused to change the terms of the audit it is conducting. 
Rodriguez argued that the similarity in voting results, was 
to be expected in a polarized election.  He showed statistics 
of similar voting patterns in several voting tables. 
(Comment: Rodriguez knocked down a straw man, since the 
opposition\'s argument is not that the results were similar at 
the mesa level, but when individual machines were compared.) 
 
8.  (C) Carter Center director Jennifer McCoy told the 
Ambassador late August 18 that the audit would proceed with 
or without Coordinadora observers.  She said the audit will 
deal with all of the Coordinadora\'s concerns except the 
question about the server -- a concern which she said Sumate 
itself had already discarded.  The Carter Center\'s chief 
technical observer, Edgardo Mimica, told the Ambassador that 
he was already examining the patterns which the Coordinadora 
claims to have uncovered.  The actual count of the paper 
receipts began at 8:00 a.m., August 19. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The referendum results are not being accepted by 
opposition leaders or supporters. These irregularities, 
though as yet unproven, are more than enough to convince the 
opposition they were robbed. The key will be how well the 
statistical evidence holds up, and how convincing it will be 
 
for the Carter Center and OAS. If the allegations are indeed 
without basis, the only way to get the opposition to accept 
the August 15 results, and overcome the \"group think\" that 
they had/had to win, is to fully address the allegations, 
which even to an interested observer are difficult to 
decipher and understand. Resolving these doubts is also 
crucial for the gubernatorial and mayoral elections scheduled 
for September 26.  Already, there are many -- politicians and 
voters -- saying they cannot possibly participate in that 
contest.  At minimum, the confidence of some 40% of the 
electorate (the number which the official result says voted 
to get rid of Chavez) has been severely shaken. 
 
9.  (C) We cannot discount that part of the rejection of the 
results and of the international observers validation of the 
results thus far arises from personal political ambitions. 
Much has been at stake in the referendum process, and many 
politicians and proto-politicians have been projected onto 
the national scene.  How many will be left by the wayside 
will become known as Venezuelans take stock of what 
participating in the referendum process has meant.  For the 
moment, nevertheless, movement towards a \"loyal minority 
opposition\" mode is absent.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Organization of American States (OAS) and Carter 
Center are auditing ballots now, but assuming that charges of 
electoral fraud are not substantiated, one must ask what 
happened and how Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez won the 
August 15 recall referendum by such a large margin.  Chavez 
ran an effective, overwhelming electoral campaign using 
practically unlimited state resources against a divided and 
disorganized opposition.  High oil prices cushioned his 
success.  Chavez also utilized other mechanisms to ensure 
himself victory, including his control over the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) and, by extension, the international 
observer missions.  Chavez created a climate of uncertainty 
for opposition supporters and leaders, who expended enormous 
energy and political capital just to get to the referendum. 
Additionally, the opposition\'s \"Si\" campaign never really got 
off the ground, weakened by lack of money and off-target 
messages.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Chavez the Great Campaigner 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Chavez ran an effective, overwhelming electoral 
campaign beginning in July 2003, when his popularity dropped 
to a low 36% in the polls.  Starting with the \"Mision 
Robinson\" literacy campaign, Chavez began using state 
resources to reach potential voters directly, offering cash 
stipends as well as access to elementary and high school 
degree completion programs.  Defeated most recently during 
the appeals process for presidential recall signatures, he 
then personally took control of the campaign and enlisted his 
ministers and other government officials to marshal the 
resources at their command. 
 
3. (C) Instead of letting the referendum be a Chavez vs. 
Chavez decision, he recast the referendum as an inevitable 
victory for his revolution.  Chavez launched his \"No\" 
campaign under the direction of the \"Comando Maisanta,\" which 
sold the Chavez twist that the mere calling of the 
referendum, provided for by his own Bolivarian Constitution, 
was a victory for the participatory democracy espoused by his 
revolution (ref A). 
 
4. (C) If the numbers as of August 19 are correct, Chavez 
appears to have successfully mobilized lower class Venezuelan 
voters who have historically abstained from elections.  The 
GOV issued identity cards or \"cedulas\" to undocumented 
Venezuelans as well as foreigners through an accelerated 
program \"Mision Identidad\" and put them on the national voter 
registry before rolls closed July 10.  In June, the GOV 
naturalized 105,000 foreigners within one week, as part of 
its goal to naturalize 200,000 before July 10.  The average 
number of naturalizations per year previously had only been 
3,000 to 4,000.  The GOV unabashedly linked cedulas to votes 
for Chavez (ref B). 
 
5. (C) To mobilize the poor, he also fed them various 
populist programs.  High oil prices throughout the campaign, 
in addition to control over other ministry budgets, gave 
Chavez the revenue not only to launch the \"No\" campaign media 
blitz but also to provide populist food, health, and literacy 
programs for the poor.  Known as \"misiones,\" these programs 
literally put cash into the hands of key voters.  Further, 
Chavez sent the clear message to voters that the opposition 
elite would take away these programs if they returned to 
power. 
 
6. (C) One of the biggest assets to the \"No\" campaign was 
Chavez, himself.  Throughout the campaign period, he 
continued his \"Alo, Presidente\" radio programs, held multiple 
marches and public addresses, and stepped up his vitriolic 
language against the U.S., the Bush Administration, 
neo-liberal economic policies, and \"Yankee Imperialism.\"  Our 
policy to avoid bilateral feuding and keep the focus on the 
referendum itself weakened Chavez\'s strategy of making us a 
central issue.  His anti-American message and the idea that 
President Bush was his true opponent, however, resonated 
among those Chavistas who continue to believe the USG was 
behind the events of April 2002. 
 
------------------- 
Controlling the CNE 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) Strongly favoring Chavez was his control of the CNE 
and, by extension, the international observer missions.  The 
three pro-government members on the CNE, Francisco 
Carrasquero, Jorge Rodriguez, and Oscar Battaglini, often 
appeared more ready to impede democratic expression than to 
facilitate it, and made it difficult for the opposition to 
collect the signatures necessary to convoke the referendum. 
Chavez suffered a blow after the signature appeals process, 
but ultimately, he benefited from the drawn out, seven-month 
signature collection and verification process that exhausted 
the opposition.  Chavez campaigned during this time, while 
the opposition was busy wrangling with the CNE over the 
validity of thousands of signatures and rules for the appeals 
process. 
 
8. (C) After the appeals process and clear Chavista 
dissatisfaction with the outspoken role of the Carter Center, 
Organization of American States (OAS), and the Group of 
Friends of the OAS Secretary General on Venezuela, the CNE 
set rules and regulations limiting international observer 
participation in the referendum.  The CNE also instituted 
automated voting over manual voting despite the opposition\'s 
concerns that an untested, computerized system would leave 
room for fraud and manipulation (ref C). 
 
9. (C) The possibility for fraud and manipulation of 
Smartmatic machine software and CANTV transmissions called 
for more extensive international observation of the process. 
Instead, the CNE initially delayed invitations to 
international observers, limited the number of observers per 
mission and their activities and movement, and banned \"quick 
counts\" as a methodology to check the accuracy of final vote 
tabulations.  Such limitations led the European Union to 
decline its invitation to observe.  The Carter Center and OAS 
accepted the invitations but had to negotiate with the CNE to 
secure the \"minimum conditions\" under which they would 
participate as observers.  Only three days before the 
election did the Carter Center get all of its requested 
observers and technicians accredited by the CNE. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Creating a Climate of Intimidation 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The GOV also created a climate of uncertainty and 
intimidation for opposition supporters to suppress the \"Si\" 
vote.  Questionable criminal indictments and detentions of 
opposition figures, including Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles, 
Sumate directors Maria Corina Machado and Alejandro Plaz, 
Gente de Petroleo leader Juan Fernandez, retired Army General 
Manuel Rosendo, and Asemblea de Educadores leader Leonardo 
Carvajal, coupled with inexplicable dismissals from 
government service of employees who had participated in the 
signature drive contributed to an atmosphere of mistrust. 
The CNE\'s decision to use fingerprinting machines 
\"cazahuellas\" to verify a voter\'s identity led to the 
widespread belief that a person\'s vote would not be secret. 
 
11. (C) Other examples of intimidation included attacks on 
media outlets and acts of violence by hard-liner Chavistas 
following the appeals process, accusations against national 
 
 
telecommunications company CANTV and GOV threats that Plan 
Republica was prepared to intervene.  There were also rumors 
that the GOV would cut off gasoline supply to the eastern 
neighborhoods of Caracas, as had happened during the appeals, 
and thinly-veiled threats of violence by senior GOV officials 
(like VP Jose Vincente Rangel) if there was evidence of 
\"sabotage\" by the \"terrorist\" opposition. 
 
-------------------------- 
Failed Opposition Campaign 
-------------------------- 
 
12. (C) The opposition\'s \"Si\" campaign bloomed late.  The CNE 
announced June 3 that preliminary calculations indicated the 
opposition had collected enough signatures to activate the 
recall referendum, and on June 8, set August 15 as the date 
for the vote.  The opposition\'s Coordinadora Democratica, 
however, did not launch its presidential recall \"Si\" campaign 
until June 25.  One Coordinadora advisor noted that an 
agreement between media owners and the GOV brokered by the 
Carter Center weakened the opposition\'s \"air\" forces.  The 
opposition, he said, then had to rely on its \"ground\" forces, 
and Coordinadora political parties and NGOs began working at 
the grassroots level. 
 
13. (C) Some critics of the Coordinadora do not think the 
\"Si\" campaign really got off the ground until August 1, when 
its leaders signed the \"National Accord for Social Justice 
and Democratic Peace,\" establishing a framework for an 
opposition-led transition government and recommending a 
primary election to determine the unified opposition 
candidate in a follow-on presidential election.  Many 
observers saw this Governance Accord as a tangible 
demonstration of unity by a politically diverse opposition, 
but it did not emerge until less than two weeks before the 
vote (ref D). 
 
14. (C) Polling data before the referendum showed that the 
\"Si\" campaign was failing to bring in new supporters, 
according to an opposition political consultant.  The 
Coordinadora convinced itself that it was sufficient to have 
Chavez run against Chavez and ran a weak media campaign aimed 
at undecided voters, while others believed the focus should 
be on buttressing core support. 
 
15. (C) The financing for the \"Si\" campaign was also lacking. 
 Coordinadora advisors told us in mid-July that Chavez\'s 
success in projecting himself as the winner and polling data 
in his favor led to a drying up of funds from 
opposition-affiliated business executives.  They speculated 
that businesses were reluctant to donate money, and those 
that did, did so in lesser amounts, because they were 
unconvinced the opposition would win and did not want to be 
identified with the opposition if Chavez won.  Movement to 
Socialism (MAS) President and Coordinadora member Felipe 
Mujica confirmed there was a lack of financial support for 
the \"Si\" campaign when the GOV was clearly outspending the 
opposition (ref E). 
 
---------------------------- 
Failed Opposition Leadership 
---------------------------- 
 
16. (C) The opposition relied on the substantial number of 
Venezuelans already dissatisfied with the Chavez 
Administration, the triumph of the signature appeals process, 
anti-Chavez messages already being transmitted by 
opposition-friendly media outlets, and marches to energize 
opposition supporters - but it did not rally behind a single 
leader.  Even though Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza 
emerged from the appeals process victory as the likely 
front-runner in a potential face-off with Chavez, the 
Coordinadora opted to stick with the Chavez vs. Chavez 
strategy. 
 
17. (C) The June 18 meeting of Venezuelan media magnate 
Gustavo Cisneros, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and 
President Chavez behind closed doors at Fuerte Tiuna 
undermined Coordinadora leaders - particularly Enrique 
 
Mendoza - and led opposition supporters to believe business 
leaders had decided to work with the GOV (ref F).  Other 
rumors that Democratic Action (AD) leaders might be cutting 
deals with Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) counterparts had the 
same damaging effect, although to a lesser extent, on the 
\"Si\" campaign. 
 
------------- 
Final Comment 
------------- 
 
18. (C) There are many reasons for Chavez\'s apparent victory. 
 Even if Chavez could not have won the vote outright, he 
successfully narrowed the margin in the run up to the 
referendum and controlled the CNE so that he probably could 
have stolen it, if necessary.  Identifying the strengths of 
Chavez\'s campaign, the pressure points within the Venezuelan 
electoral system, and the weaknesses of the opposition\'s 
campaign and leadership is important, however, for the next 
electoral match against Chavez.

1.  (C) Bolivar State Gov. Antonio Rojas Suarez and Bolivar

technical experts with each mission. Rojas, a retired Army 
General, also said he had taken the allegations to the

Claims of More Evidence 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Bolivar State Gov. Antonio Rojas Suarez and Bolivar 
state legal advisor Juan Jose met with the Ambassador, 
PolCouns and PolOff on August 19 to discuss the allegations 
of fraud in the August 15 presidential recall referendum. 
Rojas and Rendon said there are many electoral tables where 
tally sheets from voting machines registered the same number 
of yes votes at all the machines at the table, or a smaller 
number. Rendon claims this evidence indicates the machines 
were programmed with an upper limit for yes votes, which 
artificially suppressed the yes vote overall in the 
referendum. Rendon showed us original tally sheets (the 
copies that went to the opposition witnesses) from six 
tables, with three showing 2 of 3 machines with the same vote 
count for yes, and three with all the machines showing the 
same yes vote count. Gov. Rojas claimed that the opposition 
had now found 1920 machines (out of over 20,000) with similar 
results. 
 
3.  (C) Rendon, who claims to have worked on elections with 
Mexico\'s PRI, said he had noted various other patterns of 
irregularities which they were examining. The Governor noted 
that he and Rendon had just come from the meeting of the 
(democratic) Governor\'s association where others wre bringing 
forth similar results from their states. They now had numbers 
from nine states, Rendon said, showing similar 
irregularities. 
 
4.  (C) Gov. Rojas told the Ambassador that a computer had 
been found in a cyber cafe used by members of the Maisanta 
campaign. He claimed that his supporters, using an electronic 
address on the computer,  had entered a web-site with 
election results which they could play with. Rendon said they 
would need a hacker to fully exploit the discovery. The 
Ambassador encouraged them to present whatever evidence they 
had to the OAS/CC. 
 
------------------ 
Key Role of OAS/CC 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador told Gov. Rojas and Rendon that they 
should take the evidence, and present it to the technical 
experts at the OAS and the Carter Center. He noted the damage 
caused by Miranda Gov. Enrique Mendoza\'s confused and excited 
presentation August 18. The argument, the Ambassador said, 
was too confusing and technical to convince a skeptical 
layman, and that techincal experts Edgardo Mimica at the 
Carter Center, and Edgardo Reis at the OAS were the key 
people they needed to convince. Rendon said they had 
presented them with their evidence, and that Mimica had been 
very interested, while Reis was skeptical.

CUFAN

6.  (C) Gov. Rojas also said he had spoken to members of the 
Unified Armed Forces Command (CUFAN) about the fraud 
allegations. He reported that his contacts had spoken to him 
about mistrust of the referendum results within the Armed 
Forces. He noted the unusual silence from the military since 
the referendum. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) The opposition\'s allegations are mired in technical 
detail and clouded by the proliferation of theories. Without 
clarity it is unlikely that they will succeed in convincing 
international observers that the statistical phenomenon is 
really significant. In addition, they will also have to face 
the hard facts of the results of the August 19-20 audit 
overseen by the Carter Center and the OAS.

SUBJECT: MENDOZA TO TAKE FRAUD ARGUMENT BEFORE 
INTERNATIONAL OPINION 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen G. McFarland for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Miranda State Gov. Enrique Mendoza told the 
Ambassador August 20 that the opposition had formed a 
commission to compile the \"evidence\" supporting the 
allegations that the GoV committed fraud in the August 15 
referendum.  Personally convinced that the GoV committed 
fraud, he said the Coordinadora would not present the case to 
the National Electoral Council or Venezuela\'s Supreme Court, 
but rather would use it to delegitimize the Chavez 
government.  The Ambassador reminded Mendoza that the opinion 
of the OAS and Carter Center technical experts will be key, 
and urged him to take the evidence to them.  Mendoza 
recognized that the technical nature of the allegations 
hindered understanding by the public.  He concurred with the 
Ambassador that what would be most convincing would be a 
person revealing complicity.  Mendoza also said he had 
convoked the leaders of the major political parties to 
discuss the recommendation of \"democratic\" governors and 
mayors not to participate in the scheduled regional 
elections.   End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Miranda State Gov. Enrique Mendoza is convinced that 
President Chavez committed electronic fraud to win the August 
15 presidential recall referendum.  Meeting with the 
Ambassador and PolCouns August 20, Mendoza recounted the 
allegations that have been made public since August 16.  The 
Coordinadora Democratica leader said he had formed a 
commission led by constitutional lawyer Tulio Alvarez, with 
members such as former Supreme Electoral Council President 
Carlos Delgado Chapellin, to compile the \"evidence\" they are 
gathering.  Mendoza said the evidence was not for use in 
filing complaints with the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
or bringing cases before the Supreme Court.  Both these 
institutions, Mendoza asserted, lack legitimacy.  Instead, 
the opposition will use the information to delegitimize the 
Chavez government. 
 
3.  (C) Mendoza said the opposition had had two windows of 
opportunity to press the fraud case in the first days after 
the vote.  Former President Jimmy Carter, he said, had closed 
one of them with his statement August 16, whereas OAS SYG had 
kept the other open as a result of the conversation Mendoza 
was able to have with him.  Urged by the Ambassador to take 
the evidence nonetheless to the OAS and Carter Center 
experts, particularly because of its technical nature, 
Mendoza said they would, of course, do so. 
 
4.  (C) The Ambassador then asked Mendoza what impact a 
declaration by the international observers that there was no 
fraud, based on the August 19-20 audit of the results in 
which the opposition had refused to participate.  He reminded 
the Governor that numerous governments had already blessed 
the results, and following the audit, the USG might well 
follow suit.  Mendoza responded that the opposition would 
continue putting its case together.  It would be a mistake to 
try to put information together to compete with the timing of 
the audit, he said.  He emphasized that the importance of 
having the information fully in place even if it took days or 
weeks. 
 
5.  (C) Mendoza recognized the difficulty of presenting 
convincing arguments to the technically challenged and 
acknowledged that in this type of situation, the best 
arguments come from persons with hand on knowledge of what 
supposedly occurred.  He said for example, that a local radio 
station owner in his state had told him that a National Guard 
captain had lamented to a family member that he had 
participated in changing paper receipts to keep his job. 
 
5.  (C) Mendoza noted that acting hastily had most recently 
caused the death of an innocent woman at Plaza Francia, when 
irresponsible leaders could think of nothing more to do than 
to call people out on the street as a reaction to the loss. 
 
 
Another mistake the opposition had made, according to Mendoza 
was trusting Smartmatic.  He said they had been convinced by 
a member of the Coordinadora who is the father of one of the 
Smartmatic executives that \"the boys\" would do a good job. 
 
---------------- 
Future Elections 
---------------- 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador referred to the prospects for the 
gubernatorial and mayoral elections in light of the real 
possibility that the fraud allegations would still be alive 
September 26.  He asked Mendoza what would a Venezuela 
without opposition governors in the major states look like? 
Mendoza said the opposition was examining that question.  He 
noted that the Association of Governors and Mayors had 
recommended that they not participate.  The decision, of 
course, was not up to the sitting officials, Mendoza said, 
but up to the political parties, which could in any case 
choose other candidates if the incumbents did not want to 
run.  He said he had convoked the leaders of the main parties 
for a discussion August 22 to determine their course of 
action. 
 
7.  (C) Mendoza noted that it would be folly to simply 
abandon the political space to Chavez.  He said there are 
those in the opposition who advocate mass resignations, for 
example, presuming that Chavez is working from the same 
assumptions as they are.  Mendoza recalled that during the 
December 2002-January 2003 strike he had attempted to 
negotiate end to the stoppage with then Minister of Interior 
Diosdado Cabello and none of the arguments about jobs and 
commerce worked.  To participate in the elections, however, 
Mendoza said there would have to be some adjustments to the 
conditions, such as agreement to reconcile paper receipts 
with the electronic tabulation, which the government is 
unlikely to do. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Mendoza is prepared to make the fraud case the banner 
for continuing opposition to Chavez.  He is not alone, from 
what we have seen among his fellow governors and mayors. 
There are enough Venezuelans who believe they in fact have 
been robbed to maintain a core constituency in the double 
digits of percentages.  Putting the matter in the hands of 
the commission headed by Tulio Alvarez will help bring 
clarity and order to the various types of fraud mechanisms 
that are being alleged.  The question is whether it will be 
sufficiently credible. 
 
9.  (C) The question of participating in the regional 
contests is crucial because participation would give the 
opposition venues to maintain and cultivate grassroots 
support and provide a channel for anti-Chavez sentiment. 
Boycotting the elections would create a vacuum that Chavez\'s 
associates, or opponents willing to take the opportunity for 
a variety of reasons, would fill quickly.  Participation in 
the regional elections -- especially if the opposition did 
fairly well -- would legitimate the referendum process.

2.  (U)  Political police service (DISIP) and local police 
authorities apprehended the three people photographed 
shooting at demonstrators in Altamira on August 16.  Johon 
Carlos Jimenez_ and Henry Jose Parra were captured in Sucre 
the morning of August 17 in front of an emergency room, while 
Pedro Ramos Poche was captured near a bus terminal in Petare 
that afternoon.  The three have several charges pending 
against them, including homicide, assault, and public 
intimidation.  According to the Sucre police commissioner, 
Jimenez_ has intimidated Chavez opponents in the past.  He was 
involved in an assault on a group of Globovision and 
Notitarde reporters during the opposition signature drive in 
November.  In July he was arrested along with nine others on 
weapons charges, but was later released.

3.  (U)  On August 18 Communications and Information Minister 
Jesse Chacon, MVR Deputy William Lara, and Commando Maisanta 
spokespersons Mari Pili Hernandez and Samuel Moncada lashed 
out at opposition leaders during a press conference.  Chacon 
criticized the opposition\'s reliance on the polls, which he 
said did not take into account all of Caracas.  He accused 
private media stations of trying to deceive the people and 
called on the opposition supporters to reflect on what 
Coordinadora Democratica leaders are really saying and what 
he described as their Maquiavelian acts.  Lara called the 
opposition\'s latest accusations of fraud completely 
irrational at this stage in the referendum process and said 
their \"anti-democratic nature was criminal\" at such an 
important point in the country\'s history. In response to 
Miranda Governor Enrique Mendoza\'s call for supporters to 
demonstrate next week, Hernandez described the call as 
disrespectful and irresponsible, accused the opposition of 
wanting to use the people for cannon fodder, and called for 
peace.  Moncada\'s remarks were more ominous, describing the 
opposition as an oligarchy bent on insurrection, intent on 
sabotaging the regional election and resorting to violence. 
He also said the opposition posed a problem for public order.

4.  (U) On August 18, National lectoral Council Director 
Jorge Rodriguez reportd  that the latest vote count 
indicates Chavez reeived  more than 5.5 million votes 
(roughly 59 prcent) compared to 3.8 million votes (or 40.9

6.  (C) During this week more details have surfaced about 
questionable events that occurred during and after the 
referendum that have increased suspicion about international 
observer diligence in monitoring the voting process: 
 
-- On August 18, Carter Center observer Edgardo Mimica told 
the Ambassador about an \"unexplained event\" that occurred 
during the transmission of data from the voting machines to 
the CNE\'s totalization center.  According to Mimica, the 
transmission lines went down from 8 to 8:15 pm and none of 
the machines could send any data.  He said Cantv officials 
checked the lines, but could find nothing wrong. 
 
-- On August 19, Carter Center representative Jennifer McCoy 
admitted to the Ambassador that only 82 of the 192 mesas 
examined during the audit were done correctly by checking the 
paper ballots against the tally sheets from the machines.  In 
addition, international observers were only present for a 
portion of the audits and were doing their quick count of the 
tally sheets at the same time. 
 
-- Daily newspaper El Nacional reported August 20 that 
international observers were only present at 10 of the 82 
audits that were conducted immediately after the polls closed 
early August 16 and have yet to receive reports on the other 
72 examinations.  The article also says that only former 
President Carter and outgoing OAS Secretary General Cesar 
Gaviria were allowed in the CNE totalization room, a 
restriction which was imposed on voting day.  Moreover, 
during the voting simulation conducted July 18 the article 
claims that observers were only permitted to oversee testing

Summary

1. (C) Organized labor is willing to test the GOV\'s call for 
dialogue in post-referendum Venezuela, but doubts President 
Hugo Chavez\'s sincerity.  Venezuelan Workers Confederation 
(CTV) Secretary General Manuel Cova believes his organization 
needs to re-focus on issues affecting the daily lives of 
workers, and plans to propose a common labor agenda for all 
unions to pursue with the GOV.  Labor expert Jesus Urbieta 
hopes Venezuela\'s unions can become more centralized, better 
coordinated, and more effective at negotiating sector-wide 
bargaining agreements.  The pro-GOV central National Workers\' 
Union (UNT) lacks clear leadership and remains mired in 
factionalism.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CTV Leader Sees New Political Reality 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Manuel Cova, Secretary General of the Venezuelan 
Workers Confederation (CTV) told poloff August 18 that if the 
opposition could not make a case for GOV fraud during the 
August 15 presidential recall referendum, the opposition 
would have to accept the new political reality that they are 
in the minority.  Cova said the referendum results should 
signal to President Hugo Chavez that the opposition is not 
politically insignificant, but rather a force representing 40 
percent of the population.  Cova doubted the sincerity of 
Chavez\'s offer to begin a dialogue with the opposition, but 
believes the opposition should make an effort.  He said the 
opposition\'s approach, including that of the CTV, has been 
too confrontational, too focused on the short-term political 
scene, and too distant from average Venezuelans.  He hoped 
the opposition\'s political defeat would lead to \"new faces\" 
in the opposition, and even suggested the consolidation of 
leftist opposition parties into a new center-left front. 
 
3. (C) Cova said he hoped the CTV would re-focus its efforts 
toward improving lives of Venezuelan workers.  He said the 
CTV called on all Venezuelan labor centrals two months ago to 
develop a common agenda for negotiating with the GOV.  The 
common agenda, he said, would be developed under the auspices 
of a Central University of Venezuela (UCV) project.  He said 
the CTV\'s first priority should be negotiating collective 
agreements for public sector employees.  He also said unions 
must challenge the GOV\'s dismissal of public sector employees 
who signed the presidential recall petition.  Public sector 
employees, he said, are especially disappointed and worried 
about Chavez\'s victory, causing them to wonder whether the 
purges of Chavez opponents in the bureaucracy will now begin 
in earnest. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CTV Labor Expert Sees Tough Times Ahead 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Jesus Urbieta, Director of the CTV\'s Labor Studies 
Institute (INAESIN), told poloff August 19 Venezuela\'s labor 
movement has been generally weakened under Chavez rule and 
will face more challenges in the future.  With private 
industry in decline since Chavez took office, he said, public 
employee unions have become relatively more influential on 
labor issues.  If pro-GOV candidates win the regional 
elections scheduled for September 26, he said, they will 
favor rival pro-Chavez unions in collective contract 
negotiations. 
 
5. (C) Urbieta, who holds an elected position on the 
International Labor Organization\'s (ILO) Administrative 
Council, said a sign of good faith by the GOV would be to 
accept the visit of an ILO direct contact mission to 
investigate various labor complaints in Venezuela.  Urbieta 
said the ILO made the request in 2003, but the GOV ignored 
it; a similar request for a mission was approved in June 
2004. 
 
------------------------------ 
 
Chavista Labor Remains Divided 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The pro-Chavez National Workers\' Union (UNT), formed 
in early 2003, has yet to hold elections to select its 
leaders, functioning instead under 21 \"National Directors.\" 
UNT National Director Francisco Torrealba told poloff August 
18 the UNT is divided into two factions:  one controlled by 
himself and public sector union leader Franklin Rondon that 
seeks labor union autonomy from the GOV and another 
controlled by Orlando Chirinos and Marcela Maspero, whom 
Torrealba described as \"Trotskyites.\"  These radical leaders 
frequently speak out in support of the GOV and, said 
Torrealba, and resort to intimidation tactics against 
Torrealba\'s faction for control of unions.  Torrealba alleged 
that Minister of Labor Maria Cristina Iglesias frequently 
sides with this radical faction in disputes among UNT 
members.  Torrealba said he hopes UNT can hold elections in 
November so that the labor central can act with one voice. 
 
7. (C) Urbieta said that labor is one area the GOV has failed 
to co-opt or create a viable parallel organization.  The 
GOV\'s labor agenda was largely stalled when the GOV-backed 
candidate for CTV president (present Education Minister 
Aristobulo Isturiz) was defeated in elections in 2001.  The 
Ministry of Labor responded, Urbieta said, by facilitating 
the registration of pro-Chavez parallel unions such that the 
UNT, launched in the wake of the national strike, now claims 
more than 600 affiliates.  Torrealba said he would welcome 
collaboration with the CTV in developing a common agenda for 
negotiating with the GOV, but was not hopeful for progress 
until UNT leadership issues are resolved. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) While it would seem this juncture provides an opening 
for organized labor to recover lost ground, the key actors 
are not prepared or not willing.  Chavez has failed to 
\"revolutionize\" the labor sector in the past and has not 
specifically raised labor in his post-referendum offers of 
reconciliation.  Manuel Cova talks about moving past the 
referendum, but key CTV leaders continue to focus on 
allegations that Chavez stole the election.  Years of 
political battle with the GOV have left the CTV out of touch 
with workers and created the opening for the UNT.  The 
pro-GOV confederation, however, has yet to consolidate its 
power and influence among unions, and could be further 
weakened if UNT elections are scuttled due to in-fighting.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) A Caracas judge ruled August 18 that Baruta Mayor 
Henrique Capriles should stand trial for the events at the 
Cuban Embassy on April 12, 2002. The judge also ruled that 
Capriles should remain in jail. PolOff attempted to attend 
the Capriles trial August 17, but was denied entry as was the 
rest of the public on the grounds that this was a pre-trial 
hearing. Capriles\' lawyers accused the police of attempting 
to intimidate everyone involved in the trial. The GOV knows 
the USG is concerned by the Capriles case; the GOV needs to 
get similar messages from other governments and human rights 
NGOs. End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
Capriles to Trial 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) Eighth Control Court Judge Juan Ramon Leon Villanueva 
ruled on August 18 that Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles should 
stand trial for the crimes he is accused of in relation to 
the events at the Cuban Embassy on April 12, 2002. Judge Leon 
also left in place the detention order against Capriles. The 
case must now be assigned to a trial judge. Caracas Trial 
Judge Beatriz Perez told PolOff August 17 that no trial judge 
would dare to release Capriles now, and that his imprisonment 
was effectively indefinite, due to the political pressure 
surrounding the case. 
 
----------------- 
Judicial Plotting 
----------------- 
 
3.  (C) Capriles\' defense lawyer, Juan Martin Echevarria 
accused Judge Leon of suspending the session August 17 so he 
could consult on the decision with Caracas Judicial Circuit 
President Judge Nelson Chacon, Judge Maikel Moreno, and Judge 
Orangel Garcia. Judge Chacon denied these charges to 
reporters on August 19. Martin told PolOff August 17 that 
Judge Orangel Garcia carried instructions from the GOV to 
judges in the Caracas criminal courts. Martin said the fact 
that two appeals in this case have been assigned to Orangel 
Garcia\'s court was the result of political manipulation of 
the case assignment system. 
 
------------------- 
PolOff Visits Court 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C) PolOff attempted to attend the Capriles trial on 
August 17. The judicial officials who were controlling 
admission to the Control Courts informed PolOff that 
pre-trial hearings are always closed to the public. PolOff 
was allowed access to the corridor where the courts are 
located. Six DISIP agents, two of whom carried M-16 rifles, 
escorted Capriles to the courtroom. Defense lawyer Jose 
Octavio told PolOff it was only the second time that the 
agents had been so heavily armed. He said it was not normal 
for prisoners to be taken to court by armed police, and that 
the display was designed to intimidate everyone involved in 
the case. Capriles appeared healthy, and was not handcuffed. 
The leadership of the Primero Justicia political party waited 
in the hall for several hours for the hearing to end, along 
with lawyers, family and friends. 
 
5.  (C) PolOff expressed USG interest in the case to 
prosecutor Danilo Anderson. The prosecutor, visibly 
uncomfortable, said he would contact PolOff in the future. 
PolOff also approached Capriles\' fellow Primero Justicia 
party leaders to indicate USG interest. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
6.  (C) The Capriles case is both a symbol of opposition 
resistance to Chavez, and a measure of Chavez, willingness 
to use the judicial system to pressure his opponents, 
particularly those associated (in his view) with the April 
2002 coup and the December 2002 strike/sabotage of petroleum 
facilities.  The imprisonment of a defiant Capriles sends a 
very tough message within and without Venezuela.  It is 
unclear how far Chavez will proceed with this case, or with 
the cases of Generals Uson and Poggioli, or the investigation 
of Sumate.  Chavez faces a dilemma:  conviction of Capriles - 
on flimsy or nonexistent evidence - would confirm allegations 
of human rights abuses and political use of the judiciary 
(although Chavez could live with this); releasing him would 
give comfort to an opposition that refuses to recognize the 
referendum results. 
 
7.  (C) The Charge raised the Capriles and Sumate cases with 
Vice President Rangel on July 30.  PolOff,s August 17 
attempt to attend the pre-trial hearing and his talk with 
prosecutor Anderson underscored USG concern about Capriles. 
What Capriles (and others) really need, however, is broader 
international expressions of concern, particularly from Latin 
American countries and also human rights NGOs.

Summary

1. (C) Carter Center and OAS representatives found no merit 
in the arguments made by the opposition that the GoV 
committed fraud in the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  OAS/TCC reps are convinced the audit of 150 
voting tables completed on August 21 was sufficient to 
conclude that the alleged fraud was improbable.  Gaviria said 
the OAS would be willing to review any proof of fraud that

Carter Center Backs Up Audit 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) OAS SYG Cesar Gaviria and the Carter Center\'s Jennifer 
McCoy told reporters August 21 that the results of the August 
19-21 audit of 150 voting tables were compatible with the 
results the National Electoral Council (CNE) had announced. 
Asked by reporters about the opposition\'s allegations of 
fraud, Gaviria and McCoy answered that no evidence of fraud 
had been found in the audit.  The opposition alleges that 
President Hugo Chavez and his supporters committed electronic 
fraud, involving the use of algorithms to manipulate the 
results (septel). 
 
3.  (C) Carter Center technical representative Edgardo Mimica 
explained to poloff August 21 that for the audit the CNE had 
drawn a random sample of 150 of the 12,000 voting tables, 
encompassing 354 voting machines.  The CNE selected the 
sample using its own program and reviewed by the Carter 
Center.  Mimica called the sample was statistically valid 
(nearly 20,000 machines were used in all).  Once the tables 
for audit were identified, Carter Center and OAS observers 
were on-site at 22 regional depots to watch Venezuelan 
military officers find the corresponding boxes with the vote 
receipts from the table in question.  Observers had to resort 
to 28 alternate tables where the boxes had been damaged or 
could not be readily located. 
 
4.  (C) Observers accompanied the boxes to Caracas where CNE 
officials conducted the audit, by counting the paper receipts 
and comparing the results with the tally sheets emitted by 
the voting machines, in the presence of OAS and Carter Center 
observers.  They also made sure the papers and tally sheets 
matched the electoral register which voters signed.  Paper 
receipts had to be separated by machine because most tables 
had only one box for depositing the paper receipts.  When the 
count was off, they pulled boxes from accompanying tables. 
One box, for example, was 50 \"no\" votes short of what was on 
the acta; they resolved it by finding a second box that had 
been used (which poll workers had accidentally mislabeled). 
Mimica said the audit revealed the voting machines varied 
from the paper receipts by only 0.75 votes per machine. 
(Note:  The Coordinadora chose not to participate in the 
audit as opposition leaders were not sure the study would 
address all of their concerns.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Carter Center Recounts Tabulation Drama 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Mimica told PolOff he was present in the CNE control 
room just after midnight on August 16 when CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez invited select international observers to witness 
the tabulation around midnight.  He said Rodriguez stood at 
the door and personally vetted each observer.  Mimica was 
allowed to pass, but he first had to give his fingerprints. 
CNE Directors Mejias and Zamora were present. 
 
5.  (C) Rodriguez made a quick speech and then asked a 
 
 
general for the envelope with the security key, according to 
Mimica.  Rodriguez opened the envelope and entered the code 
to instruct the server that had received transmissions from 
the voting machines to run the tabulation program loaded on a 
second server.  A few moments later, the total showed that 
Chavez had won.  The calculations took a few seconds, said 
Mimica, and the results stunned most of those present. 
Mimica said it was as if a bomb had exploded.  CNE director 
Zamora, he said, turned white.  Mimica said Smartmatic 
President Antonio Mugica, whose company provided the 
electronic voting system, was visibly shocked and asked 
whether the results were confirmed by Carter Center\'s quick 
count.  Mimica said he declined to respond because he did not 
have results yet, but thought it unethical to tell 
Smartmatic.  Mimica said Mugica would \"receive the academy 
award\" if his surprise at the results was an act. 
 
6.  (C) Mimica suspects Rodriguez knew the results before the 
dramatic moment and was making a dramatic show of Chavez\'s 
victory in the presence of Carter and Gaviria.  No observers 
had been allowed in the room all night, he said.  He 
speculated that it was possible for Rodriguez to have entered 
the code and seen the results, then reset the second server. 
Alternatively, he posited, Rodriguez could have queried the 
backup control room at the Banesco building.  Mimica said he 
thought it likely Chavez already knew the results before 
Rodriguez mounted his show. 
 
7.  (C) Mimica does not believe there was fraud.  He did not 
think it possible to re-program the machines remotely (they 
are two-way because the machine has to handshake with the 
server).  He confirmed that the machines were only plugged in 
to transmit the results, which took only a couple of minutes 
at the most.  He did, however, credit Comando Maisanta 
technology chief Nelson Merentes\' manipulation of the process 
with the Chavez win.  Mimica, who was the liaison with 
Maisanta during the campaign, said he met with Merentes at 
least six times.  Merentes bragged beforehand that he had 
done a study on how to win the election and had extremely 
detailed information on the voting records and tendencies of 
every pueblito.  Mimica noted that Merentes had been able to 
influence the CNE on multiple occasions to make rules that 
benefited Maisanta\'s strategy, for example, trying to 
disqualify any poll worker who had signed the petitions in 
favor of the referendum.  When it became apparent it was too 
late to dump the workers and train new pro-Chavez ones, 
Merentes focused on changing local electoral boards which 
then gave Chavez supporters control over them.  Mimica made 
clear that Merentes\' manipulation was designed to slice off 
opposition votes:  it may have been highly unethical, but it 
did not rise to electoral fraud. 
 
--------------------------- 
OAS Convinced of Chavez Win 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (C) OAS chief observer Edgardo Ries told Poloffs August 22 
he is sure no fraud had been committed.  Ries, who has 
observed several recent elections in Venezuela, said this one 
was \"the most transparent\" in comparison to others under 
Chavez\'s administration, and certainly better than the 1998 
election when Chavez won the first time.  There were many 
\"unjust but not illegal\" maneuvers by the GoV, he said, but 
they did not need to steal the election.  He said it is 
\"improbable\" that the GoV was able to fool the random 
selection of boxes audited by OAS/TCC by replacing contents. 
He asserted that the GoV would have had to find all the 
infected boxes (amounting to 1.5 million votes), count them, 
and then replace the \"si\" votes with the appropriate amount 
of \"no\" votes. 
 
9.  (C) Ries said the August 19-21 audit settled the charge 
that someone had tampered with the machines because the 
random check of the paper receipts found no inconsistencies. 
He also said it was improbable the military would have had 
time to change the contents of the boxes in the three days 
between the election and the audit.  He discounted opposition 
allegations that algorithms to change the results were 
 
 
imbedded in electoral software, saying that such 
manipulations would have been revealed by the audit.  The 
sample for the audit, he said, was drawn from the universe of 
nearly 20,000 machines.  It was not, however, a stratified 
sample, which would have broken the universe down into sub 
units -- states -- and then selected randomly among them. 
Two (unspecified) states, therefore, were not covered. 
 
10.  (C) Ries asserted that there was no computer hacking 
because the system because the voting machines were not 
inter-connected and only connected to the CANTV dedicated 
telephone network for a short period to transmit data.  He 
dismissed opposition exit polls that showed a strong 
opposition lead as unscientific because interviewees are not 
selected by social class.  Ries concluded that this election 
was the \"most transparent\" one he had seen in Venezuela. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Coordinadora Establishes Fraud Commission 
----------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) To document and back up its allegations that fraud 
was committed in the August 15 referendum, the Coordinadora 
Democratica has established a commission headed by 
constitutional expert Tulio Alvarez.  At the moment, 
according to Coordinadora representative Enrique Naime, there 
are two other organizations working seriously on the 
allegations -- Sumate and Gente de Petroleo (Note:  Gente de 
Petroleo\'s Juan Fernandez told poloff August 24 he is working 
closely with the Coordinadora commission, though he is 
getting assistance from computer experts in his 
organization.).  Naime likened it to salvagers who have seen 
a treasure ship sink and each is competing to be the first to 
find the treasure. 
 
12.  (C) Although Miranda State Gov. Enrique Mendoza spoke of 
the commission as a done deal in his meeting with Ambassador 
August 20, some important actors such as former Supreme 
Electoral Council president Carlos Delgado are not yet on 
board, according to Jorge Casado who will be acting as 
executive secretary for the commission.  Casado and Naime 
acknowledged that another problem the Coordinadora faces is 
the proliferation of fraud theories and persons attracted to 
the camera lights.  While the Coordinadora may succeed in 
clarifying the various theories and supporting the arguments, 
they said, controlling the voices is much more difficult. 
 
13.  (C) Casado said the Coordinadora\'s goal is to produce a 
convincing case file and present it when it is ready, not in 
reaction to some external event, e.g., the OAS meeting August 
24.  He and Naime welcomed the opening that Gaviria had left 
for the opposition when he said they would be willing to 
receive documentation of the opposition\'s allegations 
whenever they were ready. 
 
14.  (U) Sumate representatives Alejandro Plaz and Maria 
Corina Machado told reporters August 23 that they were not 
trying to prove whether fraud occurred, but were trying to 
find the truth so that all doubts could be erased.  They 
restated their concerns about the process based on the fact 
the exit polls were so radically different from the results 
as announced by the CNE.  Plaz said Sumate was investigating 
hundreds of complaints it had received and was consulting 
with several national and international academics, and would 
eventually present its findings.  Machado made several 
suggestions for how to improve the transparency of the voting 
process for future votes and to restore credibility to the 
electoral process.  These suggestions included: 
--Replacing all five CNE directors; 
--Making the vote manual and conduct a recount of all of the 
votes immediately following the vote; 
--Auditing all stages of the voting process (the notebooks, 
the urns, the ballots, etc.); and 
--Ensuring international observers are given unrestricted 
access to all phases of the vote and all offices necessary to 
adequately monitor the process.

Comment 
------- 
 
15.  (C) The international observers\' validation of the CNE\'s 
audit of the August 15 results practically closes the 
referendum chapter for Venezuela.  Although Chavez opponents 
will strive to build a case to support the allegations of 
fraud, internal divisions, competing theories and doubts 
whether any one of the allegations significantly altered the 
results will hobble their efforts.  And, the opposition has 
provided no evidence, and no theory to convince the Carter 
Center/OAS observers. 
 
16.  (C) On their side, Chavez and his supporters have the 
momentum thanks to early, and now repeated, validation of the 
results by the Carter Center and the OAS.  Ironically, the 
GoV had tried to limit the role of the OAS and Carter Center 
prior to the referendum, but now touts their endorsement of 
the results as the blessing of the international community. 
Gaviria, more so than Carter, left the possibility of fraud 
open, in the sense that he said there was no evidence of 
fraud, but that the would review anything new that the 
opposition might uncover.  Many in the opposition, however, 
were disappointed with the observers\' role in post-referendum 
events, feeling as if Carter and Gaviria were more in a hurry 
to leave town than to investigate fraud allegations.  The 
opposition sees similarities with what they view as the OAS\'s 
validation of the flawed 2000 elections in Peru.  The 
Coordinadora would have to unearth convincing proof of 
electronic fraud, elusive so far, to impact on the Carter 
Center/OAS evaluation of the referendum.

Summary 
--------- 
 
1.  (C) Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputies William Lara 
(Miranda) and Jose Khan (Caracas), told poloffs August 23 
that they hoped to devise a plan for reconciliation in the 
National Assembly.  Lara and Khan had avoided EMbassy contact 
for almost a year.  They also expressed objections to 
postponing the regional elections, and optimism about 
prospects for improving US-Venezuela relations.  The deputies 
were distrustful of the opposition and of the USG, which 
indicates the likely strict limits to any dialogue.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Reconciliation is possible. . . to an extent 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Poloffs met with Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) 
Deputies William Lara (Miranda) and Jose Khan (Caracas) 
August 23 to discuss the government\'s ideas about 
reconciliation with the opposition and the US Government, and 
to gain insight into the government\'s strategy for the 
regional elections.  Lara and Khan said that government 
legislators were hoping to devise a common legislative agenda 
with opposition deputies that could be used as the starting 
point for reconciliation.  The two examples they gave were 
the law that would regulate disbursement of federal funds to 
state and municipal governments, and the formation of the 
federal government council that would direct federally funded 
development projects nationwide.  To be able to reach this 
common ground, however, Khan said there would have to be an 
agreement on protocol rules for the National Assembly in 
which opposition deputies would agree not to filibuster or 
hinder the passage of bills within the Assembly.  In apparent 
contradiction to the possibility of reconciliation, Lara said 
there were other initiatives that the MVR knew it would have 
to push on its own, such as the appointment of judges to the 
Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), the media content law, and 
the national police law.  He also made clear the GOV would 
not/not negotiate with any opposition leaders who would not 
accept the results of the presidential referendum. 
 
--------------------- 
Plans for the future 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C) When asked about the plan for deepening the 
revolution that President Hugo Chavez announced in his Alo 
Presidente program August 22 (septel), Khan explained that 
the government would begin investigating corruption charges 
lodged against government officials, including Chavez\'s 
cabinet members.  He said the party realized that one of the 
problems in implementing the 1999 Constitution was the 
rampant corruption that existed among those who had lost 
sight of the revolution.  The investigations would include a 
review of the social missions and their efficiency as well. 
(Comment: On August 25, Social Development Fund (FIDES) head 
Elias Jaua told the press he had asked the Fiscalia to 
investigate 10 of his staff for corruption.) 
 
------------------------------- 
No Delay in Regional Elections 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Turning to the regional elections, Lara was adamant 
that the regional elections be held 26 September as 
scheduled, unless a postponement was needed for technical 
reasons.  Lara argued the date should stand because the CNE 
does not have the legal authority to extend the terms of the 
governors and mayors in office.  In addition, Lara admitted, 
politically it would be more expedient for his party to hold 
elections to take advantage of the \"coattail effect\" produced 
in the wake of Chavez\'s victory.  Lara asserted with 
certainty that Coordinadora leader Governor Enrique Mendoza 
was finished politically and would be defeated by Diosdado 
Cabello in Miranda.  He said gubernatorial candidates Gen. 
 
(Ret.) Alberto Gutierrez (Zulia) and Gen. (Ret.) Luis Felipe 
Acosta Carles (Carabobo) would have tough races, given that 
the opposition incumbents can count on Chavista cross-over 
votes in their favor. 
 
-------------------- 
Bilateral Relations 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Lara and Khan expressed optimism that US-Venezuela 
relations would improve in the wake of the referendum, but 
alleged U.S. reluctance to recognize the results.  Both 
raised allegations that the CIA is conspiring to destabilize 
Venezuela.  Lara claimed former President Bush (sic) called 
President Chavez to congratulate him on his victory in the 
referendum, taking it as a positive sign that relations would 
improve.  Lara offered two areas for cooperation -- illegal 
drugs and terrorism -- and added that elements of the USG 
seem intent on impugning or at least not recognizing 
Venezuela\'s contributions.  Lara also recommended that the 
USG convince the opposition to drop its fraud allegations and 
accept the government\'s offer to dialogue. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) Lara had avoided contact with the U.S. Embassy for 
eight months, so we interpret his newfound interest in 
meeting poloffs as part of the GOV\'s post-referendum 
reassessment of bilateral relations.  The deputies\' attitude 
toward the opposition raises doubts about the Chavistas\' 
interest in a sincere give-and-take with the opposition. 
Their persistent suspicions about USG plotting in Venezuela 
indicates that while the GOV has turned down the volume on 
its criticism of the USG, it maintains its perspective.

Summary

1. (U) President Hugo Chavez announced his intentions to 
deepen the \"revolution\" and disqualified the Coordinadora 
Democratica as a legitimate political opposition during his 
5-hour television show \"Alo, Presidente\" on August 22. 
During the program, Chavez also designated Andres Izarra, the 
Press Secretary at the Venezuelan Embassy in the United 
States, as the new Minister of Communication and Information, 
replacing Jesse Chacon, who he named Minister of Interior and 
Justice.  Chavez briefly mentioned the USG, reading a U.S. 
newspaper editorial and in conjunction with international 
observers\' comments.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Strengthening the Revolution 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez used his weekly televised \"Alo, 
Presidente\" program August 22 to outline his plans for moving 
forward and deepening the \"revolution\", which included 
increasing governance and decreasing corruption.  Chavez said 
he would push for the approval of the \"Social Responsibility 
Law for Radio and Television\" that imposes limits on private 
media and gives the government more control over it.  \"This 
should not be seen as a threat, but as a guarantee for more 
order.  This will increase governance,\" Chavez said.  While 
Chavez asserted that this would help prevent radio and 
television transmissions used to incite \"terrorist or 
destabilizing\" acts, the Venezuelan independent media refers 
to the proposed legislation as a \"gag law.\" 
 
3. (U) Chavez invited public officials to eliminate 
corruption and do their jobs honestly so as to end all 
similarities to the \"Fourth Republic.\"  He said the National 
Assembly needed to move forward and appoint the new judges to 
the Supreme Court, which is currently comprised of 20 judges. 
 Chavez said this would, \"take the courts out of corrupt 
hands.\"  Opposition members, however, say that this will 
effectively give Chavez control of the court system. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Chavez Disavows the Democratic Coordinator 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Since the Coordinadora Democratica continues to allege 
fraud in the referendum, despite announcements to the 
contrary from the Carter Center and Organization of American 
States (OAS), Chavez said he does not recognize the 
Coordinadora.  Chavez said, \"We cannot dialog with those who 
do not recognize the Constitution, the people.\"  Chavez 
called for \"new leaders\" of the opposition to step forward -- 
governors, mayors or business leaders who are \"serious\" and 
recognized the results of a democratic election.  Chavez said 
that despite his win the \"rich\" should not worry because 
their rights are guaranteed.  \"This is a revolution of love, 
not one filled with hate, nor blood, nor death, nor is it a 
revolution that ignores the rights of others.  What we can is 
national unity, debate; the transformation of what the word 
\"revolution\" means,\" Chavez said. 
 
------------------- 
Cabinet Reshuffled 
------------------- 
 
5. (U) Chavez also designated Andres Izarra, a journalist and 
the Press Secretary at the Venezuelan Embassy in the United 
States, as the new Minister of Communication and Information. 
 Izzarra will replace Jesse Chacon who Chavez named the new 
Minister of Interior and Justice.  The former Minister of 
Interior and Justice, Lucas Rincon, was praised by Chavez 
during his national address, but has not been appointed to a 
new position by the President. 
 
----------- 
USG Ignored 
----------- 
 
6. (U) Chavez briefly mentioned the USG.  He read a 
translation of a \"LA Times\" editorial which said the USG had 
 
supported the coup d\'etat in 2002 but was now going to work 
with Chavez.  While talking about receiving recognition from 
the Carter Center and OAS, Chavez also said, \"The Bush 
government honored their word (recognized the results of the 
referendum).\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Rincon struck most of the diplomatic corps as a loon. 
Chacon, a trusted former co-conspirator in the 1992 coup, is 
more competent, suggesting Chavez wants more from the 
Interior (police) Ministry.  Chavez was clear that he is 
increasing his hold and influence on Venezuelan institutions. 
 His vow to deepen the revolution ostensibly focuses on 
reducing corruption and increasing MVR and GOV honesty 
(septel).  Chavez is also poised to increase government 
ability to control private radio and television stations 
should the media bill become law.  Chavez\' very brief mention 
of the USG contrasts with his pre-referendum attacks against 
the U.S.

OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
1.  (U) Venezuela\'s most recently published economic 
indicators illustrate an economic rebound based on 
increasing government expenditures.  Levels of new foreign 
direct investment remain low.  A strong international 
reserves position and high average oil prices have 
contributed to reduce the country risk and facilitated the 
partial public external debt refinancing. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
--------------- 
 
2.  (U) Total GDP increased by 23.1 percent in real terms 
during the period January-June of 2004 compared with the 
levels of economic activity registered during the same 
period of the previous year.  This is explained by depressed 
activity during the first quarter of 2003 because of the 
general strike that took place during December 2002-January 
2003.  Nonetheless, GDP growth for 2004 could be more than 
10 percent, driven by the increase in 2004 public 
expenditures.  The Ministry of Finance is now predicting 
2004 GDP growth of 12 percent.

3.  (U) First semester 2004 figures from the National

unemployment rate of 16.6 percent.  This figure represents 
2.00 million unemployed out of a labor force of 12.04 
million, and a total population of 25.86 million.  INE\'s 
figures are disputed by the private sector.  According to 
Consecomercio (National Retail and Services Council, 
representing the trade and services sector), the real 
unemployment rate in Venezuela exceeds 20 percent and 
affects some 2.4 million.  Shifts in the work force from the 
formal to the informal sector of the economy, which accounts 
for more than a half of the occupied working labor force, 
have mitigated unemployment to some extent.

OIL PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) The total value of oil exports reached USD 15.05 
billion during the first semester of 2004 with an average 
export price of USD 30.43 per barrel.  Venezuela\'s OPEC 
production quota has been 2.99 million barrels a day since 
August 1, 2004.  Venezuela\'s oil production has been below 
the quota, according to OPEC figures.  Oil prices 
(Venezuelan basket) have been increasing during 2004, 
reaching a record high of USD 39.52 per barrel during the 
third week of August.

MONEY SUPPLY/M2 
--------------- 
 
5.  (U) Monetary liquidity increased 57.5 percent during 
2003, largely as a result of exchange controls.  This is the 
highest annual increase of the money supply in the last six 
years.  Most of the excess liquidity accumulated in the 
economy during these months was withdrawn by the BCV by 
allocating government bonds and certificates of deposits to 
domestic banks.  Liquidity continued growing during the 
first half of 2004 as government expenditures increased.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (U) The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) reported that 
consumer prices for the Caracas metropolitan area rose 21.8 
percent from July 2003 to July 2004.  Consumer prices lagged 
 
producer prices, however, as wholesale prices increased by 
30.6 percent during the same period.  (Note: The GOV imposed 
price controls February 11, 2003 on some primary food items, 
pharmaceuticals, and personal care products as a complement 
to the exchange control regime.) Core inflation removes the 
most volatile categories from the CPI.

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
7.  (U) Interest rates reported by the Central Bank in 2004 
continue the downward trend of 2003.  Excess liquidity 
arising from the strict application of exchange controls was 
the most important cause of this trend.  However, credit 
card consumption, mortgages, and car loan rates have been 
kept at levels that are more than double the average loan 
rate for most consumers.  The spread between lending and 
deposit rates decreased from 6.59 percent in January 2004 to 
5.55 percent in July 2004.

EXCHANGE RATES AND BCV LIQUIDATIONS 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) The exchange control system pegged the bolivar at 
1,600/USD on February 5, 2003.  One year later, on February 7, 
2004, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank devalued the 
Bolivar 20 percent, to 1,920.00.  The National Exchange Control 
Administration (CADIVI) oversees all official foreign exchange 
transactions.  With CADIVI not supplying enough foreign exchange 
to fully meet demand, and the exchange rate remaining fixed 
 
despite internal inflation, a parallel market, in which dollars 
are traded at a substantial premium, has developed.  Official 
forex transaction, however, have increased dramatically in recent 
months.  The parallel market exchange rate closed at around 
2,800/USD by the middle of August 2004.

9.  (U) Non-oil exports increased 45.8 percent during 
January-June 2004 compared with the same period of last 
year.  (There were no exports during the general strike in 
January 2003.) According to the INE, exports of base metals 
(aluminum, steel, and others) accounted for 34.6 percent of 
total non-oil exports for the period January-May 2004, 
followed by mineral products (29.2 percent), and chemicals 
(14.7 percent).  The United States was the largest recipient 
of Venezuela\'s non-oil exports (38.0 percent), followed by 
Colombia (12.1 percent), and Mexico (5.2 percent).  Imports 
increased by 67.8 percent during January-June 2004 compared 
with the same period of last year.  2003 figures reflect the 
general strike of December 2002 - February 2003, and the 
fact that the approvals of foreign exchange during the first 
months of 2003, when exchange controls were put into place, 
were very slow.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 
------------------- 
 
10.  (U) Venezuela\'s balance of payments registered a 
surplus of USD 1.90 billion during the first semester of 
2004, compared with a surplus of USD 2.65 billion during the 
same period of last year.  Higher oil prices, exchange 
 
controls, and the resulting fall in imports and capital 
flights contributed to these results.  BCV Director Armando 
Leon, in comments to the press on August 2, projected a 
balance of payments surplus of USD 6-7 billion for the whole 
year 2004 if oil prices do not decrease during the rest of 
the year.

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES

11.  (U) BCV-held international reserves increased nearly 
continuously after exchange controls were imposed in 
February 2003 until May 2004.  PDVSA\'s sales of dollars to 
the Central Bank were suspended in order to direct oil 
revenues to a USD 2.0 billion Social Development Fund, the 
creation of which has been very controversial.  The reserves 
dropped USD 2,509 million on August 2, after PDVSA completed 
the buyback of part of its external debt.

12.  (U) Total ordinary expenditures increased by 81.3 
percent during the period January-May 2004 in comparison 
with the same period of last year.  Increased spending 
during 2004 has continued the same trend of expansion 
initiated in mid-2003.  This has been possible because of 
stronger oil prices, as well as higher collection of 
internal taxes.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT 
------------------ 
 
13.  (U) The government actively refinanced its domestic and 
external debts during 2003.  Domestic bonds and treasury 
promissory notes dramatically increased both in the share of 
domestic banks\' portfolio holdings and in the share of the 
GOV\'s debt.  During March 2004, the Ministry of Finance 
allocated bonds for the equivalent of USD 3.0 billion, of 
which one third were USD denominated with maturity in six 
months, while the rest were in local currency with 
maturities in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

14.  (U) Credit demand increased during the first semester 
of 2004 as a result of the rebound of the economy, although 
at a lower level than 2002.  The percentage of past due 
loans decreased from December 2003 to June 2004.  This 
figure has been decreasing since 2002 as banks have been 
cleaning up their credit portfolios, declaring more of the 
past due loans as outright losses.

CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 
---------------------------- 
 
16.  (U) The Caracas Stock Exchange (CSE) index closed at a 
record high of 28,595.46 on August 13, 2004, which was the 
working day just before the Presidential Referendum, 
increasing 28.8 percent from its close in December.  A 
primary catalyst in this rise is the use of CSE shares to 
acquire American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock 
Exchange that are then used as foreign exchange vehicles. 
However, the CSE has also benefited from the lack of other 
investment opportunities in the broader economy.

SUBJECT: OPPOSITION REFERENDUM FRAUD THEORIES 
 
 
Classified By: Abelardo A. Arias, Acting Deputy Chief of Mission, for R 
easons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Venezuelan opposition has developed theories -- 
though no solid evidence -- of alleged fraud and 
irregularities in the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  Among the theories, mathematicians have proposed 
that the election results were manipulated using a 
pre-determined percentage by state and a cap on \"Si\" votes 
that added votes to the pro-Chavez \"No\" option.  At the 
operative level, Chavez opponents charge, there was lack of 
appropriate custody over the software used to program voting 
machines and an unexplained 17-minute failure of the CANTV 
transmission network at a critical time.  The GOV\'s alleged 
manipulation of the electoral registry before August 15, the 
bulge in the electoral registry a month before the 
referendum, and unusual changes in poll workers immediately 
before also boost the opposition\'s doubts about the 
referendum.  While the opposition\'s theories, if true, would 
indicate manipulation and irregularities on a large scale, 
none alone would appear to be of sufficient magnitude to 
change the results.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Fraud Theories Abound 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) In the wake of the opposition\'s 40-60 defeat in the 
August 15 recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez, 
fraud and conspiracy theories have proliferated. 
Coordinadora representative and Gente de Petroleo leader Juan 
Fernandez laid out the principal arguments to poloff on 
August 24.  There are two mathematical observations that to 
the Coordinadora suggest electoral fraud: 
 
-- \"2,1,0\"  The opposition claims a state-level analysis 
suggests that each state was assigned one of three possible 
percentage outcomes (mathematically expressed as a 2,1,0 
series).  States with high opposition support, for example, 
were assigned a closer percentage split between the \"Si\" and 
\"No\" votes (prejudicing the \"Si\" votes); areas with lower 
opposition support were assigned wider spreads that gave more 
votes to \"No\" than were actually cast. 
 
-- \"El Tope\"  Some mathematicians looking at the voting 
machine level note an unusually high recurrence of similar 
numbers (affecting between 3,000 and 4,000 machines) for the 
\"Si\" votes, leading them to conclude that a cap (\"tope\") had 
been applied.  According to this theory, votes cast for \"Si\" 
in excess of this cap were applied to the \"No\" option, which 
did surprisingly well in some pro-opposition strongholds. 
Fernandez said the mathematicians believe that the cap and 
\"2,1,0\" phenomena are connected.  Fernandez also said that 
mathematicians confirmed evidence of tampering by applying 
the \"Law of the First Digit\" (aka Benford\'s Law), the same 
mathematical principle used to detect Enron\'s manipulation of 
energy markets. 
 
3. (C) Constitutional lawyer Tulio Alvarez_, who is leading 
the Coordinadora\'s special commission to document the alleged 
fraud, told reporters August 22 the mathematical phenomena 
would have been undetectable had it not been for the 
unprecedented 27 percent abstention rates.  The high voter 
turnout, he claimed, forced many more \"topes\" to be imposed 
by the machines than what was previously planned. 
 
CNE Response:  Jorge Rodriguez told reporters August 17 that 
it is expected that voting tables would have similar results. 
 In presenting examples to support his argument, he showed 
data from similar tables, not/not from the voting machines, 
which misrepresented the opposition\'s argument about similar 
results at the machine level. 
 
International Observers Response:  The Carter Center\'s 
Jennifer McCoy told reporters August 17 that the cap 
 
phenomenon could be seen among \"No\" results as well.  McCoy 
later sent a letter to the Coordinadora August 26 stating 
that, after consulting a Stanford mathematician and a 
Bolivian pollster, the Carter Center concluded that the 
recurrence of similar numbers is statistically probable.  The 
OAS\'s Edgardo Ries told poloff August 21 that similar results 
in a voting center tends to reinforce the validity of the 
results; it would have been more suspect had voting machines 
in the same electoral precinct varied substantially. 
Comment:  Post does not have the expertise to judge the merit 
of these mathematical arguments. 
 
--------------------- 
Ghosts in the Machine 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) Fernandez gave two possible explanations for how the 
mathematical manipulation was carried out.  Either the 
software had been tampered with, he said, or the data 
transmission was compromised.  Fernandez complained that the 
CNE had not given them full access.  He claims Coordinadora 
informatics specialists were only given limited access to 
portions of the code.  Coordinadora representatives also 
charged publicly that the CNE distributed thousands of 
machines to centers prior to the audit. 
 
CNE/Smartmatic Response:  The CNE\'s Rodriguez said publicly 
the Coordinadora had full access to the software used to 
program the machines and had representatives present when the 
machines were individually programmed before being sent to 
the field.  Smartmatic officials told emboffs in June that 
the CNE and political actors would have access (read-only 
copies) to only about five percent of the total code used to 
operate the machines, principally because of proprietary 
reasons.  Mugica said the CNE and political actors would be 
allowed to audit -- but would not be able to alter -- the 
relevant codes for tabulating votes thanks to a three-step 
verification process within the company to certify the 
software was as advertised.  Smartmatic officials claim the 
programs exhibit a unique digital signature that would be 
altered had the source code been altered.  Smartmatic 
President Antonio Mugica told poloff August 18 his company 
had given the Coordinadora copies of the digital signature of 
every machine to check the authenticity. 
 
International Observer Response:  Observers were not present 
for most of the software development process, though they 
have publicly expressed confidence in the performance of the 
voting machines. 
 
Comment:  It appears likely the Coordinadora did not have 
sufficient participation in the development and loading of 
the software and transportation of the machines to voting 
centers, making manipulation a possibility.  Also, the audit 
of the machines was a one-day affair with a sample of 
machines.  Some 14,000 of the more than 19,000 machines had 
already been distributed around the country. 
 
5. (C) Fernandez also called into question an unexplained 
outage of the CANTV transmission network between 8:12 and 
8:29 p.m. on election night.  A Venezuelan judge documented 
it at CANTV\'s request.  According to Fernandez, CANTV said it 
could not account for the data transmission of at least 200 
machines, though Fernandez believes there were more. 
Fernandez said that since the voting machines can receive 
data as well as transmit, it was possible for a \"phantom 
server\" to intercept the data and send altered data to the 
CNE as well as back to the voting machine. 
 
Smartmatic Response:  Mugica claimed his machines cannot be 
remotely re-programmed and noted that the machines are only 
connected to the network for transmission, amounting to no 
more than two minutes per machine. 
 
International Observer Response:  OAS and Carter Center 
observers found no evidence of manipulation, though Carter 
Center observer Edgardo Mimica confirmed the outage had taken 
place.  Observers did not perform audits of CNE servers 
handling the information. 
 
Comment:  CNE rules had the transmission taking place 
before/before the tally sheets were printed.  The timing is 
significant because CNE Director Rodriguez announced at 7:50 
p.m. that polling stations would stay open until midnight, 
instead of 8:00 p.m. as previously announced.  As CNE public 
announcements are notorious for not filtering down to the 
voting centers, it is likely that many of the 19,662 voting 
machines attempted to connect to the network a few minutes 
after 8:00 p.m., coinciding with the reported blackout.  This 
fact is significant in that only voting machines closing at 
8:00 p.m. would have been affected, and might not be detected 
by the two supposedly random samples taken by the CNE for 
audit purposes. 
 
-------------- 
1-2-Switcharoo 
-------------- 
 
6. (C) A few press reports surfaced on election day that some 
voters noticed on their paper receipt that their \"Si\" vote 
was preceded by the number Q\" rather than the number \"2\", 
the code assigned to the \"Si\" option. 
 
CNE/Smartmatic Response:  Smartmatic officials said such an 
occurrence was impossible. 
 
International Observer Response:  Both Mimica and OAS chief 
observer Edgardo Reis told poloff they did not find any such 
cases in the 354 machines audited. 
 
Comment:  This alleged fraud was the product of election day 
rumors.  It probably had some resonance later among Chavez 
opponents because the results announced by the CNE were the 
reverse of what exit polls showed. 
--------------------------------- 
Masters of The Electoral Universe 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Coordinadora also goes back to the weeks before 
the election with its theories and allegations when the 
electoral registry plumped up by an unprecedented two million 
new voters in the two months before the referendum, 
attributed mainly to the GOV\'s massive identity card/voter 
registration drive.  Coordinadora electoral chief Amado 
Dounia estimated prior to the election that a registry of 12 
million would give the opposition 3.8 million votes, just 
over the threshold needed to recall Chavez.  He estimated the 
GOV would get just 3.4 million voters, using available 
polling data and time studies of the election procedures. 
The addition of two million new voters (from mostly pro-GOV 
social classes), however, changed his analysis to show a 
possible GOV victory. 
 
8. (C) Dounia doubted the new voters actually turned out to 
vote based on his tracking of the flow of voters on election 
day.  The Coordinadora\'s network of witnesses at each table 
reported that nearly seven million people had voted by 9:00 
p.m. on election day.  By midnight, however, the system was 
projecting 10 million voters.  Three million additional votes 
in three hours, Dounia estimated, would have required all 
machines to be working at a rate of one minute per vote, much 
faster than what had generally been observed during that 
time.  Dounia suggests that the new voters were fraudulently 
added en masse to the \"No\" option late in electoral day.  He 
had no theory, however, for how such a fraud could be carried 
out. 
 
9. (C) Dounia also told poloff that the CNE changed voting 
centers for some 300,000 voters just days before the 
election.  Forty thousand of these voters were able to 
correct the problem, but the remaining 260,000 voters were 
forced to go to centers far from home or to abstain from 
voting.  Dounia accused the CNE of intentionally trying to 
eliminate \"Yes\" votes using this method.  The quantity could 
have been important, he noted, were it a tight race. 
Additionally, Chavez opponents allege that last minute 
changes of poll workers affected the efficiency of voting 
centers. 
 
CNE/Smartmatic Response:  The electoral registry was a source 
of contention within the CNE.  CNE Director Rodriguez even 
filed charges against fellow Director Sobella Mejias because 
the latter allegedly had failed to expunge thousands of 
deceased persons from the registry.  The pro-opposition 
Mejias claimed she had been shut out of changes to the 
registry. 
 
International Observers:  The Carter Center\'s Mimica told 
poloff privately the last minute changes to the electoral 
registry were unfair, though the observers did not criticize 
the CNE publicly. 
 
Comment:  The GOV\'s \"Mission Identity\" to give identity cards 
to millions of Venezuelans and foreigners had few controls to 
ensure integrity of the cards, the only proof needed to vote. 
 The CNE was a doormat to the new names presented by Mission 
Identity, pouring them into the electoral registry.  Also, 
some 200,000 names were added to the registry days after it 
was closed.  Coordinadora representatives complained to 
emboffs that the registry was changing daily even the week 
before the referendum.  The GOV\'s manipulation of the 
registry was a significant factor in Chavez\'s victory. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) We do not know whether the opposition\'s allegations, 
if they turn out to be true, would sufficiently alter the 
results to overturn Chavez\'s victory.  No one theory alone 
appears to be of sufficient magnitude to be a silver bullet. 
The technical arguments raised by the opposition will have to 
be evaluated by experts in light of realities of the voting 
system.  International observation, though imperfect, did not 
detect any evidence that would support the opposition\'s 
claims, but then again, these would not be things readily 
evident to persons eyeing the process at the voting 
precincts.  Some opposition allegations would require a 
significant number of accomplices in the CNE, the military, 
Smartmatic and even CANTV.  It seems reasonable that 
Smartmatic and CANTV, both firms that have an interest in 
avoiding allegations of impropriety, would probably not risk 
company health by engaging in fraud.  This would not rule 
out, however, the actions of specific employees, and in fact, 
the opposition\'s theories aim more at the GOV and the CNE, 
not the companies.  Chavez opponents remain intent, 
nonetheless, on swimming against the strong tide of opinion 
blessed by international election observer organizations.

make a formal request to the Attorney General to get 
information for the Human Rights Report. Boscan promised to 
begin compiling the information as soon as we faxed her a

2.  (C) PolOff went to see Alis Boscan, Director of the 
Office for the Protection of Fundamental Rights at the 
Attorney General\'s office, on August 26 to request her 
cooperation in providing statistics on human rights abuses in 
Venezuela. Boscan\'s office is in charge of overseeing 
investigations into human rights abuses by public officials 
in Venezuela. Boscan was extremely defensive, asking for 
proof that the office had cooperated in the past, and 
accusing the State Department of taking statistics off the 
internet and claiming they came from the Attorney General\'s 
office.

4.  (C) Boscan said that she understood our request, and that 
we would have to make a formal request to the Attorney 
General for statistics on human rights abuses, and 
information on specific cases. Boscan said we could fax her 
the note and she would begin to prepare the information while 
the official request made its way through the bureaucracy.

5.  (C) It will not be easy to get GOV officials to cooperate 
in the elaboration of the human rights report. Boscan was 
clearly nervous about having to deal with the Embassy, and 
was defensive and negative from the start. We expect similar 
reactions from the Ministry of Interior and Human Rights 
Ombudsman\'s office.

IMMEDIATE GROWTH 
 
REF: CARACAS 2594 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard Sanders; for reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d) 
 
 ------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The prospects for additional Venezuelan oil 
production in the short term come from the four projects that 
produce synthetic crude from Venezuela\'s abundant resources 
of extra heavy crude.  We calculate that Venezuela\'s syncrude 
production could increase to as much as 634,000 b/d by the 
end of 2004.  Interest in new projects is building and some 
local industry observers believe we may see up to $10-12 
billion in new projects signed in Venezuela in the next year, 
primarily representing new investments in extra heavy crude 
extraction.  International oil companies are exploring new 
economic models to accommodate the higher royalty rate 
demanded by the GOV.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The most important developments affecting Venezuelan 
production levels in the short term are likely to occur in 
the four \"Strategic Association\" projects that convert the 
extra heavy crude of Venezuela\'s Orinoco heavy oil belt to 
lighter, sweeter synthetic crude, or syncrude.  In 2003, we 
calculate that these projects produced about 415,000 b/d of 
syncrude. 
 
------ 
HAMACA 
------ 
 
3. (C) As reported reftel, the upgrader of the Hamaca project 
(ChevronTexaco/ConocoPhillips/PDVSA), the fourth and last of 
the Strategic Associations is due to come on line in 
September.  ChevronTexaco President for Latin America 
Upstream Ali Moshiri confirmed to econoff August 16 that the 
mechanical completion of the facility occurred on August 12. 
He also said there will be crude moving through the upgrader 
on September 1.  While it will take some time for the 
facility to reach full production levels, by the end of 2004 
the Hamaca project should increase its current field 
production of extra heavy crude from 120,000 b/d to 190,000 
b/d for a syncrude yield of 180,000 b/d. 
 
----------- 
CERRO NEGRO 
----------- 
 
4. (C) ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark Ward informed 
econoff in a July 22 conversation that he was hopeful that 
ExxonMobil would soon receive approval from the GOV to 
proceed with debottlenecking the Cerro Negro 
(ExxonMobil/PDVSA) project upgrader.  This process, if 
started in early 2005 as Ward hopes, would yield a 20 percent 
increase in the through-put of the upgrader by the first 
quarter of 2006.  Currently, the Cerro Negro field produces 
120,000 b/d of extra heavy crude for 110,000 b/d of syncrude, 
so the debottlenecking would allow an increase of field 
production to approximately 145,000 b/d for a yield of 
132,000 b/d of syncrude. 
 
---------- 
PETROZUATA 
---------- 
 
5. (C) In addition, ConocoPhillips announced to the press 
early this month that Petrozuata (ConocoPhillips/PDVSA) had 
processed nearly 150,000 b/d of extra heavy crude into 
approximately 140,000 b/d of syncrude in July.  \"The new 
level was achieved through operational and technological 
improvements which gave the Petrozuata upgrader a new 
sustainable plateau of 140,000 b/d,\" said the statement. 
ExxonMobil\'s Mark Ward, however, asserted to econoff that 
Petrozuata had \"pulled a fast one,\" and expanded its 
production capacity without GOV approval.  According to Ward, 
Petrozuata\'s production level should nominally be at 130,000 
but is actually at 160,000 b/d. 
 
 
6. (C) Ward told econoff that Petrozuata is now arguing with 
the GOV over the royalty rate to be paid on the additional 
extra heavy crude that would support the project\'s expanded 
production capacity.  (Note:  The royalty for the Petrozuata 
project - as with all the Strategic Associations - is 
currently one percent.  This royalty holiday lasts for nine 
years or until the project has re-couped some multiple of its 
investment.  The GOV is now pushing for at least a 20 percent 
royalty for any additional production from these projects. 
End Note)  While ConocoPhillips has not confirmed Ward\'s 
comments, careful comments by a ConocoPhillips Government 
Relations officer in an August 12 conversation with econoff 
might seem to confirm his allegations.  She said the 
Petrozuata upgrader had produced 150,000 b/d of syncrude in 
July but that this had simply been \"a one-off,\" to test the 
maximum through-put of the facility.  She added that 
Petrozuata\'s planned syncrude production level is still 
124,000 b/d and that PDVSA is keeping them to that plan. 
This could indicate, however, that Petrozuata could 
ultimately increase its sustained production to 
140,000-150,000 b/d of syncrude. 
 
------ 
SINCOR 
------ 
 
7. (C) Finally, Sincor, the Total/Statoil/PDVSA project, will 
shut in production in October for 48 days to conduct a major 
turnaround.  The planned overhaul will reportedly increase 
the current 180,000 b/d syncrude capacity of the upgrader by 
14,000 b/d.  Thus, according to our calculations, Venezuela\'s 
syncrude capacity could grow to some 634,000 b/d by the end 
of 2004 with the possibility of a further small increase in 
early 2006 by ExxonMobil\'s Cerro Negro. 
 
8. (SBU) In an interesting side note, a senior Schlumberger 
executive commented to econoff on August 12 that the first of 
the Strategic Association projects is now starting to fight 
decline in field production.  He agreed that the fields are 
experiencing gas problems earlier than had been expected and 
added that one field has now started to have a problem with 
water encroachment, that will over time, he asserted, affect 
them all. 
 
--------------------------------- 
MORE EXTRA HEAVY CRUDE PRODUCTION 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) As reported reftel, there has also been at least one 
proposal to the GOV for additional field production of extra 
heavy crude.  ChevronTexaco Vice President for Latin American 
Upstream Ali Moshiri told econoff August 6 that he had 
proposed to the GOV that the Hamaca project expand its field 
production to provide PDVSA with an additional 100,000 b/d of 
extra heavy crude.  In a subsequent converation on August 16, 
Moshiri said the GOV has \"philosophically\" accepted the 
proposal but that an agreement must still be structured.  He 
said there has been no decision about whether the additional 
crude would be sold as part of the Hamaca project or 
separately.  He confirmed it would likely be sold by PDVSA as 
Merey (a medium crude oil blend).  When econoff asked Moshiri 
if the other three Strategic Association projects might make 
similar proposals to the GOV, he responded that, to his 
knowledge, only the Hamaca field has the extra capacity to 
produce over upgrader capacity. 
 
---------------------------------- 
MORE SYNCRUDE PROJECTS ON THE WAY? 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) While the companies in the existing projects are 
engaged in discussions with the GOV on debottlenecking or 
otherwise expanding their syncrude production, proposals for 
bigger projects that would take the syncrude farther up the 
value chain to finished products have been made to the GOV. 
ChevronTexaco\'s Ali Moshiri announced August 6 that the 
company had made a $6 billion proposal to the GOV for a new 
project.  According to his announcement, the project would 
include exploration and production, a new pipeline and an 
upgrader to produce 200,000-400,000 b/d of high-quality 
syncrude and products. Shell de Venezuela President Moreno 
 
 
has now stated publicly that his company has also proposed a 
similar project to produce syncrude and products.  The Vice 
Minister of Energy for Hydrocarbons acknowledged to econoff 
that Total has made a similar proposal. 
 
------------------- 
NEW ECONOMIC MODEL? 
------------------- 
 
11. (C) In an August 19 conversation with Moshiri, he 
confirmed that the ChevronTexaco proposal envisions multiple 
companies along the project value chain.  Under this model, 
PDVSA would hold 51 percent of the upstream portion of the 
project while ChevronTexaco would control the downstream 
assets.  Moshiri clearly believes that the economics of such 
a structure could work despite the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law 
requirement that PDVSA have 51 percent or more ownership in 
any upstream development.  Moshiri dismissed any concern 
about whether PDVSA could finance its 51 percent.  Moshiri 
added that ChevronTexaco\'s project proposal includes the use 
of its steam flood technology for enhanced crude recovery. 
(Note:  The four Strategic Association projects currently 
recover 7-10 percent of the extra heavy crude.  While Moshiri 
first said he did not know what the recovery rate might 
increase to with the use of the ChevronTexaco technology, he 
then said perhaps 40-50 percent.  Increasing the extra heavy 
crude recovery rate is an important goal for the GOV.) 
 
12. (C) Finally, econoff raised with Moshiri the possibility 
of a new licensing round for blocks in the Orinoco heavy oil 
belt.  Moshiri responded that these projects are too big and 
complicated to auction and that he would urge the GOV not to 
do so.  Instead, he anticipated that the GOV would proceed 
with a selective process to drive the projects towards the 
majors in partnership with PDVSA and certain Venezuelan 
companies. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C) With the August 15 referendum having settled 
Venezuela\'s future for at least the next two years (they 
hope), ChevronTexaco\'s Moshiri and other oil industry 
representatives want to get down to business with the GOV. 
Some local industry observers believe we may see up to $10-12 
billion in new projects signed in Venezuela in the next year, 
primarily representing new investments in extra heavy crude 
projects.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) With the August 12 signing of the Preliminary 
Development Agreement (PDA) for a giant petrochemical 
project, ExxonMobil finally looks to have overcome the 
disappointment of being shut out of the Mariscal Sucre 
natural gas project in 2002.  Econoff met July 22 with 
ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark Ward to review the 
status of company projects.  Cerro Negro, the company\'s 
flagship extra heavy crude project, is operating well and 
Ward hopes shortly to receive approval to move ahead with 
debottlenecking the project upgrader.  ExxonMobil will begin 
a long-term production test in September on wells in the La 
Ceiba field while it has also submitted a joint development 
proposal to PDVSA outlining how the field could be developed 
in concert with PDVSA\'s Ceuta-Tomoporo field.  Ward 
emphasized that ExxonMobil is interested in Venezuela over 
the long term, and particularly in big projects that would 
play to ExxonMobil\'s strengths.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  On August 12, ExxonMobil de Venezuela President 
Mark Ward signed the PDA for a $3 billion petrochemical 
project that has been under discussion with the GOV for nine 
years.  In a July 22 meeting, Ward anticipated that the 
Preliminary Development Agreement (PDA) would soon be signed. 
 He added that a meeting might be arranged between President 
Chavez and ExxonMobil Chairman Lee Raymond in early October 
to discuss further that project.  Ward also briefed econoff 
on the status of other ExxonMobil projects in Venezuela which 
range from the 25 percent share the company has in the 16,000 
b/d Quiamare-La Ceiba field (operated by Repsol) to the 
multi-billion dollar Cerro Negro project. 
 
----------- 
CERRO NEGRO 
----------- 
 
3. (SBU) Ward reported that ExxonMobil is pleased with the 
operation of its flagship Venezuelan project, Cerro Negro, 
which currently upgrades 120,000 b/d of extra heavy crude 
into 110,000 b/d of syncrude.  (Note:  Cerro Negro is one of 
the four so-called \"Strategic Associations\" in which various 
international oil companies partner with PDVSA to exploit the 
extra heavy crude of Venezuela\'s Orinoco heavy oil belt.) 
Ward is hopeful ExxonMobil will receive approval \"within 
weeks\" from the GOV to proceed with debottlenecking the 
project upgrader to increase its capacity by 20 percent to 
some 145,000 b/d of extra heavy crude. 
 
4. (C) While Ward underlined that the existing Cerro Negro 
contract covers debottlenecking and that he nominally only 
needs construction permits from the Ministry, he acknowledged 
an on-going discussion with the GOV about royalty payments on 
any additional barrels resulting from the debottlenecking. 
(NOTE:  The royalty for the Cerro Negro project - as with all 
the Strategic Associations - is currently one percent.  This 
was agreed by the GOV (pre-Chavez) as an incentive for 
development of these multi-billion dollar projects.  The 
royalty holiday lasts for nine years or until the project has 
re-couped three times its investment level, whichever comes 
first.)  Ward said the GOV is pressing for a 20 percent 
royalty rate for the additional barrels (the 2001 
Hydrocarbons Law allows a 20 percent royalty for extra heavy 
crude vice 30 percent for other grades).  He said ExxonMobil 
would not agree because of the precedent it might set for the 
eventual royalty for the project\'s base production which 
ExxonMobil believes should revert to the 16.67 percent 
royalty in place at the time the original contract was signed. 
 
5. (C) Turning to the issue of field operation, Ward said 
associated gas production has built up faster than had been 
anticipated.  This has, he said, affected all the Orinoco 
heavy oil belt projects and now necessitates that Cerro Negro 
undertake additional investment in separation and compression 
equipment and a pipeline.  Cerro Negro is currently 
 
 
delivering 20 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) to gas to 
PDVSA but Ward anticipated that this would increase to 100 
mcfd within two years.  He added that ExxonMobil is currently 
recovering its costs from the gas sales, which is \"the most 
that can be expected with a monopoly buyer.\" 
 
6. (C) Ward anticipates that both the gas handling and 
debottlenecking projects will cost $150 million apiece.  He 
hopes to start the gas project at the end of 2004 and the 
debottlenecking in early 2005.  If so, the new production 
would come on-line in the first quarter of 2006.  Ward also 
informed econoff there will be a 30-day shutdown for 
maintenance of the Cerro Negro upgrader in mid-2005.  Field 
production will also be shut-in for 12 days; the other 18 
days of production will be sold to PDVSA as heavy oil. 
 
7. (C) Finally, Ward acknowledged that ExxonMobil has begun 
consideration of a Cerro Negro II which could be supported by 
the existing concession area.  The question, he said, is what 
level of upgrading would be demanded by the GOV and whether 
it would be commercially viable.  (Note:  Cerro Negro 
produces a 16 degree API syncrude, the lowest of the four 
projects.)  Although ExxonMobil has agreed to study the 
possibility of applying enhanced oil recovery techniques, 
Ward said bluntly that it makes little sense for Venezuela - 
with 300 million barrels of recoverable reserves of extra 
heavy crude ) \"to spend even one dollar more than it needs 
to increase recovery rates.\"  (Comment:  Ward\'s skepticism 
about the economics of increasing the oil recovery rate for a 
second phase of the Cerro Negro project is directly opposed 
to the current energy policy of the GOV which is pressing for 
an increase in the current 7-10 percent recovery rates of the 
extra heavy crude projects.) 
 
-------- 
LA CEIBA 
-------- 
 
8. (C) In September, ExxonMobil will begin a long-term 
production test on wells in the La Ceiba field south of Lake 
Maracaibo.  The La Ceiba project is a risk/profit sharing 
agreement inked in 1996 by Mobil.  Ward estimates that it is 
a 180 million barrel field (\"not a company maker.\") 
ExxonMobil has drilled five wells in La Ceiba and will test 
two that are currently producing a total of 10,000 b/d.  The 
oil will be moved by pipeline to a PDVSA facility in Barua. 
While Ward was hopeful that the test would generate 
sufficient data to allow the company to decide whether to 
move ahead with field development, he was clearly skeptical. 
If not, ExxonMobil would be required to drill at least one 
additional well and continue testing in order to satisfy its 
exploration requirement.  Ward said he is concerned about 
water in the reservoir.  Ward also told econoff that 
ExxonMobil has provided PDVSA with a joint development 
proposal outlining how La Ceiba could be developed with 
PDVSA\'s nearby Ceuta-Tomoporo field. 
 
-------------- 
OTHER BUSINESS 
-------------- 
 
9. (C) In a quick overview of other possible business 
opportunities, Ward noted that ExxonMobil would still be 
interested in participating in the development of Blocks 2, 3 
or 4 of the Deltana Platform offshore natural gas project. 
ExxonMobil plans to buy the data packages for whatever blocks 
the GOV bids in the Gulf of Venezuela and off Falcon state. 
Ward said this would be a natural extension of ExxonMobil\'s 
\"play\" in Colombia. 
 
10. (C) With respect to downstream business, Ward said the 
company is holding its own in the lubricants business.  In 
terms of the local gasoline market, however, he acknowledged 
that ExxonMobil is incurring significant losses because of 
the controlled prices.  Ward said bluntly that ExxonMobil 
will not be willing to ride out a losing business forever and 
that the Venezuelan fuels market is simply not sustainable 
for foreign companies. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C)  Ward emphasized that ExxonMobil is interested in 
operating in Venezuela over the long term, and particularly 
in big projects that play to the company\'s strengths.  With 
the successful August 12 signing of the Preliminary 
Development Agreement (PDA) for its planned multi-billion 
dollar petrochemical project (reftel), ExxonMobil finally 
looks to have found such a project in Venezuela and overcome 
the disappointment of being shut out of the Mariscal Sucre 
natural gas project in 2002.  Like its rivals such as 
ChevronTexaco and Shell, ExxonMobil has not been deterred by 
the ongoing political noise from considering large 
investments in Venezuela.  Unlike its rivals and true to its 
corporate philosophy, however, ExxonMobil has taken a lower 
profile and more measured pace.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ REVIVES NEW MEDIA LAW - VENEZUELAN PRESS 
FEELS THERE ARE GREATER THREATS 
 
 ------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.    (C) President Hugo Chavez, exulting in the officially 
announced overwhelming victory for the NO vote in the 
presidential recall referendum revived the idea of the  media 
law on August 22 during his regular &Alo Presidente8 
television program.   The law was proposed in January 2003. 
Despite the fact that Chavez and his allies in the media have 
singled out particular opposition media for post-referendum 
attack, a member of the &Boston Group8 had earlier assured 
an embassy officer that the law would not go forward. 
Nonetheless, with Chavez, proclamation calling for action, 
it is clear that the media law will go forward.  Post 
contacts have said that they are more concerned with how the 
media law would be enforced rather than its actual content. 
They have asserted that they are already practicing 
self-censorship.  A larger concern expressed by &El 
Universal,8 Venezuela,s mainstream paper of record, is the 
physical threats being directed towards the paper,s 
management.      END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
THE MEDIA LAW PROPOSED IN JANUARY 2003 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In January 2003 the &Law of Social Responsibility in 
Radio and Television8 (or Broadcast Media Content Law) was 
introduced in the Venezuelan Congress.  Under this law, 
broadcasters must release only &truthful information8; 
television companies, advertisers, and broadcasters could be 
punished for transmitting &contents that promote, defend or 
incite lack of respect for legitimate authorities, such as 
the deputies of the National Assembly, the President of the 
Republic, the Vice-President of the Republic, ministers, 
magistrates of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice(.8  Programs 
containing violence of any kind, including coverage of 
disasters, political conflicts, and criminal incidents, would 
be restricted to the hours between 11 PM and 5 AM, hours when 
very few channels broadcast at all.  In the bill a new 
department within the state broadcasting regulatory agency 
would determine the appropriateness of the content, and 
exorbitant fines could be imposed on stations, possibly 
leading to their closure.  The government would also have the 
right to suspend broadcasting or revoke the broadcasting 
license in the case of repeated offenses. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
CHAVEZ REVIVES THE PROPOSED LAW 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In a conversation with the PAO, Pedro Diaz Blum,  an 
opposition member of the Boston Group (composed of members of 
both the government and opposition that had undertaken 
conflict management training in Boston at the initiative of 
members of the U.S. House of representatives) stated that the 
Boston Group members had a arrived at a gentleman,s 
agreement  that the discussion of the bill was to be tabled. 
Nonetheless, during a speech give on August 22 during his 
regular &Alo Presidente8 television program President 
Chavez called for the expedited passage of the law.  He 
underscored the need for quick passage of the law during his 
august 27 ceremony at Congress. He said passage was important 
for the governability of the country and he quoted the Pope 
as calling for press regulation.  Chavez added, &this should 
not be seen as a threat by anyone, to the contrary, it is a 
guarantee of order, respect for the law, stability; but never 
more can televisions or communications media act as arms of 
terrorism, of coups, or of destabilization.8  In addition, 
both President Chavez and pro-Chavez media have regularly 
accused particular major opposition press outlets, daily 
papers &El Nacional8 and &El Universal8 and TV news 
channels &Globovision8 and &RC TV8 as being behind the 
referendum and irreconcilable to the  Bolivarian 
revolution., 
 
--------------------------------- 
VENEZUELAN MEDIA HAS OTHER WORRIES 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In an August 20 meeting between embassy officers and 
the management of &El Universal,8 Venezuela,s mainstream 
 
 
paper of record, the managing editor, public relations 
officer, and executive vice president were somewhat sanguine 
of the possible effects of the new media law (perhaps 
reflecting their role as print media).  They noted how the 
media, themselves included, were already practicing 
self-censorship.  Their larger concern were physical threats 
to them and their family.  They mentioned that they had 
already received phone threats directed against them.  They 
feared that with the (alleged, in their eyes) referendum 
victory the government and pro-Chavez forces would go beyond 
threats.  They noted the shooting of opposition demonstrators 
by pro-Chavez gunmen on August 16 as showing the direction 
the country was heading. 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) The Chavistas in the National Assembly will take up 
President Chavez, call probably at the same quick pace as 
the Supreme Court Law.  The new media law would undoubtedly 
be used to pressure the opposition media of which, at this 
time, there is no shortage.  The management of &El 
Universal8 is sincere in its concerns about physical threats 
though it is hard to tell how far the government and its 
supporters would go to silence the opposition press.  Despite 
the confession of self-censorship &El Universal8 and the 
rest of the opposition media has been tireless in crying 
fraud at the results of the referendum.  The opposition 
media,s concern over violence is mirrored in the 
vociferously pro-Chavez paper &Diario Vea8 that  warns 
daily in its editorials that the opposition will turn violent 
after their democratic defeat and that the Bolivarian 
revolution must be prepared to defend itself. 
 
6.  (C) Charge,s Comment:  What drives Chavez, interest in 
the media law is his perception that the media owners are the 
true leaders of the opposition, the puppet-master behind the 
April 2002 coup, and the main holdovers from the pre-Chavez 
&Fourth Republic8 era.   Thus the media,s performance 
during the referendum campaign * which was aboveboard, and 
in which opposition media increased interviews of Chavista 
leaders * is beside the point.   The application and the 
existence of the law are more significant than the specific 
sections in the law.   More media controls would be bad for 
democracy; it will not be clear just how bad until we see the 
final draft of the law.   Chavez listens little to foreign 
reactions to his laws; we will have far more impact, however, 
if we can voice our opinions in concert with other countries 
and NGOs.

1. (U) Venezuela\'s gubernatorial and mayoral elections are 
scheduled for September 26, but National Electoral Council 
(CNE) director Jorge Rodriguez told reporters on August 23 
that the CNE is discussing changing the date of the regional 
elections for logistical reasons.  President Hugo Chavez\'s 
Comando Maisanta representative and National Assembly deputy 
William Lara (MVR, Miranda) said a short delay for technical 
reasons was acceptable but insisted regional elections should 
take place as soon as possible. Many within the opposition 
are debating whether to participate in the regional and 
mayoral elections, and some are hinging their participation 
on changes to the electoral process.  End Summary.

Election Day Delay 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) Gubernatorial and mayoral elections are scheduled for 
September 26, but National Electoral Council (CNE) director 
Jorge Rodriguez told reporters on August 23 that the CNE is 
considering changing the date of the regional elections for 
logistical reasons.  This would be the second postponement 
for the regional elections initially scheduled to occur on 
August 1 but delayed due to the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum.  Rodriguez also told reporters on August 23 that 
the recall referendum for nine opposition legislative 
deputies might be scheduled on the same day as the regional 
and mayoral elections.  Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR) 
gubernatorial candidate Diosdado Cabello (Miranda State) 
opposed holding regional and recall elections together 
saying, \"The priority is the regional election.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
Challenges for Comando Maisanta 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) President Hugo Chavez\'s Comando Maisanta 
representative and National Assembly deputy William Lara 
(MVR, Miranda) said a short delay for technical reasons was 
acceptable, but suggested that if the date were pushed back 
too far Comando Maisanta would appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Falcon State governor Jesus Montilla said CNE members do not 
have the constitutional right to extend the terms of 
governors and mayors, which in essence they would be doing by 
changing the date of the elections.  The mayor of Caracas\' 
Libertador municipality, Freddy Bernal, urged the CNE to 
preserve the September 26 date for regional elections.  If a 
change of date were necessary for technical reasons, Bernal 
said, then the delay should be minimized because the 
Venezuelan people have been in \"campaign mode\" for too long. 
(Note: Comando Maisanta formally launched its regional and 
mayoral election campaign on August 20.)  While opposed to 
delaying regional elections, Chavista leaders urged the CNE 
to increase the number of voting tables available at each 
voting center before the regional elections to reduce the 
amount of time voters spend in line. 
 
4. (U) With multiple Chavista candidates in 12 of the 23 
states, deciding how to choose one unified candidate is a 
dilemma for Comando Maisanta.  The four propositions 
currently under discussion are: a political dialog among the 
parties, consulting the communities, conducting a poll and 
choosing the candidate with the most support, or holding 
primary elections.  According to Comando Maisanta\'s William 
Izarra, Chavez will be the one to choose the method for 
unification.  President Chavez, meanwhile, has reiterated his 
support for the candidates he has chosen, and on his August 
29 \"Alo, Presidente\" program told his followers to stop 
bickering and unite behind the candidates. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Opposition Otherwise Occupied 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Chavez opponents continue to debate whether to 
participate in the gubernatorial and mayoral elections, and 
some are hinging their participation on changes to the 
electoral process.  To increase transparency in the upcoming 
regional elections the opposition said they want a manual 
 
 
rather than electronic vote.  If the vote were electronic, 
they propose, then each table should also count the manual 
ballots emitted by the machines.  Yaracuy State Governor 
Eduardo Lapi said, \"If Chavez successfully discourages the 
opposition from voting in the regionals, then he will have 
obtained the largest victory in the history of democracy, so 
we (the opposition) have to participate in the regionals on 
the condition that the votes are counted manually.\" 
 
6. (C) Bolivar State Governor Antonio Rojas Suarez said that 
unless changes were made, no one should participate in the 
regional elections. He said, \"If we do not participate in the 
regionals, there will be an institutional crisis.\" One of 
Tachira State\'s gubernatorial candidates opposed to Chavez, 
Jose Luis Rincon, agreed with Rojas pointing out that if the 
referendum was a true reflection of the voter\'s will (which 
he vehemently denied), then Chavista governors will win in 
every state just as Chavez did, especially now that so many 
opposition voters feel robbed and will abstain from voting. 
If the vote was fraudulent, Rincon said, then using the same 
system will allow the GOV to \"steal\" the regional elections.

Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Hoping to take advantage of the momentum from the 
August 15 referendum win, plus the opposition\'s confusion and 
internal arguments, Chavez supporters are pushing to hold 
regional elections on September 26 or soon thereafter.  The 
opposition may benefit from the additional time, but it is 
most unlikely they will be successful in their push for a 
manual count.  They may, however, come to agreement and make 
headway on unified candidates that can compete with 
candidates backed by the Chavez machine.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica plans to contest the 
National Electoral Council\'s (CNE) certified results 
announced August 26 that President Hugo Chavez won the August 
15 recall referendum.  The Coordinadora is working toward 
documenting its case.  A Coordinadora commission headed by 
constitutional lawyer Tulio Alvarez_ has enlisted a team of 
mathematicians to document the alleged irregularities in the 
referendum results.  The NGO Sumate is proceeding with its 
own analysis but is troubled by harassment from both GOV and 
opposition sympathizers.  The Coordinadora\'s work may turn 
out to be only an exercise in closure for the opposition.  In 
the meantime, however, Chavez opponents continue to pursue 
the fraud allegations.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Fraud Commission Head Accuses GOV of \"Plan B\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica\'s Fraud Commission (ref) 
legal coordinator Tulio Alvarez_ told Emboffs August 24 he 
believes the GOV decided in July to enact a \"Plan B\" to 
commit fraud to win the August 15 recall referendum against 
President Hugo Chavez.  Alvarez_ said the GOV in the runup to 
the referendum had worried about a close race and initiated 
its plan to ensure victory.  Alvarez_ theorized that the GOV 
either altered the voting machines or altered their 
transmission to the National Electoral Council (CNE).  He 
thought the GOV changed the contents of the boxes containing 
the paper receipts -- perhaps 20 percent before and 20 
percent after the vote -- to match the tally sheets of the 
corresponding machines.  Alvarez_ also questioned the GOV\'s 
ability to augment the electoral registry by two million 
votes the two months prior to the referendum, suggesting the 
voters may never have existed. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Coordinadora\'s Strategy To Contest Results 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Alvarez_ said this is a case of \"blackmail of the 
evidence,\" wherein all the proofs needed to demonstrate fraud 
are in the hands of the GOV, leaving the Coordinadora with 
mostly circumstantial evidence.  Alvarez_ said he plans to 
release a preliminary report in mid-September with the 
purpose of raising public awareness of irregularities in the 
election. Alvarez_ said he planned to release a definitive 
report by mid-October.  The Coordinadora has 20 working days 
after the August 26 CNE  announcement of the final referendum 
results to contest them.  Alvarez_ said the Coordinadora plans 
to file its objection five days before the expiration date to 
buy additional time for Coordinadora investigators.  He 
admitted there was little chance the CNE would act on the 
Coordinadora\'s objection, but noted the action would preserve 
the opposition\'s right to appeal to the Supreme Court (TSJ). 
 
-------------------------------- 
Sumate Embarks on Parallel Track 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In meeting with Emboffs August 24, members of the NGO 
Sumate Maria Corina Machado and Roberto Abdul said they, too, 
had a team of computer experts and mathematicians analyzing 
the election data.  Machado doubted the exercise would yield 
any definitive proof of fraud.  She said Sumate is reaching 
out to world-recognized experts in electoral fraud, 
especially in the United States, to examine the case of the 
referendum. 
 
5. (C) Machado and Abdul said they and other Sumate members 
had received threats by telephone and e-mail from GOV 
 
sympathizers over the NGO\'s refusal to endorse the referendum 
results.  Machado added that opposition groups were also 
critical of the NGO because it appeared to endorse the CNE\'s 
results on August 16 when it was revealed that Sumate\'s quick 
count showed Chavez had won.  Machado complained that this 
fact had been used by the GOV, former President Jimmy Carter, 
and the international press to imply Sumate\'s endorsement. 
Machado said that after receiving an apology from Carter for 
misrepresenting Sumate\'s position, he nevertheless continued 
to cite the NGO\'s quick count as evidence of transparency in 
the process. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Alvarez_ is a serious and politically savvy attorney 
with a reputation for high-profile cases, such as a 
corruption suit against Chavez for suspicious oil sales to 
Cuba.  His willingness to take this case is an advantage for 
the Coordinadora.  An appeal of the CNE\'s referendum results 
will ultimately be fruitless because both the CNE and TSJ are 
controlled by the executive branch.  The real issue is 
whether the Coordinadora\'s report turns up enough evidence to 
cast doubt on Chavez\'s landslide win and, thus, his 
legitimacy.  If it does not, the report may still serve as a 
face-saving measure to soften the political blow of losing 
the referendum.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The GOV rejected talks with umbrella private sector 
organization FEDECAMARAS after the latter issued a \"Business 
Manifesto\" which cast doubts on the results of the recent 
referendum on President Chavez\'s tenure in office and sharply 
criticized other GOV policies.  Interior Minister Chacon 
stated that the GOV would not engage in dialogue \"under 
conditions\" and would talk directly to other business 
organizations and leaders.  The GOV backed off somewhat when 
FEDECAMARAS President Albis Munoz insisted that no conditions 
were being demanded.  Nonetheless, it remains unclear if, 
when, and under what circumstances such dialogue will take 
place.  The business community\'s accommodation to Chavez 
continues, with the departure under pressure of Rafael 
Alfonzo, one of the hardest-line anti-Chavez industry 
leaders, from the presidency of the Food Industry Chamber. 
The U.S.-Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce (VENAMCHAM), which 
held useful meeting with the Finance Minister and the 
Chairman of the National Assembly\'s Finance Committee, is 
nonetheless leery of a GOV effort to set it up it as a 
counterweight to FEDECAMARAS.  Both the GOV and the business 
community have an interest in maintaining dialogue, but the 
GOV aims to manipulate the private sector into definitively 
accepting its place in the Chavista revolution.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
Offers, Rejection, Clarifications 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Following Chavez\'s referendum victory, Albis Munoz, 
President of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry of Venezuela (FEDECAMARAS) offered to enter into 
dialogue with the GOV, calling for the creation of \"friendly 
environments for national... reconstruction.  Her comments, 
well publicized nationally, caused considerable dissension 
within her organization, which led it, after lengthy 
close-door debate, to issue on August 30 a \"manifesto\" with a 
distinctly political tinge.  It led off by noting the 
persistence of \"doubts regarding the transparency and 
veracity\" of the August 15 referendum results.  It denounced 
the effort to \"impose laws which limit freedom of expression 
and foment the non-recognition of private property.\"  Noting 
that \"communication is the ideal mechanism for 
understanding,\" it called for \"businessmen, workers, 
consumers and government to close ranks in a common effort to 
put Venezuela on the path of full economic and social 
development, under democracy and with the values which define 
our people.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Interior Minister Jesse Chacon responded by saying 
that the manifesto represented the views of the \"extreme 
right wing\" of the business community.  The GOV, he added, 
was already undertaking discussions with various sectorial 
chambers, and would work with businessmen to create a 
\"strategic agreement,\" but that FEDECAMARAS would not be 
participating:  \"We do not dialogue under conditions.\" 
Munoz subsequently clarified that the manifesto, while 
reflecting the views of FEDECAMARAS\' members, did not 
constitute any effort to impose any pre-conditions on 
dialogue with the GOV.  GOV Executive Vice President Jose 
Rangel, in turn, responded by calling this \"an interesting 
signal,\" adding that the GOV was \"prepared to dialogue with 
FEDECAMARAS and any other sector, but based upon the 
constitution.\" 
 
------------ 
One GOV View 
------------ 
 
4.  (C)  On September 2, econcouns met with Francisco Natera, 
a former FEDECAMARAS President who currently serves in the 
GOV in the low profile post of \"Minister of State for Special 
Economic Zones.\"  Natera\'s principal task has been to 
maintain liaison with the private sector, most notably 
through the staging of a series of public \"encounters\" Chavez 
held with businessmen in Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia and 
 
Puerto La Cruz prior to the referendum.  Natera asserted that 
FEDECAMARAS had lost an opportunity to repair relations with 
the GOV.  Chavez, he said, had placed a telephone call to 
Munoz after his referendum victory.  Munoz, closeted with her 
advisors, neither took the call nor returned it later.  This 
discourtesy, according to Natera, together with the 
manifesto\'s outlining of purely political issues as 
FEDECAMARAS priorities, made the GOV\'s hostile response 
inevitable. 
 
5.  (C)  Natera suggested that despite the apparent failure 
thus far to re-establish normal relations between the GOV and 
FEDECAMARAS, all was not lost.  He thought that after \"five 
or six months\" it could be renewed, noting that Chavez is 
quite capable of changing his positions if it suits his 
interest.  He suggested that a change in FEDECAMARAS 
leadership might be needed first.  In the meantime, he added, 
dialogue was taking place at other levels.  Several important 
sectorial organizations, such as the Banking Association and 
the Chamber of Construction had either met or would shortly 
meet with President Chavez.  (Note:  The Banking Association 
met with Chavez on September 3.  End note.)   He also praised 
the U.S. Venezuelan-Chamber of Commerce\'s (VENAMCHAM) highly 
publicized meeting with Finance Minister Nobrega (See para. 
9).  He suggested that these various initial approaches would 
be followed up by the formal creation of working groups at 
the ministerial or sub-ministerial level. 
 
6.  (C)  Natera denied any contradiction between Chavez\'s 
asserted policy of outreach to the private sector and his 
announcement of a new land reform initiative, including a 
threat to expropriate idle land if owners did not negotiate 
its sale.  Chavez, he said, is a politician who must play to 
different constituencies, and the rural poor are one of the 
most important voting blocs whose support he will need ahead 
of the regional elections.  There are, he insisted, large 
stretches of land not worked by their owners, who in many 
cases do not even have good title.  The extent of the problem 
is well known, and landowners outside of these well-defined 
situations have nothing to fear.  He suggested that 
implementation of land reform could be a subject for 
business-government dialogue. 
 
------------------------------------- 
A Hard-Liner Moves On, Under Pressure 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  As the status of the business-government dialogue 
remains murky, one leading player in the organized business 
community is leaving the scene, at least for now.  Rafael 
Alfonzo, head of a large, family-owned grain milling and food 
importing business, announced his resignation from the 
presidency of Venezuelan Food Industry Chamber (CAVIDEA). 
Alfonso had been the private sector representative in the OAS 
and Carter Center-sponsored negotiations leading to the June 
2003 agreement which set the stage for the petition drive and 
referendum on Chavez\'s tenure in office.  One of the highest 
profile business sector figures within the opposition, he had 
publicly cast doubt on the validity of Chavez\'s August 15 
victory.  Alfonzo reportedly had strongly opposed within 
FEDECAMARAS any effort to re-start dialogue with Chavez.  He 
attributed his departure to health concerns, but admitted 
that given that his actions could be \"misinterpreted\" and 
affect the interests of CAVIDEA\'s members, it was time to go. 
 
8.  (C)  Alfonzo\'s departure followed a meeting of the 
National Cereals Board, a GOV-industry consultative entity on 
issues such as price controls and import permits on key 
commodities, at which, according to industry sources, Vice 
Minister of Agriculture Garzon specifically raised Alfonzo\'s 
allegations of electoral fraud, saying that as long as 
institutions such as CAVIDEA (and also farmers\' association 
FEDEAGRO) did not recognize the legitimacy of the government, 
they would not be considered \"valid interlocutors.\"  He also 
said that public declarations questioning the referendum 
results or calling for revision of the Land Law were 
unacceptable, since \"losers don\'t place conditions.\" 
Implicit in his comments, according to one participant, was a 
threat that import permits and price increases (the latter 
being crucial in Venezuela\'s high inflation economy), would 
not be forthcoming without personnel and policy changes at 
major industry associations.  We have also heard from an 
industry insider that food and beverage giant Polar was 
instrumental in Alfonzo\'s departure. 
 
-------------------------- 
VENAMCHAM Moves Cautiously 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  In an introductory call on the Ambassador on 
September 3, Imelda Cisneros, President of the U.S.-Venezuela 
Chamber of Commerce (VENAMCHAM), discussed the August 26 
meeting which her organization had held with Finance Minister 
Tobias Nobrega and National Assembly Finance Committee 
Chairman Rodrigo Cabezas.  Cisneros, while satisfied 
substantively with the results, was irked by the massive 
publicity which Cabezas in particular had generated both 
before and after the event.  She saw an effort on the GOV\'s 
part to set up a dichotomy between a \"good\" VENAMCHAM and a 
\"bad\" FEDECAMARAS.  Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. 
Bernardo Alvarez_ had subsequently telephoned her to suggest 
that his Embassy and VENAMCHAM jointly host a major 
investment promotion event in Washington.  She told the 
Ambassador that she would be very careful about such 
approaches, while trying to engage a very difficult 
government on the range of substantive concerns which 
VENAMCHAM had. 
 
------------------------------- 
Comment:  No Dialogue of Equals 
------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  Despite the difficult beginning, we may yet see 
FEDECAMARAS participating in formal dialogue with the GOV. 
From its own institutional perspective FEDECAMARAS must find 
a way to be able to talk to Chavez and his ministers or be 
doomed to impotence and irrelevance at least through the 2006 
elections.  The business community as a whole also has an 
interest in speaking with a unified voice, given that 
Chavez\'s efforts to deal with individual chambers and 
businesses reflect a \"divide and conquer\" strategy.  For the 
GOV the need for dialogue with FEDECAMARAS is less pressing. 
Nonetheless, given the role of the business organization\'s 
leadership in both Chavez\'s temporary ouster in April 2002 
and in the December 2002-February 2003 general strike, its 
reconciliation with the GOV, should it occur, would add to 
the perception of Chavez\'s long-term invincibility. 
 
11.  (C)  Chavez\'s vision of what the business-government 
relationship should be probably entails smiling business 
leaders publicly approving various economic development 
schemes being financed with oil revenues, and some private 
dickering over specific problems.  One long-time observer 
even suggested that the stability of Chavez\'s government 
could benefit from the added communication that formal links 
to the business community could provide, especially outside 
of Caracas, as an alternative to misinformation from corrupt 
and sycophantic politicians at the state and local level. 
But to judge by the initial sparring, if the business 
community acts as if it has the right to criticize core 
political interests of the Bolivarian revolution such as its 
management of the electoral process and the courts, its 
planned law regulating the press, and possibly (despite 
Natera\'s comments) land reform, it will get the back of 
Chavez\'s hand.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Judge Dayva Soto Vallenilla released Baruta Mayor 
Henrique Capriles from pre-trial detention September 6, 
following a defense motion on September 2. Capriles must 
appear before the court every 15 days, remain in Venezuela, 
and is not allowed to make public comments on the case 
against him. Prosecutor Danilo Anderson has five days to 
appeal the decision. Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez said the 
decision \"gave a ray of light in a Judicial Power which is 
rotten, and takes decisions according to political 
interests.\" MVR Deputy Willian Lara called the decision proof 
that \"the Venezuelan state respects the rights, even of those 
who do not respect the Bolivarian Constitution and the 
law...\" The DCM met with Capriles\' mother August 30, and 
advised her on her September 1 meeting with Vice President 
Rangel. A source close to Rangel told the Ambassador that 
Rangel had persuaded Chavez that the GOV should -- informally 
-- prevail on the courts to free Capriles. End Summary.

Capriles Freed 
-------------- 
 
2.  (U) Judge Dayva Soto Vallenilla ruled in favor of a 
defense motion to free Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles 
(Primero Justicia) from pre-trial detention on September 6, 
after 120 days in DISIP custody. Capriles is charged with 
colluding with rioters in front of the Cuban Embassy on April 
12, 2002. Judge Soto substituted the detention order with the 
requirement that Capriles present himself to the court every 
15 days, not leave Venezuela, and not make public comments on 
the case. Prosecutor Danilo Anderson has five days to 
consider an appeal of the decision. Capriles was released the 
evening of September 6. 
 
--------------------- 
Lopez Cites Leon Case 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez (Primero Justicia) told 
reporters the decision was, \"a ray of light in a Judicial 
Power which is rotten, and takes decisions according to 
political interests.\" Lopez pointed to the arrest on 
September 4 of Judge Juan Ramon Leon Villanueva, on charges 
of trying to bribe the head of Venezuela\'s investigative 
police (CICPC). Leon was the judge who ordered Capriles be 
sent to trial on August 18. Lopez called Leon, \"a corrupt 
judge who was seen committing extortion, and who ended up 
showing that the Capriles case was political.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
Even Justice for our Enemies 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) MVR Deputy Willian Lara told official news agency 
VenPress that the decision to release Capriles was proof 
that, \"the Venezuelan state respects the rights, even of 
those who do not respect the Bolivarian Constitution and the 
law, with anti-democratic conduct of a fascist character, as 
was (Capriles\') on April 12, 2002 in the assault on the Cuban 
Embassy.\" He said the decision invalidates all the 
accusations of Primero Justicia leaders that Capriles\' rights 
had been violated.

The Judge 
--------- 
 
5.  (C) Capriles defense lawyer Juan Martin Echeverria told 
PolOff August 31, when the case was assigned to Judge Soto, 
that she was a professional judge with several years on the 
bench. He said he was sure she would be under pressure to 
 
conform to the GOV line on the case. Trial Judge Beatriz 
Perez told PolOff September 3 that Judge Soto was not a 
Chavista, and noted that she had made no effort to have 
herself removed from the controversial case. 
 
------------------------------ 
DCM Meets with Capriles Mother 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) The DCM met with Capriles\' mother, Monica Radonski, 
August 30. Ms. Radonski told the DCM she had an appointment 
with Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, and asked DCM for 
his advice on how best to take advantage of the meeting. The 
DCM advised Ms. Radonski to make an appeal to Rangel on 
humanitarian grounds, to leave her lawyers behind, and not to 
make accusations about the political nature of the case. 
 
7.  (C) A source close to VP Rangel told the Ambassador and 
DCM September 7 that Rangel had convinced the President that 
they should find a way to get the court to release Capriles. 
President Carter had raised the issue with Chavez, and we 
believe this helped as well. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The GOV was looking for some way out of the Capriles 
situation. It did so without ostensibly violating the 
separation of powers -- but clearly Chavez\' change of mind 
drove the process. This decision temporarily reduces pressure 
on the GOV on human rights issues. How the GOV proceeds with 
the trial will still be significant, as will be the 
conclusion of the trial of nine Chavez opponents in Tachira 
state (which we understand the GOV is examining) and the 
proceedings against Generals Alfonzo, Uson and Poggioli.

Venezuela (PDVSA) fired in the wake of the December 2002 - 
January 2003 national strike.  Minister of Labor Maria 
Cristina Iglesias ruled the dismissals do not meet the legal 
definition of \"mass firing\" under Venezuelan law.  In 
rejecting the petition, Iglesias said the striking workers 
had imposed a disproportionate hardship on Venezuelan society 
that outweighed the collective interests of the workers. 
Representatives of the fired workers also accused the GOV of 
ignoring International Labor Organization (ILO) 
recommendations.  The GOV argues that the dispute should be 
addressed on a case-by-case basis rather than collectively. 
Additionally, the GOV remains convinced that the fired 
workers were, in fact, engaged in economic sabotage to 
overthrow President Hugo Chavez during the strike, an 
impediment to any equitable solution.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Labor Minister Denies It Was a \"Mass Firing\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Minister of Labor Maria Cristina Iglesias ruled August 
31 that the 14,000 ex-workers of Petroleos de Venezuela 
(PDVSA) fired during the December 2002 - January 2003 strike 
were not dismissed in a \"mass firing\" as spelled out in 
Venezuelan labor law.  A \"mass firing,\" defined as more than 
10 percent of an employer\'s workforce, must be approved by 
the Minister of Labor, who may reverse the dismissals if they 
are deemed to be contrary to the \"social interest.\"  Although 
the PDVSA firing constituted more than 40 percent of the 
state-run oil company\'s workforce, Iglesias concluded that 
the strike affected the quality of life of all Venezuelan 
society, which the government is obligated to protect. 
Minister Iglesias previously issued two similar decisions 
encompassing an additional 6,000 employees of PDVSA 
subsidiaries Intevep and Pequiven.  Iglesias also argued that 
the national strike did not comply with the requirements of 
the labor code.  Iglesias told reporters September 1 the 
strike was, in fact, an attempt to overthrow President Hugo 
Chavez against the will of Venezuelans. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Opposition Unions Claim Political Retaliation 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Venezuela Workers Confederation (CTV) Executive 
Secretaries Alfredo Ramos and Pablo Castro criticized the 
 
SIPDIS 
decision September 1 as an instrument of political 
retaliation.  Ramos questioned whether the GOV\'s offer of 
dialogue with the opposition can be considered sincere in 
light of the Labor Minister\'s actions.  Castro asserted that 
the decision proves the rule of law is lost in Venezuela. 
Castro defended the workers\' decision to strike, calling it a 
legitimate response to a GOV attack on the meritocracy that 
ran PDVSA until President Chavez attempted to replace its 
board with his sympathizers in 2002.  Juan Fernandez, leader 
of the organization of the fired workers, Gente de Petroleo, 
told poloff September 1 his organization planned to reject 
the decision.  Fernandez said they would hold a series of 
assemblies throughout Venezuela with the fired workers to 
coordinate their strategy to resolve the dismissals. 
 
------------------------------- 
An \"Irreversible\" Determination 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Iglesias said September 1 her decision was 
\"irreversible\" though she left open the possibility that the 
workers could appeal to the Administrative Policy Chamber of 
the Supreme Court (TSJ).  Carlos Alexis Castillo, Director 
General in the Ministry of Labor, told reporters August 31 
the workers may still pursue individual claims with local 
labor inspectorates, adding that a Caracas-based inspector 
had already processed (and denied) 100 individual petitions. 
Ivan Gonzalez, head of the human rights office of the 
Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), told 
 
Poloff September 1 there is effectively no recourse to the 
courts or inspectorates because the GOV controls these 
institutions.  He added that the TSJ declared the strike 
illegal in December 2002, making a GOV settlement unlikely 
from a legal perspective.  Gonzalez asserted that the 
re-incorporation of the fired workers is impossible, and 
added that the workers\' best hope is to be able to receive 
legally mandated severance and pension payments as well as 
the balances of their individual savings accounts still held 
by PDVSA. 
 
------------------------------------- 
ILO Treaties, Recommendations Ignored 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Labor Minister\'s decision flies in the face of 
International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions 87 and 98, 
according to Edgar Quijano, an ex-PDVSA manager and labor 
advisor to UNAPETROL, the union formed by fired oil workers. 
Quijano told poloff September 1 the decision also ignores 
many ILO recommendations approved by the Governing Body in 
June 2004 (ref a).  ORIT\'s Gonzalez said the decision shows 
the GOV will not apply ILO recommendations, preferring to 
disagree with the international body\'s conclusions that the 
December 2002 - January 2003 strike amounted to a national, 
generalized strike.  Juan Fernandez said he hoped these 
issues would be investigated by the ILO direct contact 
mission, which should take place in September or October if 
the GOV permits. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The Minister\'s decision got some media attention 
because of the peculiar logic that the dismissal of 14,000 
employees cannot legally be called a \"mass firing.\"  For the 
Minister to have decided otherwise, however, would have meant 
the immediate re-incorporation of the employees into PDVSA, 
which is politically and logistically impossible.  The GOV\'s 
revolutionary orthodoxy considers the strike as an attempted 
economic coup d\'etat by the opposition -- an interpretation 
not completely removed from the truth.  Unfortunately, the 
GOV\'s unwillingness to reach a collective settlement with the 
workers has left them in legal limbo and in financial 
distress.  The GOV will continue its case-by-case approach of 
coaxing a small number of people back to work on its terms 
and will probably resist, or impose tight conditions on, the 
ILO direct contact mission.

SUBJECT: CHAVEZ CALLS FOR LAND REFORM ON \"ALO PRESIDENTE\" 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. Agriculture was the main topic of President Chavez\'s 
202nd \"Alo, Presidente\" which aired August 29. Indeed his 
choice of a rural town, El Socorro, in the state of Guarico 
helped to set the stage.   During this event, as in recent 
speeches before the National Assembly and other venues, he 
called for the reformation of the land law.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Agriculture to Return To Former Glory 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  Chavez stated, \"Now the revolution has begun the road 
toward construction of a agro-economy.  We have been working 
on this for some years, and 2004 will be a great year in 
this endeavor, a leap forward in agricultural production.\" 
 
3.  Chavez began his call for land reform by noting that 
there were persons who had thousands and thousands of 
hectares of unused land.   He complained that the current 
land law says if you have 20,000 hectares and they are 
producing it is not illegal.   He also noted that 1,500 
hectares seemed like an \"adequate\" size.   He made a call to 
the landowners of Guarico and of Venezuela, \" I prefer that 
we come to an arrangement.\"  He continued saying, that \"in 
this new stage of the revolution, and I have told the 
minister of agriculture today, and the president of the land 
institute and I tell them in front of the whole country, I 
insist on the severe application of the constitution and the 
land law.\"   He continued by saying the present law calls 
for the \"elimination of large land holdings\" and it has to 
be followed. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Neo-liberalism and Coup Fall-Guys 
----------------------------------- 
4.  President Chvez began his remarks by laying the blame 
for agricultural woes on neo-liberalism saying, \"We are 
hitting hard on land, on agriculture. Venezuela was an 
agricultural country for many years, then came the oil and 
the bad governments and we lost our national concept, that 
is Venezuela lost its way, and installed a neo-liberal 
capitalist system that abandoned the countryside, the rural 
producers were left abandoned, the rural exodus, the 
economic history of the twentieth century, we went to the 
cities, we left the fields, and agriculture fell.\" 
 
5.  In  another remark, Chavez noted \"The rural area  had  no 
access to technology, that is why we must leave aside the neo- 
liberalism  and it is the Government, the State assuming  the 
responsibility along with the private producers.\" 
 
6. The program also included a video entitled, \"The Agrarian 
Revolution Marches Ahead.\"   It began noting that the rural 
struggle was being done in conjunction with the Bolivarian 
government to \"break the chains of dependence on oil, that 
for many years relegated agriculture to a forgotten state. 
And the 2002 anti-government strike demonstrates how 
transnational interests penetrated our oil industry.  We all 
remember how we lacked basic goods and how they tried to 
subjugate the desire for change of the Bolivarian people 
with hunger.\" 
 
7. When speaking of the fall in production of beef and pork, 
Chavez called upon the minister of agriculture (Arnoldo 
Marquez) to repeat the explanation for the fall.   The 
minister noted a fall of nine to eleven percent and blamed 
the attempted coup.  Chavez went on to say that such a fall 
would not occur again because there now exists a government 
that will be working with the \"nationalistic private sector 
to rid themselves of such a threat.\" 
 
----------------------------------- 
Private Producers Should Not Fear 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. Aware of the fact that private producers might find 
 
something to fear in these suggestions, Chavez assured them, 
\"This revolution does not have anything against private 
producers, on the contrary, we extend our hand to give them 
credit, cheap credit, this is an example, an agreement with 
China, we brought tractors from China and we will continue 
to bring tractors and we give them to Venezuelan producers 
on credit, to small producers and really cheap.\"  He also 
noted the purchase of Brazilian tractors. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Cubans Thanked for Medical Aid to Rural Guarico 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9. President Chavez also talked about the poor of Guarico 
and the support received from Cuba.   He noted that there 
were 36 people from Guarico that had not returned from Cuba, 
where they were receiving medical aid.  He also spoke of 
other Venezuelans who likewise had traveled to Cuba: 
Carabobo, 1,480; Miranda, 1,300; Barinas, 434; Vargas, 520; 
Yaracuy, 601; and Zulia, 3,783.  Currently he estimated 
5,963 Venezuelans in Cuba.  \"For this we must thank the 
Cuban revolution, the Cuban people, the Cuban medical 
science, and their leader comrade Fidel Castro, thank you 
very much. Thank you in the name of so many Venezuelans who 
had lost the hope of seeing, recovering their sight to see 
their corn fields, to see their loved ones, to see the sun 
rise and set, thank you.  This is a people coming out of the 
darkness.\" 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. In this broadcast of \"Alo Presidente,\" and on other 
occasions, President Chavez has called for immediate 
amendment of the current land law, to cap land ownership at 
10,000 hectares per person (rather than the current 20,000 
hectares), while at the same time making contradictory 
statements to allay the fear of the private sectors.

SUBJECT: GOV TAKES FULL CREDIT FOR GDP GROWTH, BUT STILL 
PASSES BLAME 
 
Classified By: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR RICHARD M. SANDERS FOR REASON 1.4 B A 
ND D 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) First half GDP statistics show a 23.1% increase over 
last year, which also represents the first improvement over 
2002 figures.  Second quarter growth was 13.6%, led by 
non-petroleum growth of 15.0%.  Considering these factors, 
the GOV has revised its 2004 growth estimate from 6 to 12%. 
Meanwhile, S&P raised Venezuela\'s long and short-term credit 
ratings to B.  The official GOV line, in public and private, 
is that things are good, are going to get better, and that 
the only reason they are not better now is because of the 
general strike of December 2002-February 2003, not the 
government.  In its annual report for 2003 as elsewhere, the 
GOV downplays the fact that good news are largely a result of 
the substantial increase in oil prices in 2003 and 2004.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
THINGS ARE GOOD - BUT IF NOT, IT\'S NOT OUR FAULT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) New GDP statistics released recently by the Venezuelan 
Central Bank (BCV) indicate that not only did Venezuelan GDP 
grow 23.1% in 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 (with 
growth in all sectors of the economy for the first time in 
three years), but that it grew by 4.4% over the same period 
in 2002, before the two month general strike of 2002-2003. 
The increase is in part because the government also revised 
the first quarter growth upward, from 29.8% to 34.8%.  Second 
quarter growth was not only 13.6% compared to last year, but 
4.5% over the first quarter of 2004.  Almost simultaneous to 
these announcements, Standard and Poor\'s raised Venezuela\'s 
long and short-term credit ratings (from B- and C, 
respectively) both to B. 
 
3. (SBU) The GOV, while taking credit for the recent good 
news, has avoided all responsibility for Venezuela\'s economic 
problems by blaming the participants of the December 
2002-February 2003 general strike, as criticism of their 
economic policy has continued.  The Ministry of Finance\'s 
\"Summary of Year 2003\" (written in early 2004 but distributed 
only recently) starts and continues for much of the text by 
blaming the strike, and 2002 pre-strike activities, for all 
problems in the economy.  The report uses harsh language, 
repeatedly citing \"financial blood-letting,\" the \"devastating 
effect\" of the strike, the \"immense harm inflicted on the 
country,\" \"traitors and conspirators,\" \"political 
destabilization,\" and the \"ferocious media campaign against 
the national economic policy.\"  Y2003 claims that the effects 
of the strike \"cannot be erased for a long time,\" and adds 
that those who called for the strike, and now blame GOV 
policy for the current problems, \"are conceptually and 
morally incapable of speaking to the nation.\"  It also 
asserts that the strikers have not put forth a recovery plan, 
and now \"maintain biased positions which in no way favor 
improvement of the productive climate of the country.\" 
 
4. (SBU) The report also cites a study conducted by the 
Ministry of Finance to prove just how wrong some of its 
critics were with their own estimates about GDP and inflation 
in 2003.  These errors by \"experts\" led the Ministry to 
conclude that, \"definitely, the country overcame an extremely 
difficult test, and has managed to set itself upon the path 
of economic recovery and growth.\"  When Finance Minister 
Tobias Nobrega was asked, in an interview televised on August 
28, what the GOV could have done better economically over the 
last five years, he could only come up with \"perhaps a 
mistake was not to have applied exchange controls in February 
2002.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
WE\'RE DOING THINGS RIGHT, BUT DON\'T ASK FOR SPECIFICS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (SBU) Not until page 9 of the 36 page text does the study 
mention a single action by the GOV - the imposition of 
 
 
exchange controls.  It then lauds the work of the Foreign 
Exchange Control Administration (CADIVI): \"the objective of 
protecting the international reserves and avoiding the 
financial blood-letting of the country has been achieved. 
International reserves closed 2003 above USD 20 billion.  The 
specter of a moratorium or cessation of payments has 
dissipated.  The patrimony of the Venezuelans was preserved.\" 
 Some of the alleged achievements are dubious, such as noting 
that CADIVI liquidated 50% of the forex it approved in 2003, 
It also claimed that CADIVI approved - NOT/NOT liquidated - 
\"about\" what the BCV provided before the \"petroleum 
sabotage,\" though BCV statistics indicate that liquidations 
in 2003 were only about 60% of those in 2002. 
 
6. (C) The improvement of the economy has raised the question 
as to why CADIVI still exists.  The report reminds us that it 
was conceived to be temporary, but \"its dismantling can only 
be a response to the disappearance of conditions that gave 
rise to its adoption, that is, the definitive extinction of 
the environment of irrationality and political and economic 
destabilization that has dominated since 2002.\"  In a private 
conversation with econoff on September 1, Finance Ministry 
Director of Public Credit Alejandro Dopazo confirmed that 
exchange controls will not be lifted until the GOV has the 
mechanisms \"to control the capital account.\"  Nobrega, in the 
August 28 interview, implied that CADIVI was needed because 
Venezuelans still lacked confidence in the economy.  He said 
that exchange controls were \"the only manner to guarantee 
that the foreign currency...stays here.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
HERE ARE (SOME OF) THE STATISTICS TO PROVE IT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The GOV has endeavored to justify its performance by 
citing various statistics, but it consistently tells only a 
part of the story.  For example, total GOV income for 2003 
was 88.9% of goal, despite the strike.  However, Customs 
collections were only 57.4% of goal, a side effect of the 
initial sluggishness of CADIVI\'s operations.  The report says 
that \"Plan Zero Evasion\" (a program to increase tax 
collections by SENIAT, the Venezuelan tax and Customs agency) 
brought in an additional USD 7.5 million - which is only 
0.13% of total tax revenues - ignoring the fact of increased 
revenue from high petroleum prices.  It lauds the dramatic 
drop in the EMBI Plus risk rating (a measure of credit risk 
of government debt relative to U.S. Treasury bonds) from its 
high in early 2003, but fails to mention that it reached 
similar peaks four other times during Chavez\'s tenure 
(including February, July and October of 2002), and remains 
higher than Colombia\'s rating. 
 
8. (C) On government spending, the report cites a budget 
reduction in January 2003, but does not mention - as 
statistics from the Ministry of Finance website show - that 
year-end spending increased by 34.4%.  The budget portion is 
long on names of projects funded, but short on details such 
as amounts spent.  It notes that internal debt increased, but 
not how much.  (According to the Ministry website, it grew 
48.0%.)  On external debt, the report claims that investor 
efforts to sell Venezuelan debt were triggered by the 
\"campaign launched against the Republic.\"  The GOV response 
was to \"take advantage of the circumstances in the financial 
market\" and lists in great detail - over 15% of the total 
text - the terms of new dollar-denominated bonds that were 
issued that year, but neglects to mention how the total 
external debt was affected (it increased 13.0%, according to 
the website, and from 20.9% of GDP to 26.8%, according to 
VENAMCHAM).  Dopazo was evasive when asked if debt would 
increase this year, saying only that the Ministry is 
\"studying\" bond options. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) Comparing 2004 results to strike-affected 2003 is of 
limited utility, but that the first semester improvement is 
an increase over the first half of 2002 (though still 5.3% 
lower than the GDP in the first half of 1998, before Chavez 
assumed the Venezuelan presidency) is a positive sign.  The 
 
 
deficit, however, continues to grow, as government spending 
for the year, which may be the primary cause for GDP growth, 
is projected to be 32% of GDP, a 21-year high.  GOV 
officials, while touting their good numbers, seem to be 
determinedly avoiding the obvious, that Venezuela is hitting 
one of its cyclical petroleum booms, and the Chavez 
government is doing what previous governments have done - 
spend the money as fast as possible.

for Reasons 1.4 (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s Coordinadora Democratica is hobbling after 
its defeat in the presidential recall referendum August 15. 
Some Chavez opponents blame the Coordinadora\'s leadership for 
either losing the referendum via an inept campaign or for not 
preventing the alleged fraud.  The dozens of opposition 
political parties and NGOs are split also over the fraud 
allegations and on how to proceed to the regional elections 
scheduled for October 31.  Another immediate concern is how 
to keep disillusioned anti-Chavez voters interested in 
electoral politics.  Further along, the Coordinadora faces 
the challenges of restructuring and maintaining unity among 
political parties and NGOs, a situation which will be greatly 
affected by how the regional elections play out.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Coordinadora Turns On Itself 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Since the victory of President Hugo Chavez in the 
August 15 recall referendum, the opposition Coordinadora 
Democratica has suffered from lack of leadership and internal 
squabbling.  Union Party Secretary General Luis Manuel 
Esculpi September 1 described the Coordinadora as 
representative of the Venezuelan opposition, with some 
believing Chavez beat them legitimately and others believing 
he used massive fraud to steal the election.  Either way, 
said Esculpi, the effect is a political defeat for the 
opposition and, thus, the Coordinadora.  Noticeably absent 
has been Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza, head of the 
Coordinadora, who is reportedly dedicating much of his time 
to his own re-election campaign.  The Coordinadora continues 
to operate, Esculpi said, but with few important meetings. 
The campaign committee, for example, has not met since just 
after the referendum. 
 
3. (C) Leonardo Carvajal, leader of the NGO Education 
Assembly, told poloff September 2 he had resigned from the 
political committee (though his organization remains a 
Coordinadora member) in protest of Mendoza\'s leadership. 
Carvajal said senior Coordinadora representatives in the run 
up to the election had ceased to consult with the political 
committee.  Both Carvajal and Esculpi asserted that Mendoza 
had become increasingly closed off before the referendum, 
putting his people in charge of key areas and not 
disseminating information.  Jose Luis Mejias, Secretary 
General of Primero Justicia, told poloff September 3 that 
Mendoza \"collapsed\" psychologically when he learned that 
Chavez had won.  Carvajal said Mendoza offered his 
resignation to the political committee on August 16, which 
the majority of the committee rejected.  Carvajal, believing 
Mendoza\'s continued leadership to be an error, withdrew from 
the political committee. 
 
4. (C) Carvajal, among others, also complained that the 
Coordinadora\'s negotiators at the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) accepted the terms of the CNE\'s first audit of voting 
machines that later proved to be fundamentally flawed. 
Movement to Socialism (MAS) Secretary General Felipe Mujica, 
one of the negotiators, contradicted Carvajal to poloff 
August 31, noting the opposition\'s only leverage in its 
dealings with the CNE was to withdraw from the referendum, 
which was not a politically viable option. 
 
------------------------------- 
GOV Kicks \'Em When They\'re Down 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOV has also circled in on the wounded opposition. 
 President Chavez declared on August 22 he no longer 
recognizes the Coordinadora as the legitimate representatives 
of the opposition, adding that it is past time the 
Coordinadora \"disappear from the face of the earth.\"  Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel reiterated this line on 
September 6, saying that the Coordinadora is dead and 
deserves a \"good Christian burial.\"  Numerous pro-Chavez 
politicians have conditioned negotiations between Chavez 
 
 
opponents and the GOV on the unconditional acceptance of the 
referendum results.  Mujica told poloff the GoV\'s 
non-recognition policy is nothing more than a ploy to keep 
the opposition from negotiating acceptable terms for the 
October 31 regional elections. 
 
------------------------------ 
Fraud and Elections Loom Large 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Though shaken, the Coordinadora focused on making its 
case that the GOV rigged the referendum and pressing for 
acceptable conditions with the CNE for the regional 
elections.  A Coordinadora committee headed by constitutional 
lawyer Tulio Alvarez will formally contest the CNE\'s 
certification of the referendum results, using comprehensive 
documentation of allegations of irregularities, bias and 
fraud.  Esculpi said the Alvarez report would be useful for 
highlighting vulnerabilities of the electoral process that 
the CNE should resolve before the opposition agrees to 
participate.  Mejias said the report would be convincing, but 
he said he was not sure where it would lead the opposition 
politically.  Mejias complained there were too many \"heads 
with no bodies\" within the Coordinadora, making decisions 
difficult.  Both Carvajal and Mejias are wary of the 
opposition\'s chances in the elections, warning that 
abstention among anti-Chavez voters will be high due to 
suspicions about the CNE\'s handling of the electoral process. 
 
----------------------- 
Whither the Opposition? 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Mejias said opposition groups would have to wait until 
after the regional elections to determine the fate of the 
Coordinadora.  Fresh from elections, Mejias said, the 
political parties will have a better sense of their relative 
strengths and, therefore, of the possible makeup of a new 
opposition coordinating entity.  Esculpi said he had 
consulted with center-left parties on the possibility of 
forming a new political alliance for the 2006 presidential 
race. 
 
8. (C) Juan Fernandez, leader of the NGO Gente de Petroleo, 
told poloff September 3 he had been holding town hall 
meetings with his membership throughout Venezuela to discuss 
his organization\'s post-referendum strategy.  Fernandez, a 
member of the Coordinadora\'s campaign committee, said he had 
received harsh criticism from some members over the 
Coordinadora\'s handling of the referendum and its aftermath. 
Fernandez noted that opposition parties are not clearing the 
air with their supporters as he is doing, and predicted that 
it will cause parties to lose in the regional elections. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) The Coordinadora is effectively rudderless and in need 
of re-invention.  Rather than attempting to salvage what grew 
to be a defined organization that took diverse opponents of 
Chavez through 18 months of electoral hurdles, Coordinadora 
members are choosing to shoot their own wounded.  The 
upcoming regional elections serve to intensify each party\'s 
focus on its own fortunes.  The GOV has also done its best to 
ease the passing of the Coordinadora into the political 
afterlife.  But it may be too soon to write it off the 
Coordinadora.  The fraud report is an important step by the 
opposition to buck up supporters and, though more difficult, 
to prove to them and to others that Chavez stole the 
election.  The Coordinadora\'s future depends on its member 
groups, and on whether they can come back from their 
political defeat, and to the extent to which they can find 
common purpose.  A key test will be whether opposition 
parties can agree on unified candidacies in the regional 
elections so as to increase the opposition\'s ability to 
defeat Chavista opponents.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Opponents of President Hugo Chavez put forward their 
preliminary findings of the investigation of alleged fraud 
during the August 15 presidential recall referendum September 
8.  Lawyer Tulio Alvarez, presenting a 70-page preliminary 
report, noted irregularities in all stages of the referendum 
process and called for a legal challenge of the official 
results.  He gave the report to Coordinadora Democratica 
Leader Enrique Mendoza, who publicly re-emerged September 7, 
for use with the National Electoral Council (CNE).  Harvard 
professor Ricardo Hausmann, working with the NGO Sumate, 
revealed statistical inconsistencies in the results that, in 
his view, confirm the presence of fraud in the referendum 
September 5.  The GOV rejected the allegations, saying the 
Coordinadora confused \"speculation\" with evidence, and 
suggested that the opposition is living in a fantasy land. 
The anti-fraud offensive has more political than legal value 
given the GOV\'s firm control over the CNE, and for the moment 
puts Chavez opponents on a more sure footing on the 
allegations of GOV fraud, irregularities and bias.  A U.S. 
statistician and electoral expert would help us all evaluate 
the Coordinadora\'s considerable effort to prove fraud.End 
summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Mendoza Back on the Scene 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Opponents of President Hugo Chavez bolstered their 
attacks against the government over alleged fraud in the 
August 15 recall referendum beginning September 5.  After 
weeks of low visibility, Coordinadora Democratica leader and 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza appeared on a taped 
televised address September 7 in which he recounted the 
history of the impediments the opposition faced in getting to 
the referendum and described some early fraud theories (ref 
a).  Mendoza claimed the National Electoral Council (CNE) had 
intentionally slowed down the voting system on referendum day 
so as keep the number of votes low, which he said favored 
Chavez.  Mendoza said his presentation was the first report 
of \"substantiated hypotheses\" that are coming to light.  He 
said there are other \"traces of fraud,\" but cautioned that 
the Coordinadora would not reveal everything it knew to 
prevent the GOV from destroying evidence. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Alvarez Alleges Institutional Fraud 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Working on behalf of the Coordinadora, constitutional 
lawyer Tulio Alvarez released on September 8 the preliminary 
report of fraud allegations compiled by a multi-disciplinary 
team of 40 experts in 14 fields (refs b and c).  Alvarez 
recounts the weakening of the CNE and Supreme Court by the 
Chavez administration, the CNE\'s rejection of the first 
petition signature drive results, and CNE\'s biased handling 
of the second petition drive.  The report is critical of the 
Carter Center\'s handling of its observation mission during 
the referendum and subsequent audit, calling the mission\'s 
performance on the latter \"insufficient, superficial, even 
irresponsible.\" 
 
4. (U) Alvarez asserts that the GOV issued identity cards 
illegally to pad voter rolls.  Alvarez charged that the 
electoral registry increase of 1.8 million voters between 
March and July 2004 was unprecedented.  He alleged some 
300,000 of these new voters are non-existent and indicative 
of GOV manipulation.  Alvarez contrasted the growth in the 
electorate with population growth and the population of 
localities.  He said he had documented more than 100 
municipalities, mostly in areas where manual vote counts were 
used, where registered voters ranged from 80 to 150 percent 
of the actual population. 
 
5. (U) The Alvarez report includes information from logs of 
CANTV, the privatized national telecommunications company 
that operated the automated electoral system\'s network on 
August 15.  CANTV, Alvarez asserts, recorded two-way 
transmissions between the voting machines and the CNE\'s main 
server in Caracas, which he said implies the machines\' 
results could have been altered.  He said the data 
transmission -- both incoming and outgoing -- were notably 
different, an oddity given the machines were transmitting 
similar information.  He also said the CANTV logs show 
communication between the CNE and some voting machines as 
early as 7 a.m. on election day, which is prohibited by law 
until after polls close. 
 
6. (U) Alvarez recommended that the Coordinadora: contest the 
referendum results based on the manipulation of the electoral 
registry, which if legally successful would nullify the 
referendum results; and refuse to participate in future 
elections utilizing the automated system until fundamental 
changes are made.  Alvarez also called on international 
organizations to oversee an audit of Venezuela\'s national 
identity card system, and suggested the application of the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act against Smartmatic (based in 
Florida) and CANTV (whose controlling investor is Verizon). 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Hausmann Concludes There Must Be Fraud 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Separately, Harvard Professor Ricardo Hausmann and MIT 
Professor Roberto Rigobon (both Venezuelan citizens and 
pro-opposition) analyzed the referendum results, crossing 
them with data from two August 15 exit polls (that gave a 
landslide win to the \"Si\") and the Reafirmazo signature drive 
in November 2003.  Hausmann, who presented the results at a 
Sumate press conference, used statistical methods to conclude 
that if the voting results were manipulated, it would have to 
have been committed at level of the voting center, not at 
each voting machine within a particular center.  He also said 
he found that the manipulation was not applied evenly to 
every voting center.  Such manipulation, he theorizes, could 
only have been coordinated as a central point such as the 
CNE\'s tallying room, which was closed to international 
observers during all but the last moments of the election. 
The study also claims the 150 machines audited by the Carter 
Center and CNE on August 18 were not/not a random sample. 
Hausmann said the 150 audited machines delivered 10 percent 
more votes for the \"Si\" than the universal results, a result 
that has a less-than-one-percent chance of occurring 
randomly. 
 
---------------------------- 
GOV Calls It A Fantasy World 
---------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Samuel Moncada, member of the pro-Chavez campaign 
committee Comando Maisanta, immediately rejected the Alvarez 
report, calling it a re-hash of old news that confuses 
speculation with evidence.  He accused the opposition of 
being against poor people voting in elections.  Moncada 
called the report\'s attack on the naturalization of 
foreigners \"deeply xenophobic.\"  Vice President Jose Vicente 
Rangel called the report \"fiction\" designed to cover the 
Coordinadora\'s grand defeat.  The opposition would have to 
perform magic to justify its claims, he said, adding that the 
Coordinadora had entered into a fantasy world.  He argued 
that there was no fraud on August 15 and those who allege it 
have no sense.  He called on the opposition be sincere, 
serious, and capable of accepting their defeat. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) With the referendum already three weeks behind them, 
the opposition is just now laying out its first coherent 
allegations of fraud.  There is no damning evidence, but 
supposition and investigation results that put the 
opposition\'s claims on more sure footing.  Mendoza\'s message 
sought to stir the spirits of disappointed Chavez opponents, 
while Alvarez\'s report is more effective, raising significant 
questions about the electoral registry and the data 
transmission.  Hausmann\'s approach is abstruse, but contains 
conclusions that buttress the pervasive \"there was fraud\" 
 
sentiment among Chavez opponents.  We do not expect these 
reports to overturn the referendum results or to receive a 
fair hearing at the hands of the CNE or Venezuela\'s courts. 
The reports are a serious repudiation of the automated voting 
system, however, and set the stage for a fight over the 
regional elections procedures.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s gubernatorial, mayoral, and regional 
deputy elections, scheduled for October 31, are cloaked in 
uncertainty with little more than six weeks before the date. 
Procedurally, there are questions regarding who the members 
of the regional and municipal electoral boards will be, if 
these local boards will tally and announce the results as the 
law provides, how many new members of voting tables will be 
assigned, and if the Electoral Registry will be opened to the 
voters for changes and corrections.  With allegations of 
fraud and irregularities involving the August 15 referendum 
still in the open, opposition participation remains 
uncertain.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
The Timeline and the Reality 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) announced 
gubernatorial, mayoral, and regional deputy elections are 
scheduled for October 31 and released a timeline leading up 
to the elections.  The CNE is currently discussing where, 
how, and by whom the votes will be tallied, according to 
Diego Acevedo, an assistant in the office of CNE Director 
Sobella Mejias.  There is no guarantee, he said, that the 
tally will be done by the regional and municipal boards as 
the law provides. These local boards are also to check and 
certify the electronic voting machines.  However, there has 
been controversy surrounding the local boards since the CNE 
removed some of their members for having signed the petitions 
for the recall of President Hugo Chavez.  The CNE replaced 
them with \"unbiased\" representatives before the August 15 
referendum, effectively giving Chavez supporters control of 
the regional boards.  While opposition candidates are calling 
for the reinstitution of equitable regional and municipal 
boards before the regional elections, Acevedo said it was 
unlikely the CNE would remove the most recently appointed 
board members. 
 
3. (U) Between September 20-21, the CNE also is to appoint 
poll workers.  On September 2, CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez 
said the CNE would consider doubling the number of electoral 
tables from 12,000 to 24,000.  Rodriguez also noted that the 
creation of new voting centers was under discussion. 
Doubling the voting tables would mean appointing 60,000 new 
poll workers (5 members per voting table) before the regional 
elections. 
 
4. (C) The CNE is scheduled to publish the electoral register 
between September 14-16.  According to Diego Acevedo, the CNE 
has not determined if the electoral register will be opened 
for registered voters to correct or update their information, 
including the disputed additions to the electoral registry 
and voting center transfers before the August 15 referendum. 
The Register, however, was open from September 4-8 for 
persons who recently became of voting age (18) to register 
and for voters who were unintentionally eliminated to file a 
complaint. 
 
----------------- 
Testing, Testing 
----------------- 
 
5. (U) On October 3, a voting simulation is scheduled to test 
the automatic voting machines and the transmission of data 
from the voting centers to the totalization centers.  There 
also is to be a test of the totalization and 
telecommunications programs from October 8-12.  The CNE 
already conducted a voting simulation September 3 to 
determine the amount of time it would take each voter to vote 
with the automatic touch screens. According to the Minister 
of Communication and Information, Andres Izarra, the delay 
time is up to eight minutes because of the complexity of the 
voting and the number of possible candidates. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Unanswered Questions For The Opposition 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) With allegations of fraud and irregularities involving 
the August 15 referendum still in the open and significant 
changes to the electoral process unlikely, opposition 
participation remains uncertain.  Acevedo also said the 
Coordinadora\'s inability to unite and form one list of 
demands for the CNE was a weakness the CNE would take 
advantage of by acquiescing to the most inconsequential 
proposals from the \"laundry list\".  Some of the various 
demands from the political parties and NGOs that form the 
Coordinadora are a complete audit of the Electoral Registry, 
a total manual count, the elimination of blank voting 
notebooks, equally constituted regional and electoral boards, 
the reinstitution of the voting table members who were 
removed (up to 18,000), the auditing of software and hardware 
for the electronic voting machines, and a public audit of the 
voting results. 
 
---------------- 
Chavista Outlook 
---------------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez\'s Movimiento Quinta Repulica (MVR) has objected 
to the October 31 regional election date, proposing regional 
elections for October 10 instead.  According to Acevedo, this 
minor disagreement is being used as a smokescreen to show CNE 
decisions are not always partial to Chavez.  MVR Deputy 
William Lara said if the date was not changed to October 10, 
the MVR candidates would still win on October 31.  Lara also 
said the MVR was closer to achieving unity for the regional 
elections and that sustained efforts and dialogue would 
produce visible results within a month. He noted, however, 
that in some municipalities the MVR would not be able to 
achieve complete unity, but reiterated that alternate 
\"revolutionary\" candidates would be \"self-excluding\" 
themselves by challenging Chavez\'s chosen candidate.  Lara 
was referring to MVR Deputy Desiree Santos\' statements to the 
press that the candidates Chavez supported were chosen by the 
electoral base, and not simply appointed, so candidates 
running against them would be \"self-excluded.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The National Electoral Council (CNE) has demonstrated 
that  strict adherence to the electoral laws is not the norm 
in Venezuela.  Improvization on rules and regulations will 
likely continue to mark the preparations for the regional 
elections.  The opposition is facing unfavorable terms like 
biased regional and municipal boards with little hope of 
achieving significant changes in the electoral process before 
the regional elections.  The traditional opposition voters 
are disillusioned and many are not likely to vote under 
current electoral conditions.  To stay alive in the regional 
elections, the opposition needs to unify competing candidates 
and motivate its electoral base.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The report issued by OAS Secretary General (SYG) Cesar 
Gaviria on September 13 gave ammunition to both the GOV and 
the opposition regarding the question of fraud in the August 
15 presidential recall referendum.  The GOV played up 
Gaviria\'s admonitions to the opposition to begin to accept 
the referendum results.  The Coordinadora Democratica called 
the report \"adequate and favorable,\" finding in it criticisms 
of the GOV.  The Coordinadora formally presented its 
allegations of fraud on September to the National Electoral 
Council (CNE), which has 20 days to rule.  The Coordinadora 
also requested a nullification of the CNE\'s results at the 
Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court on September 15. 
Though the possibility of reversQg the referendum results 
are practically nil, the opposition is nonetheless seeking to 
exhaust legal and administrative remedies.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
GOV Finds the Silver Lining 
--------------------------- 
 
2.(U) Venezuelans had a mixed reaction to OAS Secretary 
General Cesar Gaviria\'s final report on OAS efforts to 
relieve Venezuela\'s political crisis, released on September 
13.  The GOV emphasized Gaviria\'s repeated advice to the 
opposition that it \"get on the path to accepting\" its defeat 
in the August 15 recall referendum against President Hugo 
Chavez.  Minister of Interior and Justice Jesse Chacon told 
reporters September 14 the GOV respects the report but 
disagrees with some parts of it.  Chacon said Gaviria\'s 
message is more or less that Venezuela has been unable to 
settle its political crisis peacefully because the opposition 
refuses to accept the results.  Venezuelan OAS Ambassador 
Jorge Valero told state television on September 16 that 
Gaviria\'s report is personal, does not represent the OAS\'s 
official position, and even contradicts the report given by 
Brazilian PermRep Valter Pecly, who headed the observation 
mission during its final stage. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Opposition Sees Political Backing 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Coordinadora Democratica representative Asdrubal 
Aguiar called Gaviria\'s report \"appropriate and favorable,\" 
suggesting Venezuelans read it carefully to understand 
Gaviria\'s position.  Felipe Mujica, Secretary General of the 
Movement toward Socialism (MAS), told poloff September 16 the 
Gaviria\'s report has an anti-Chavez message.  Mujica said 
Gaviria lightly criticized the opposition so as to make his 
stronger attacks against Chavez, such as Gaviria\'s assertion 
that the Chavez\'s policies are eroding fundamental democratic 
principles in Venezuela, more credible.  Aguiar said 
Gaviria\'s report implicitly endorses the creation of an 
international group to investigate the referendum and 
determine whether there was fraud. 
 
4. (C) Coordinadora representative Jorge Casado told polcouns 
September 13 that the Coordinadora plans to make 
presentations of its fraud allegations throughout Venezuela. 
Fraud report drafter Tulio Alvarez began visiting Venezuelan 
states going to Zulia September 14 to present the 
information, Casado said, adding that other opposition 
figures would also make presentations.  Coordinadora 
representatives will also visit other countries, funding 
permitted, to present their case.  Casado said they first 
intended to visit \"Friends\" governments such as Mexico. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Coordinadora Contests Referendum At CNE, Supreme Court 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (U) Coordinadora representatives also presented a formal 
objection to the National Electoral Council (CNE) on 
 
 
September 9.  The Coordinadora documented 1,077 reports of 
irregularities related to the presidential recall referendum. 
 Coordinadora legal advisor D\'lsa Solorzano told reporters 
they had specifically presented proof of manipulation of the 
electoral registry, which if found true by the CNE board 
should result in the nullification of the referendum results. 
 (The Alvarez project also alleges irregularities in the 
electoral registry.)  The CNE has 20 working days to respond 
to the Coordinadora\'s request.  Coordinadora negotiator 
Enrique Naime told reporters his organization had requested 
relevant documents from the CNE to facilitate the 
investigation on August 23, to which the CNE did not respond. 
 
6. (U) On September 15, Solorzano petitioned the Electoral 
Chamber of the Supreme Court for a nullification of the 
election based on violations of the constitution and of the 
Organic Law of Suffrage and Political Participation. 
Specifically, Solorzano claims the CNE violated electoral law 
by having poll workers transmit data before printing the 
tally sheets.  Solorzano said the legal motion would require 
the Electoral Chamber to request all relevant documentation 
from the CNE.  In addition, an NGO named Active Citizens 
(Ciudadania Activa) petitioned the Electoral Chamber to order 
the suspension of the October 31 regional elections until 
problems with the electoral process experienced during the 
referendum are sorted out. 
 
----------------------------- 
CNE Directors Already Decided 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (U) The pro-Chavez directors of the CNE board commented 
publicly on the opposition\'s request.  Director Oscar 
Battaglini said the referendum had already been decided, 
which caused the Coordinadora to demand that Battaglini 
recuse himself from deciding on the case.  Battaglini 
refused, arguing that he is not a member of a formal 
tribunal, but rather a representative of a branch of the 
Venezuelan government.  CNE President Francisco Carrasquero 
defended his institution for its handling of the referendum, 
saying that political actors are trying to impugn the CNE 
with allegations of fraud and tricks.  Director Jorge 
Rodriguez said the CNE would treat the opposition\'s request 
fairly, proposing even that the CNE\'s deliberations be made 
public. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Gaviria\'s report gave the opposition a shot in the 
arm, though it does not seem to be having a lasting effect. 
Chavez opponents are exhausting legal avenues for contesting 
the referendum, which they believe necessary while moving on 
politically.  The opposition\'s chances of legally overturning 
the referendum results are slim-to-none.  Both the CNE and 
the Electoral Chamber are firmly in the hands of Chavez 
sympathizers who seem to have already made their decisions. 
It is possible these appeals could unearth some new 
information that exposes vulnerabilities with the CNE\'s 
electoral process.  This might help the opposition exact fair 
conditions from the CNE for the October 31 regional 
elections, but chances of that are similar to those of 
overturning the referendum results.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) In 2003, a bill was introduced in the National 
Assembly to punish violations of the newly created foreign 
exchange controls.  The proposed text was harsh and has not 
progressed far since its introduction, but there are 
indications that it will be up for discussion in the session 
that began September 15.  Pro-GOV members of the National 
Assembly Finance Committee provided us with a copy of the 
most recent draft.  While the name has been softened and the 
penalties reduced, it still seeks to criminalize relatively 
minor financial transactions.  Meanwhile, actual liquidations 
of foreign exchange in August reached their highest amount 
since the controls were instituted.  Merely having under 
consideration  a law criminalizing parallel market 
transactions allows the GOV to intimidate the private sector. 
 If the final version is similar to the most recent draft, it 
will be a blow to any hopes for serious business-government 
dialogue.   END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
WHERE IT STANDS NOW 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) Shortly after the GOV imposed foreign exchange 
controls and set up a new government agency (The Foreign 
Exchange Control Administration, CADIVI) to monitor them in 
February 2003, it introduced a draft \"Law of Foreign Exchange 
Crimes\" to impose criminal penalties for violations of the 
new regime.  After languishing for over a year, the bill 
passed its first reading in May 2004.  Since then, it has not 
moved forward, as legislators focused on legislation to 
change Venezuela\'s Supreme Court.  However, contacts have 
told us recently that a new version of the bill, which the 
Chavista majority could quickly pass into law, will be ready 
soon. 
 
3. (SBU) The text approved in the first reading is posted on 
the National Assembly website, and is both harsh and full of 
vitriolic language.  It calls for a 5-10 year prison sentence 
and (not/not or) a fine for simply buying/selling over USD 
1000 on the black market.  The \"Exposition of Motives\" (EOM) 
repeatedly describes unspecified acts (implied to be any 
foreign exchange transaction not conducted via official 
channels) as \"malignant,\" directly damaging the economic 
order,\" and defining them as \"criminal,\" even while 
acknowledging that there are no pre-existing penalties for 
such acts.  It highlights the \"drastic and sustained 
shrinking of international reserves\" which gave rise to 
controls and speaks of the \"necessity and urgency\" of 
establishing penalties for violating them. 
 
--------------------- 
WHERE IT\'S GOING NEXT 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) National Assembly Finance Committee Chairman Rodrigo 
Cabezas and fellow committee member Jose Sanguino (both of 
the pro-Chavez Fifth Republic Movement, MVR) told econcouns 
on September 9 that the bill was currently awaiting action by 
a sub-committee (Note: the Assembly returned to work on 
September 15).  They said that some obstacles in the text had 
already been worked out, such as significantly raising the 
USD 1000 minimum transaction that will be considered a 
criminal act, but implied that the final version would 
encompass all qualifying transactions not approved by CADIVI. 
 The bill now bears the somewhat less polemical title of \"Law 
of Illicit Exchange Activities,\" rather than \"Crimes.\" 
Cabezas said Colombia, where foreign exchange transactions 
are free but registered, could be a model.  Sanguino 
indicated they wanted to avoid events like during the 1994 
banking crisis, when people were known to have taken 
\"suitcases full of cash\" out of the country without 
consequence, since there was then no law against it. 
 
 
Econcouns stressed that businesses needed the flexibility 
provided by being able to transfer money predictably, and 
Cabezas asserted that there were now fewer obstacles and 
bottlenecks in the CADIVI process. 
 
5. (C) Econcouns requested a copy of the most recent draft, 
which post received from Cabezas on September 17.  Despite 
the softer name, it still calls for prison sentences (now of 
two to six years) for individuals who exchange USD 4000 or 
more, or businesses that exchange USD 9000, outside of CADIVI 
procedures.  It also requires declarations of the import or 
export of such amounts, except for temporary visitors, though 
they are not exempt from the requirement to use official 
exchange mechanisms and penalties for failure to do so.  The 
\"Exposition of Motives\" has been toned down, but a new 
section blames circumvention of the exchange regime for 
\"producing a devastating effect on the key economic 
variables, such as increased inflation, interest rates, a 
diminishing of the credibility and financial stability of the 
Republic as a potential destination of investment and 
capital.\" 
 
---------------- 
WHAT IT COULD DO 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Meanwhile, it is unclear how this proposed law may 
eventually affect GOV activities.  The Ministry of Finance 
has been selling dollar-denominated bonds, structured so that 
investors can buy in part them with dollars obtained at the 
official rate and re-sell them  at the parallel market 
exchange rate (see ref B).  The Finance Ministry has recently 
obtained legislative authority to borrow an additional USD 
1.5 billion.  Perhaps wanting to retain the option of 
structuring further transactions in the same way as past 
ones, Finance Minister Nobrega has publicly referred to the 
idea of such a law as \"complicated.\"  Venezuelan-American 
Chamber of Commerce legal analyst Bernardo Galavis told 
econoff August 31 that he believes the version of the bill 
that will come out of the \"second reading\" will essentially 
be written by the Ministry of Finance.  Alejandro Dopazo, 
head of the Public Credit Office at the Ministry of Finance, 
attempted to downplay the influence his Ministry had on the 
process, but opined to econoff on September 2 that the final 
version of the bill will be watered down. 
 
----------------------------------- 
STATUS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE REQUESTS 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) In the meantime, while the business sector views with 
concern the possible imposition of criminal penalties for 
exchange violations, there are fewer complaints about CADIVI 
operations than at any previous time.  While there are 
individual cases with problems, the majority of businesses 
seem to be getting as much exchange as they need.  Actual 
liquidations reached a high of USD 63.9 million per day in 
August, up 11% over July, 37% over the first half of 2004 and 
71% from the fourth quarter of 2003, as ever more of 
Venezuela\'s foreign exchange needs are met through the 
official system as opposed to the parallel market. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) There are conflicting signals coming from the National 
Assembly and the Finance Ministry as to what the law will 
contain and when it will move forward.  Criminalizing foreign 
exchange activities, nonetheless, has not been among the 
legislative priorities enunciated publicly by President 
Chavez and his leading legislators; but for the GOV, the 
threat of such legislation offers the same intimidation 
quotient as a law at this time.  Also, pushing the 
legislative agenda would compete with the GOV\'s high profile 
outreach program to the business community which has included 
large public meetings between Chavez and businessmen, as well 
as smaller meetings on his part and that of ministers with 
the leaders of individual sectoral business associations 
(while umbrella private sector association FEDECAMARAS 
remains frozen out).  The GOV\'s message appears to be that, 
 
 
while there is no room for business community activism on 
\"political\" issues, the GOV is prepared for dialogue and 
compromise on purely \"economic\" ones.  Should the most recent 
draft of this bill become law, that message would be severely 
undermined.

Summary

1. (C) Five groups nominally associated with the Venezuelan 
opposition -- including political parties Alianza Bravo 
Pueblo and Causa R --  announced their separation from the 
Coordinadora Democratica on September 21.  The groups 
criticized the Coordinadora\'s handling of the referendum 
campaign and its apparent willingness to participate in the 
October 31 regional elections without changes to the 
electoral process.  Separately, opposition governors and 
mayors formed a new committee to take over management of the 
regional elections campaign.  These are natural, tactical 
moves based on opposition groups\' relative readiness for the 
elections.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Minor Groups Leave The Coordinadora 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Several opposition political parties, NGOs, and 
individuals announced on September 21 their separation from 
the Coordinadora Democratica.  They asserted the Coordinadora 
is sending the mixed message that opponents of President Hugo 
Chavez should proceed to the October 31 regional elections 
even though the National Electoral Council (CNE) has not made 
changes to the electoral process that the Coordinadora 
denounced as fraudulent.  Alianza Bravo Pueblo (ABP), Causa 
R,  Un Solo Pueblo (headed by William Ojeda), Vision 
Emergente (an NGO led by Cipriano Heredia), Fuerza Liberal 
(an NGO headed by Haydee Deutsch), Rafael Alfonso (an 
opposition businessman), Oswaldo Alvarez_ Paz (former foreign 
minister), and Carlos Blanco (a political analyst) all 
withdrew their support from the Coordinadora, according to 
press reports.  ABP President Antonio Ledezma said the 
opposition should not participate in the regional elections 
without guarantees of the transparency of the process. 
 
3. (C) Causa R leader Andres Velazquez said the time of the 
Coordinadora had passed with the August 15 recall referendum. 
 Velazquez said the Coordinadora failed to catch the CNE\'s 
fraud during the referendum and has done nothing to improve 
conditions for the next elections.  He told poloff September 
22 he is in discussion with several parties about a new 
movement to be formed after the regional elections \"that will 
offer Venezuelans a new alternative\" from the current 
political context.  Velazquez predicted a crippling defeat 
for the opposition in the regional elections. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Governors and Mayors Pick Up The Baton 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Opposition governors and mayors announced September 22 
the formation of an electoral committee to manage the 
regional elections and negotiate conditions with the CNE. 
Yaracuy state Governor Eduardo Lapi described the opposition 
governors and mayors as \"generals with the troops for this 
battle\" and boasted of a decisive win for opposition 
candidates.  Lapi announced that he will coordinate the 
committee, joined by Zulia state Governor Manuel Rosales and 
Metropolitan Caracas Mayor Alfredo Pena.  Lapi, a former 
COPEI member now with Convergencia, said the major opposition 
parties support the formation of the committee. 
 
5. (U) Notably absent from the group was Carabobo state 
Governor Henrique Salas Feo (Proyecto Venezuela) and 
Anzoategui Governor David de Lima (formerly with the Movement 
to Socialism, MAS), the latter of whom is embroiled in a high 
profile dispute over public finances in his state. 
Coordinadora leader and Miranda state Governor Enrique 
Mendoza was present for the announcement and made brief 
remarks in support of the new committee.  Lapi said the 
committee will take over CNE negotiations from the 
Coordinadora, which will focus on documenting the fraud 
allegations surrounding the recall referendum. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) These developments are tactical responses to the 
opposition\'s basic dilemma:  How can Venezuelans participate 
in elections they know to be unfair in the light of the 
August 15 \"fraud?\"  Ledezma and company are minor political 
groups with no real prospects in the elections.  Ledezma had, 
in fact, left the Coordinadora prior to the signature appeals 
process in May and was not invited back.  Velazquez has only 
nominally associated himself with the Coordinadora, depending 
on the political winds.  Regarding the new campaign 
committee, it is reasonable that the opposition governors and 
mayors take center stage in managing their own elections. 
These elected leaders have been meeting regularly for several 
months to discuss common issues and seem to work well 
together.  The new committee, at least, will spell the 
opposition\'s battle-worn leadership.  The committee faces a 
tall task, however, in beating the well organized and 
relatively more unified forces of Chavismo.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The head of the Venezuelan tax authority (SENIAT) 
announced on September 7 that the GOV\'s goal for 2005 tax 
collections (including taxes on oil revenues) would be 56% 
higher than the 2004 goal.  This comes at a time when tax 
collection methods, particularly a program called \"Plan Zero 
Evasion,\" have come increasingly under fire from the private 
sector.  There are no indications that the Plan has uncovered 
any actual tax evasion, but has generated limited revenue 
through fines.  The fines are often accompanied by temporary 
business closures, which the business sector argues are a 
violation of due process, but SENIAT officials assert 
(without providing specifics) that the Plan is a rousing 
success.  The raids underscore the business community\'s 
vulnerability to heavy-handed government interference.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
THE PLAN - ZERO TAX EVASION 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In May 2003, the GOV introduced a program to increase 
tax collections, called \"Plan Zero Evasion.\"  Jorge Molina, 
the Chief of SENIAT\'s \"fiscalizacion\" (on-site audit) 
division, told econoff on September 15 that Plan Zero Evasion 
had two main objectives.  The first was to create what he 
termed \"subjective risk,\" i.e., to put people \"on alert\" and 
create the impression that payment was absolutely expected, 
something he said has never been the case in Venezuela.  The 
second objective was three-fold: to inform the public about 
expectations and the law, to verify fulfillment of formal 
record-keeping obligations, and to perform complete audits 
when necessary. 
 
3. (C) To carry out the plan, SENIAT auditors, accompanied by 
National Guard troops, visit several businesses of the same 
type throughout the country simultaneously.  The decision as 
to what type of business will be audited next is made outside 
of the audit division, which Molina did not clarify further. 
(Comment: We would bet that SENIAT head Jose Vielma Mora 
makes these decisions himself, perhaps following 
consultations with higher political levels in the GOV.  End 
comment.)  He stated that an audit could be organized in as 
little as two days.  SENIAT launched a new tactic the second 
weekend of September, when students were sent into local 
malls armed with the authority to assess fines of up to USD 
64.32 to customers who left stores without a legal receipt. 
Molina said that \"many\" fines were assessed. 
 
---------------------------------- 
THE METHOD - THE STORY OF AN AUDIT 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Ronald Evans, a tax attorney at the Caracas office of 
leading U.S.-based international law firm Baker & McKenzie 
(and also the President of the Venezuelan Financial Law 
Association and a member of the VENAMCHAM tax committee), 
told econoff on September 10 about the audit of his firm by 
SENIAT, which began in May 2004.  SENIAT auditors appeared 
unannounced with six National Guardsmen, along with cameras 
from the state television station.  They brought personal 
computers, expecting to download all data from the firm\'s 
computers.  After protest that this would violate client 
confidentiality, a compromise was reached, that four 
 
SIPDIS 
attorneys would preside over a file-by-file review to 
determine which contained the firm\'s own tax information.  A 
complete one-day computer shutdown was required to accomplish 
this, during which the firm had to rent hotel space to 
continue basic operations.  After the review, SENIAT assessed 
a fine of USD 7800, not for tax evasion, but rather for 
failure to properly fulfill all formal tax accounting 
requirements.  A 48-hour closure was mandated, along with 
another one-day computer shutdown.  Employees were allowed to 
 
 
work, but all public contact was prohibited.  The computer 
shutdown fell on the day when Baker & McKenzie was to perform 
its end of fiscal year accounting.  It requested a one-day 
postponement, which was denied because the closure was 
already \"programmed.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
THE RESULTS - LOTS OF BUSINESSES CLOSED, VERY LITTLE MONEY 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5. (C) SENIAT\'s Molina stated that about 3300 businesses had 
been audited under the Plan in 2004, and that about 70% of 
those visited in the greater Caracas area had been closed 
(from one to three days), but only about 50% nationally.  He 
said that the closures were - as in the case of Baker & 
McKenzie - for failure to fulfill formal requirements rather 
than tax evasion, and that the main problem was not having 
the complete accounting ledgers on site as required.  He 
indicated that personal knowledge of the business/owner by 
the auditors was sometimes a factor in a decision not to 
close a business, which he used to explain why the closure 
rate was lower outside of Caracas.  Molina estimated that 
2004 collections from the Plan were in the range of USD 1.9 
million, which is less than .03% of total SENIAT collections 
for the year.  (NOTE: statistics from the Venezuelan-American 
Chamber of Commerce - VENAMCHAM - state that 66% of audited 
businesses have been temporarily closed as a result of the 
Plan, and that the total of fees collected since the Plan 
began was USD 1.7 million.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
THE COMPLAINTS - ILLEGAL AND EXCESSIVE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Based on his contacts with other businesses, Evans 
said that the circumstances of Baker & McKenzie\'s audit were 
fairly representative.  However, it is the only law firm (and 
as far as he knows, the only business) that has protested the 
closure and fine in court.  It argued that the closure 
violates its right to due process, that it is 
disproportionate to the alleged offenses, and that it 
violates the constitutional principle of efficient tax 
collection.  Evans says other companies agree with those 
charges, but seem to consider the fines not worth the trouble 
to fight, or prefer to keep things as quiet as possible.  He 
has spoken publicly about the audit issue, once commenting on 
the SENIAT audit of bakeries, pointing out that they were 
already struggling to make a profit because of the price 
controls on bread products.  Vielma Mora sent Evans an email 
which, though not overt, Evans considered threatening.  He 
showed econoff the email, where Vielma declares \"there is a 
gigantic breach of evasion\" by bakeries - before any audits 
were completed.  VENAMCHAM Executive Vice President Antonio 
Herrera, in a letter dated July 6 that he provided to post, 
complained to Vielma Mora that SENIAT\'s actions had created 
an impression of unequal treatment, harmed the rule of law, 
and discouraged investment. 
 
7. (C) The GOV has responded to some of these complaints. 
According to VENAMCHAM Finance Committee staffer Maria 
Angelina Velasquez, Vielma Mora, in an August 4 meeting with 
the VENAMCHAM tax and foreign trade committees, promised to 
\"tone down\" its audits by no longer bringing camera crews and 
possibly reducing the number of National Guard troops who 
accompany the auditors.  Molina, however, told econoff that 
there were no plans to stop audits with troops, as some that 
had taken place without any such protection resulted in 
\"cacerolazos\" (pot-banging protests) and physical abuse, as 
in one incident in which a woman (not from the business being 
audited) kicked him.  Molina also disputed the charges of 
illegality and inefficiency, claiming that the process was 
completely justified in the tax code, and was much more 
efficient and effective than ever. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) The stated purpose of Plan Zero Evasion is laudable - 
to reduce tax evasion in a country where such behavior is 
rampant.  However, the fact that the audits continue without 
 
 
change when SENIAT is not discovering evasion and generating 
minimal revenue suggests that the purpose is different.  The 
raids underscore to the business community its vulnerability 
to GOV harassment and the importance of staying in its good 
graces.  Targeting multinational and prominent local firms 
also helps bolster the GOV\'s image as a \"revolutionary 
government\" unafraid to take on vested interests.  The much 
ballyhooed Plan Zero Evasion also, of course, heightens the 
profile of Vielma Mora, a former military officer and 
participant in Chavez\'s failed 1992 coup.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Responding to reftel demarche regarding trafficking 
in persons, September 21, Venezuelan MFA officials insisted 
that the TIP report had not accurately assessed Venezuela\'s 
anti-trafficking initiatives under its treaty obligations 
with the United Nations. PolOff reiterated USG reasoning 
behind placing Venezuela on Tier 3, and emphasized that the 
Embassy had sought to obtain required information from the 
GOV, but had been unsuccessful. The MFA officials offered to 
provide information if the USG would consider removing 
Venezuela from Tier 3. When PolOff noted that such 
information would be welcome for next year\'s report, the MFA 
official retracted the offer. One official said the GOV does 
not give information to foreign governments, only to the 
United Nations, with whom it has a treaty responsibility. 
Septel will report GOV police update on TIPs to our legatt. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to the MFA Director 
for International Organized Crime, Drugs and Corruption Ana 
Cazzadore on September 21. Also present were assistant to the 
Foreign Minister Magali Garcia, North American Office 
Director Rebeca Guevara, and USA Desk Officer Reynaldo 
Pulido. Cazzadore and Guevara insisted that the TIP report 
had not accurately assessed Venezuela\'s anti-trafficking 
initiatives under its treaty obligations with the United 
Nations. PolOff told the MFA officers that failure to 
cooperate with the TIP reporting system is taken as evidence 
of a problem, and that the Embassy had made efforts to obtain 
information from various GOV agencies, but had been 
unsuccessful. Guevara said the GOV does not give information 
to foreign governments, it only gives it to the United 
Nations, with whom it has assumed a treaty responsibility. 
 
3.  (C) PolOff pointed to our demarche delivered on June 14 
which indicated the steps that needed to be taken to avoid 
sanctions. Cazzadore told PolOff that she chairs a 
semi-weekly meeting of 22 representatives from different GOV 
agencies on trafficking. She said there were serious problems 
implementing anti-trafficking initiatives in Venezuela 
because there was no law against it, and the Attorney 
General\'s office would not pursue it judicially. She said a 
law was being drafted. PolOff told Cazzadore that the Embassy 
was willing to work with the MFA to identify anti-trafficking 
initiatives, to ensure that next year\'s report was as 
accurate as possible. 
 
4.  (C) Guevara asked exactly what programs would be effected 
by the sanctions, and for clarification on whether the USG 
would oppose international loans. She noted that the reftel 
talking points clarified this question. Guevara insisted that 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 
2003 authorized the State Department to send an amended 
report at any time to Congress. She asked whether the Embassy 
would consider this, given her contention that the 2003 
report was in error due to our not getting the correct 
information. 
 
5.  (C) Guevara pushed for a promise to consider 
re-classifying Venezuela this year, in return for information 
from the MFA from 2003 in a subsequent conversation on 
September 22. She would not commit to cooperation next year, 
however, insisting that the GOV does not provide information 
formally to other governments, only to the United Nations. 
Informal cooperation would depend on a higher level decision, 
she said, which would depend on our response to the question 
of re-classification. (Note: In a separate exchange with the 
Ministry of Labor regarding information for the human rights 
report, the GOV also told us to look to the United Nations 
for information.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) The existence of an anti-trafficking task force at 
the MFA had not been mentioned in any previous meeting on the 
subject of trafficking in persons. If it indeed functions, it 
could serve as a clearinghouse of information on trafficking 
 
for us in the future. The suggested quid pro quo -- making 
information available if we agree to take Venezuela off the 
list -- strikes us as unacceptable, but possibly the GOV 
will come up with a better offer. For the moment, it appears 
that the GOV is carrying out a two-pronged strategy: public 
assertions that it is cooperating with a higher authority, 
the United Nations, and not responding to Washington; and 
indications by Venezuelan law enforcement that it is 
responding to TIPs issues (septel).

Summary

1.  (C)  A 10 September newswire reporting Venezuela\'s 
alleged interest in procuring Russian jet fighters has 
renewed media speculation that the two countries may be close 
to an arms deal.  Chavez has already purchased Russian 
helicopters, according to DAO and press reports.  Although he 
is seeking to reduce the military\'s dependency on US-based 
weapons systems, Chavez is unlikely to conclude the fighter 
contract in the near term, and we should not take steps that 
encourage him to do so.  End summary. 
 
------------------ 
Rumors and Offers 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) On 10 September, a UPI newswire detailing Venezuela\'s 
plans to acquire MiG-29 fighters prompted additional press 
rumors over the status of a possible deal between Venezuela 
and Russia that has resurfaced every several months since 
late 2001.  The press reports cite US, European, and Latin 
American military intelligence officials.  In sharp contrast 
to Russia\'s 2001 proposal, which outlines a nearly USD two 
billion offer, the reports describe the contract as worth USD 
five billion.  Details about the materiel and support Russia 
is to provide, however, are roughly consistent with the 2001 
offer.  Both reports mention the purchase of 40 one-seat MiG 
29s, 10 two-seat MiG 29s, and training and maintenance for 
the planes. 
 
3.  (C) Press reports also cite a contract to buy MI-17 
helicopters from Russia and radar systems from China.  On 22 
September, Chavez confirmed he had bought Russian helicopters 
to help patrol the Colombian border after a 17 September 
ambush claimed the lives of five Venezuelan soldiers 
(SEPTEL).  DAO reporting (REFTEL) suggests this deal may 
include a package of MI-17, MI-35, and MI-26 helicopters for 
USD 190-450 million.  According to MILGROUP, the negotiations 
for Chinese radar have collapsed. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  (C) Although Venezuela\'s signed contracts sometimes fall 
apart, the GOV appears to have purchased Russian helicopters. 
 Any deal on MiGs, however, will probably take longer to ink. 
 Acquiring Russian fighters would involve a shift in 
technology, maintenance, and training for which the FAV is 
unprepared.  Moreover, buying MiGs would also alienate 
Chavez\'s US-trained F-16 squadron and give his opposition 
fodder to condemn government waste.  The GOV, which has 
counter-offered in the past with ill-defined joint ventures 
and barter deals for Venezuelan aluminum and petroleum, will 
remain reluctant to pay the up-front cash required by Moscow. 
 Even spread out over several years, a USD 2-5 billion 
purchase would put a severe dent in Venezuela\'s budget. 
 
5.  (C) The logistical and practical details notwithstanding, 
Chavez is seeking a way to free Venezuela from reliance on US 
training and parts.  He may view buying a new fleet of 
fighters from Russia as an easy solution to his decaying F-16 
squadron.  According to MILGROUP, only six of the 21 
remaining F-16s in the Venezuelan fleet are fully mission 
capable, while a proposed US overhaul of the F-16 squadron 
remains on hold. 
 
6.  (C) For our part, we should avoid tilting the balance in 
favor of a MiG deal by default.  The symbolism of purchasing 
from a US strategic adversary cannot be overemphasized.  By 
buying Russian or Chinese systems, Chavez aims to distance 
Venezuela not only from \"imperialist\" weaponry, but also from 
the US military in general.  If this is to be the case, then 
we should ensure that it is the result of a decision clearly 
attributable to Chavez and the GOV, not us.

September 17 near the Colombian border in an apparent ambush

additional military units to the region and visited the area 
on September 22.  The GOV has exploited the incident to 
criticize the US and Colombia for \"warlike policies,\" to 
rationalize a planned acquisition of Russian helicopters, and 
even to explain Chavez\'s absence at the UN General Assembly. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (C) An ambush of a PDVSA exploration group by 
unidentified combatants killed six, including a petroleum 
engineer and five military escorts, and wounded two on 
September 17 in Apure State near the Colombian border. 
According to press reports, such attacks have claimed the 
lives of 51 troops since July 1983.  Promising an 
\"overwhelming\" response to the attackers, President Hugo 
Chavez scrambled troops, helicopters, and fighter jets after 
the incident, according to press and local police.  MILGROUP 
confirmed that a Venezuelan Mirage jet that the press 
reported had crashed on 17 September was returning from the 
region; the pilot survived by ejecting. 
 
3.  (U) Since the attacks, eight more corpses with wounds 
suggesting their recent execution have been found.  The press 
has speculated that six of these victims were members of the 
group responsible for the ambush. 
 
------------------- 
The Blame Game 
------------------ 
 
4.  (U) The Colombian Government quickly cited \"reliable 
intelligence\" implicating the FARC in the attacks, and 
Colombian Vice President Santos charged that more kidnappings 
occur on Venezuela\'s side of the border than on Colombia\'s. 
(Comment:  Santos\'s comments may not be far off the mark, 
according to a University de los Andes professor, who cited 
weekly death tolls and kidnapping notices in the local press. 
 End comment.) 
 
5.  (U) GOV spokespersons initially mentioned the possible 
involvement of the Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL), a 
leftwing Venezuelan armed group loyal to Chavez.  The FBL 
quickly denied any link to the incident with a full-page 
advertisement in the pro-government tabloid \"Diario Vea.\" 
The Apure State police commissioner confirmed that the FBL 
had been clashing with Colombian ELN guerrillas in the area 
for several months.  The national investigative police 
(CICPC) on September 21 accused the FARC 10th front, but the 
CICPC chief in Tachira state claimed the following day that 
the press had misquoted him and that CICPC investigations 
remained inconclusive. 
 
6.  (U) Chavez did not discount the thesis of FARC 
involvement during his September 19 Alo Presidente program 
and warned Colombian guerrillas they would become his enemies 
if they violated Venezuelan sovereignty.  Alluding to the 
FBL, he rejected the support of Venezuelan armed groups and 
urged them to disarm and meet with him at Miraflores. 
 
7.  (C) On a September 22 visit to the border region, Chavez 
bristled at Bogota\'s \"suspicious\" quickness to blame the 
FARC.  He charged Colombia to assume its responsibility for 
the incident and mused that the attackers probably had 
returned to Colombian territory.   In an apparent reference 
to Plan Colombia, Chavez faulted the United States\' \"policy 
of war\" for the region\'s instability.  He also harped on the 
importance of officers maintaining high morale among their 
subordinates and promised greater logistical support as the 
media speculated about the troops\' discontent. 
 
8.  (C) Not baited by Chavez\'s invective, Colombian President 
Uribe the following day publicly expressed confidence that 
Venezuela would work with Colombia to overcome the border 
problem, according to press reports.  Colombian and 
 
Venezuelan foreign affairs ministers, meanwhile, agreed in 
New York to look for new ways to avoid border violence. 
 
      9.  (U) Chavez took advantage of the incident to 
announce he had bought Russian helicopters to protect the 
border from such attacks (SEPTEL).  MVR Deputy Nicolas 
Maduro, hatching an international conspiracy theory, used the 
attack to explain the cancellation of Chavez\'s September 
20-22 trip to the UN General Assembly in New York. 
 
--------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) After years of allowing guerrillas to operate with 
impunity, Chavez has been forced to focus on the subject only 
in part by the media storm surrounding the Apure killings. 
Blaming Colombia and the US, a hollow effort, momentarily 
masks the true reasons for Chavez\'s direct involvement in the 
matter.  We suspect, but do not have solid evidence, that the 
incident has shaken the military, and Chavez wants to take no 
chances in letting things get out of control.  In effect, 
Chavez has had to face up to the question of whether his FARC 
policy has now cost the lives of Venezuelan soldiers.  This 
is the second incident in less than a year (the first being 
the burn deaths at Fuerte Mara) where Chavez has intervened 
quickly and personally to calm the military.  The 
government\'s willingness even to entertain the possibility of 
left-wing guerrilla culpability marks a slight shift in the 
party line.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s National Assembly (AN) reportedly plans to 
tackle four controversial bills in its new session that 
started September 17.  The Assembly\'s pro-Chavez majority 
will push to pass controversial laws on the media, a national 
police force, reform of the penal code, and the organization 
of municipal governments.  Selecting Supreme Court justices 
is likely to come later in the term.  The opposition will 
continue to resist the legislation, though the 86-79 split in 
favor of the GOV and the Assembly\'s internal rules make it 
likely that pro-Chavez legislators will make progress on some 
of the bills.  A trial balloon for 21 constitutional 
amendments, which included the possibility of indefinite 
re-election for President Hugo Chavez appears to have 
withered, but may yet be resurrected.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
New National Assembly Kicks Off 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Venezuela\'s National Assembly convened a new session 
on September 17.  Construyendo Pais deputy Leopoldo Martinez 
told PolCouns September 24 that the pro-GOV majority still 
has not agreed on its agenda although the legislators have 
met in three plenary sessions already.  Many pro-Chavez 
deputies, he said, are preoccupied with local wrangling over 
regional candidacies.  Martinez also noted that National 
Assembly president Francisco Ameliach is otherwise busy with 
his duties as the Fifth Republic Movement\'s Secretary 
General. 
 
3.  (C) Despite not having formulated a precise agenda, many 
deputies believe some of the most controversial bills will 
get priority attention.  Pro-GOV Deputy Hector Vargas 
(Podemos) told poloff September 22 the GOV\'s win in the 
recall referendum has given it momentum to press forward on 
contentious issues.  Causa R deputy Andres Velasquez told 
poloff September 21 the GOV majority will push four bills: 
 
-- The Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, 
which would, among other things, impose penalties on private 
media for offenses against public officials; 
 
-- The Organic Law of the National Police Corps, which would 
subordinate all state and municipal police forces to the 
national government; 
 
-- The Organic Law of the Municipal Public Power, which would 
redefine the autonomy of mayors; and 
 
-- The Law of Reform of the Penal Code Law, which reportedly 
would penalize certain protests against government officials 
and place limits on public protests. 
 
4. (C) The AN\'s coordinating committee met on September 21 to 
set the session\'s agenda, but did not reach agreement. 
Speaking to reporters, Ameliach noted the importance of the 
Social Responsibility in Radio and Television Law, and 
mentioned the need to pass bills on housing and workers\' 
severance benefits.  Martinez said Ameliach told him that 
they would schedule discussion of the media law an article at 
a time, focusing on areas where there was agreement. 
(Martinez, recalling the strong opposition to the media law, 
said Ameliach had no answer when he was asked which those 
might be.) National Assembly Vice President Ricardo Gutierrez 
(Podemos) said many of the priority bills will require action 
in committee before the plenary can consider them.  Gutierrez 
noted progress in getting the Penal Code Reform Law reported 
out of the Internal Policy Committee. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
New Supreme Court Judges Still Pending 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) After the passage of the Supreme Court (TSJ) law in 
May (ref), the National Assembly must now select the 12 new 
 
judges created by the law.  Vargas told poloff the GOV is in 
no hurry to name the judges and will likely wait until after 
the October 31 regional elections.  (Note:  National 
Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco Carrasquero, who 
will oversee the regional elections, is a candidate for one 
of the new seats on the bench.)  Ameliach asserted that 
naming the judges is a priority for the Assembly.  Martinez 
told Polcouns September 24 that fellow legislator Pedro 
Carreno (MVR) had polled other deputies to measure 
willingness to participate in the process of the naming of 
the judges.  Martinez said he and (unspecified) others had 
rejected the overture. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
21 Constitutional Amendments:  No One Salutes 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) MVR Deputy Luis Velasquez Alvaray floated a proposal 
for 21 constitutional amendments on the first day of session, 
apparently responding to President Hugo Chavez\'s call on 
August 23 for fine-tuning of the 1999 Bolivarian 
Constitution.  Among other things, Velasquez proposed to 
eliminate the prohibition against the president running for 
re-election more than once, arguing that only \"the people\" 
are sovereign to decide whether a leader may stand again for 
election.  Velasquez also proposed raising the threshold for 
signatures needed to initiate recall referenda, from 20 to 30 
percent of the electoral registry. 
 
7. (C) Reaction to the proposal was universally negative. 
The opposition claimed it was evidence that Chavez wanted to 
impose an electorally-based dictatorship.  Pro-GOV deputies 
reacted just as harshly, publicly characterizing the proposal 
as unauthorized.  MVR Deputy Luis Tascon told poloff 
September 21 the proposal was an attempt to curry favor with 
Chavez, but instead had a destabilizing effect.  Vargas told 
poloff if he were in the opposition, he would call for the 
deputy\'s resignation, noting that Velasquez is also a 
candidate for a TSJ seat but had showed his bias on a 
critical constitutional issue.  Chavez himself denounced the 
proposal on September 19, claiming he had not been consulted 
and has no plans to perpetuate himself in office.  Velasquez 
withdrew the amendments, which he admitted were \"politically 
inopportune,\" but asserted he had received assurances from 
Ameliach the Assembly would deal with constitutional 
amendments in 2005. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The National Assembly will probably continue to be 
complicated as it has been over the past year, principally 
due to polarization between the pro-GOV majority and the 
opposition.  The last important piece of legislation passed, 
the TSJ Law, required a change to internal rules -- six in 
four years -- and absurd legislative smithing before it could 
be approved.  If Chavez insists on passage of one of the 
contentious bills, as he did with the TSJ law, the Chavistas 
may again resort to parliamentary ramrod tactics.  They will, 
however, continue to be plagued by their own inefficiencies 
and perhaps even dissent in the case of the media law.  As 
such, the pro-Chavez legislators may make some progress in 
approving the bills, but easy approval will elude them. 
Velasquez Alvaray\'s constitutional amendments could have been 
a rogue operation (or secretly endorsed by Chavez), but the 
Chavistas\' complaints dealt more with timing rather than 
substance.  It could foreshadow an attempt next year, after 
National Assembly elections in which the GOV is hoping to 
gain more seats, to amend the constitution to give Chavez the 
chance of another term beyond 2013.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Venezuela\'s National Electoral Council (CNE) found the 
Coordinadora Democratica\'s challenge of the results of the 
August 15 recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez 
inadmissible on September 23 and said the matter should be 
taken to the Supreme Court instead.  CNE Director Jorge 
Rodriguez nonetheless then attempted to refute the 
opposition\'s case, point by point, in a national broadcast on 
September 24.  Rodriguez accused the opposition of trying to 
discredit the CNE and warned that from now on accusers who 
cannot present proof of CNE wrongdoing could face reprisal in 
court.  On September 27, pro-opposition CNE Vice President 
Ezequiel Zamora resigned, citing differences of opinion with 
the pro-Chavez majority on the board and noting especially 
his disagreement with the handling of the recall referendum. 
GOV supporters charged that Zamora\'s resignation is part of 
an opposition plot to delay the October 31 regional 
elections.  Legal experts expect the Supreme Court to name a 
replacement for Zamora, though for the time being the CNE can 
continue to function with the four remaining members.  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Rodriguez Lashes Out 
-------------------- 
 
2. (U)  Venezuela\'s National Electoral Council (CNE) on 
September 23 found inadmissible the Coordinadora 
Democratica\'s administrative appeal to the results of the 
August 15 presidential recall referendum.  The Coordinadora 
had challenged the results citing irregularities in the 
electoral registry and fraud on election day (ref).  Despite 
refusing to admit the complaint, CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez 
presented arguments against the Coordinadora\'s claims on 
September 24 in a national broadcast carried obligatorily on 
every television and radio station (\"cadena\").  The electoral 
registry used for the recall was legal, Rodriguez asserted, 
and claimed that the time to object to it was 30 days prior 
to election day.  Rodriguez also repudiated the opposition\'s 
claims of GOV tampering with electoral software and data 
transmission, claiming that Coordinadora representatives were 
allowed to audit the voting machines beforehand.  Rodriguez 
argued that the statistical analysis presented by the NGO 
Sumate used only exit polls that agreed with their premise 
and not polls performed by other pollsters. 
 
3. (U) Rodriguez said that the CNE had adequately addressed 
the opposition\'s assertions.  Rodriguez warned that from now 
on anyone who makes allegations of impropriety against the 
CNE not supported by solid evidence would be taken to 
\"national or international\" court, if necessary.  Rodriguez 
specifically mentioned Sumate representative Maria Corina 
Machado, the Coordindaora\'s fraud report author Tulio 
Alvarez, and professors Ricardo Hausmann and Roberto Rigobon, 
who performed the statistical analysis used by Sumate. 
Rodrgiuez\'s broadcast used splashy production techniques and 
tight close-ups during dramatic moments.  His presentation of 
the opposition\'s allegations tended to be incomplete.  He 
also referred at times to absurd rumors that were not alleged 
in the Coordinadora\'s report, such as the use of Cuban 
satellites to intercept electoral data transmissions. 
 
------------------- 
Alvarez Fights Back 
------------------- 
 
4. (U) Tulio Alvarez, who led the team of 44 people who 
compiled the Coordinadora\'s appeal, told reporters on 
September 25 that Rodriguez had not refuted any of the 
opposition\'s charges.  Alvarez said Rodriguez\'s broadcast, in 
fact, confirmed two allegations:  that some areas of 
Venezuela have more registered voters than inhabitants and 
that the voting machines are bi-directional.  Alvarez said 
the CNE board had not followed proper procedures by rejecting 
the Coordinadora\'s appeal out-of-hand without formally 
opening an investigation.  Alvarez asserted this proved that 
 
the CNE is subordinated to President Hugo Chavez.  He called 
on the two pro-opposition directors of the CNE, Ezequiel 
Zamora and Sobella Mejias, to resign.  Alvarez said he plans 
to issue a final report of the Coordinadora\'s allegations on 
October 15. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Pro-Opposition CNE Vice President Zamora Resigns 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (U) On September 27, pro-opposition CNE Vice President 
Ezequiel Zamora presented his resignation to Supreme Court 
(TSJ) President Ivan Rincon.  Zamora based his resignation on 
the CNE\'s failure to carry out a transparent and efficient 
electoral process on August 15.  He said the process was 
marred by excessive waits in line and inadequate auditing 
practices.  Zamora also decried the systematic replacement of 
CNE technicians with political sympathizers of the 
government, saying it had led to a loss of the CNE\'s 
institutional integrity.  Zamora noted growing differences of 
opinion between him and the three pro-Chavez directors, who 
he said had become inflexible.  Zamora said he had not 
resigned immediately after the referendum because he had no 
proof of fraud.  He said he also believed he could convince 
the CNE board to revise the voting process for the October 31 
regional elections, but he now discounts that possibility. 
Separately, pro-opposition CNE Director Sobella Mejias 
announced she would not resign so as not to \"surrender space\" 
to the GOV. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Chavez Supporter Charge Conspiracy 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) William Lara, a National Assembly Deputy and leader of 
Chavez\'s Fifth Republic Movement (MVR), called Zamora\'s 
resignation part of an opposition plot to discredit the CNE 
and delay the regional elections, which, Lara added, the 
opposition is sure to lose.  National Assembly Vice President 
Ricardo Gutierrez (of the pro-Chavez Podemos party) defended 
the CNE majority, which he said had acted democratically and 
with moral authority.  Minister of Interior and Justice Jesse 
Chacon said Zamora\'s leaving was expected and quipped that 
Zamora would probably end up as campaign manager of 
Coordinadora leader Enrique Mendoza, who is running for 
re-election as governor of Miranda State.  CNE President 
Francisco Carrasquero told reporters on September 28 that if 
there were irregularities in the CNE, then Zamora was party 
to them as he signed on to 90 percent, he claimed, of the 
CNE\'s decisions. 
 
--------- 
Moving On 
--------- 
 
7. (U) According to the constitution, the CNE should have 
been named by the National Assembly, but the latter 
deadlocked on the issue in 2003.  As a result, the TSJ\'s 
constitutional chamber found the Assembly \"in omission\" and 
proceeded to name the members.  CNE legal advisor Andres 
Brito recommended to the board that Zamora\'s replacement also 
be named by the constitutional chamber rather than submit the 
question to the National Assembly, according to press 
reports.  The law provides for the temporary incorporation of 
one of Zamora\'s two alternates while awaiting TSJ action, but 
pro-Chavez politicians have already scuttled the idea. 
Zamora\'s two alternates, Miriam Kornblith and Carolina 
Jaimes, are outspoken critics of the CNE\'s pro-GOV majority. 
An effort to incorporate Kornblith several months ago when 
Zamora became ill was similarly rejected. 
 
8. (U) The CNE board minus Zamora proceeded on September 28 
to approve the rules for tallying the results of the regional 
elections (Mejias abstained).  The rules reportedly maintain 
the same procedure as that used in the recall referendum, 
most notably, the transmission of voting machine results to 
the CNE before the machines print the tally sheets.  This was 
perhaps the most criticized feature of the recall referendum 
voting procedure, as the opposition alleges the voting 
machines may be re-programmed by the CNE server during the 
data transmission and thereby produce altered tally sheets. 
The CNE also agreed to not/not count the paper receipts, as 
the opposition has demanded. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Zamora\'s departure will not have much impact on the 
CNE -- which needs only three directors for a quorum -- or on 
the political scene.  Zamora was the CNE\'s most experienced 
director though it is debatable whether he had any influence 
on the Chavista-dominated CNE.  The TSJ\'s selection to 
replace Zamora will probably tilt the CNE even further toward 
the government.  The CNE\'s summary dismissal of the 
Coordinadora\'s appeal, finished off by an obstinate Rodriguez 
on television, was probably designed to irritate opposition 
groups and distract them from the regional elections.  The 
three pro-Chavez CNE directors seem determined to press in 
spite of Zamora\'s departure, as demonstrated by its approval 
of controversial rules for the regional elections.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelan opposition party Primero Justicia withdrew 
from the Coordinadora Democratica September 24.  Lines of 
cooperation among groups opposed to President Hugo Chavez 
have been reduced to documenting fraud claims related to the 
referendum, negotiating with the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) for the October 31 elections for governors and mayors, 
and selecting unified candidates to face pro-Chavez 
candidates in those elections.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Primero Justicia Separates from the Coordinadora 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) Leaders of the opposition political party Primero 
Justicia (PJ) announced September 24 the party had withdrawn 
from the Coordinadora Democratica.  PJ leader Julio Borges 
told reporters the Coordinadora had done a respectable job in 
reaching the recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez. 
 He said it is now time for PJ to leave the opposition 
alliance and build a political party that offers a viable 
alternative to Venezuelans.  The 34-year-old Borges said PJ 
hopes to facilitate a \"generational change\" in political 
leadership in Venezuela. 
 
3. (C) PJ Secretary General Jose Luis Mejias told poloff 
September 29 PJ\'s post-referendum strategy is to go into the 
poor neighborhoods and make inroads into Chavez\'s support 
base.  In an effort to dispel PJ\'s image as a right-wing 
party of young rich urbanites, Mejias said PJ would open the 
party to other sectors of Venezuelan society.  He 
specifically mentioned the possibility that Causa R, led by 
former presidential hopeful and labor activist Andres 
Velasquez, might join with PJ.  (Velasquez and Alianza Bravo 
Pueblo\'s Antonio Ledezma separated from the Coordinadora just 
days before (ref a).)  Mejias said PJ is not focused on the 
October 31 elections for governors and mayors as PJ has only 
a handful of likely winners.  He said PJ is instead more 
focused on the 2005 National Assembly elections and on 
fielding a candidate to challenge President Chavez in 2006. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Death Rites For the Coordinadora 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Mejias described PJ\'s departure from the Coordinadora 
as a political necessity.  He said the Coordinadora was 
\"practically dead\" and no longer served PJ\'s interests.  He 
added that Accion Democratica and Proyecto Venezuela had also 
quit the Coordinadora though without fanfare.  Mejias said 
only three areas of cooperation currently among opposition 
groups remain.  First, the secretaries general of opposition 
parties continue to meet regularly to work out single 
opposition candidacies to face pro-Chavez candidates in the 
regional elections.  Mejias was pessimistic on this point, 
however, saying there is no political will to consolidate 
candidacies.  Second, opposition governors and mayors 
continue their common negotiation with the National Electoral 
Council (CNE) to secure acceptable conditions for the 
regional elections.  Third, a diverse team of experts, 
including PJ representatives, will continue to work with 
Tulio Alvarez to pursue fraud charges related to the recall 
referendum (ref b).  Mejias added that the Coordinadora\'s 
political committee, composed of parties and NGOs, has ceased 
to hold meetings. 
 
5. (C) In a lunch with Coordinadora representatives Juan 
Fernandez (Gente de Petroleo), Daniel Thiman (an aide to 
Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza), and Amado Dounia (an 
electoral expert with the COPEI party), Fernandez expressed 
great disappointment in the Coordinadora.  He said the 
Coordinadora had become \"nothing\" and lamented that many 
groups had forsaken opposition unity to serve their own 
interests.  Fernandez said he was not in agreement with 
Mendoza\'s decision to hand control of the Coordinadora over 
 
to Pompeyo Marquez, whom he described as \"an old man\" who 
lacks vision.  Thiman criticized the MAS party and its 
associated NGOs as \"a bunch of leftists\" who practically 
joined the government by giving in after the referendum. 
 
6. (C) Fernandez, who has been attending assemblies 
throughout Venezuela of his organization\'s membership, said 
he saw little cooperation among opposition groups in the 
country\'s interior and predicted they would lose 
overwhelmingly in the regional elections.  He asserted that 
Chavez is already trying to build a \"Chavista-lite\" 
opposition, financed indirectly by the GOV, to contend with 
Chavez\'s traditional opponents and play the part of a loyal 
opposition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The passing of the referendum eliminated the cohesive 
force that maintained unity with the Coordinadora.  Parties 
with a wisp of political future are protecting their 
interests by participating in the elections while others 
(mostly opposition NGOs) are attributing to themselves the 
moral high ground and withdrawing, for now, from the scene. 
The result for the time being is the re-fragmentation of the 
opposition.  Primero Justicia is the first major party to 
leave the Coordinadora.  PJ has always fancied itself as a 
\"party of the future\" and so it is not surprising it would 
not linger around the political corpse of the Coordinadora. 
The party faces a challenge, however, to shed its yuppie 
image and cast itself as an organization with popular roots.

accounting for foreign exchange profits.  While the BCV has 
resisted this demand, it may be caving in another area.  It 
recently changed its retirement policy, allowing employees to 
receive pensions with fewer years of service.  Combined with 
allegations - confirmed by a BCV employee - that some 
employees have already been notified of their \"voluntary\" 
retirements, this has fueled rumors that the GOV plans to 
gain control of key BCV management positions.  Also, despite 
record high Venezuelan oil prices, the international reserves 
held by the BCV have not been increasing, leading to 
speculation that the GOV is either withholding oil income, or 
lying about how much it is.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY - FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (U) The Venezuelan Central Bank recently turned over to 
the GOV 1.5 trillion bolivars (USD 780 million) in foreign 
exchange earnings for the first half of 2004.  However, Trino 
Alcides Diaz, the Banking Superintendent (who reports to 
Finance Minister Nobrega), criticized the BCV\'s accounting. 
He initially estimated that it owed an additional one 
trillion bolivars, but soon increased that to 2.5 trillion 
(USD 1.3 billion).  Several private economists said this 
would increase inflation - one called it \"hyper-inflationary\" 
- and also stated that the bolivar would be weakened, since 
this would cause an enormous increase in the money supply 
without a backing in the international reserves, issues which 
Diaz did not address.  The Superintendency may also attempt 
to apply the same method to older transactions, which could 
create an additional amount as high as 5 trillion bolivars 
owed for the period from 1989 to 1999. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
NEW RETIREMENT PLAN - AKA HOSTILE TAKEOVER? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) On September 15, BCV Director Domingo Maza Zavala 
announced a new Central Bank retirement plan, which would 
allow some employees receive pensions with fewer years of 
service.  Rumors immediately spread that certain employees, 
particularly managers in the divisions of national and 
international operations, as well as statistics, would be 
forced to retire.  These are areas which are generally 
considered to have asserted their independence by publishing 
information that goes against GOV desires, and retirement 
would make it easier to pack management with government 
sympathizers.  Rodrigo Cabezas, National Assembly Finance 
Committee chairman (of the pro-GOV MVR party), stated that 
the BCV directorate had denied these rumors, which circulated 
as soon as the plan was put into effect. 
 
4. (C) However, BCV researcher Reinier Schliesser told 
econoff on September 30 that the forced retirements were, in 
fact, real.  He noted that letters notifying employees of 
their retirement seemed to originate with the Human Resources 
Director, who has only been at the BCV a few months. 
Schliesser also asserted the employees now eligible to retire 
were placed into three different lists: those to dismiss 
soon, those to dismiss eventually, and those to definitely 
keep.  The first phase had begun, and dismissed employees 
would receive their notification letter at noon, plus a box 
for their belongings.  A guard would return at 4:00 to 
inspect the box and escort the employee out of the building. 
Schliesser stated that the reason the forced retirements were 
being done gradually was to avoid the disruption created in 
PDVSA by the mass firings there. 
 
------------------------------------ 
WHERE HAVE ALL THE OIL PROFITS GONE? 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Venezuelan reserves on September 23 totaled USD 21.59 
billion, which included USD 706 million in the Macroeconomic 
Stabilization Fund (FEM).  Accounting for a USD 2.5 billion 
debt buyback by PDVSA on August 2, this is essentially the 
same level of reserves as on April 23 (USD 24.09 billion). 
Credit Suisse First Boston estimates that the GOV receives an 
average of USD 80 million per day from oil revenues. 
However, it estimates that only about USD 45 million is being 
sold per day via officially approved exchange transactions. 
Since this is the primary outlet for foreign reserves, it 
appears that total income is somewhat less than expected. 
This could mean that either PDVSA is diverting funds again, 
either by keeping them in accounts offshore or in the fund 
established earlier this year for \"development\" and 
administered by PDVSA (reftel B), or that oil production has 
taken a sudden drop. 
 
6. (C) Oil sector sources have yet to perceive such a drop in 
production, so the diversion of funds is the likely 
explanation.  Banco Mercantil economist Luis Zambrano 
believes that the GOV has determined that the ideal amount of 
reserves is between USD 21 and 22 billion, and will simply 
divert PDVSA income into offshore accounts to prevent the 
reserves from increasing beyond that.  He also believes that 
PDVSA has, this year, diverted at least USD 3.5 billion into 
such funds.  (Note: That this amount is higher than the 
announced USD 2 billion ceiling on the social fund is 
plausible, as President Chavez and PDVSA chairman Ali 
Rodriguez have both declared that the PDVSA social fund was 
rotating in nature; that is, when money is spent, more money 
can be diverted into the fund, making it an unlimited source 
of extra-budgetary spending.  Maza Zavala disagreed with that 
interpretation.)  Zambrano speculated the GOV is using this 
money to make foreign purchases (such as food for the MERCAL 
program), or loaning the funds (through BANDES, the GOV-owned 
Development Bank) to importers. 
 
------------------ 
INDIRECT PRESSURES 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) Efrain Velazquez, President of the National Economic 
Council (a private sector group created in 1946 to advise the 
President on economic issues, but which has not formally met 
with the current administration in over 18 months), told 
econoff on September 27 that the GOV\'s plan was to \"get rid 
of the people with rational ideas\" in the BCV.  He noted that 
Minister of Finance Tobias Nobrega had been critical in an 
interview televised August 28, saying that the institution 
\"has been something of a straggler in their way of 
determining problems.\"  Nobrega added that BCV employees, 
when considering their job, think that \"my responsibilities 
are these, so I won\'t get myself involved in working on other 
subjects.\"  Velazquez added that BCV employees he has spoken 
with have said that they haven\'t felt free to talk openly 
over the phones at work in two to three years; Schliesser 
concurred. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) The forced retirements and the pressure for extra 
profits are an assault on the autonomy of the BCV as an 
institution.  It appears the reason is a desire for more 
money, with no regard to negative consequences, such as 
inflation which may eventually come to pass, but also to 
control statistical information emanating from the Bank.  The 
term of current BCV President Diego Castellanos, as well as 
those of several other Directors, is up in early 2005.  The 
short list of candidates to replace Castellanos, according to 
Schliesser, are Finance Minister Nobrega (Schliesser termed 
the position Nobrega\'s \"dream job\"), Guillermo Ortega (a 
little known advisor to Nobrega), Banking Superintendent 
Trino Alcides Diaz, PDVSA Vice President Jose Rojas, and 
FOGADE (Deposit Guarantee Fund, FDIC equivalent) President 
Jesus Caldera Infante.  For now, the GOV\'s need for funds is 
not that pressing, given strong oil prices and the openness 
 
of international markets to Venezuelan borrowing.  However, 
should need for an easier monetary policy (not to mention 
some statistical massaging) arise in the future, the GOV may 
have sufficient control of the BCV to effect it.

1.  (U) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, presented copies of 
his credentials to Foreign Minister Perez late afternoon Oct. 
1.  Perez was accompanied by Chief of Staff Jesus Avancini 
and a MFA notetaker Pulido.  Ambassador was the last of 
several ambassadors who presented credentials to the FM that 
afternoon.  Perez had returned from the U.S. (UN and OAS) the 
day before. 
 
2.  (C) After 15 minutes of pleasantries (Texas, Barinas, 
Venezuelan rodeo), Ambassador worked through reftel (notal) 
talking points, emphasizing: 
 
-     USG would not back off our fundamental principles, but 
we could adjust the tone and volume of our dialogue if they 
did as well; 
-     We had a list of issues requiring attention; we assumed 
they had their own list; 
-     We were not going to solve bilateral issues by starting 
at the top; senior government meetings would come at the end, 
not the beginning; 
-     If we were going to make progress, we needed channels 
of communication, particularly at working levels; we would 
continue to reach out to GOV to try to address bilateral 
issues. 
 
Following two cell phone interruptions from the President, 
Perez said he agreed with the step by step approach.  He 
wanted an improved bilateral relationship. 
 
3.  (U) Following meeting, FM and Ambassador met with the 
press outside his office.  Ambassador noted he had presented 
credentials, and discussed how 190 years of bilateral 
relations gave us a good starting point to address issues of 
democracy, prosperity, and security.  Press asked Ambassador 
whether USG was willing to improve relations with the GOV. 
Ambassador said we were willing to explore improved relations 
on both bilateral and regional issues.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuela\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) chairs a 
22-person interdepartmental working group that meets 
approximately once a month to coordinate efforts to combat 
trafficking in persons.  Representatives from the MFA and the 
Ministry of Interior and Justice (MIJ) told Poloff on 
September 27, 28 and 30, that specific action plans for 
individual Ministries have been identified, and they will 
begin implementation in late October. The national 
investigative police (CICPC) is currently working on 2 
international human trafficking case involving 7 women.  The 
GOV appears more energized on TIP, and we will continue to 
engage them on this issue.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Meetings and Plans 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) National investigative police (CICPC) Interpol 
division commissioner Henry Matos told Poloff September 27 
that he and other Ministry of Interior and Justice (MIJ) 
personnel were part of a working group chaired by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Matos said the MFA has 
provided courses in spreading awareness, prevention, and 
coordination (interagency and international) to 
representatives of 15 different Ministries or agencies. 
Matos provided Poloff with a sample of an awareness and 
prevention pamphlet the GOV intends to print and distribute 
as part of its awareness campaign.  He also provided a 
four-page plan produced by the MFA as a result of what Matos 
said were monthly meetings.  According to the plan, the MIJ\'s 
Directorate General of Crime Prevention would act as a 
clearinghouse for human trafficking cooperation. 
 
3. (C) Mirna Lopez, MIJ Assistant Director of Crime 
Prevention, told Poloff on September 28 that the MIJ planned 
to launch pilot training programs for law enforcement, 
government officials, and civil society at the end of 
October. The pilot programs would include awareness, 
prevention and coordination training.  If the pilots are 
successful, Lopez said the MIJ would expand the program to 
regularly scheduled training sessions by the first quarter of 
2005. 
 
4. (C) On September 30, MFA Director for International 
Organized Crime, Drugs, and Corruption, Ana Cassadore, 
confirmed that the pamphlet provided by Matos was to be 
printed and distributed to all consulates by the end of 
October.  Cassadore said the Ministry of Education would also 
be distributing the pamphlets within Venezuela.  Asked about 
statistics to determine the extent of the problem in 
Venezuela, Cassadore said the National Statistics Institute 
was \"just now\" being invited to take part in the working 
group.  Cassadore and Otilia Kaufman from the Crime 
Prevention Unit of the MIJ noted that the draft Law Against 
Organized Crime makes trafficking in persons punishable by 
8-10 years in prison, and has provisions for additional time 
if the victim is a child or if trafficking was done for 
sexual exploitation.  However, the law has languished in the 
National Assembly since 2001.  Cassadore asserted that the 
MFA twice in 2004 requested action on the proposed law, but 
could do no more.  Lopez, Kaufman, and Cassadore all asserted 
that the lack of legislation would not prevent the 
Ministries\' implementation of the current action plans. 
 
5. (C) As in meeting with human rights officer September 21 
(reftel), Cassadore reiterated the GOV\'s interest in being 
removed from Tier 3 early.  She asked that the Embassy send 
an amended report that \"accurately\" reflects GOV\'s efforts to 
combat human trafficking.  Poloff told Cassadore that it 
would be prudent to review the information regarding GOV 
efforts before discussing next steps. 
 
---------------- 
Work in Progress 
 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Commissioner Matos pointed out that indirectly, using 
existing laws against kidnapping or child protection laws, 
the CICPC can obtain warrants to arrest perpetrators and 
cooperate with international law enforcement to secure the 
safe return of victims.   Matos said CICPC is working on two 
international human trafficking cases involving 7 women. 
Mexican law-enforcement officials cooperated with CICPC to 
return two trafficked women to their families, but CICPC is 
still working to apprehend the perpetrator in Venezuela. 
According to Matos, five women were also trafficked to Spain, 
but despite cooperation with Spanish law-enforcement, the GOV 
has been unable to secure their return and apprehend those 
responsible. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
7. (C) MFA and MIJ have put effort into developing a 
coordinated action plan to combat human trafficking.  While 
concrete plans appear to have been developed, so far there 
has been only training for working group representatives. 
Efforts to go beyond awareness and prevention plans will 
continue to be hampered as long as there is a lack of 
anti-trafficking legislation.  The recent coordination 
between the MFA and the Interior (police) Ministry is 
positive, as is the current CICPC effort.  While they will 
never admit it, the TIP sanctions have motivated the GOV to 
take some concrete steps.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY On October 1, Economic and Commercial 
Counselors met with representatives of Philip Morris and 
British-American Tobacco, the two largest cigarette companies 
in Venezuela, who raised the impact of contraband cigarettes 
in the domestic Venezuelan market. The particular focus was 
on the \"Universal\" brand of cigarettes that is being produced 
in Colombia exclusively for the contraband market in 
Venezuela. Universal has been so successful that it now 
accounts for 8 percent of Venezuelan domestic cigarette sales 
and counterfeit versions of Universal itself are now on the 
market. The Venezuelan tobacco companies report that despite 
the volume of illicit cigarette trade between Colombia and 
Venezuela, authorities in neither country have taken concrete 
steps toward interdiction. END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------------- 
The Contraband Cigarette Issue 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Economic and Commercial Counselors met on October 1 
with Daniel Montealegre, Director of Government Affairs and 
Pedro Sosa, Legal Counsel for Tabacalera Nacional, the local 
subsidiary of Philip Morris;  Gerardo Anselmi, Director of 
Institutional Relations for Bigott, the local subsidiary of 
British-American Tobacco, and Carmen Martinez, Executive 
Director of the Colombian-Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce. 
The tobacco companies requested the meeting in order to 
discuss what they see as an increasing threat to legitimate 
tobacco companies in Venezuela from contraband products. 
According to the industry, 17 percent of the Venezuelan 
cigarette market is made up of contraband product. The 
remainder of the market is dominated by Bigott (representing 
the Belmont, Consul, Lucky Strike, and Kent brands) with a 69 
percent market share and Tabacalera Nacional (Marlboro) with 
14% 
 
3. (SBU)  The companies, primary concern was about the 
\"Universal\" brand of cigarettes.  This brand, they advised, 
is produced by Protabaco, one of the largest Colombia tobacco 
companies.  There is no legitimate market for Universal 
cigarettes in Venezuela, and the Universal trademark in 
Venezuela is not owned by Protabaco. According to the 
industry, the Universal cigarettes that find their way the 
Venezuelan market are supposedly exported to the free trade 
zone in Curacao and are either imported into Venezuela from 
there or never go to Curacao and are smuggled across the 
Colombian-Venezuelan frontier.  Bigott and Tabacalera 
Nacional claim that there is clear evidence that the 
Universal product is intended for the Venezuelan market in 
the fact that the Venezuelan health warning is printed on the 
packages and the cigarettes are 50mm in length, which is a 
peculiarity of only the Venezuelan and Japanese markets.  As 
a point of reference, the contraband product sells for 
approximately 800Bs.(US$.42) versus 2000Bs. (US$1.04) for 
legitimate products, with the difference largely arising from 
the fact that no taxes are reflected in the price of 
Universal. 
 
4. (SBU) The industry representatives stated that contraband 
cigarettes have been a problem in Venezuela for some time and 
the quantity of contraband on the market has increased over 
the last seven years.  At the apex in 1999, contraband 
cigarettes represented 25 percent of domestic sales, but 
subsequent exchange controls served to undermine smugglers as 
their ability to obtain the necessary hard currency for 
imports was significantly diminished. However, they have seen 
an upswing in contraband as foreign exchange has become more 
freely available. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Government Inaction Continues on Both Sides of the Border 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Queried as to the status of enforcement efforts, the 
 
 
industry representatives said that Colombian authorities have 
thus far been uncooperative with the requests for assistance 
from the Venezuelan tobacco sector, no doubt due in part to 
the fact that Protabaco holds a 40% market share in Colombia. 
 Similarly, they stated that the Venezuelan authorities do 
not appear to be particularly interested in pursuing 
interdiction despite the fact that 53% of the price of 
legitimate cigarettes is tax revenue. 
 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
6. (SBU) Cross-border smuggling is nothing new, of course. 
That a major Colombian company would consider itself free to 
create an entire contraband brand is a new wrinkle and would 
indicate that Venezuela,s customs authority, either through 
indifference, lack of resources, or corruption is making 
little effort to stop the illegal trade from going forward. 
Earlier in the Chavez administration, the GOV had given some 
priority to stopping illegal imports from competing with 
national industry.  (The main area of focus was the garment 
industry, where it imposed detailed country-of-origin 
labeling requirements).  However, interest in this issue has 
faded, especially as the GOV has become ever more solicitous 
of the burgeoning sector of informal vendors, who form the 
principal distribution channel for smuggled goods (including 
Universal cigarettes).  When the Venezuelan consumer goes 
down to the street market to pick up a pirated music or 
computer CD, or a knock-off designer shirt, he can also pick 
up some untaxed Colombian smokes and is likely to be able to 
do so for the foreseeable future.

WARNING TO AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. The regular \"Stumbling Block\" column published under the 
pseudonym \"Marciano\" in the very pro-Chavez daily DIARIO 
VEA, offered both a guarded welcome and a warning to 
Ambassador Brownfield.  \"Martian\" noted that Ambassador 
Brownfield seemed to be bringing a new approach based on 
mutual respect.  He warned the Ambassador not to try to 
interfere in Venezuela\'s internal affairs.  It is widely 
believed that \"Marciano\" is actually Venezuela\'s Vice- 
President, Jose Vincente Rangel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
HEADLINE AND FULL TEXT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. DIARIO VEA (pro-government, circ. 25,000) 
10/08 Stumbling Block column headline: \"Shapiro\'s Successor\" 
 
Full text: \"The new U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela is William 
Brownfield.  He\'s a Foreign Service official; that is, a 
professional.  He\'s coming from Chile, where he was 
carefully watched: too friendly say some, but restless. 
He\'s loquacious and forward.  His wife is also the U.S. 
Ambassador to Ecuador.  It is a family of diplomats. 
Brownfield was in Central America and also, some years ago, 
in Venezuela as a consul in Maracaibo.  In other words, he 
knows the country. 
 
\"What is, for now, the main thing about Brownfield?  The 
instructions he brings from his government and the fact that 
he is Shapiro\'s successor.  Let\'s see: a) As for the 
instructions, he gave a signal when he submitted copies of 
the letters of credence to Foreign Affairs Minister Prez: 
\"We are ready, willing, prepared and eager to explore the 
possibility of improving the bilateral relations between our 
two countries and also to collaborate on regional affairs,\" 
(our cannibalistic opposition cannot be happy with this 
statement).  Starting off with this statement is not bad and 
we have to bet on his good faith.  Venezuela-United States 
relations got complicated as a result of Washington\'s 
interfering in Venezuela\'s domestic affairs and because of 
the way the U.S. Embassy worked together with the Venezuelan 
opposition in sinister events such as the coup d\'tat on 
April 11 and the oil strike and sabotage in 2002.  The 
government of the United States provoked the conflict, not 
the government of Venezuela.  Therefore, if the new 
ambassador brings another approach, that of respect for 
national sovereignty, there won\'t be any trouble because 
everything can be dealt with based on that recognition.  b) 
Succeeding Shapiro is a challenge: he was a most imprudent 
and undiplomatic human being.  If Brownfield doesn\'t want 
problems he must behave differently than his predecessor - 
more discretion and less meddling; relations with all the 
sectors of society and not with one in particular; Chavista 
and anti-Chavista; government and opposition; not to succumb 
to the lure of the East of Caracas and to keep in mind that 
Caracas also has other places where human beings live and a 
number of people that believe in the Venezuelan government 
and support President Chvez. 
 
\"Welcome or Unwelcome: 
\"This columnist, who has many reservations about the Bush 
administration\'s foreign policy towards the region - and 
particularly towards Venezuela - and about the performance 
of ambassadors from that nation, leaves the door open to 
judging Brownfield\'s management, which will not be working 
within the parameters of other previous ambassador, and with 
the hope that the U.S. administration will look at the case 
of Venezuela with a different criteria from the one it has 
used up until now.  Welcome, Mr. Brownfield!  And I hope I 
won\'t have to say in the future, Unwelcome, Mr. Brownfield!\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. `Marciano\' is considered to be the pen name of 
Venezuela\'s Vice-President Rangel; the fact that he chose to 
address this issue probably reflects the Vice President\'s 
desire to comment on recent statements by Secretary Powell, 
A/S Noriega and the Ambassador.  The general line in VEA is 
stridently anti-USG.  Marciano\'s message shows some 
restrain, but remains firm in the GoV\'s stated principles

Summary

1. (C) The assimilation of organized labor into the 
Bolivarian Revolution continues to elude supporters of 
President Hugo Chavez.  Two rival labor confederations -- the 
anti-Chavez Venezuela Workers Confederation (CTV) and the 
pro-Chavez National Workers Union (UNT) -- plan to hold 
elections in early 2005.  The CTV wants to get fresh 
leadership and dispel the cloud left by current 
president-in-exile Carlos Ortega.  UNT has hobbled along 
since 2003 with 21 national coordinators who have digressed 
into factionalism.  The two electoral processes could shed 
light on which labor camp is strongest in Venezuela, though 
the \"revolutionary\" Chavistas ru a high risk of revealing 
their lack of support mong the working class.  End summary.

2. (U) After the pro-Chavez Bolivarian Workers Forc (FBT) 
lost the elections for the Venezuelan Worers Confederation 
(CTV) in October 2001, Presidet Hugo Chavez continued to 
battle the CTV and heped create a parallel labor

founded in Apri 2003 the National Workers Union (UNT) with 
the ope of supplanting the CTV as Venezuela\'s largest rade 
union group.  Since then, the CTV and UNT hve competed for 
union membership along pro-Chave/anti-Chavez lines, and it 
is now unclear how man workers each confederation

for top pots next year that could help bring the labor 
picture to sharp relief.

CTV:  Elections A Chance For A New Mandate 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) CTV President Carlos Ortega (currently in exile/hiding 
and facing criminal charges related to the national strike) 
and Secretary General Manuel Cova (now the CTV\'s de facto 
leader) received four-year terms in what was the first direct 
election of confederation leaders in CTV history.  Ortega and 
Cova were backed by a coalition of opposition parties, most 
notably Accion Democratica (AD).  The FBT charged fraud, and 
the GOV did not recognize the current CTV leadership.  At the 
same time, federations and individual unions affiliated with 
CTV were elected to three-year terms, which expire at the end 
of October 2004.  By law, unions have three months to hold 
new elections after the end of the term.  Rather than operate 
one more year with a president-in-exile, some CTV leaders 
(including Cova) are pressing to hold CTV elections at the 
same time as federation and union elections.  Voter turnout 
is also a factor, with workers more likely to vote for local 
union leaders than for national labor leaders. 
 
----------------------------- 
UNT:  Plagued By Factionalism 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In the wake of the national strike, dissident CTV 
officials and pro-Chavez labor leaders formed the UNT, naming 
a board of 21 \"national coordinators\" representing diverse 
groups.  Some national coordinators have ties to pro-Chavez 
political parties Patria Para Todos (PPT), Podemos, and 
Movimiento Quinta Republica (MVR).  Others have ideological 
ties, such as to the Socialist League or Trotskyites.  Some 
are \"independents\" from the Christian Democrats (COPEI), 
though critics refer to them as \"opportunists.\"  National 
Coordinator Orlando Chirino, a Trotskyite former regional CTV 
chief in Carabobo State, told poloff September 8 the concept 
of UNT was to practice \"collective leadership\" and thereby 
break from traditional Venezuelan union models.  The 
collective arrangement proved inadequate to manage a national 
labor movement, however, said Marcela Maspero, a former CTV 
executive council member from COPEI.  Maspero told poloff the 
full board of coordinators stopped meeting after only a few 
months, dwindling down into factions.  Maspero said the time 
had come for labor central to elect a president, which UNT 
 
 
leaders hope could take in February 2005, if electoral rules 
can be adopted in time. 
 
5. (C) There are two principal factions within UNT.  Maspero 
and Chirino lead one sect that is reported to have close 
contacts with Minister of Labor Maria Cristina Iglesias.  A 
member of the PPT party, Iglesias\' support is crucial for 
registering new UNT-affiliated unions, and unions with ties 
to Maspero and Chirino reportedly fare better with Iglesias 
than do other UNT factions.  Maspero demurred when poloff 
asked in the presence of Chirino which of them would be their 
faction\'s candidate for UNT president.  It will be decided 
later, Maspero responded. 
 
6. (C) The second principal faction is formed by Ramon 
Machuca, leader of the union at the GOV-owned steel plant, 
SIDOR, in Bolivar State.  Machuca was a founder of UNT and 
had hoped to be named its first president; when the 
collective model was adopted, Machuca\'s interest in UNT 
cooled.  Earlier this year, Machuca lead a successful strike 
at SIDOR.  If the UNT holds elections, Muchaca is likely to 
be a candidate.  He is supported by fellow national 
coordinators Franklin Rondon, who leads the large pro-Chavez 
public worker federation, and Francisco Torrealba, the former 
head of the Caracas Metro union.  Torrealba told poloff 
September 28 his faction has poor relations with the Minister 
of Labor, who clashed publicly with the metro union in 
September over its collective bargaining agreement with the 
GOV.  Both faction agreed that other groups exist within UNT 
that, if motivated by the elections, could field serious 
candidates as well. 
 
--------------- 
The CNE Wrinkle 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) Venezuelan labor analyst Rolando Diaz told poloff 
September 22 that elections for both confederations will be a 
measure of their respective strengths.  Workers affiliated 
with each central will vote -- confederations draw up their 
own voter rolls -- and thus give an indication of overall 
membership of each.  Another factor in the elections is the 
role of the National Electoral Council (CNE), which was 
empowered by the 1999 Constitution to oversee union internal 
elections.  Both the CTV and UNT oppose this provision, which 
they view as a violation of International Labor Organization 
(ILO) conventions on the freedoms of association and to 
organize.  There are widespread concerns as well that the 
CNE, which routinely cows to GOV interests, will give 
disparate treatment to the CTV, whose 2001 elections the CNE 
has yet to recognize.  Torrealba expressed concern that the 
CNE will be biased in favor of the UNT faction competing 
against his.  He said his faction might seek a Supreme Court 
injunction to void the CNE\'s authority to intervene in union 
elections.  Diaz was confident that in a fair contest the UNT 
would be shown to have fewer workers than the CTV. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) President Hugo Chavez has been unable to capture wide 
support among organized labor and has instead caused its 
fragmentation.  He can only count on nominal support from the 
UNT leaders, who are united more by their disgust for the CTV 
than for their affection for Chavez.  The CTV and UNT 
elections could overlap next year, creating some potential 
pitfalls for Chavez.  A relatively big turnout for CTV over 
UNT would signal low Chavez support in the formal economy 
working class.  Involving the rarely impartial CNE could open 
the institution to further erosion of its credibility, which 
Chavez needs to preserve for next year\'s legislative 
elections.  Taken in the context of high 
unemployment/underemployment and flagging worker salaries and 
benefits, labor politics will at least present a major 
headache for Chavez in the coming year.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The media has continued to report on the 
killing of a PDVSA engineer and five soldiers in Apure State. 
 The opposition and the Colombian Government continue to 
fault the government for complicity in border violence.  The 
GOV and its supporters have blamed the United States and 
Colombia for the attacks.  Former PDVSA workers have cast 
doubt on the official line that the victims constituted an 
oil exploration team.  Both the opposition and the GOV likely 
expect to benefit from the publicity.  The true identity of 
the attackers may never surface publicly.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The media has stretched the news thin to keep the 
story on the September 17 Apure State ambush (REFTEL) 
running.  The national press has begun to report even the 
discovery of corpses in neighboring Tachira state in order to 
continue the body count.  On September 30, the press ran a 
story simply to say that the National Assembly\'s defense 
committee continued to investigate the murders. 
 
-------------------- 
Trading Accusations 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Accusations leveled by the Venezuelan and Colombian 
Governments continued to give life to the story.  In the 
latest round of a verbal row between Venezuelan Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel and Colombian members of 
congress, Rangel, accused of engaging in \"verbal terrorism,\" 
blamed Colombians on September 29 for ignoring the border 
problem.  The Governor of Colombia\'s Arauca department, which 
borders Apure, blamed the GOV on 30 September for supporting 
the Colombian insurgency.  On October 5, secretary of the 
Venezuelan National Defense Council (CDN) Gen. Melvin Lopez 
Hidalgo said at a university forum on Plan Colombia that he 
suspected Colombian paramilitaries were receiving US 
training, although he stopped short of indicating that 
Washington intended to use such forces. 
 
4.  (C) GOV press outlets have also kept the story alive. 
The Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL) garnered front-page 
coverage in the pro-Government tabloid Diario Vea October 1 
by announcing they would suspend operations, adding that the 
\"empire\" was blaming the FBL for its own bloody attacks.  A 
pro-Chavez website on September 29 cited a joint declaration 
by Colombian social organizations blaming the White House for 
the ambush.  The FARC, meanwhile, has sent a communique to 
the press accusing the Colombian Army. 
 
5.  (U) The pro-opposition media, meanwhile, has cited local 
ranchers, indigenous people, and clergy who fault the 
government for the lack of security at the border states. 
The CD on October 8 responded to the FBL\'s article by asking 
the Attorney General\'s office to investigate links between 
the FBL, Diario Vea, and the government.  Striking a less 
confrontational tone, ranching association FEDENAGA during a 
September 30 press conference said Chavez\'s September 22 
speech to troops in Apure opened space for dialog after 28 
years of insecurity in the region.  (The first kidnapping 
took place in 1976, according to FEDENAGA.) 
 
----------------- 
Oil exploration? 
---------------- 
 
6.  (C) A former PDVSA executive told PolOff September 29 
that the victims probably were not in the area for oil 
exploration.  A larger group with seismic equipment would 
have characterized a true exploration mission, he said, 
adding that even a less formal scouting party would have had 
experienced geologists.  Defense Minister Gen. Garcia 
Carneiro told the press that authorities were seeking a 
member of the group who incriminated himself in the attack 
because he fled the scene just prior to the ambush. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
 
------- 
 
7.  (C)   As noted by the NGOs, the attack is representative 
of the everyday violence in Venezuela\'s \"wild west,\" which is 
rarely publicized at a national level and almost never 
punished.  This time, however, the attacks have become a 
publicity bonanza for both the GOV and the opposition.  The 
opposition is using the incident to blame the government for 
harboring terrorists, ignoring border violence, and damaging 
military morale.  The border problem has also become the 
latest GOV bugbear, serving as a convenient reminder to the 
Venezuelan public that it has an external enemy in the United 
States, Plan Colombia, and ill-defined \"neoliberal\" plotting. 
 The GOV also continues to treat the issue in attempts to 
reassure the public it controls both the border and its own 
troops. 
 
8.  (C) The GOV\'s unwillingness to rule out the FARC as the 
culprit in these attacks suggest that the Colombian 
guerrillas really were at fault and that the GOV knows it. 
If the PDVSA official\'s comments and the account of the 
fleeing victim are true, the soldiers likely were in the 
region to conduct some kind of business with one of the armed 
groups.

REF: 10/15 BROWNFIELD/NORIEGA E-MAIL 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Abelardo A. Arias for reason 1.4 (D) 
 
1.  (C) I presented my credentials to President Hugo Chavez 
October 15.  We were a package of four ambassadors (Barbados, 
US, Norway, South Korea) handled in assembly line fashion. 
The President devoted roughly 15 minutes per country 
separately.  Each ambassador took DCM plus four.  In my case, 
the four were POL, DATT, FCS, and MGT.  Chavez was 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Jesus Perez plus two others. 
We all remained together for the entire meeting.  Chavez and 
I did all the talking. 
 
2.  (C) Chavez offered a few pleasantries to start the 
meeting, informing me that he likes the Cincinnati Reds and 
inviting me to La Orchila island to go fishing.  The 
President then told me he wants better bilateral relations 
with the US.  He noted my comments to FM Perez from my 
meeting with the Foreign Minister two weeks earlier, and said 
they were a good starting point.  Not all bilateral issues 
had to be politicized, Chavez said.  He recalled that when he 
was denied a US visa from 1992-98 he never tried to 
politicize that fact in Venezuela.  Chavez told me he was 
watching the US election and he was ready to work with 
whoever won.  The President acknowledged that there are areas 
and issues on which we inevitably would not agree, but he 
reiterated that he wanted to improve the relationship. 
 
3.  (C) I told Chavez that, as the Secretary had stated, we 
also wanted better relations.  I noted, however, that the 
process had to be step by step, starting with current reality 
and small steps at that.  We would maintain our positions on 
democratic institutions and human rights, I emphasized, and 
we would maintain positions on regional and security issues. 
These would be issues on which we might continue to disagree, 
in public and in private, I told the President, but there 
should be areas where we could engage in pragmatic 
cooperation. 
 
4.  (C) Suggesting our approach, I said the first step would 
be to change the tone and volume of the bilateral dialogue; 
also to avoid gratuitous provocation as well.  We could not 
resolve problems, I told the President, if we did not have 
good communication and access.  If the optics of the 
relationship improved, I said, I could explore with his 
ministers more cooperation on drugs, terrorism and energy.  I 
cautioned again that we had to do this one step at a time, 
and tone down the rhetoric.  Chavez agreed with that 
approach, and offered his presidential staff to address and 
resolve problems.  He told me he would also be available to 
meet with me.

OAS SECRETARY GENERAL A U.S. COUP 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. The regular \"Stumbling Block\" column published under the 
pseudonym \"Marciano\" in the very pro-Chavez daily DIARIO 
VEA, bitterly attacked the resignation of Costa Rican 
Secretary General Miguel Angel Rodriguez.  It described this 
 
SIPDIS 
as a U.S. coup to maintain control of the OAS.  The 
Salvadoran OAS Secretary General candidate and any Peruvian 
candidate are seen as U.S. puppets.  It is widely believed 
in Venezuela that \"Marciano\" is actually Venezuela\'s Vice- 
President, Jose Vincente Rangel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
HEADLINE AND FULL TEXT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. DIARIO VEA (pro-government, circ. 25,000) 
10/13 Stumbling Block column headline: \"Coup at the OAS\" 
 
Quotes: \"A coup was mounted against Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
at the OAS.  Why does this columnist say that?  Because 
everything is very clear.  The U.S. did not like Rodriguez. 
The reasons were not that clear.  When Cesar Gaviria\'s 
succession was discussed, the possible options were: the 
Chilean Insulza, Lagos\' candidate, and the Salvadoran 
Flores, Washington\'s favorite candidate.  Rodriguez did not 
stand out; he was only mentioned symbolically.  What 
happened?  Chavez involved himself in the process.  He 
regarded Rodriguez as a good candidate to beat Flores 
\"...the U.S. maneuvered but could not prevent the formation 
of a Caribbean and Latin American bloc in support of 
Rodriguez.  Washington had no choice but to accept and said 
to itself: \'I\'ll get back at you later on!\' 
\"... The coup had been consummated.  The U.S. has recovered, 
for the moment, control of the OAS through the gringo (sic) 
sub-secretary Einaudi, and the possibility of proposing 
captive candidates, such as the Salvadoran Flores or any 
Peruvian candidate that might be in line.  This story is not 
over...\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. The GoV and the more leftist Chavistas view the OAS with 
suspicion; the GoV had welcomed the election of Rodriguez as 
it perceived he would be a far less interventionist OAS 
Secretary General.  In addition, the Salvadoran OAS 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary General candidate, Flores, had provoked GoV ire by 
 
SIPDIS 
his early recognition of the April 2002, short-lived Carmona 
presidency.  The charge that the USG is behind Rodriguez\'s 
departure has little resonance here; its appearance in VEA 
reflects both an instinctive suspicion of the USG as well as 
bald-faced manipulation. End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Former Zulia State Governor, Francisco Arias Cardenas, 
told the Ambassador on October 14 that President Hugo 
Chavez\'s antagonism had served Chavez well in the past, but 
he was now looking to improve relations with the U.S.  Arias 
asserted that the President would not let the differences 
escalate to those the U.S. has with Cuba.  However, Arias 
said, Chavez would react with aggression to any criticism 
from the U.S. government, because he assumes the U.S. intends 
to destroy his government.  Arias, who is again running for 
governor of Zulia State, also claimed that the upcoming 
regional elections would redefine the political face of 
Venezuela in Chavez\'s favor, with the opposition\'s mistakes 
costing its candidates dearly.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador and Poloff met October 14 with 
Francisco Arias Cardenas, a candidate for governor in the 
western border oil state of Zulia.  Arias, an ex-army officer 
who also participated in the 1992 coup attempt with President 
Hugo Chavez, brought Jorge Garrido, Secretary General of the 
Union political party that Arias founded. 
 
------------------- 
Chavez\'s Mentality 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador told Arias he believed many people were 
awaiting the outcome of the presentation of his credentials 
for an indication of future U.S.-Venezuelan relations. Arias 
asserted that Chavez\'s antagonism towards the U.S. had served 
him in the past, but he was now looking to improve relations 
while maintaining respect and dignity.  Chavez, he said, 
would prefer not to let the confrontation escalate to the 
same level that Castro has with the U.S.  The Ambassador 
asked if Chavez would be able to manage pragmatic 
collaboration on some topics even though the U.S. would 
continue to disagree with him on regional issues and 
democratic institutions.  Arias responded that Chavez is 
paranoid about U.S. intention to destroy him, and those fears 
will be reconfirmed by those around him at the first sign of 
disagreement or criticism from the U.S.  Chavez\'s paranoia 
will cause him to react aggressively, Arias asserted.  Arias 
said it might be helpful if the Ambassador specifically 
pointed out to Chavez that a disagreement was not an attack, 
and that on a wider scale many topics existed on which the 
two countries could cooperate. 
 
------------------ 
Political Outlook 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) Arias asserted that the upcoming regional elections 
would redefine the political face of Venezuela in Chavez\'s 
favor.  The big opposition political parties, he said, will 
lose most of the races.  The opposition parties lost their 
way and need to be rational and accept that some of Chavez\'s 
ideas are good, Arias asserted, while still rejecting 
authoritarian, centralist and anti-democratic tendencies. 
The \"missions\", especially the Cuban doctors and teachers, 
are making a big impact on the people, Arias said.  Chavez 
has control of many institutions now, Arias noted, and in the 
next two years those who oppose him will lose more and more 
of their resources.  Arias said he foresaw Chavez being 
re-elected in 2006, thus maintaining power for the next eight 
years.  There are no alternatives that opposition parties can 
offer, Arias asserted.  Miranda State Governor Enrique 
Mendoza, he said, suffered a big defeat with the referendum, 
and will likely be defeated again.  Arias also asserted that 
Manuel Rosales, the current Zulia state governor running for 
reelection against Arias, would not be a possible leading 
political figure since he is likely to be convicted of 
treason for the April 2002 events regardless of whether he 
wins or loses the regional election. 
 
--------------- 
Boarder Issues 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) Arias said kidnapping and paying \"protection money\" to 
criminals and guerrillas is common in Zulia State.  He said 
drugs and drug trafficking were a problem, but now there was 
no way to identify how extensive the problem was because 
there were no satellite images or inspections by the armed 
forces.  The people are afraid to confront the Colombian 
problem directly, Arias said, and the local, regional and 
national governments compete rather than cooperate, so no one 
addressed border problems or crime. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Francisco Arias Cardenas\' insight into Chavez\'s 
mentality was interesting given their past connection in the 
military service and the 1992 coup attempt. Arias, a former 
governor of Zulia state who lost to Manuel Rosales, had 
reasonable predictions about the political outlook, but of 
course, he is not completely unbiased, particularly with 
regards to his rival Rosales.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Supporters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez are 
stuck on how to roll back market-oriented reforms of worker 
benefits from the 1990s.  The 1999 Constitution reversed 
changes to the severance, health care, pensions, and housing 
regimes, replacing them with impractical and, so far, 
impossible goals of vastly improving the welfare of workers. 
The GOV pushed through a state-centered social security law 
in 2002, but a debate among Chavez supporters on whether to 
exclude the private sector from the new system has impeded 
application of the new law.  Labor leaders see little hope of 
progress in these areas due to polarization and Chavez\'s 
autocratic methods.  Meanwhile, Venezuela\'s hodgepodge social 
safety net continues to deteriorate, marked by an increase in 
the informal economy.  The GOV is unlikely in the medium-term 
to reach a societal consensus on reform, to the detriment of 
Venezuela\'s workers.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Chavez Promised Better Benefits 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Worker wages and benefits in the 1990s deteriorated in 
a period of economic stagnation.  In 1997, the Venezuelan 
Workers Confederation (CTV) negotiated with the business 
sector and GOV to overhaul severance payments and the social 
security (which includes health care, pensions, and housing 
loans) regime along market lines.  The results of those 
negotiations left workers thinking they had lost out in the 
name of the free market, leading to a crippling loss of 
credibility for the CTV (ref).  Restoration of worker 
benefits became an effective campaign theme for 
then-presidential candidate Hugo Chavez in 1998.  Chavez 
later wrote his campaign promises into the 1999 Constitution. 
 The new Constitution instilled a right to severance payments 
and implied a return to the old system; rights to universal, 
state-provided health care and a pension plan were also 
established.  Despite the constitutional language, however, 
actions have been few.  A bill amending the Organic Labor Law 
to adjust severance payments has been stuck in the National 
Assembly for three years.  In November 2002, during a 
political crisis and without opposition support, the 
pro-Chavez majority of the National Assembly passed a new 
Organic Social Security Law.  The organic law requires 
specific legislation, all still pending, in the areas of 
health care, severance and pensions, housing, workers 
compensation, and worker safety.  None of these bills has 
been mentioned by the majority leaders as a priority for the 
current session. 
 
----------------------------- 
The Severance Package Dilemma 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Severance payments (prestaciones) traditionally had 
been calculated based on the employee\'s current salary times 
the number of years worked, though additional factors could 
multiply this figure by up to ten times.  As a result, 
instead of raises, employers paid more in bonuses and food 
allowances, so much so that by the mid-90s salaries accounted 
for just 30 percent of total income of workers.  The 1997 
reform changed the calculations to a monthly basis on all 
income and imposed caps on severance payments.  Workers with 
many years of service at a company or government agency 
complained they were hurt by the reform.  CTV legal advisor 
Leon Arismendi, who negotiated the 1997 reform, told poloff 
that workers with more than 7.5 years on the job lost some 
benefits.  The 1997 reform also permitted workers to draw up 
to 80 percent of their severance in advance to purchase a 
house or cover some other large expense.  Rather than let 
debts to workers pile up, employers began to pay \"severance\" 
on an annual basis.  This essentially eliminated the 
severance payment\'s function as a de facto unemployment 
benefit. 
 
4. (C) Orlando Chirino, a national coordinator of the 
 
 
pro-Chavez National Workers Union (UNT), said his labor 
confederation is fighting to restore the old severance 
system, free of caps, with retroactivity back to 1997 (with 
interest).  Venezuelan labor analyst Rolando Diaz told poloff 
such rhetoric is disingenuous, as such payments would be 
astronomical for employers, especially the public sector.  He 
pointed out that even the Chavez administration has not paid 
the arrears owed to public workers, which Diaz called 
financially impossible.  (The GOV also owes severance pay to 
the 18,000 ex-workers of PDVSA.)  The GOV, in fact, still 
works under the 1997 severance system.  Pro-Chavez Deputy 
Ismael Garcia told poloff October 11 that retroactivity is 
probably not feasible.  As an alternative, Garcia said his 
Podemos party would soon propose a bill to allow workers to 
convert severance packages into credits for housing loans. 
 
----------------------------- 
Rationalizing Social Security 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Though workers contribute to Venezuela\'s health care 
system, the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS), most 
receive medical attention at specialized or private clinics. 
Arismendi said the GOV decided in 1992 to open IVSS services 
to all patients regardless of ability to pay.  This resulted 
in a precipitous decline in the quality of IVSS care to the 
point that most government agencies (including IVSS) 
established their own clinics for their workers.  Large 
private companies began to offer medical insurance policies 
for attention at private clinics.  Employers also opted for 
private alternatives in pensions and housing loans, as IVSS\' 
cash reserves for pensions were routinely raided by GOV 
administrations.  Unions complained that by 2000, workers 
were being asked to shoulder the costs of the decrepit IVSS 
system while still contributing to other medical and pension 
plans. 
 
6. (C) The 2002 Organic Social Security Law sought to bring 
the patchwork of separate health/pension/housing plans under 
a re-constituted IVSS.  Article 86 of the Constitution, 
however, gave all Venezuelans the right to universal, 
comprehensive, and public health care that could be financed 
by direct or indirect contributions of the participants. 
Article 86 effectively prohibits private health care 
companies from participating in the medical system, though it 
left the door open with regard to pensions.  A bill proposed 
in March 2001 by then-Vice President Isaias Rodriguez had 
tried to create a state-run medical system with a mixed 
pension plan.  Rodriguez\'s plan was denounced, however, by 
Chavez hard-liners as a \"privatization\" plan.  Arismendi 
predicted that the GOV\'s refusal to negotiate with the CTV 
and Fedecamaras (both anti-Chavez entities) would impede any 
new efforts at reform. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Venezuela:  A Neo-Liberal Paradise 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Venezuela\'s debate over worker benefits is taking 
place in the midst of a decline in the formal employment 
sector.  A National Assembly report on labor said the 
formal-informal employment ratio had nearly reversed, going 
from 58%-42% in 1990 to 45%-55% in 2002.  Leon estimates, by 
taking out unemployment, that only 30% of workers (about 3.6 
million workers) receive some kind of formal benefit package. 
 Froilan Barrios, a former Chavez supporter and lead drafter 
of the Constitution\'s labor provisions, said the GOV has an 
outstanding debt with the workers to achieve real reform and 
to restore their living conditions to those of previous eras. 
 He said the Chavez administration has become comfortable 
with stopgap measures to alleviate social problems (the 
\"missions,\" decrees prohibiting firing of workers, etc.). 
The result, he concluded, are the lowest labor costs in 
Venezuelan history, which he said had created a \"neo-liberal 
paradise.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Chavez came into office promising to reverse 
neo-liberal reforms that workers rightly or wrongly blamed 
for their shrinking benefits.  After five years of Chavez 
 
 
rule, however, the formal employment sector continues to 
wither and unemployment remains high.  Serious labor reform 
seems unlikely given the constitutional straitjacket against 
private sector participation and Chavez\'s autocratic style of 
governance.  With oil prices and state revenues up, Chavez 
can probably afford to neglect the labor market in the 
short-term.  In the medium term, however, he will need to 
find practical solutions for the working class or risk 
spurning a significant constituency.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Venezuelan prosecutor Danilo Anderson took testimony 
from three media executives at the beginning of October as 
part of his investigation into the events of April 12-13, 
2002. Anderson announced on September 17 that he was 
reopening the investigation of persons who had supported the 
interim government of Pedro Carmona. Anderson announced the 
investigation would involve some 400 people associated with 
the \"Carmona Decree,\" which dissolved the GOV in April 2002. 
In addition to those that signed the decree, Anderson is 
targeting persons known to be present in Miraflores Palace at 
the time, having \"signed in\" or been caught on videotape. 
Sumate\'s Maria Corina Machado and Zulia Governor Manuel 
Rosales are perhaps the most prominent persons on the list. 
End Summary. 
 
------------- 
Case Reopened 
------------- 
 
2.  (U) On September 17 prosecutor Danilo Anderson announced 
that Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez had ordered him to 
reopen the investigation into the events of April 12, 2002 
surrounding the installation of the Carmona government. He 
told reporters he would investigate those people named as 
ministers in Carmona\'s government, those who signed the 
\"Carmona Decree\" and those who were present at Miraflores 
during Carmona\'s swearing in. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
3. (C) On April 11, 2002 Gen. Lucas Rincon announced 
President Chavez\' resignation on national television. 
Hundreds of Chavez opponents had marched to the Presidential 
Palace and occupied it when military officers took the 
President into custody. Pedro Carmona, then president of the 
business federation FEDECAMARAS,  swore himself in as 
president. This act broke the constitutional chain. Amidst 
the celebrating and negotiating, a decree was written. It is 
not clear who wrote it, though that is likely to be part of 
Anderson\'s investigation. The Carmona Decree, as it is now 
known, dissolved the GOV, the National Assembly, the Supreme 
Court, and the Citizen Power, including the prosecutor\'s 
office. The decree was signed publicly by the representatives 
of several institutions, and publicly proclaimed. This 
decree, and the political attacks against Chavista officials, 
is generally credited with sparking the reaction of loyal 
elements of the military, which led to Chavez\' restitution on 
April 13. In 2002 the Supreme Court, sitting in Plenary 
Chamber, ruled that the events of April 11, 2002, did not 
constitute a coup, but rather a power vacuum, given Chavez\' 
resignation. The decision halted attempts to try the military 
participants in the April events. 
 
--------- 
400 Blows 
--------- 
 
3.  (U) On September 30 Anderson announced that he expected 
to call 400 persons to testify, possibly as suspects, over 
the course of two months. He said he intended to investigate 
Carmona\'s ministers first, then those who signed the decree 
publicly, then those who signed privately after Carmona was 
sworn in, and finally those who were present at Miraflores 
during Carmona\'s swearing in ceremony as president. For this 
last group, Anderson plans to use videos to identify people. 
Anderson told the press that the investigation was beginning 
from the assumption that the crime committed was civil 
rebellion. Depending on the level of complicity, suspects 
might be charged as author, co-author, participant or 
accomplice. Anderson said he would not call Gen. Lucas 
Rincon, who announced Chavez\' resignation, or the Vice 
President at the time, Diosdado Cabello, to testify. 
 
------------------- 
Media Execs Testify 
------------------- 
 
 
4.  (U) Globovision Director General Alberto Ravell testified 
before prosecutor Danilo Anderson on October 4, about an 
alleged meeting on April 13, 2002, between interim president 
Pedro Carmona and media executives, allegedly to design the 
interim government\'s communication policy. Anderson told 
reporters that he had learned of the meeting from testimony 
by Rafael Arreaza, Carmona\'s Health Minister. Anderson also 
summoned Globovision President Guillermo Zuloaga on October 
5, Venevision President Victor Ferrer on October 7, and 
Venevision owner Gustavo Cisneros on October 8. The media 
executives told reporters that the meeting with Carmona was 
public, that they had not met to design Carmona\'s 
communication policy, and that they had not signed the 
decree. Some noted that the allegation did not make sense 
because as independent media their role is not to advise a 
government on a communication strategy. 
 
------------ 
Fear Abounds 
------------ 
 
5.  (C) On October 5 PolOff spoke with Juan Martin 
Echevarria, who represents some of the potential suspects. He 
said he knew many people who were scared, and that some would 
follow Rafael Arreaza\'s step of coming forward and 
cooperating with Anderson to avoid being charged. Martin 
suggested that these testimonies could be manipulated by 
Anderson to implicate whoever he wanted in whatever crime he 
wanted. Martin suggested that the appointment of Anderson as 
prosecutor sent a powerful message, since people remembered 
that he sent Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles to jail for 120 
days. Martin said the case was an attack against the 
opposition rear-guard, designed to shut down sources of 
financing and other support for opposition leaders by 
bringing the real threat of prison close to home. 
 
6.  (C) Most of those alleged to have signed apparently 
signed blank pieces of paper, which press reports have said 
were left out for people to sign their adherence to the 
decree. Maria Corina Machado, of SUMATE, listed as a signer 
on lists that have appeared in the press, alleges that she 
signed only a visitors book, though her lawyer, Martin, told 
PolOff she physically signed a blank piece of paper. Martin 
confirmed that Machado\'s mother also signed a piece of paper 
in Miraflores, and would probably be called to testify. 
 
7.  (C) Several people signed the decree publicly in the name 
of various social and political groups, including: Cardinal 
Velasco in the name of the Catholic Church; Carlos Fernandez, 
in the name of FEDECAMARAS; Zulia Governor Manuel Rosales, in 
the name of the regional governments. MVR Deputy Saul Ortega 
told PolOff on October 6 that it would probably be impossible 
to convict those who signed the blank pieces of paper, or 
those who were physically present. The ministers, and those 
who signed publicly, however, were guilty of treason and 
should be convicted, Ortega said. Construyendo Pais deputy 
Leopoldo Martinez, whom Carmona named Finance Minister, told 
PolCouns he did not believe Anderson would pursue a case 
against him because of his parliamentary immunity. Anderson, 
he asserted, was more intent on intimidating Chavez opponents 
than in ever taking the investigation to fruition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Capitalizing on winning the referendum, the GOV is 
turning to ensure that opponents understand there is a cost 
to participation in politics against the government. It is 
also important for Chavistas that April 11 be legally defined 
as a coup, and those who supported the Carmona government as 
coupsters. The prosecutor\'s office is being used to convey 
this message. The beginning of the parade of persons 
answering Anderson\'s summons appeared to be fairly innocuous. 
The list is long, however, and there are bound to be 
flare-ups, for example when SUMATE representative Maria 
Corina Machado is called. That moment, while solely at 
Anderson\'s discretion, will likely occur at an advantageous 
moment for the GOV and an inopportune moment for its 
opponents.  Still unknown is how far the prosecutions are 
likely to proceed through the judiciary.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Christian Democratic Party (COPEI) 
president Eduardo Fernandez offered the Ambassador on October 
14 his views on US policy in Venezuela and on best strategies 
to implement it.  Fernandez supported current efforts to 
improve the bilateral relationship and urged respect for 
Venezuelan sovereignty.  He struck a moderate tone on 
President Hugo Chavez, criticizing his antidemocratic 
practices while conceding that he would recognize him as a 
democratically elected President.  Fernandez\'s \"counsel\" 
accords with the USG approach, although he urged perhaps too 
much caution in the face of Venezuelan sovereignty concerns. 
Fernandez\'s moderation, nonetheless, will not ingratiate his 
party with the GOV.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
An Opposition Opinion of US Policy... 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Christian Democratic Party (COPEI) president Eduardo 
\"El Tigre\" Fernandez told the Ambassador during a courtesy 
call October 14 that the Embassy\'s job in Venezuela was to 
procure the best possible relationship with both the GOV and 
the Venezuelan people.  He submitted that the Embassy had 
influence in supporting Venezuelan democracy, human rights, 
and government institutions.  The USG, he said, should speak 
in defense of principles--such as democratic and press 
freedoms--with \"pugnacity.\" 
 
3.  (U)  According to Fernandez, the Embassy could bolster 
its image by respecting Venezuelan sovereignty and by not 
becoming a \"political actor\" or an opposition party. 
Fernandez recommended couching US discourse in terms of an 
esteem for Venezuelan political experience and a refusal to 
intervene in its internal processes.  In a later aside, he 
mentioned having told every US ambassador he had met that 
baseball was a \"secret weapon\" that the US could use to 
influence Venezuelan public opinion.  Calling himself a 
\"fanatic of dialog,\" Fernandez valued the Boston Group, a 
bipartisan exchange effort of Venezuelan and US legislators. 
 
--------------- 
...And the GOV 
-------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Fernandez said improving the bilateral relationship 
would be complicated because the GOV\'s words and actions were 
often different.  The GOV, he said, presented a bellicose 
image, but it had been an exemplary debtor and a trustworthy 
energy supplier.  He added that investors in the petroleum 
sector have had no complaints.  Prompted by the Ambassador, 
Fernandez conceded that the GOV decision on October 10 to 
increase royalty payments on heavy crude projects (REFTEL) 
was an exception. 
 
5.  (U)  Fernandez warned that many radical opposition 
elements wanted Chavez overthrown, but he recognized that 
Chavez was elected by majority vote.  He acknowledged that 
his party could not disavow the referendum after the OAS and 
the Carter Center had legitimized it.  According to 
Fernandez, the outcome of the referendum was his party\'s 
problem, not that of the United States; multilateral accords 
obligated both Washington and the Venezuelan public to accept 
the results. 
 
6.  (U)  Turning to criticism, Fernandez said President Hugo 
Chavez\'s administration had roots in military culture rather 
than in democratic, juridical tradition.  He noted that the 
National Assembly and the judiciary were controlled by a 
government accustomed to issuing orders rather than engaging 
in dialog.  Referring to the proposed Media Law, he lamented 
that the judicial system was in dangerous straits. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Although Fernandez resists Chavez-bashing, his 
moderation will not save COPEI from drawing fire from the 
GOV, which brands opposition groups as traitors to the 
revolution.  Accordingly, any high-profile US encounters with 
such parties will afford Chavez anti-US fodder.  True to his 
non-confrontational nature, Fernandez had relatively 
innocuous suggestions for packaging US policy.  His counsel 
about honoring Venezuelan sovereignty is prudent, but we 
would not translate respect for sovereignty into silence and 
inaction on controversial issues.  Otherwise, Fernandez\'s 
\"advice\" sounds much like the USG\'s current operating 
strategy.  End Comment. 
 
8.(U)  Bio Note:  Fernandez spoke fondly of American culture 
and his two years at Georgetown University, where he received 
a master\'s degree in political science, according to the 
official COPEI website.  He jokingly mentioned having trouble 
receiving a US visa for 20 years after he wrote to advise 
former President Nixon against visiting Venezuela because of 
political instability.  He said US Immigration had mistakenly 
identified him as a communist.

1. (C) Venezuelan Vice-President Jose Vicente Rangel led a 
delegation to Moscow from October 2-6 for the first meeting 
of the High-Level Russo-Venezuelan Intergovernmental 
Commission (CIAN).  Rangel discussed joint efforts to combat 
international terrorism and military-technological 
cooperation with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander 
Zhukov and Secretary of the Russian Security Council Igor 
Ivanov according to press reports.  The Venezuelan delegation 
also discussed energy, mining, trade, scientific and cultural 
exchanges. The joint declaration signed on October 5 was a 
general agreement, according to the Russian Embassy in 
Caracas, for future economic cooperation.  Russian Emboff 
confirmed that planning continues for a visit to Russia by 
President Hugo Chavez in November 2004.  GOV-Russia 
cooperation suits the GOV because it signals the GOV\'s 
ability to deal with major non-U.S. powers; to emphasize 
non-U.S. sources of military equipment; and as a signal of 
independence.  End Summary.

Economic Cooperation 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C)  Vice-President Jose Vicente Rangel led a 34-person 
delegation to Moscow from October 2-6 for the first official 
meeting of the High-Level Russo-Venezuelan Intergovernmental 
Commission (CIAN).  According to Mikhail Babich, a political 
and cultural attache at the Russian embassy, the purpose of 
this meeting was to increase economic activity between the 
two countries.  Babich said Russia and Venezuela had signed 
an agreement regarding their intentions to increase economic 
cooperation in 2001, but the political turmoil in Venezuela 
had delayed the first meeting for years.  Babich asserted 
that Chavez perceives Russians to be fellow \"revolutionaries\" 
and an alternative to U.S. power (with India and China), so 
interest in political engagement between the two countries is 
high. 
 
3. (C)  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov told 
reporters Russian companies were interested in greater 
cooperation with Venezuela, and that various projects existed 
that could act as engines to drive bilateral relations. 
Zhukov cited the Russian Aluminum Company (RusAl) intention 
to invest approximately $1 billion in the construction of an 
aluminum refining plant in Venezuela.  Babich confirmed that 
RusAl intended to invest at least $500 million in the 
refining plant as RusAl president and owner, Oleg Deripaska, 
told reporters.  Zhukov also asserted that Russian companies 
want to establish hydroelectric energy plants in Venezuela to 
increase cooperation. 
 
4. (C) Babich said that during the meetings, Venezuelan 
officials and Russian representatives discussed oil and gas 
cooperation.  LUKOIL and Gazprom were two companies 
specifically mentioned.  LUKOIL first vice-president, Ravil 
Maganov, told reporters he discussed a joint venture with the 
Venezuelan oil company, PDVSA, with the Venezuelan delegation 
on the basis of a memorandum of understanding signed by 
LUKOIL and PDVSA in December 2003.  According to press 
reports, Venezuela and Russia also discussed Russia\'s entry 
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which Venezuela 
is a member. 
 
--------------------- 
Military Cooperation 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) Rangel and Secretary of the Russian Security Council 
Igor Ivanov discussed cooperation in military-technology and 
combating international terrorism, according to press 
reports.  DAO reported nine Venezuelan officers representing 
all the services traveled to Moscow to attend CIAN from 
October 1-10 (reftel).  A DAO source said, \"It will be no 
surprise if Venezuela comes out of this intergovernmental 
commission with more equipment purchases in all services of 
 
the armed forces.\"  In the agreement signed on October 5, the 
mention of military cooperation was limited to \"develop and 
strengthen cooperation\" based on the May 2001 convention 
between the two countries. 
 
6. (C) Rangel and the Venezuelan ambassador to Russia, Carlos 
Mendoza, both confirmed that Venezuela bought Russian 
helicopters; the first 10 of which are to be delivered to 
Venezuela before the end of 2004 rather than by mid-2005 as 
previously reported.  In statements to the press, Rangel said 
the helicopter purchase for MI-17, MI-26 and MI-35 had been 
underway already and that at no time was the purpose of his 
trip to Moscow to sign arms contracts because, \"Arming the 
military is the Defense Ministry\'s responsibility.\"  Babich 
could not confirm if the helicopter contract had already been 
signed, but noted that a contract for 40-50 helicopters \"was 
going to happen.\"  Babich said he had no information about a 
contract for Russian fighter aircraft. 
 
---------------- 
Future Meetings 
---------------- 
 
7. (C)  A note from the Vice-President\'s office indicated 
that President Hugo Chavez would travel to Russia on November 
25-26 to sign the Cooperation Accord between the two 
countries in regards to energy, petroleum, education, 
military-technical and aerospace cooperation.  Babich 
confirmed the possibility of a Presidential visit and said 
that Russia would use the opportunity to agree on more 
specific cooperation goals rather than signing a general 
agreement as they did in the October joint declaration. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Now that the recall referendum is water under the 
bridge for the GoV, it is turning its attention to external 
relations beyond the confines of the Western Hemisphere.  The 
first major foray was Foreign Minister Jesus Perez\'s trip to 
Iran, India and China, now followed by Vice-President 
Rangel\'s visit to Russia.  Talks between Russia and Venezuela 
languished during the nearly two years of pre-referendum 
political turmoil with the exception of a brief stop-over by 
then Foreign Minister Ivanov in December 2003 followed by an 
equally brief visit by Vice-President Vladimir Yakovlev in 
January 2004.  Although there appear to be a number of big 
ticket economic items on the agenda, the helicopter deal has 
garnered the most public attention, and paves the way for a 
broader military-to-military relationship between the 
countries.  The Rangel vist--and the inclusion of three 
Venezuelan Air Force generals in the delegation--will, along 
with the helo deal fuel speculation about Venezuela\'s 
procurement from Russia of advanced fighter aircraft.  For 
the time being only the helicopter purchase appears to be a 
reality.

Summary

1. (U) A fire ripped through 20 floors of the East Tower of 
Caracas\' Parque Central complex the night of October 16.  No 
one was killed, but the top third of the building was 
completely burned and the tower is unusable.  Finger pointing 
to place the blame for the fire began immediately between the 
federal and city governments and a number of competing 
conspiracy theories are also making the rounds.  The tower 
housed offices of a number of government ministries, 
including the Ministries of Infrastructure, Agriculture, and 
Production and Commerce.  The offices of the civil aviation 
and ports and merchant marine institutes were also affected. 
A number of important data bases, including those relating to 
civil aviation, have been destroyed and, reportedly, no back 
up exists.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Fire Causes Extensive Damage 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On October 17, a fire gutted the top 20 floors of the 
56-floor East Tower of the Parque Central complex in downtown 
Caracas.  These twin towers are the tallest buildings in 
South America.  Dozens of firefighters were injured fighting 
the blaze, but no one was killed.  The origins of the fire 
are still unclear, but according to the Caracas Fire Chief, 
the prevailing thought is that it began with an electrical 
short-circuit. It took the fire department 20 hours to bring 
the fire under control, in part because of a complete failure 
of the sprinkler system. 
 
---------------- 
Who Is To Blame? 
---------------- 
 
3. (U) The blame game began immediately with President Chavez 
taking the lead during his weekly national broadcast on 
October 17.  The politically appointed head of the Centro 
Simon Bolivar (CSB)--which administers the Parque 
Central--accused the fire department of incompetence.  The 
head of the Caracas fire department, which reports to 
opposition mayor Alfredo Pena, blamed the extensive 
destruction on badly maintained fire suppression equipment in 
the building, and said the problems with the building 
electrical system had been brought up in several meetings 
with the CSB.  Conspiracy theories tied to the government 
offices located on the floors where the fire is supposed to 
have started have also started making the rounds.  These 
include allegations that the fire was started to hide the use 
of computers in electoral fraud on August 15 or to mask 
corruption in the management of the car title registry for 
the City of Caracas. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Multiple Government Offices Affected 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The East Tower was home to numerous government 
offices, including those of the Ministry of Infrastructure, 
INAC (The Institute of Civil Aviation), INEA (the agency that 
regulates the ports and merchant marines), the Caracas 
Automobile Registry, the Ministry of Production and Commerce, 
and the Ministry of Agriculture.  Many offices in the top 
third of the building, such as those of INAC, which was 
located on the floor where the fire started, were completely 
destroyed.  Others on lower floors suffered extensive smoke 
and water damage.  The full extent of the structural damage 
to the building is not yet known nor whether it can be 
reoccupied.  In the meantime, ministry workers have been 
relocated throughout the city. 
 
5. (U) The Venezuelan Council of Ministers has extended a 
\"declaration of emergency\" for the affected offices which 
reportedly enables better resource sharing among ministries 
and allocates limited additional financial resources. 
Meetings that were to be held by the Economic Section with 
both INAC and INAPESCA (The National Fisheries Institute) 
have not been canceled, merely relocated.  The Agriculture 
Ministry plans to be fully operational in a temporary 
location within the next two weeks, and claims that most 
essential functions will only be temporarily slowed.  The 
 
 
Minister of Agriculture claims that, though the data and 
servers which housed ministry records were not damaged, it 
will take some time to gain access to the data.  As a result, 
certain activities such as the issuance of animal import 
permits have been suspended. 
 
---------------- 
Loss of Records 
---------------- 
 
6. (U) The \'planoteca,\' the nation-wide archive of blueprints 
and plans for public buildings and infrastructure, was 
destroyed according to news reports.  As well, the office of 
Setra, which housed the records for automobile, truck and bus 
licenses and vehicle titles registered in Caracas, was 
completely incinerated.  Contacts in INAC and INEA have told 
us informally that their record loss (both electronic and 
paper) is extensive and may include airport and port 
blueprints and diagrams and the civil aviation registry. 
Also affected are pilot, mechanic, and air traffic controller 
licenses; medical certificates; and airline certification 
documents.  Even those offices that were not affected by the 
fire have extensive loss of records due to water damage.  We 
understand that few, if any, of these records had backup 
copies maintained elsewhere.  The government, however, is 
claiming that unofficial copies of various documents exist 
throughout the country. 
 
------------------------ 
Investigations Underway 
------------------------ 
7. (U) During his October 17 address President Chavez called 
for a comprehensive investigation into both the cause of the 
blaze and the problems that occurred in controlling the fire. 
 On October 19, the administration created a \'High Level 
Committee\' to evaluate the situation.  This committee has 
thus far focused solely on recovery plans for the building 
and damage assessments.  A preliminary report presented to 
President Chavez on October 20 recommends the demolition of 
the 22 most damaged floors of the tower.  According to 
statements by Infrastructure Minister Ramon Carrizalez, the 
fire and its aftermath have been declared a \'state problem\' 
which expands the scope of the committee\'s work to include 
nearby residential and commercial buildings in addition to 
the state offices.  Carrizalez has also said that the 
committee will be investigating \"every public building\" to 
prevent similar incidents from happening. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
8. (U) Since the Parque Central fire occurred on a weekend, a 
significant human tragedy was avoided. The extent of the 
property damage and other losses is not yet known, but some 
important governmental functions will undoubtedly be 
seriously affected.  Despite calls for investigations into 
the systemic failures that contributed to the extensive 
damage of the Parque Central fire, government action thus far 
appears to be deflected away from the CSB which managed the 
building and toward establishing additional bureaucracies 
with loosely defined public mandates--hardly a recipe for 
expediency and success.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) On October 13 a court in Tachira State convicted 
eight persons on charges of rebellion in relation to the 
events of April 2002. The court found on of the original nine 
defendants not guilty, and five of them are free one 
probation. On October 11 a military court convicted retired 
Army Gen. Francisco Uson for insulting the Armed Forces and 
sentenced him to five and a half years in prison. Journalist 
Ovidio Rodriguez, professionally known as Napoleon Bravo, who 
faces charges for disparaging comments about the Supreme 
Court he made on his television program, testified October 13 
before the prosecutor leading the investigation. End Summary 
 
---------------- 
Tachira 8 Guilty 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U) The trial against nine political leaders in Tachira 
State for civil rebellion ended at midnight October 13, when 
the court found eight of the defendants guilty of civil 
rebellion, and freed one, Wilfredo Tovar. The court sentenced 
three of the defendants, Saul Lozano, Orlando Pantaleon and 
Danny Ramirez, to six years in jail and five others, Elsy 
Marquez de Pena, Jacobo Supelano, Jose Neira Celis, and Omar 
Guillen, to three years. The judge, Gerson Nino, granted the 
latter five probation, and they were set free on October 15. 
They may not leave Tachira State, may not speak to the media, 
and may not participate in political demonstrations. 
 
3.  (U) The case against the Tachira 9 stems from 
disturbances in front of the Governor\'s offices in Tachira on 
April 12, when a mob allegedly attacked Tachira Governor 
Ronald Blanco La Cruz to forcibly remove him from office. At 
the time the Governor was meeting with military and political 
leaders to decide what steps to take, following Chavez 
apparent resignation. Witnesses have described a confused 
situation, aggravated when military officers withdrew support 
from Blanco La Cruz, and allowed part of the mob into the 
Governor\'s mansion. The defense concentrated its argument on 
the question of whether the defendants led the crowd, or 
tried to restrain it. There are approximately 40 additional 
persons in Tachira who have formal investigations open 
against them for the same incident, including one general and 
several politicians. During testimony Blanco La Cruz 
testified that the persons most responsible for the crime 
were not on trial. 
 
------------------ 
Defense Complaints 
------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Defense lawyer Carlos Bastidas told PolOff October 18 
that the case was a political vendetta for humiliating 
Governor Blanco La Cruz, who he called a close Chavez ally 
and possible successor. Bastidas asserted that the judges 
delayed the trial 16 months, allowing the defendants to 
languish in pre-trial detention, acting under pressure from 
Blanco La Cruz and the prosecutors. Bastidas claimed that the 
trial would not have begun at all if the Supreme Court had 
not ordered Judge Nino to begin. He also noted that the 
motion to the Tachira State Appeals Court to release the 
detainees has not been ruled on after 14 months, though the 
court had a legal obligation to respond in 30 days. 
 
5.  (C) Bastidas said he suspects that prosecutors unfairly 
pressured the two lay judges hearing the case. The first 
group of lay judges was dismissed after prosecutors claimed a 
witness, now being investigated by prosecutors, reported a 
bribery attempt, according to Bastidas. Bastidas said he had 
a text message from one of the lay judges saying she was 
being pressured on the case. Bastidas also claimed that the 
witnesses for the prosecution met with the head of the 
Tachira court system prior to testifying, and were coached. 
He said the court ran the trial well, but that the judges 
only took into consideration the witnesses who worked for the 
government of Tachira State, ignoring defense testimony from 
deputies, generals, and police officers. He said he has some 
hope the Supreme Court Penal Chamber may eventually overturn 
the convictions. 
 
--------- 
Reactions 
--------- 
 
6.  (C) Following his release, William Tovar made a public 
plea for President Chavez to pardon the eight persons 
convicted. He said it was time for Chavez to use his position 
to call for peace and reconciliation in the country. Liliana 
Ortega, of the human rights group COFAVIC, told PolOff 
October 14 that the decision \"makes crimes against the 
majesty of elected officials more serious than crimes against 
humanity or human rights violations.\" Sergio Omar Calderon, 
the main opposition candidate for governor of Tachira in 
upcoming regional elections, called the sentence 
\"unbelievable\" because, \"everyone knows that there was no 
civil rebellion here.\" 
 
------------------- 
General Uson Guilty 
------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Separately, a military court found retired Army 
General Francisco Uson, former Minister of Finance, guilty on 
October 11 of insulting the armed forces , and sentenced him 
to five and a half years in prison. The charges stem from 
comments Gen. Uson made in a television interview in relation 
to the Fuerte Mara case of March 2004. In that case, eight 
soldiers received serious burns while in a punishment cell in 
Fuerte Mara, Zulia. Two later died. Gen. Uson responded to a 
journalist\'s questions about how a flame-thrower worked, and 
explained the procedures for signing one out, after 
journalist Patricia Poleo alleged a flame-thrower had been 
used to burn the soldiers. 
 
8.  (C) Uson\'s defense lawyer, Gonzalo Himiob, told PolOff 
October 15 that the prosecutors\' evidence had consisted of an 
edited version of the interview, which he said manipulated 
what Uson said. Other evidence presented, he asserted, was 
irrelevant or counterproductive to the prosecution, while 
none of the defense witnesses was challenged by the 
prosecution. Himiob also asserted that the trial was closed 
to prevent the public from witnessing the weakness of the 
prosecution case. He said he believed Minister of Defense 
Gen. Jorge Garcia Carneiro ordered the judge to convict Uson, 
but had no evidence. Himiob said the conviction sent a 
message to the Armed Forces that those who spoke out against 
the GOV would be jailed. He also said the respect Uson 
commanded within the Armed Forces, and his inside knowledge 
of Chavismo made him dangerous for the GOV. Himiob said they 
would appeal, but had no hope of success. 
 
9.  (C) Himiob said he disagreed with arguments that Uson 
should have been tried in a civilian court. Several 
commentators, including Bastidas, have argued in the press 
that since Uson was retired, military courts did not have 
jurisdiction over him. Himiob told PolOff that military 
officers are always under military jurisdiction, whether 
active or retired. He also said that conditions in the Ramo 
Verde military prison were much superior to those in civilian 
prisons, and that, due to his rank, he received excellent 
treatment. Given how long Gen. Uson may be in prison, Himiob 
said he preferred to keep the case in the military courts, 
despite his claim that Gen. Garcia Carneiro had imposed a 
guilty verdict. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Accusations Against Military Courts 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Captain Alfredo Hernandez Osorio received the Uson 
case in his military control court in Caracas, on May 22. He 
sent it to the military appeals court because Uson was a 
general, and thus had to be tried there. The President of the 
appeals court rejected the case, and sent it back to another 
military control judge. On May 23 Capt. Hernandez was 
arrested, and, he alleges, taken to Minister of Defense Gen. 
Jorge Garcia Carneiro. Hernandez told PolOff that the 
Minister screamed at him, \"The rule of law is bullshit, this 
is not juridical, its political!\" The next day he was fired, 
together with four other judges. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Napoleon Bravo Called to Account 
-------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U) On October 13 journalist Ovidio Rodriguez, 
 
professionally known as Napoleon Bravo, testified before 
prosecutor Luisa Ortega for four hours in relation to 
statements he made about the Supreme Court, in which he 
suggested the building would be better used as a house of 
prostitution. No formal investigation has yet been opened 
against Rodriguez. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) The conviction of 8 members of the Tachira 9 is 
important for the GOV\'s strategy of giving a juridical base 
to its claims that the opposition are coupsters. The GOV is 
anxious to force the current opposition leadership out, and 
bring in  a \"loyal\" opposition. The Tachira convictions will 
send a shiver through the 400 persons in the sights of 
prosecutor Danilo Anderson for the  \"Carmona decree.\" 
 
13.  (C) The Uson conviction is a serious blow to freedom of 
expression, especially by ex-military officers. Uson has been 
convicted of insulting a public institution based on 
technical responses to a journalist\'s questions. The 
conviction also sends a message to those retired officers who 
play an important role in the opposition, and the \"traitors\" 
such as Bolivar State Gov. Antonio Rojas Suarez, who Chavez 
says have abandoned the revolution. Calling Rodriguez in to 
testify for allegedly insulting the Supreme Court reinforces 
the message that words have judicial consequences when 
directed against the institutions of the Venezuelan state.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES BILATERAL AGENDA 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Abelardo A. Arias for 
reason 1.4 (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s Ambassador to the U.S. Bernardo Alvarez_ 
told us October 18 he is amenable to meeting with National 
Endowment for Democracy (NED) President Carl Gershman to 
discuss GoV perspectives regarding NED support to NGOs such 
as Sumate.  In a breakfast meeting with Ambassador and 
PolCouns, Alvarez_ also welcomed the Ambassador\'s offer to 
begin discussion of ideas for an agenda for possible 
bilateral discussions.  The Ambassador noted that better 
communication can help with issues such as the Sumate 
controversy or trafficking in persons.  Alvarez_ highlighted 
the cooperation on the case of the Venezuelan soldiers 
seeking asylum whose extradition has been requested as a sign 
of how an issue can be handled positively.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The Ambassador and Venezuela\'s Ambassador to the U.S. 
Bernardo Alvarez_ met over breakfast at the Residence October 
18.  PolCouns and MFA Director General Temir Porras 
accompanied the Ambassadors. 
 
3.  (C) Discussing the case against the NGO Sumate, Alvarez_ 
told the Ambassador that he had received a letter from 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED) President Carl 
Gershman prior to leaving Washington requesting a meeting. 
Alvarez_ said he was amenable to such a meeting to help 
resolve the controversy over NED funding for Venezuelan NGOs. 
 The Ambassador encouraged Alvarez_ to speak with Gershman as 
soon as he returned.  Having such a meeting, the Ambassador 
emphasized, would be an important first step, especially 
since the GoV could expect more Washington attention to the 
Sumate case.  Alvarez_ acknowledged that the GoV\'s pursuit of 
the Sumate is costing him some of the ground he has gained 
for the GoV in Washington. 
 
4.  (C) Alvarez_ told the Ambassador that, unlike USAID 
activities which focus on reconciliation, the NED\'s $1 
million funding of activities in Venezuela since April 2002 
has been directed at undermining the GoV.  He warned that 
researchers looking into the activities are tracing the links 
of government opponents to the NED and then the Department of 
State.  Alvarez_ asked rhetorically whether it is not against 
U.S. law for organizations to receive funding for political 
reasons.  (The Ambassador told Alvarez_ he believed our only 
restrictions relate specifically to election campaign 
funding.)  He said he ensures that \"his people\" maintain 
meticulous records to comply with the Foreign Agents 
Registration Act. 
 
----------------------------- 
Pursuing the Bilateral Agenda 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The two Ambassadors agreed that it is important to 
find avenues to improve communications between our two 
governments.  The Ambassador offered to put together for 
Alvarez_ a list of possible points for discussion which the 
Venezuelans could consider and amend.  Once we have agreement 
on the list of points here, the Ambassador said, he would 
then propose them to Washington.  Determining whether or at 
what level the discussions would take place would follow, he 
told Alvarez_. 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador noted that what occurred with the 
trafficking in persons report, and subsequent sanctions, is 
an example of the need for better communication.  He told 
Alvarez_ that we understand that the GoV may have been 
otherwise preoccupied between June and August, but now the 
effects were being felt as with the World Bank loan for 
Venezuela\'s judiciary. 
 
7.  (C) Alvarez_ noted that recent developments in the case of 
the two Venezuelan soldiers (who sought asylum in the U.S. 
and whose extradition the GoV has requested) were a sign of 
how the two sides can handle an issue positively.  Alvarez_ 
added that we \"could expect paper\" on (the extradition) of 
Robert Alonso soon.  (Note:  The GoV has charged Alonso in 
the case of the alleged Colombian paramilitaries who 
reportedly were poised to attack Caracas earlier this year.) 
Alvarez_ also suggested that the GoV would like to move to 
 
conclude the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) Alvarez_ was clear that the GoV would like to pursue 
talks with us.  He accepted that there are areas where we are 
not going to find common ground, but is willing to test the 
waters in others.  As for Sumate and NED, he gave no 
indication that the GoV would relent.  To the contrary, 
taking note of his warning about the work of researchers, 
there is more in store, including the possibility of gambling 
on making Sumate\'s Maria Corina Machado a martyr.  While some 
parts of the GoV may attempt to disassociate themselves from 
aspersions cast against U.S. institutions and the USG, we do 
not expect them to bring them to a halt.

1. The lead editorial in the 10/22 edition of very pro- 
Chavez daily DIARIO VEA, signed by editor Guillermo Garcia

2. DIARIO VEA (pro-government, circ. 25,000) 
10/22 lead editorial headline: \"The Robbery of the Century\" 
 
Selected Quotes: \"George Bush\'s fall in the opinion 
polls.has created a fear among many American that the 
rightist-fundamentalists will put into effect new 
machinations in order to repeat the election fraud of 
November 7, 2000.  That was no fraud but rather a scandalous 
robbery.  Bush\'s friends paid to have all voters `suspected\' 
of having a criminal record scrubbed from the voter list in 
Florida.  At one stroke George Bush\'s brother, Jeb Bush, the 
governor of Florida, eliminated thousands of Democratic 
Party voters, 173,000 to be exact.  Among these were those 
who had already completed their sentences or who had 
committed crimes such as illegal parking or marijuana 
possession. 
\"Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, lost his advantage due 
to the cheating and falsifications carried out by George W.

cleared the way for the occupation of the White House by the 
interests of the American ultra-right and their policy of 
`permanent war.\'

COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. The Chavez administration and the Chavistas have been 
stung by the continuous opposition claims of fraud in the 
August 15 referendum and the opposition\'s belief that the 
October 31 regional elections will be marred by fraud.  This 
editorial is making the concealed point that the United 
States is in no position to judge voter fraud in Venezuela. 
In his most recent \"Alo Presidente\" TV program, Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez said \"the people of the United States 
will decide [the presidential elections], at least I hope 
that it will be the people of the United States that 
decide.\"    End Comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Coordinadora Democratica issued on October 12 its 
second report on alleged electoral fraud in the August 15 
recall referendum on President Hugo Chavez.  Using 
statistical analyses, the report alleges that some 2.5 
million votes were manipulated during the referendum to 
reverse what should have been an opposition victory.  The 
report documents irregular patterns in data transmission in 
voting machines where Chavez won, implying that the National 
Electoral Council (CNE) remotely changed the votes recorded 
on the machines.  In presenting the Coordinadora report, 
legal expert Tulio Alvarez accused the GOV of planning to 
commit similar fraud in the October 31 regional elections. 
The Coordinadora\'s strategy is to continue issuing reports in 
the hope of smoking out proof positive of the GOV\'s 
complicity.  The report is not conclusive and works against 
the opposition parties\' efforts to boost voter participation 
in the upcoming elections.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
The Second Report:  More Statistics, and Data Transmission 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2. (U) The Coordinadora Democratica released on October 12 
the first official report on fraud in the August 15 recall 
referendum on President Hugo Chavez (The September 8 report 
was \"preliminary.\"  See ref a).  The report gives results of 
statistical studies carried out by academics at several 
Venezuelan universities.  Comparing individual machine 
results to results at the level of states and \"parrochias\" (a 
political subdivision below a municipality), the academics 
concluded that nearly half of voting machines deviated from 
the voting patterns of the areas in which they were located. 
These irregularities correspond to 2.5 million votes.  The 
academics claimed that if the alleged manipulation had not 
occurred, the \"Si\" votes against Chavez would have won 60% to 
40% (The official results were the converse, with the 
opposition losing 40% to 60%).  Another study applying 
\"Benford\'s law,\" a mathematical method for detecting numbers 
fraud, to both manual and automated voting centers suggested 
the Si votes won 55% to 45%.  The academics also concluded 
that both referendum audit samples (including the one 
overseen by the Carter Center) were not representative of the 
universe of voting machines. 
 
3. (U) The report gives results of a study of election day 
data transmission between the National Electoral Council 
(CNE) server and the voting machines over the network 
operated by private telephone carrier CANTV.  The 
Coordinadora contends the CNE server and the voting machines 
shared more two-way data than was originally claimed 
(Smartmatic officials had asserted that two-way transmissions 
were limited to the security protocol handshake).  Studying 
network logs, however, Coordinadora investigators discovered 
higher-than-normal levels of data transmission in 52% of 
voting machines.  In these machines, the report alleges, the 
incidence of \"No\" votes (in favor of Chavez) was much higher 
than the voting machines with normal transmission logs.  The 
implication is that the CNE was able to re-program half the 
voting machines to give Chavez the numerical advantage. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Alvarez Backs Abstention, Rattles Sabers With Military 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4. (C) Legal expert Tulio Alvarez (ref a), who is 
coordinating the Coordinadora\'s fraud documentation efforts, 
delivered the report during an opposition event on October 12 
attended by poloff.  Alvarez repeated his allegation that the 
CNE had committed fraud in the electoral registry and had not 
repaired the voter rolls for the October 31 elections for 
governors and mayors.  Alvarez claimed that the mere 
manipulation of the electoral registry will result in a loss 
for Chavez opponents in all governorships (including the 
 
 
mayor of Caracas district) and 106 mayoralties.  He concluded 
by saying that any opposition politician who goes to the 
regional elections will be guilty of \"validating the August 
15 fraud.\"  Coordinadora representatives later told poloff 
that Alvarez went beyond what was agreed. 
 
5. (C) Alvarez also alleged during his speech that the 
military was involved in the referendum fraud.  Alvarez 
showed a video of a supposed telecommunications network 
control center operated by the military that was reportedly 
used to carry out the fraud.  Alvarez named four mid-level 
military officers who, he alleged, have firsthand knowledge 
of the fraud.  Coordinadora representative D\'lsa Solorzano 
told poloff October 25 the video had come just a day before 
the Coordinadora event from an undisclosed source in the 
military.  (Comment:  The film appeared to be a video 
inventory of a telecommunications network control room. 
There were no obvious indications that the control room was 
related to either the military or the elections.  End 
comment.) 
 
6. (C) Alvarez reiterated to PolCouns October 21 that the 
opposition is headed into a crushing electoral defeat because 
of the fraud.  Alvarez said he had presented the information 
to Accion Democratica functionaries, who told him the party 
planned to pursue elections in spite of the likelihood of 
fraud.  Alvarez said he believes the referendum fraud is not 
confined to a handful of people, but also includes employees 
of Smartmatic and some unspecified foreign consultants. 
Solorzano told poloff that new information is constantly 
being passed to the Coordinadora from sources within the CNE, 
Smartmatic, and the military.  She said the Coordinadora 
plans to issue two more reports at monthly intervals to spur 
those with knowledge of the alleged fraud to come forward. 
 
----------------------- 
Legal Remedies Languish 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Solorzano, the Coordinadora\'s legal representative, 
also told poloff that the CNE\'s rejection of her appeal of 
the referendum results out of hand on September 23 violated 
electoral law (ref b). She asserted that the law requires the 
CNE to admit the appeal and then request within five days the 
required proofs from the appellant.  Instead, Solorzano said, 
the CNE tossed out the appeal for lack of evidence.  She said 
she faced a similar legal paradox at the Supreme Court (TSJ) 
when immediately after the referendum she petitioned for an 
injunction to force the CNE to turn over copies of electoral 
documents.  Instead of deciding on the injunction within the 
48 hours as stipulated in the law, the Court waited more than 
a month to deny her motion on the grounds that the deadline 
for challenging the CNE decision had already passed. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The substance of the Alvarez report is intriguing to 
the interested observer for its revelations about the two-way 
transmissions, but it fails to go beyond the circumstantial. 
The report has political relevance for the regional 
elections, as opposition parties are desperate to get their 
already fatigued and disappointed supporters to the polls. 
Alvarez\'s prophecy of another massive fraud on October 31 is 
clearly counterproductive to these efforts.

1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero declared October 19 that only 2.1% of Venezuelan 
voters registered did not have addresses.  Opposition 
leaders, who had alleged that more than a million persons did 
not meet the legal requirement of having an address, 
challenged the CNE to make the electoral registry public and 
open it for scrutiny.  Preparing for the October 31 
elections, the CNE increased the number of voting centers, 
voting tables, and electronic voting machines and decreased 
the number of voting table workers.  There will be no 
international observers like the Carter Center, Organization 
of American States (OAS), and the European Union. 
Abstentions are the chief obstacle to the opposition, which 
has a lot riding on these elections.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
The Electoral Registry 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) A committee of Governors and Mayors complained to the 
National Electoral Council (CNE) on October 13 that more than 
1.8 million new voters in the electoral register do not have 
addresses listed in the register as required by electoral 
law.  On October 19 CNE President, Francisco Carrasquero, 
publicly and vehemently contradicted the claim during a press 
conference.  He insisted the CNE technical committee found 
40,283 Qters without addresses by cross-checking voter 
information.  Asserting that only 2.1% of the people the 
opposition produced as \"proof of fraud\" were without 
addresses, Carrasquero demanded that the opposition respect 
the CNE and desist trying to prevent or delay the regional 
elections, which he insisted would go forward on October 31. 
 
3. (U) Primero Justicia President and National Assembly 
Deputy, Julio Borges, said that if the CNE were as 
transparent as it claimed to be the electoral registry would 
have been posted publicly so all Venezuelans could review it 
and denounce inconsistencies or incorrect information. 
Instead, Borges said, the CNE has kept the registry hidden 
and made a spectacle of having one journalist \"check\" the 
notebooks during the press conference October 19.  (Note: By 
law, the CNE is required to publish the official electoral 
registry and open it for voters to dispute incorrect 
information, but it has not done so.)  Primero Justicia and 
other political parties have petitioned the Supreme Court 
(TSJ) to annul the electoral registry or to call for its 
complete review before regional elections. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
More Centers, More Tables, More People, More Time... 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4. (U) To reduce the amount of time it takes to vote before 
the regional elections, the CNE created 572 additional voting 
centers.  The CNE also increased and redistributed the number 
of voting tables (28,617 total) and electronic voting 
machines (23,595) to be used.  The National Electoral Board 
(JNE) selected 194,242 new poll workers to correspond to the 
voting table and voting center increases.  With time running 
short, the CNE decided that voters whose voting center has 
changed would be notified on Election Day when they arrived 
at their previously assigned voting location. 
 
5. (C) The CNE organized training sessions for poll workers 
October 4-7.  According to the poll worker-training manual, 3 
principal poll workers and a secretary will run each voting 
table, rather than by the 5 workers the law calls for.  Each 
voting center will also include a \"coordinator\", newly 
appointed by the CNE.  (Note: There are no provisions in the 
electoral law for this type of official.)  At centers with 
electronic voting machines, after the voting finishes and 
polls close, the results are to be transmitted, and then a 
vote count document is to be printed.  CNE director Jorge 
Rodriguez told reporters October 18 that the Governors and 
Mayors Committee had agreed to a post-election audit that 
 
 
would allow voting table members to count the ballots when 
voting ended. The Governors and Mayors contradicted 
Rodriguez. 
 
6. (U) In preparation for October 31, the CNE conducted a 
voting simulation October 10.  The results gave rise to 
worries that the increase in centers and redistribution of 
tables would not be enough to compensate for the time needed 
per voter to cast a ballot. 
 
----------- 
CNE Changes 
----------- 
 
7. (U) On September 27, Director Ezequiel Zamora resigned 
from the CNE because of differences with the majority. 
During an October 19 press conference, CNE President 
Carrasquero urged the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme 
Court to examine Director Sobella Mejias\' political actions 
and \"take action accordingly.\"  Mejias was acting as a 
political agent rather than neutral election official and 
distorting figures, according to Carrasquero.  Mejias had 
complained about alleged irregularities in the electoral 
register and insisted on a complete review. 
 
--------------- 
The Legalities 
--------------- 
 
8. (U) The NGO Sumate asked Venezuela\'s Supreme Court to 
suspend the regional elections because of the violations of 
the Electoral Law.  The illegalities Sumate alleges include: 
the CNE did not publish the public notice for regional 
elections that should have been published six months ahead of 
the elections; irregularities with the electoral registry 
that were denounced were not resolved; specifications for the 
technical audits have not been approved; the General 
Electoral Rules have not been approved nor published; the 
electronic voting machines have not been properly tested, 
stored, or guarded; there are no representatives or witnesses 
from different organizations at the different levels of the 
electoral process; and the CNE Directorate is still one 
member short since no official has been named to replace 
Ezequiel Zamora. 
 
----------------------- 
International Observers 
----------------------- 
 
9. (U) In early October, the CNE issued invitations to some 
international observers. The Carter Center declined the 
invitation citing lack of time and resources to adequately 
observe, and the lack of confidence in their ability by 
political actors.  The Organization of American States (OAS) 
also declined saying there was insufficient time to prepare 
an election observation team.  The European Union will not be 
sending an observation team.  (Comment:  We believe the 
invitations were for show, since the CNE knows well the 
Carter Center and OAS and EU requirements to mount an 
observation.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The CNE declaration that the electoral registry is 
not a problem as the opposition claims comes as no surprise, 
and Carrasquero\'s statement about Mejias \"political actions\" 
is irony at its best.  The opposition\'s and Sumate\'s court 
challenge will languish as it is unlikely that the Supreme 
Court will issue any decision to contradict the CNE before 
the regional elections.  Predictions of low turnout by 
opposition voters are likely being exacerbated by the CNE\'s 
continuing and public disregard for what the opposition 
claims are unequal and illegal voting conditions. 
 
11. (C) The main challenge the opposition faces is 
abstentionism, some of it fueled by opposition leaders\' 
statements after the 8/15 referendum.  Having questioned the 
fairness of the CNE, it is harder for them to convince voters 
to stand in line again to vote.  The regional races remain 
important, both in terms of giving the opposition authority 
and resources, and in terms of developing future leaders.

-------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Candidates are battling against voter apathy for 
gubernatorial, mayoral, and state legislative positions in 
the oil-rich Anzoategui State, currently controlled by the 
opposition.  The administration\'s candidate, National 
Assembly deputy Tarek William Saab, is close to President 
Hugo Chavez and is a vociferous critic of the USG.  The 
opposition\'s eleventh-hour candidate, mayor Antonio Barreto 
Sira, is popular and charismatic.  The opposition, however, 
will have to rebound quickly from its divisions and 
reputation for poor leadership at the state and local levels 
to be competitive on October 31.  Suspicion of fraud may nail 
the opposition\'s coffin by keeping their voters away from the 
polls, leaving a hard-core Chavez supporter as governor in a 
strategic state.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
Atmospherics 
------------ 
 
2.  (U)  Intense campaigning marks the oil-rich but 
underdeveloped Anzoategui State, in which the opposition 
controls the state government and 12 of 21 mayoralties. 
Propaganda litters the streets, signposts, and newspapers of 
the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz corridor, which contains over 
half of the state\'s 1.4 million inhabitants.  In 
advertisements for President Hugo Chavez\'s favored 
candidates, Chavez\'s face is ubiquitous.  At a Chavista rally 
site, activists wearing red gather all day and celebrate at 
night.  Opposition supporters clad in political t-shirts 
distribute campaign literature at roadside stands and at red 
lights.  While Chavista and opposition activists are so 
polarized that they rarely associate with each other, most 
state residents lack confidence in all politicians, according 
to government, business, and academic officials. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Gubernatorial Candidates 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Chavez\'s candidate is National Assembly deputy Tarek 
William Saab Halabi (MVR), an outspoken critic of the USG who 
has made a national issue out of his revoked US visa.  Saab, 
of Lebanese extraction, was denied a visa in 1997 because of 
his links to terrorist activities.  He also violated the 
terms of a 2000 waiver he received for an official visit to 
Washington.  A former human rights lawyer and poet, Saab won 
the trust of the President when he visited Hugo Chavez in 
prison in 1992.  Saab hails from the city of El Tigre in 
central Anzoategui and returns from Caracas on the weekends 
to campaign.  His campaign cites the \"North American Opinion\" 
polling firm\'s report that he has the support of 67.5 percent 
of the state. 
 
4.  (U)  Opposition candidate Antonio Barreto Sira (AD) is a 
longtime politician and the popular mayor of Freites, the 
fifth-most populous of Anzoategui\'s 21 municipalities.  (The 
opposition currently controls 12 of the 21 municipalities.) 
According to the host of a political television show on the 
local channel Telecaribe, the public \"is drawn\" to the 
charismatic Barreto.  State director of Primero Justicia 
Gustavo Marcano told PolOff Barreto\'s popularity in Freites 
stems from his construction of grandiose public works 
projects--including a ten-lane, olympic-sized swimming 
pool--with revenue contributed by oil companies.  According 
to the pollster \"Data Consult,\" Barreto Sira on October 24 
had a five percentage-point lead on Saab.  About 18 percent 
of those polled, however, remained undecided or failed to 
respond. 
 
------------------ 
Opposition Discord 
------------------ 
 
5.  (U)  The splintered opposition did not rally behind 
Barreto Sira until the night of the CNE-imposed October 21 
deadline to drop out of the race.  Candidates Barreto Sira 
and incumbent governor David de Lima--a former Chavista now 
affiliated with MAS--had agreed that they each would choose 
 
one firm to poll the public, and the least popular candidate 
would withdraw, according to National Assembly deputy Alfonso 
Marquina (AD).  On October 20, the press announced that both 
polls had picked Barreto Sira.  Meanwhile, David de Lima\'s 
secretary told the Embassy that the rivals were still 
 
SIPDIS 
negotiating behind closed doors.  According to the tabloid 
Tal Cual, De Lima decided to withdraw in exchange for AD\'s 
support for some undisclosed mayoral candidates. 
 
6.  (U)  In the local elections, each municipality has 
several candidates on the ballot, many of whom have chosen to 
stay in the race.  For example, there are 15 mayoral 
candidates in the opposition-dominated municipality of 
Urbaneja, including the state party leaders of Primero 
Justicia and COPEI.  Three of these 15 candidates are 
sympathetic to the administration, although in each case of 
such a divided \"oficialista\" ticket, Chavez\'s support for 
only one candidate is manifest. 
 
      ------------------------ 
      Opposition Mismanagement 
      ------------------------ 
 
      7.  (C)  The former head of Puerto La Cruz\'s chamber of 
commerce described de Lima to PolOff as a governor with few 
accomplishments.  De Lima\'s tourism director blamed 
\"political instability\" for the state\'s inability to attract 
vacationers, although the state, with stunning ocean and 
desert scenery in the north and the Orinoco River in the 
south, has significant potential.  On October 25, 120 police 
officers demanding unpaid benefits raided the governor\'s 
house, apprehended his bodyguards, and fired shots in the air 
to drive the intervening police chief from the scene.  The 
officers remain on strike. 
 
8.  (U)  Waste has characterized the term of office of 
Urbaneja\'s opposition mayor, who also has declined to seek 
reelection.  According to Primera Justica\'s Marcano, Urbaneja 
has a larger law enforcement budget than Caracas\'s Baruta 
municipality, yet its streets are unsafe. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  That Saab enjoys the support of 67.5 percent of the 
electorate in Anzoategui stretches the imagination. 
Abstention is likely to be high among sympathizers of Chavez 
and the opposition.  Nonetheless, Saab will likely carry the 
day because the specter of fraud will probably keep more 
opposition than pro-government voters away from the polls. 
And, Saab has been campaigning for nearly one year -- he has 
worked hard.  The opposition may also have trouble retaining 
a majority of the mayoralties.  End comment.

STATE 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Both sides in the race for governor of Bolivar State 
are confident their candidate will be elected in the regional 
elections on October 31.  Efficiency, rather than politics, 
is the main theme in the campaign, and both campaigns hope to 
draw supporters away from their opponent.  The GoV wants to 
defeat a former Chavista, and to control this important 
industrial area.  In conversations with PolOff the sides 
agreed that Gov. Antonio Rojas Suarez has been an effective 
administrator, and that Gen. Fernando Rangel Gomez, the 
Chavista candidate, has been an effective leader of the 
Corporacion Venezuelana de Guayana, the state owned 
industrial giant of the region.  Regional newspapers are 
split in their predictions. End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Rojas Suarez Optimistic 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) PolOff spoke with Bolivar State Governor Antonio 
Rojas Suarez, and State Secretary General Waldo Jose Negron 
October 25.  Rojas said that, based on daily tracking polls 
the tendency in favor of his reelection is irreversible.  He 
would not specify numbers, but explained that he expected 
significant support from Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) 
members and other backers of President Hugo Chavez.  Negron 
noted that Rojas Suarez had been the president of the state 
MVR until his 2003 break with Chavez.  He also said the MVR 
is divided in Puerto Ordaz, the largest city in the region, 
because the current MVR mayor is running for reelection 
without the party\'s support.  Rojas Suarez said Chavista 
support for Rojas Suarez would help offset the effect of 
abstention among hard core opposition supporters. 
 
3.  (C) Rojas Suarez said his administration had achievements 
to back up his campaign for reelection, including building 50 
schools, renovating 160, creating an integrated emergency 
dispatch system, a trauma hospital and a virtual library. 
Asked where the resources came from for all the projects, the 
Governor complained about central government disbursement 
delays, but noted that funds eventually arrive.  He said that 
to get the payments, governors have worked arrangements with 
local banks. 
 
4.  (C) Rojas Suarez said many voting centers in Bolivar were 
manual, due to their isolation, and that he had a strong lead 
in these districts.  As for the electronic voting centers, he 
said he had \"heard\" that the people in the barrios were going 
to demand that the voting boxes be opened.  He stressed that 
in contrast to the recall referendum, the regional elections 
have a law that specifically refers to counting the votes 
publicly. 
 
-------- 
Maisanta 
-------- 
 
5.  (C) Marco Rojas (a cousin of the Governor) of Chavez\' 
Comando Maisanta campaign, told PolOff October 26 that Gen. 
Francisco Rangel Gomez was leading 57% to 31% over Rojas.  He 
dismissed the support Rojas could expect among Chavista 
voters as \"insignificant\", while pointing to significant 
support for Rangel among businessmen in Bolivar.  He asserted 
that as head of the Corporacion Venezuelana de Guayana (CVG), 
Rangel had had extensive dealings with the business 
community, which was now translating into political support. 
Marco Rojas said the Governor had done a good job,  but had 
been unwilling to work with the CVG and the central 
government, even before breaking with Chavez.  He said 
Bolivar State would develop faster with three forces (state 
government, municipal government, and CVG) pushing in the 
same direction. 
 
6.  (C) Marco Rojas told PolOff that the Maisanta campaign 
was trying to prevent abstention, to give the elections 
legitimacy. He said they would work with the opposition to 
allay any suspicions, but only under the orders of the 
National Electoral Council (CNE). They would not support or 
allow the opening of all the voting boxes, alleging that it 
 
 
would take too much time, though he suggested that the two 
sides could reach an agreement on election day on which boxes 
to open. (Note: CNE rules do not allow for this.) 
 
--------------- 
Local Press POV 
--------------- 
 
7.  (C) Robinson Lizano, editor of the conservative Correo 
del Caroni, told PolOff October 25 that independent polls 
show Rojas Suarez with 26-7% of the vote, Rangel with 22-3%, 
and two other opposition candidates with 8% and 6% 
respectively.  He said the campaign was between two leaders 
with good administrative records.  Lizano noted that Rangel, 
while president of the CVG, had failed to solve Puerto Ordaz\' 
serious water problems, which are the responsibility of CVG, 
and that this could hurt him in the election.  He said the 
issue of Rojas Suarez\' break with Chavez has not been major 
campaign issues.  Chavez, Lizano said, also forgave Rojas 
Suarez after April 2002, and continued to work with him until 
2003.  Lizano alleged that Rangel was shamelessly using CVG 
resources to finance his campaign. 
 
8.  (C) Lizano said no leaders in the region had called for 
abstention.  Anecdotal evidence, however, indicated it would 
be very high among the middle and upper classes of Puerto 
Ordaz, he said.  Among the reporters on his staff, he 
estimated 20 of 25 would not vote.  Lizano estimated that 
abstention would be near the traditional 40%.  He said the 
two military leaders in the state, National Guard CORE 8 
Commander Gen. Alberto Betencourt Nieves, and 5th Jungle 
Division Commander Gen. Wilhelm Beccerra, were strong Chavez 
supporters, who would not hesitate to favor the Chavista 
candidate any way they could.  He said there were divisions 
in Chavismo in the region, in part over the substitution of 
the MVR candidate for mayor of Puerto Ordaz for a PPT 
candidate and over a fight for control of some unions in CVG, 
which might favor Chavista dissidents crossing over to Rojas 
Suarez.. 
 
9.  (C) Gerardo Gonzalez, head editor of the Nueva Prensa de 
Guayana, told PolOff October 25 that he believed the Chavista 
candidates would win the elections as a result of the high 
opposition abstention.  He said the Rojas Suarez government 
has a good reputation among Chavistas, while Rangel has the 
support of 40,000 employees of CVG who experienced his 
successful management, and the association with Chavez. 
Gonzalez said that the people of Bolivar State have learned 
that you get more resources if you are with the GOV, than if 
you are against it. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) Bolivar State seems unusually blessed to have two 
good managers to chose from on October 31.  As one would 
expect in a regional election, many local factors will play 
important roles in this race, including water, past 
achievements, and party divisions.  Despite complaints about 
fraud in the recall referendum, Rojas Suarez talked about the 
race in normal and political terms.  He seems confident that 
the electoral law gives the opposition much greater control 
than during the referendum. Rangel, for his part, is not a 
politician, and seems to have been chosen as a trustworthy 
stand-in for Chavez. That, and his record at CVG, make him a 
formidable challenger for a successful opposition governor. 
The key to the race will be whether Rojas Suarez can peel 
away enough Chavista support to offset middle class 
abstention.

Summary

1. (C) Political party representatives in Carabobo State each 
told Poloff October 21 that polls showed its candidate in the 
lead in the gubernatorial race, and in a majority of mayoral 
races.  Chavez\'s Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) representative 
asserted that Chavista candidates would sweep all the races 
on October 21.  Proyecto Venezuela dismissed COPEI and 
Primero Justicia concerns about the electoral registry, but 
joined in their worries about high abstention rates and 
possible violence if voters turned out but were not allowed 
to count paper ballots after polls closed.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Proyecto Venezuela\'s Solitary Can Do Attitude 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) Maria Eugenia Hands, Director of Communication for 
Proyecto Venezuela (PV) in Carabobo State, confident that 
current PV Governor Henrique Salas Feo would be reelected on 
October 31.  Hands told Poloff October 21 that current polls 
showed Salas Feo ahead of MVR candidate Luis Acosta Carles by 
about 30 points, and third party candidate Jose Gregorio Ruiz 
with no more than 5% of the vote.  A high abstention rate 
could hurt Salas Feo, Hands said so she qualified it as a 
\"close\" race.  Hands said PV was also likely to win four or 
five of the 13 mayoralties, while other opposition parties 
would probably win three.  Hands speculated that after the 
regional elections the divide between PV and the opposition 
could grow wider.  She pointed out that while many opposition 
parties supported Salas Feo for governor, for most the 
support was in name only. 
 
3. (C) Proyecto Venezuela was not concerned about the 
problems with the electoral registry, Hands noted, because 
the registry has always had problems.  Instead, she said, the 
party is worried about how the votes will be counted when 
polls close.  Hands said the PV campaign strategy is to 
MOTIVATE the middle class to vote, EDUCATE the lower class on 
how to use electronic voting machines, and have voters stay 
at the polls and GUARD their votes on election day. Hands 
asserted that the middle class in Carabobo were most likely 
to abstain because of conflicting messages and a sense of 
defeat from the \"stolen\" referendum.  While the middle class 
had to be motivated, Hands said, lower class voters were 
inexperienced with technology and needed to be educated on 
how to vote to make sure they did it correctly. 
 
---------------------- 
Full Steam Ahead: MVR 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) Movimiento Quinta Republica\'s (MVR) Secretary General 
for Carabobo State, Luis Medina told Poloff October 21 that 
the MVR has taken advantage of the opposition\'s weakness and 
their division and would continue to do so in the regional 
elections.  Medina asserted that MVR candidate Acosta Carles 
would become governor of Carabobo, and the MVR would sweep 
all 14 mayoralties.  (Note: Carabobo State has 14 
mayoralties; one of which is an administrative municipality 
and does not elect a mayor on October 31.)  Medina compared 
the opposition to spoiled children who if given concessions 
would continue to make more outrageous demands or claims. 
According to Medina, this showed it would be impossible to 
work with the opposition.  He said the CNE could not agree to 
the opposition\'s requests for fear of opening a floodgate of 
requests and challenges. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Chavez\'s Little Party That Could: Podemos 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) On October 21, poloff also met with Oscar Perez, 
Regional Secretary General of Carabobo State for Podemos. 
Perez asserted that Podemos was backing Chavista candidates 
in Carabobo and hoped to contribute 20% to the Chavista vote. 
 In the regional elections, Perez said, political parties 
were more important than in the referendum and were working 
 
 
in tandem with Comando Maisanta.  Perez predicted that 
Chavista candidates would win 9 of the 13 mayoralties and the 
gubernatorial race  Perez noted that according to four recent 
polls, MVR candidate Acosta Carles was ahead of Proyecto 
Venezuela\'s Salas Feo by seven points. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Reasons for Worry: COPEI and Primero Justicia 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) COPEI\'s Lucio Herrera and Hector Pinero told Poloff 
October 21 that while Proyecto Venezuela\'s Henrique Salas Feo 
was ahead by 10 points, his selfishness had cost him a 
stronger lead in the polls and the active support of other 
opposition parties.  If abstention rates are higher than 50%, 
Herrera said, then Salas Feo would probably lose the 
governor\'s race.  Herrera estimated that the opposition had a 
good chance of winning 7 of the 13 mayoralties, including 
Valencia, the state capital and largest city in Carabobo. 
Herrera and Pinero said they were concerned about the 
electoral registry and the conflicting message of fraud and 
abstentions that voters were receiving from different 
opposition political parties.  They pointed out that if 
opposition voters did go to the polls on election day, the 
possibility of violence was high unless the CNE instructed 
poll workers and the military guarding the polls to allow the 
people to observe the paper ballots being counted after the 
polls closed. 
 
7. (C) Local Primero Justicia representatives said Salas Feo 
was ahead in the polls by a small margin, and asserted that 
the opposition would win 7 of the 13 mayoralties.  They 
reiterated Proyecto Venezuela and COPEI concerns about 
conflicting messages, high abstention rates and possible 
violence if voters turned out to vote but were not allowed to 
observe paper ballots being counted after polls closed. 
Primero Justicia\'s Ruben Dario noted the importance of 
winning the gubernatorial race and the Valencia mayoralty to 
protect civil liberties and the right of the people to march 
in protest. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Despite some opposition concerns, political party 
representatives in Carabobo believe his/her favored candidate 
is doing well in a close race.  The most important factor, as 
they note, is the possible abstention, and one that will hurt 
candidates identified as opponents of President Hugo Chavez. 
Governor Henrique Salas Feo has a solid political base and 
the foundation incumbency provides.  His boorish chief rival, 
known for his televised burp during a controntation with a 
Coca Cola distributor, however, has struck a chord with lower 
class voters and fully enjoys the financial backing of the 
central government...a combination that may prove to be hard 
to beat.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The voting process for Venezuela\'s October 31 
regional elections is complicated.  In a process akin to the 
recall referendum, voters will elect governors, mayors, and 
state legislators.  Screens will have dozens of options, 
which are organized by political parties rather than by 
races.  The press has reported that the public did not take 
advantage of an opportunity to practice voting, and little 
personal attention will be available on election day, 
according to a CNE official.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Venezuelan voters who go to the polls on October 31 
will face an overly complicated process.  Voters must first 
present their identification card for identification in the 
electoral rolls.  Poll workers then will take their 
fingerprints next to a video monitor that continuously 
explains the voting process.  Next, CNE representatives will 
again explain the voting process and activate the voting 
machines.  After choosing from a veritable alphabet soup of 
candidates and parties, the electors will receive and deposit 
a physical ballot verifying their vote.  After dipping their 
fingers in indelible ink, the voters may leave the polling 
place. 
 
3.  (U)  From 8,509 candidates, Venezuelan voters will elect 
22 governors, 336 mayors, and 229 state legislators.  Each 
voter will have to choose at least four candidates, including 
a governor (except in the Federal District, whose chief 
executive is called \"mayor,\" and in Amazonas State), a 
municipal mayor, and state legislators.   Some of legislators 
are \"list deputies,\" meaning electors will select parties, 
which will receive portions of legislative seats roughly 
equal to their proportion of votes.  Voters will also choose 
\"nominal deputies\" individually. 
 
------------------- 
Ballots and Screens 
------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  Rather than organizing the voters\' options by each 
race, each district\'s electronic ballot will display numerous 
logos of political parties and independent candidates.  In 
Anzoategui state, for example, the ballot for governor and 
state legislators in one electoral district, or 
\"circunscripcion,\" has 62 logos.  Once voters press to choose 
a logo from the electronic ballot, candidates appear on their 
computer screen for selection.  Voters choose a chief 
executive, a \"party list,\" and a number of \"nominal\" 
legislative candidates for their district.  (Smaller 
districts only have one \"nominal\" candidate.)  Many parties 
do not have candidates for all the positions, so some voters 
will have to search for different logos before concluding 
their vote.  After completing this process, voters proceed to 
another electronic ballot to select a mayor for their 
municipality.  This ballot also displays myriad parties, many 
of which endorse the same candidate. 
 
5.  (U)  Candidates who have withdrawn from the race will 
still appear on the screens.  If the candidate withdrew 
before the October 21 deadline, the candidate\'s votes will go 
to a candidate he or she designates.  If the candidate 
dropped out afterwards, votes for him or her will not count. 
According to CNE director Jorge Rodriguez, 194 candidates 
have dropped out of the race nationwide. 
 
--------------------------- 
Inadequate Voter Assistance 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  The CNE sponsored a mock election October 10 to 
acquaint the public with the process, but few participated, 
according to press.  TV and radio have also had regular 
government-sponsored \"cadenas\" to explain the procedures. 
Despite the planned presence of explanatory videos at the 
polls, a CNE official in Anzoategui State told poloff that 
little personal attention would be available on election day. 
 The CNE has chosen local electoral officials by lot, and, 
according to the local official, many of those drafted have 
 
 
not responded.  Press reports add that in some states, few 
poll workers have appeared for training. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
7.  (C)  The voting process is slightly less complicated than 
programming a VCR, yet national CNE officials insist that it 
will work with minimal difficulties.  The staid CNE education 
campaign, concentrated in the use of ubiquitous \"cadenas\" 
which occupy the airwaves regularly at least three times a 
day, has become a droning noise that attracts little 
interest.

ADVOCATES 
 
REF: STATE 223273 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASON 1.4 (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Pushing to advance the \"revolution\" following the 
favorable outcome of the recall referendum, the GoV has made 
good on its promise to seek enactment of the \"Law of Social 
Responsibility in Radio and Television.\" The private media 
insist it\'s a significant step toward the muzzling of free 
expression, while the GoV claims the law aims to protect 
society, especially children, from inappropriate content. 
Amongst other effects, the law would regulate content and the 
television schedule, require large portions of daily 
programming to be produced by \"national independent 
producers\" (rather than the television stations or foreign 
producers), punish loosely-defined character defamation of 
public figures, regularly require airtime be ceded to the 
government, limit paid advertising and publicity, and levy a 
tax on the media to finance a \"Fund for Social 
Responsibility.\"  The law would back these requirements with 
the threat of fines and suspension or revocation of licenses. 
 The power to monitor, evaluate, and penalize would belong 
the National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL), a 
sub-agency of the Ministry of Infrastructure whose director 
is named by the President. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
PROVISIONS OF THE \"GAG LAW\" 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The draft law covers all forms of broadcast media. 
Included are: \"open\" broadcast television (VHF and UHF), 
\"open\" radio (FM, AM, and community radio), and subscription 
television (cable and satellite). The present wording is such 
that the law can be applied to future, as yet unimagined, 
types of electronic media. A provision claiming jurisdiction 
over internet sites pertaining to Venezuelan broadcast media 
companies has been removed from the most recent draft. 
 
3. (U) The legislation specifies a complicated system of 
schedules and classifications of inappropriate content which 
is to be regulated within those schedules. It creates three 
categories of programming time:  All-User time (07:00-19:00), 
Supervised time (19:00-23:00 and 05:00-07:00), and Adult time 
(23:00-05:00).  The content largely prohibited during the 
first two time categories includes most types of sexual 
content and crude language, as well as such \"unhealthy\" 
conduct as drinking excessively and smoking. \"Violent\" images 
and sounds (broadly-defined) are also banned during all but 
the adult hours. 
 
4. (U) Television and radio stations are convinced that this 
is the provision which will be used to silence them. They 
argue that it would be nearly impossible to produce a news 
product in which images or sounds of, for example, a 
terrorist attack (9/11 is the commonly-cited example) are 
prohibited. During all but the adult hours, the law bans 
content which presents elements of \"physical, psychological, 
sexual, or verbal violence exercised individually or 
collectively against one or more people, objects, or animals\" 
and also that which presents \"the consequences or effects\" of 
the aforementioned types of violence. No exception is made 
for news. Stations would also have to publish a monthly 
 
 
programming schedule and stick to it, the only exceptions 
being for government broadcasts and for live \"exceptional\" 
messages. 
 
5. (U) The draft legislation now provides no more permissive 
standard in portraying public figures than for private 
figures, and the law would explicitly ban character offenses. 
Article 3, paragraph 3 states that one of the bill\'s primary 
goals is to, \"Promote the effective exercise and respect for 
human rights, in particular, the protection of honor, private 
life, intimacy, one\'s own image, confidentiality, and 
respect...without censorship.\" Some reporters worry that this 
clause may be used to punish any embarrassing disclosure 
about public or private officials, whether personal, 
professional, or criminal, and suspect that it might even be 
used to discourage political cartoons or parodies. 
Legislators changed the language from \"guarantee\" the 
protection of honor to promoting it, when they approved the 
article in mid October. Still, media figures believe the 
intent of this provision remains the same. And though 
explicit penalties for such offenses have been removed from 
the bill, media figures believe the new penal code, also 
working its way through the assembly now, will provide the 
punishment. 
 
6. (U) One provision that causes grave concern amongst 
broadcasters is the article that requires large portions of 
the schedule be given over to \"national independent 
producers.\"  For instance, 60% of the All-User time 
programming must be of national origin, while 36% of All-User 
programming must be the product of national independent 
producers (NIPs). Only 15% of a stations\' independent 
programming can come from any one NIP. 
 
7. (U) According to Article 13, to be classified a NIP by the 
National Telecommunications Agency (CONATEL), a producer must 
be Venezuelan and resident in Venezuela, not related by a 
fourth degree (nor married to or cohabitating with) anyone 
employed by a radio/TV service provider, possess experience, 
\"demonstrate capacity to produce national productions,\" and 
comply with the rest of the requirements established in the 
technical norms (no further reference to where to find those 
norms). The person also must not be linked through contract, 
active participation, address, or subordinate commercial 
relationship to any radio or television service provider. 
These requirements are retroactive for the 12 months 
preceding application to CONATEL to be classified a NIP 
(reduced from 24 months in previous drafts).  CONATEL has the 
right to revoke NIP status at any time. Opponents of the bill 
say that this effectively forces media to cede control over 
as much as half their airtime to outsiders who, 1) have no 
experience in producing programming and, 2) are beholden to 
the government. 
 
8. (U) CONATEL\'s broad role in regulation, review, and 
sanctions worries media and opponents of President Hugo 
Chavez. A presidentially-appointed director heads CONATEL, 
which falls under the Ministry of Infrastructure. Earlier 
versions of the law, as proposed by CONATEL, envisioned the 
creation of a semi-autonomous National Institute of Radio and 
Television (INART), which would have been responsible for 
monitoring media compliance with the law. Subsequent 
versions, however, granted those powers to CONATEL. Critics 
point to four areas of concern regarding CONATEL\'s proposed 
oversight role:  1) its role in granting NIP status to 
producers, 2) its approval of User Committees, 3) its nearly 
complete control over the sanctions regime, and 4) its 
 
 
financing of these activities and of NIPs through a special 
tax levied on media companies, called the \"Fund for Social 
Responsibility.\" 
 
9. (U) According to article 19, the \"Directorate of Social 
Responsibility,\" would sanction violators of the media law, 
under the direction of CONATEL. The composition of the board 
guarantees that the government will always have at least a 
majority vote. The directorate is to be comprised of one 
representative from each of the following:  the Ministries of 
Communication and Information, Health, and Education and 
Culture, the National Institute of Women (INAMUJER), the 
National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents 
(CNDNA), the churches (collectively), the universities with 
graduate schools of communication (collectively), the \"users\" 
(collectively), and NGO\'s concerned with protection of 
children (collectively). 
 
10. (U) CONATEL\'s power to declare violations of the law and 
impose sanctions causes the greatest concern among 
broadcasters and their supporters. For television stations, 
fines would range from $13,000 for a minor infraction to 
$430,000 for more \"serious\" infractions. Violations would 
include showing violence during the day (apparently to 
include that which appears in news programming), not 
identifying themselves as required in article 4 (in TV\'s 
case, by displaying their logo in the top left-hand corner at 
all times, including during commercials), and not 
broadcasting the required quota of NIP programming. In the 
case of radio, fines are no more than 50% of the equivalent 
television fine. 
 
11. (C) Opposition deputy Gerardo Blyde (Primero Justicia), a 
leading negotiator of the bill with the Minister of 
Communication and Information, says that even the most 
financially sound of the media companies would not be able to 
withstand repeated fines, which he characterized as 
\"excessive.\" He asserted that the government could bankrupt 
leading station Venevision with three maximum fines, leaving 
the channel in the hands of the government. Felipe Serrano, 
director of the Venezuelan Chamber of Radio Broadcasters, 
expressed a similar concern to Poloff, saying many radio 
stations, if fined, would end-up in government hands. 
 
12. (U) Beyond fines, broadcasters would face suspension of 
rights for up to 72 hours for such infractions as: 
broadcasting messages which \"promote, apologize for, or 
incite alterations of public order,\" or \"are contrary to the 
security of the nation.\" Broadcast rights may also be 
suspended after receiving two of the maximum monetary fines 
within a three year period. The most serious penalties, 
imposed for recurring infractions, are suspension of license 
for up to five years or revocation of license. Broadcasters 
may appeal sanctions to the Minister of Infrastructure and, 
subsequently, at the Supreme Court (TSJ). 
 
13. (U) A \"tribute\" of two-percent of gross annual revenue 
will be levied on all broadcast media enterprises by CONATEL 
and will be used to create and sustain a \"Fund for Social 
Responsibility.\" CONATEL will use this fund primarily to 
finance the operations of NIPs. It will also fund other 
aspects of the agency\'s oversight of the law, such as its 
approval of \"User Committees.\" Under the law, Venezuelan 
citizens can form \"User Committees\" to monitor media content 
and file complaints; upon which CONATEL confers official 
status.  Critics assert that CONATEL would approve mostly 
committees sympathetic to the President, or hostile to the 
 
media and the opposition. The result, according to one 
opposition lawmaker, would be \"Bolivarian Circles of 
Communication.\" In addition to fines and more serious 
penalties, the law requires alleged violators to answer all 
user committee complaints formally within 15 days.  Failure 
to meet the 15 day deadline would lead to punitive actions 
against the enterprise. 
 
14. (C) Venezuelan media also complain that the law will lead 
to self-censorhip.  A lawyer for all-news channel Globovision 
asserted that there would be a \"chilling effect that will 
lead to prior restraint.\" The primary cause, she and others 
argue, is the \"third party liability\" clause in the 
legislation. Electronic media outlets will not only be held 
accountable for the content they produce and the images they 
transmit, but also for what their guests and interview 
subjects say.  Advertisers too will be legally liable for any 
prohibited content aired within a program that they are 
sponsoring or during which they have purchased time. If an 
interview subject violates \"the honor,\" \"intimacy,\" or 
\"reputation\" of a public figure in the course of an 
interview, the station and sponsors can be held equally 
liable.  The same is true if a station is issued a violation 
for showing scenes of violence or the results thereof. The 
only exception granted by the law is for \"live, direct from 
the scene transmission, when the broadcaster can prove that 
it acted diligently to avoid or suspend the infraction.\" 
Media fear that CONATEL\'s interpretations will be subjective 
and depend on the government\'s disposition toward the company 
in question. 
 
15. (U) Aside from formalizing the government\'s right to 
take-over the airwaves with \"cadenas,\" the law would also 
require all stations to cede to the government 70 minutes per 
week for publicizing educational and informative messages, 
the timing of which is to be left to the Minister of 
Communication and Information. Of that 70 minutes, the 
government must cede 10 minutes to \"the users.\" Subscription 
television services (cable and satellite), which must have 
government authorization to operate, will be required to 
carry all \"open\" channels (including VTV, which belongs to 
the government, but captures little audience share) and to 
provide one channel to the Ministry of Communications and 
Information exclusively for the airing of programs produced 
by NIPs. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16. (C) It seems likely that Venezuelan legislators will make 
minor changes to some controversial aspects of the bill. 
Others will be easily approved. In fact, as the GoV points 
out, some aspects of the law resemble conditions under which 
broadcast media operate in some European countries. However, 
there have been no signs of government willingness to lessen 
CONATEL\'s control over media content. Regardless of small 
adjustments that are won by the opposition, the overall 
effect of the law, once implemented, will be one of 
restricting free speech and lessening criticism of the 
government, both through direct censorship, and through 
self-censorship. Much of the law codifies censorship. Under 
this law, as one opposition deputy put it, \"It will be costly 
to criticize the government in the future.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Congressman Cass Ballenger and three House staffers 
visited Caracas October 28-29 with the principal objective of 
raising the case of the four representatives of the NGO 
Sumate, who have been charged with treason for supporting the 
recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez.  To this 
end, Ballenger met with three of the indicted Sumate 
representatives, Supreme Court President Ivan Rincon, chief 
prosecutor Danilo Anderson, and five foreign ambassadors. 
Ballenger offered to help Sumate with a House Resolution in 
support of their case and to elicit support from various 
colleagues on the Hill.  Though the requested meeting with 
Chavez did not occur, the visit was well timed in that the 
Sumate representatives face possible incarceration as early 
as November 2.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Machado Expects Imprisonment 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Congressman Cass Ballenger visited Caracas October 
28-29 accompanied by House staffers Ted Brennan, Caleb 
McCarry, and Mark Wheat.  The Ambassador hosted breakfast for 
CODEL Ballenger and representatives of the NGO Sumate on 
October 29.  Present were Maria Corina Machado, Alejandro 
Plaz, Luis Enrique Palacios, and Roberto Abdul, the first 
three of which have been charged with treason for having 
accepted a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy 
(NED). 
3. (C) The Ambassador summarized international efforts in 
support of Sumate, including a letter signed by 31 prominent 
international figures, a letter in support of the NED by 
Congressmen Gregory Meeks and Christopher Cox, a visit on 
November 7 by NED President Carl Gershman and NED Board 
Member Terence Todman, statements by the Department 
spokesman, demarches to and by EU members, and a letter and 
possible call to Chavez by former President Jimmy Carter. 
The Ambassador also took note of public comments against 
President Hugo Chavez by National Security Advisor Rice and 
presidential candidate John Kerry.  Regarding press, the 
Ambassador noted that the Wall Street Journal and Miami 
Herald had run stories favorable to Sumate and that the 
Washington Post might do so as well. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador briefed the Sumate representatives on 
the Department\'s efforts to drum up support from European 
governments, noting that the United Kingdom and France had 
voiced concern to the GOV.  Plaz added that he had heard that 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim had called Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Jesus Perez on the case.  Plaz acknowledged 
the help locally of the Dutch and German ambassadors.  Plaz 
also mentioned that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan had 
agreed to express support via a planted question at his next 
weekly press conference. 
 
5. (C) Machado said Sumate used the NED funds strictly for 24 
workshops to educate citizens on voting rights.  She said the 
prosecutor working on the Sumate case had recommended to the 
judge that the four Sumate representatives (including Ricardo 
Estevez, who was not present) be jailed pending trial. 
Machado said the 18-year sentence associated with the charges 
made incarceration almost automatic.  Machado believes there 
is a strong likelihood that she and Plaz will be jailed 
November 2.  Plaz suggested this could be delayed a week by 
legal maneuvering.  Machado said she was unsure of the GOV\'s 
intentions, calling the court case \"a poker game.\"  She 
admitted it had been difficult to present her case to some 
foreign ambassadors who dismissed the rebellion charges as a 
GOV scare tactic.  She expressed concern that their 
imprisonment would strike fear into their volunteer network 
and intimidate NGOs.  Plaz predicted Chavez would step up 
persecution of his enemes after the October 31 elections. 
 
6. (C) Balleger told the Sumate representatives he regretted 
 
that Chavez had not granted him an udience to raise Sumate. 
Ballenger offered to spnsor a House Resolution in support of 
Sumate onc the U.S. Congress comes back to session on 
Novemer 15.  Ballenger suggested that nother member, who he 
said is closer philosophically to Chavez than he, might be 
convinced to contact Chavez personally.  The Ambassador noted 
that a House Resolution might come after the Sumate 
representatives are locked up, but would nonetheless have a 
significant impact.  Machado said she did not know how the 
GOV might react to a resolution, but agreed it would be \"huge 
moral support\" for their case.  Ballenger also noted he had 
sought support for Sumate\'s case with the local ambassadors 
of Argentina, Canada, France, Mexico, and UK at a lunch 
hosted by the Ambassador on October 28. 
 
-------------------- 
Anderson Stands Firm 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) Congressman Ballenger and the Ambassador later met 
with prosecutor Danilo Anderson. Congressman Ballenger 
defended the role of the NED around the world, and the grant 
to Sumate in particular.  He asked Anderson if he had any 
suggestions on how the USG could help resolve the questions 
the Attorney General\'s office had about the NED.  Anderson 
told Ballenger that the prosecutor\'s office is investigating 
the NED loans to Venezuelan NGOs because some of the groups 
that received the money had allegedly engaged in crimes, 
including civil rebellion, electoral crimes, and fraud.  He 
said the prosecutor in the case would probably decide whether 
to charge the members of Sumate or close the case on November 
2.  The Ambassador asked if it would be helpful to have NED 
President Gershman come to Venezuela and explain the NED\'s 
procedures and the projects in question to the prosecutor\'s 
office.  Anderson said it was a good idea, and agreed to 
express his interest in meeting to the MFA, which would 
coordinate the NED\'s schedule. 
 
------------------------------- 
Rincon Dismisses NED Connection 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Ballenger and the Ambassador also met with Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Ivan Rincon.  Ballenger told Rincon that 
many members of the U.S. Congress were upset about the 
Sumate/NED case.  Ballenger opined that neither NED nor 
Sumate had engaged in illegal or illegitimate activity.  He 
pointed out that the Congress contributes funds to many 
international organizations, including the World Bank.  He 
said the criminalization of NED funding in Venezuela has led 
many in Congress to suggest either that the Congress should 
not give money to these international organizations, or that 
the Congress should get more involved in deciding what loans 
are approved.  Ballenger stressed this message to Rincon, 
expressing the anger in the Congress, and the possible effect 
it could have on World Bank funding Rincon is seeking for the 
Venezuelan judiciary. 
 
9.  (C) Rincon said it is not illegal to receive 
international financial aid, adding that the Supreme Court 
itself does so.  He said the size of the NED loan made it 
insignificant, and that even if the funds were put to some 
use other than the one intended, the NED is not culpable 
under Venezuelan law.  The fact that most of the evidence was 
obtained through FOIA made it clear it was not a covert 
program.  Rincon added, however, that Sumate may have 
participated in illegal acts.  He made a point of Sumate\'s 
role as the organizational and technical nerve center of a 
fractured opposition.  He said the prosecutor\'s investigation 
centered on possible crimes committed by Sumate in the 
signature drive leading up to the recall referendum, and for 
allegedly setting up a parallel Electoral Council. 
 
10. (C) Ballenger asked for clarification on whether the 
charges against Sumate stemmed from alleged illegal 
financing, or if the political organizing they had engaged in 
was illegal.  Rincon said the investigation had not 
determined yet that any crime had been committed, but if so 
it had nothing to do with the NED.  He said Attorney General 
Isaias Rodriguez told him that the investigation of Sumate 
 
had to be disconnected from the NED, as international 
financing was not illegal.  Rincon stressed the role of the 
USG in helping reform the Judicial Branch in Venezuela 
through bilateral and multilateral projects, and said he 
hoped it would continue.  Ballenger asked Rincon about 
amendments to the Penal Code being discussed in the National 
Assembly which would criminalize receipt of international 
funds by NGOs.  Rincon said he had nothing to do with the 
proposal, and thought it was probably unconstitutional.  He 
promised if such a law were passed, the Supreme Court would 
act. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C)  Ballenger\'s visit was useful in signaling to the GOV 
our interest in the Sumate\'s highly politicized case, and 
tying that interest directly to the U.S. Congress.  President 
Chavez is seeking to neutralize Sumate\'s capacity to 
challenge him on electoral transparency.  He also wants to 
send a message to the Venezuelan NGO community that 
activities contrary to GOV interests will not be tolerated. 
Up to now, it has served Chavez\'s interest merely to threaten 
Machado and company with jail time.  He may be ready, 
however, to turn up the political heat on the opposition, 
similar to when Baruta Mayor Enrique Capriles was detained 
earlier this year. 
 
9. (U) Congressman Ballenger did not review this message 
before transmittal.

Rincon suggested it would be in Venezuelan and U.S. interest 
for the World Bank to approve the $45 million loan for the 
National Modernization Project of the TSJ.  The Ambassador 
reminded Rincon of the consequences of the September 2004 
trafficking in persons (TIP) sanction which required the U.S. 
to vote against loans to Venezuela.  The Ambassador asserted 
that support for the World Bank loan would probably be tied 
to the perception of independence and autonomy the TSJ could 
project through its future decisions. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador met with Ivan Rincon Urdaneta, 
President of Venezuela\'s Supreme Court (TSJ) and its 
Constitutional Chamber, on October 25 at Rincon\'s invitation. 
 Rincon reviewed judicial cooperation between the U.S. and 
Venezuela and lauded the training of criminal judges in 
Puerto Rico.  He fondly reminisced about his own 
participation in the International Visitor (IV) program in 
1993.  Regarding Venezuela\'s work with the World Bank, he 
called it one of the World Bank\'s most successful projects 
that should serve as a model for other Latin American 
countries.  The project, he said, has helped the Supreme 
Court earn a 59% credibility vote from the people. 
 
---------- 
The Pitch 
---------- 
 
3. (C) After touting past success in judicial cooperation, 
Rincon said the National Modernization Project for the TSJ he 
presented to the World Bank in 2003 had received verbal 
approval, but was not signed in May 2004 as planned because 
of the referendum.  Venezuela did not need the $45 million 
dollar World Bank loan, Rincon told the Ambassador, but the 
support of the World Bank name was important and a decision 
was needed.  Rincon dismissed World Bank concerns about 
political risk with the project in Venezuela, citing the 
TSJ\'s cooperation with the U.S. Federal Courts and the U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
Embassy as an endorsement.  In regards to trafficking in 
persons (TIP), Rincon asserted that strengthening the TSJ was 
a way of gaining some control over the situation, and one way 
to help could perhaps be to provide training regarding 
prostitution, especially that of minors. 
 
-------------------------- 
It\'s All About Perception 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador agreed that cooperation with the TSJ 
has been positive in the past.  Nevertheless, the September 
2004 TIP decision meant that the U.S. would have to vote 
against the loan.  But the level of U.S. objection and future 
support of the World Bank proposal would be tied to how 
independent and impartial the Supreme Court is perceived to 
be.  The Ambassador noted the following examples that worry 
the U.S.: the appointment of twelve new members of the TSJ, 
the proposed media law, the changes to the penal code that 
would make foreign contributions to nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) illegal, the Sumate case, unresolved 
allegations of CNE fraud, and increased oil royalties in 
apparent violation of existing contracts.  Did Rincon believe 
that TSJ decisions on these issues would contribute to 
concerns about judicial independence? 
 
------------ 
The Defense 
------------ 
 
5. (C) Rincon reacted defensively citing the TSJ\'s 
independence, autonomy and distance from some of the issues. 
He said he could not prevent the National Assembly from 
contemplating the proposed media law, but if the proposed law 
came before the TSJ and violated the definitions of free 
press defined in the constitution, it would be overturned. 
Rincon warned the Ambassador to be wary of politics and the 
opposition.  He asserted that he had recommended Henrique 
 
Capriles be set free, but the Sumate case was still under 
investigation by the Attorney General and the prosecutor\'s 
office and had not reached the Court.  Alluding to the 
National Endowment for Democracy, Rincon said it was not the 
fault of the U.S. if a bipartisan group designated money for 
democracy building that was then used for unintended 
purposes. 
 
6. (C) Rincon also said he was disappointed that all the 
judges that had been trained had failed the judicial exam and 
would need to reenter training. He noted the decision to 
dismiss judge Franklin Arrieche from the TSJ was due to 
falsified credentials, and reiterated that the TSJ needed 
credibility.  Rincon reasserted the TSJ\'s independence 
claiming that 80% of its decisions went against the 
government. However, he said, he could not do something like 
delay the regional elections at the request of some when the 
population was prepared to vote.  Noting that much of the 
Venezuelan judicial system is based on the American system, 
Rincon reiterated the need for U.S.-Venezuelan judicial 
cooperation. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
7. (C) Rincon got the message: If he wants USG support for 
judicial reform projects, the TSJ better not be a Chavez 
rubber stamp.  Rincon reacted defensively but tried to stay 
upbeat by suggesting that issues had already been resolved or 
passing the buck to other institutions.  That said, the 
judicial reform project is worth supporting, if for no other 
reason than giving us continued leverage on TSJ decisions.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Ambassador visited Maracaibo, Zulia State, October 
26-27, to meet with U.S. organizations, local leaders, and 
the press.  He called on Governor Manuel Rosales, Maracaibo 
Mayor Giancarlo DiMartino, and San Francisco Mayor Saady 
Bijani.  The Ambassador attended a lunch with business 
leaders hosted by Venamcham and a reception hosted by the 
binational center (CEVAZ).  Chevron-Texaco received the 
Ambassador at two of its social development projects, a 
public children\'s hospital and a boys\' orphanage.  The 
Ambassador visited the editorial boards of Maracaibo dailies 
\"Panorama\" and \"La Verdad\" and gave several press interviews. 
 There is general optimism that the economy is rebounding in 
Zulia, a state that manifests a historic autonomous streak 
and, to a lesser extent, resistance to President Hugo Chavez. 
 End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Zulian Politicos See Pains and Progress 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador visited Zulia State capital Maracaibo, 
Venezuela\'s petroleum center and a key enclave of U.S. 
economic and social interests, on October 26-27.  Governor 
Manuel Rosales, who was in the midst of campaigning for 
re-election on October 31, told him the national government 
had given practically no support to his administration, and 
often worked at cross-purposes via Corpozulia, the GOV-run 
development corporation there.  Rosales said the GOV is 
operating under the guise of democracy and is run by people 
\"with very different concepts of freedom of expression and 
human rights.\"  Rosales attributed President Hugo Chavez\'s 
victory in Zulia during the recall referendum to Colombians, 
some living in Zulia and some in Colombia, who received 
Venezuelan identity cards and were illegally permitted to 
vote.  Rosales also complained that ELN, FARC, and Colombian 
paramilitaries crossed freely into Venezuela, often to buy 
supplies, with the tacit approval of the Venezuelan military. 
 The Ambassador expressed his desire to boost the U.S. 
profile in Zulia using the bi-national center (CEVAZ), the 
Venamcham, and the Maracaibo Consular Agency.  Rosales 
encouraged the Ambassador to bolster relations with Zulia, 
noting possibilities in educational exchanges. 
 
3. (C) Maracaibo Mayor Giancarlo DiMartino, whom Chavez 
endorsed for re-election, recounted the achievements of his 
administration.  He noted that the Maracaibo police force had 
been re-designed via a strategic alliance with the Miami-Dade 
Police in Florida.  DiMartino acknowledged that border crime, 
namely kidnapping and contraband, has grown more serious 
because of Colombian guerrilla and paramilitary groups.  He 
also noted the problems with illicit drug use in Maracaibo, 
including ecstasy.  The Ambassador offered to collaborate on 
counternarcotics matters, including investigation, 
interdiction, and education. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador met with Saady Bijani, mayor of San 
Francisco (to the south of Maracaibo municipality) and 
president of the Venezuelan Mayors\' Association (ADAVE). 
Bijani warned of GOV social programs with Cuban assistance, 
especially the medical program Barrio Adentro.  Bijani 
claimed that each Cuban \"doctor\" (often nurses, med students, 
or residents) has up to three other Cubans in charge of 
indoctrination of a specific poor neighborhood covered by the 
clinic.  Regarding election fraud, Bijani said that before 
the presidential recall referendum, the GOV added 43,000 new 
voters to his constituency, a 30-pct. increase over the 
150,000 voters previously registered.  Bijani said the GOV 
had done this around the country to make it numerically 
difficult for more than 100 opposition mayors to be 
re-elected.  Bijani also complained that the GOV is 
intentionally cutting off or delaying payments of legally 
entitled revenues to states and municipalities to weaken 
elected officials who oppose Chavez.  The Ambassador assured 
Bijani the USG would continue to stand by its principles of 
supporting democratic institutions and promoting human rights 
in Venezuela. 
 
---------------------------- 
Visits To U.S. Organizations 
 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The Maracaibo Committee of the Venezuelan-American 
Chamber of Commerce (Venamcham) hosted a lunch for the 
Ambassador attended by more than 30 U.S. and Venezuelan 
business leaders.  Participants expressed concern about 
kidnappings and other criminal activities of armed groups 
operating on the Colombian border.  The Ambassador 
highlighted the need to break the nexus between the armed 
groups and narco-trafficking, a fundamental tenet of Plan 
Colombia.  At a meeting with the Venezuelan-American Center 
(CEVAZ) board, the Ambassador expressed interest in 
augmenting CEVAZ\'s activities in Maracaibo and offered to 
help promote the center.  CEVAZ hosted a reception for more 
than 100 ex-pats and community leaders as well.  The 
Ambassador also visited the American school, Escuela Bella 
Vista (EBV), addressing high school and elementary students. 
 
------------------------------ 
U.S. Corporate Social Projects 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) The Ambassador visited the sites of two social 
development projects sponsored by Chevron-Texaco (CTX).  The 
Pediatriatrics Specialties Hospital is a free public hospital 
operated by Zulia State that CTX helped to complete.  The 
hospital serves hundreds of patients daily, and has modern 
facilities and equipment.  The Ambassador also visited the 
Simon Rodriguez Orphanage, built by CTX and home to more than 
30 orphaned boys.  The Ambassador presented a collection of 
books on American history and culture to the boys.  He 
highlighted corporate social responsibility and the strong 
relationship between the U.S. and Venezuelan people in his 
comments to the press. 
 
----------------------- 
The University of Zulia 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) Leonardo Atencio, the recently-elected rector of the 
state-run University of Zulia (LUZ), hosted a lunch for the 
Ambassador.  The Ambassador encouraged Atencio to consider 
increasing cooperation with U.S. universities (student and 
teacher exchanges) and to take advantage of CEVAZ\'s expertise 
in English language instruction.  The Ambassador also 
highlighted the Fullbright and Cochran fellowship programs as 
opportunities for educational exchange.  Atencio mentioned 
LUZ is in the process of renewing its working agreement with 
CEVAZ and would look for ways to improve upon it. 
 
---------------- 
Press Interviews 
---------------- 
 
8. (C) Esteban Pineda, Director of the Chavez-leaning daily 
\"Panorama,\" told the Ambassador his newspaper made a business 
decision in 2002 not to \"act like a political party\" and 
oppose Chavez.  Pineda said Chavez has capitalized on a 
long-term social movement though he has had problems 
converting it into a political movement.  Pineda, who also 
heads an important business group in Zulia, said there are 
strong signs that Zulia\'s economy is improving.  The 
Ambassador also met with Juan Carlos Abudei and Luis Perez, 
editors of \"La Verdad,\" a pro-opposition newspaper founded in 
1998.  Abudei said the paper received a boost in circulation 
when \"Panorama\" began to support Chavez.  Abudei predicted 
fraud in the October 31 elections, claiming that some 176,000 
Colombians had been illegally registered to vote in Zulia for 
the recall referendum.  Asked his impressions of the Social 
Responsibility in Radio and Television Law, Perez said the 
bill does not currently contemplate print media.  He said, 
however, he fears that once the law is passed, the courts 
could interpret it to apply to newspapers. 
 
-------------- 
Press Coverage 
-------------- 
 
9. (U) The trip generated three days of extensive press 
coverage in both print dailies as well as television and 
radio.  In the press encounters, the Ambassador stayed on 
message about U.S.-Venezuela relations, noting that the USG 
will look to improve cooperation in those areas where we can 
(illegal drugs, terrorism, and energy) and disagree where we 
cannot (democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights, 
etc.).  He refused to be dragged into the debate over 
 
regional elections, saying they are an internal affair for 
Venezuala.  The press took special note of the Ambassador\'s 
Zulia connection (Maracaibo having been his first diplomatic 
assignment) and of his sense of humor (legendary throughout 
the State of Texas). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador was well received by the press and 
public and was able to present U.S. policy goals in Venezuela 
outside of the politicized atmosphere of Caracas.  Zulia has 
a fierce independence streak and, therefore, instinctive 
resentment toward the national government in Caracas.  Though 
the state broke 51-49 in favor of Chavez in the referendum, 
Zulia remains a bastion of opposition to Chavez -- even the 
Chavista candidates have to run as moderates.   There is 
relative optimism in Zulia that the economy is improving. 
Opposition politicians, however, are glum about Chavez\'s 
apparent abuse of state authority to dismantle political 
resistance in Zulia. 
 
11. (C) Ambassador requested a meeting with Alberto 
Gutierrez, the Chavez-backed candidate for governor, but 
received no response.  Similarly, a request for a meeting 
with senior regional military commander Gen. Wilfredo Silva 
went unanswered, though Post learned informally that Silva\'s 
commanding officer in Caracas denied permission for the 
meeting.

1.  (C)  Proyecto Venezuela leader Henrique Salas Roemer said 
that the government would win by fraud in the regional 
elections during a short courtesy call on the Ambassador at 
the Residence October 22.  Salas Roemer criticized the Carter 
Center for legitimizing what he described as a fraudulent 
recall referendum.  Citing polls, he said the opposition was 
poised to fare well in the regional elections on October 31, 
but Chavez would sweep the map on October 31 by cheating. 
 
2.  (C)  Salas Roemer called himself the \"most famous 
unemployed Venezuelan.\"  He dismissed the Ambassador\'s 
suggestion that he would have many opportunities to seek 
election in the next few years, saying he would never run 
without an impartial process.  In response to Ambassador\'s 
queries about a future strategy for the opposition, the party 
leader merely returned to the subject of prospects for the 
regional election.

Comment

3.  (C)  Salas Roemer demonstrates a lack of vision that is 
typical of opposition leadership, many of whom have no plan 
for reorganizing after what they expect to be a Chavez rout 
on October 31.  Claims that he will abstain from future 
elections appear somewhat disingenuous coming from this 
self-absorbed, longtime politician.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Pro-Chavez candidates won 20 of 22 governorships and 
the mayoralty of metropolitan Caracas in the October 31 
regional elections.  Governors Enrique Mendoza (Miranda 
State) and Henrique Salas Feo (Carabobo) trailed their 
Chavista opponents and challenged the accuracy of the 
preliminary results released early November 1 by the National 
Electoral Council (CNE).  Opposition candidates in Zulia 
State and Nueva Esparta State won.  In Caracas, Baruta Mayor 
Enrique Capriles and Chacao Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, of the 
opposition party Primero Justicia, won, as did Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) Libertador Mayor Freddy Bernal.  The winners 
begin their terms of office within a week or two of the local 
electoral boards\' certification of results.  Voter turnout 
was low in both opposition and pro-Chavez strongholds, 
reaching 60 percent nationwide.  President Hugo Chavez and 
his supporters took advantage of the relatively calm voting 
day to dig at the U.S. by expressing hope that the United 
States\' elections be as transparent that of Venezuela.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Preliminary Results Give 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The National Electoral Council (CNE) released 
preliminary results of the regional elections just after 
midnight on November 1.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez noted 
that the results were partial, based on information 
transmitted from voting machines and, in a few cases, were 
not sufficient to confirm a winner.  According to the partial 
count, pro-Chavez candidates won 20 of 22 governor seats. 
(The CNE gave results for only a handful of the 335 mayoral 
races.)  The CNE announced the victory of Chavista luminaries 
such as former Infrastructure Minister Diosdado Cabello in 
Miranda State, Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) Deputy Tarek 
William Saab in Anzoategui State, and retired National Guard 
General Felipe Acosta Carles in Carabobo State.  MVR Deputy 
Juan Barreto easily won control of the mayoralty of the 
Caracas federal district.  Pro-Chavez Maracaibo Mayor 
Giancarlo DiMartino appeared to have lost in the initial 
report, but subsequent announcements by Maracaibo election 
officials suggested he might yet prevail. 
 
3. (U) On the opposition side, Zulia State Governor Manuel 
Rosales held a commanding lead over retired army general 
Alberto Gutierrez in that state.  Former Nueva Esparta State 
(Margarita Island) Governor Morel Rodriguez beat pro-Chavez 
incumbent Alexis Navarro in that state.  In the Caracas 
federal district, Baruta Mayor Enrique Capriles and Chacao 
Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, both of Primero Justicia, handily won 
their races. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Opposition Challenges Some Results 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) While MVR candidate Diosdado Cabello was giving his 
victory speech for his 52-48% win in Miranda State, Governor 
Enrique Mendoza publicly announced that his count showed 
otherwise.  Mendoza claimed that his tabulation of copies of 
tally sheets showed a 53-47% tilt in his favor.  Cabello said 
Mendoza\'s reaction is \"damaging\" to the State and called on 
Mendoza to make his appeal via the courts.  In Carabobo, 
Governor Henrique Salas Feo rejected the CNE\'s announcement 
and claimed to have a 26% lead over the pro-Chavez candidate. 
 The opposition governors of Bolivar and Yaracuy states, 
Antonio Rojas Suarez and Eduardo Lapi, made similar 
challenges to the CNE results.  According to electoral law, 
state and municipal electoral boards certify the results of 
gubernatorial and mayoral races, respectively, within two 
days after the election.  Once certified, the newly elected 
officials are inaugurated within one to two weeks, depending 
on regulations in each state and municipality. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Voting Day:  Relative Calm, High Abstention 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Election day was marked by relative calm with only 
sporadic reports of irregularities in voting procedures. 
Preliminary results suggest 60 percent abstention nationwide. 
 In contrast to the endless hours of waiting in line during 
the August 15 presidential recall referendum, voters waited 
no more than 30 minutes.  Fingerprint-capturing computers 
were used at most centers to verify identity of voters and 
did not slow down the voting lines.  The CNE extended voting 
one hour to 5:00 p.m. to accommodate latecomers.  Emboffs 
observed minimal numbers of people in lines at dozens of 
voting centers in Caracas and nearby states.  GOV officials 
repeated throughout the day that abstention rates in regional 
elections are historically high.  Chavez contended to 
reporters after he cast his vote that abstention rates are 
lower than those of the U.S., which sometimes reach 80%. 
 
----------------------------------- 
GOV Wishes U.S. Well In Nov. 2 Vote 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) During a press conference at his assigned polling 
place, Chavez extolled the transparency of Venezuelan voting 
procedures and the cutting-edge technology used.  Chavez said 
his country\'s voting system is more transparent, more direct 
than that of the United States, taking a swipe at the U.S. 
Electoral College as an affront to \"direct democracy.\"  Vice 
President Rangel told reporters he hoped U.S. elections would 
be transparent and not leave doubts among the voters. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) True to their predictions, the Chavistas have handed 
the opposition a stinging electoral defeat.  We expect a 
similar sweep for Chavez\'s candidates at the mayoral level. 
Governors Mendoza and Salas may have a chance to pull out a 
victory as more results are reported, but it seems unlikely. 
Abstention rates are only slightly higher than in previous 
regional elections here, making the unusually high turnout in 
the presidential recall referendum look ever more like an 
outlier.  From our informal observation, abstention seemed to 
affect both sides, with opposition voters apathetic after the 
referendum loss and Chavista campaigns suffering from less 
\"walking around money\" than what was available in the 
referendum.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELAN SUPREME COURT INTERVENES IN SUMATE CASE 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Penal Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court 
November 2 suspended the case against four members of the NGO 
SUMATE facing charges of conspiracy to overthrow the 
government.  The Penal Chamber agreed to investigate whether 
the crime the prosecutor alleges that the Sumate 
representatives committed is contemplated in the penal code. 
The court may take anywhere from hours to months to make its 
decision, during which time the case is suspended.  Prior to 
the Supreme Court\'s suspension, the lower court handling the 
case had postponed a hearing scheduled for November 2 until 
November 24.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Penal Chamber Intervenes 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) Jesus Loreto, one of the lawyers defending 
representatives of the NGO Sumate, told PolOff November 2 
that the Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court (TSJ) had agreed 
to examine a defense appeal submitted on November 1.  (Note: 
In a meeting on October 29 with CODEL Ballenger, SUMATE 
leaders Maria Corina Machado and Alejandro Plaz told the 
Ambassador about the planned appeal. End Note).  The appeal 
asked the court to review whether the actions alleged by the 
prosecutors could rightfully be considered criminal.  The 
TSJ\'s action suspends the Sumate case until a decision is 
 
SIPDIS 
reached.  The Chamber decided unanimously to hear the appeal, 
with the loan Chavista in the Chamber, Justice Alejandro 
Angulo Fontiveros, writing the decision. 
 
3.  (U) Machado and Plaz were scheduled to appear before a 
lower court November 2.  At that hearing, they expected to be 
jailed pending trial because under Venezuelan law persons 
charged with crimes that carry a penalty of more than ten 
years are presumed to be flight risks.  On November 1 the 
judge postponed that hearing until November 24, and it is now 
suspended indefinitely pending the Penal Chamber\'s ruling. 
 
4.  (C) Loreto told PolOff that the Chamber could take hours 
or months to reach a decision.  He was cautiously optimistic 
about the Chamber\'s decision, and surprised it had acted so 
rapidly. Machado wrote PolOff in an e-mail that this was 
\"definitely good news,\" and asked that her gratitude be 
expressed to all who had shown concern in the case. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
5.  (C) The case against SUMATE stems from its activities 
during the recall referendum drive, and its receipt of 
funding from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  The 
prosecutor has accused SUMATE of conspiring to overthrow the 
government, focusing on the receipt of international funding 
to justify the charges.  Several high ranking GOV officials 
have testified that the NED is a front organization for the 
CIA and the State Department.  The defense claims that the 
prosecutor is investigating SUMATE for actions which are not 
contemplated in the penal code. They claim that all of 
SUMATE\'s activities were legitimate, and that the NED funding 
did not go to political work, but to education. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) While the TSJ\'s decision is welcome news, it is much 
too early to consider it a victory in the case.  The majority 
in the Penal Chamber is not Chavista, and they have ruled 
against the prosecution in other politically sensitive cases, 
only to have the case continue for one reason or another. 
The case successfully sidelined Sumate during the regional 
elections.  Maintaining it alive, albeit in suspense, can 
continue to be useful to the GoV.

2.   (U)  US. Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC) met with 
Venezuelan National Assembly members of the Boston Group, a 
bipartisan exchange initiative of US and Venezuelan 
legislators, at the Ambassador\'s Residence on October 28. 
The Venezuelan deputies invited Rep. Ballenger to return to 
Caracas later this year for a plenary Boston Group meeting to 
discuss a proposal for a National Assembly television channel 
and to meet with two local Boston Group offshoots.  Rep. 
Ballenger agreed to append a trip to his 1-3 December visit 
to a coffee growers\' association in Colombia.  Rep. Ballenger 
accepted the Ambassador\'s offer to help invite Reps. Bill 
Delahunt (D-MA) and Gregory Meeks (D-NY) to the December 
plenary. 
 
3.  (U)  Proyecto Venezuela deputy Pedro Diaz Blum told Rep. 
Ballenger that the political situation had forced the 
National Assembly to put aside an initiative to create a 
\"C-Span\"-like channel for Venezuelan television until after 
the October 31 regional elections, but the idea had not been 
scrapped.  Indeed, the National Assembly had made several 
proposals concerning the project, and the alternate to 
National Assembly president Francisco Jose Ameliach (MVR) 
told Diaz Blum he would support it.  The administration 
agreed that the channel should be balanced, representing both 
the government and the opposition.  Rep. Ballenger said he 
could procure the support of US television stations that 
would donate used equipment. 
 
4.  (U)  The Venezuelan party briefed Rep. Ballenger on the 
positive results of a Harvard Conflict Management Center 
workshop sponsored by USAID aimed at fostering mutual respect 
among government supporters, opposition supporters, and 
citizens disillusioned with both sides.  The workshop has 
since flourished, expanding into a \"Group Boston-Valencia\" 
and a \"Group Boston-Caracas,\" each of which comprises more 
than 40 citizens, including journalists from both 
pro-government and opposition media outlets.  In addition to 
stimulating respectful dialog, the groups have cooperated on 
issues of mutual concern, such as trash removal, and have 
created educational and cultural programs.  The deputies 
planned to propagate such groups in the other Boston Group 
members\' home states of Bolivar, Lara, Sucre, and Zulia. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (U)  US support for such civil society groups is a small 
step towards lessening Venezuela\'s political polarization and 
combating its culture of relying on government to solve its 
problems.  A National Assembly television station, meanwhile, 
could begin to help hold Venezuela\'s legislators accountable 
to a public that tends to shun political involvement because 
of its suspicion of politicians.  End comment. 
 
6.  (U)  Rep. Ballenger did not review this message before 
transmittal.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  A Caracas Appeals Court overturned the conviction of 
National Guard Gen. Carlos Alfonzo Martinez on November 1 on 
grounds that the actions alleged by the prosecutor did not 
constitute a crime under Venezuela\'s Penal Code.  The same 
court, citing similar grounds, dismissed the charges against 
Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles on October 18.  Prosecutor 
Danilo Anderson announced November 4 that he would open an 
investigation of former Mayor of Greater Caracas Alfredo Pena 
and the capital\'s two highest ranking police officials for 
murder in relation to the events of April 11, 2002. 
Prosecutors also began investigating corruption allegations 
against Pena October 27.  Anderson has opened investigations 
against 28 persons, alleging civil rebellion in relation to 
the Carmona decree issued on April 12, 2002.  On November 1 a 
military prosecutor suspended his investigation of the 
journalist Patricia Poleo for releasing a video allegedly of 
Cubans at a military base.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Capriles and Alfonzo Martinez Cases Thrown Out 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (U)  The Second Appeals Court overturned the conviction 
of Gen. Carlos Alfonzo Martinez for violating security zones 
on November 1, on the grounds that the act allegedly 
committed by the general -- giving a speech to opposition 
demonstrators in front of National Guard headquarters --  is 
protected by the constitution and international treaties 
under freedom of speech.  The same Court threw out charges 
against Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles on October 18, ruling 
that the events which the prosecution alleged took place were 
not criminal acts under the Penal Code.  The Court released 
Capriles from the restrictions he was under as conditions of 
bail.  In both cases the prosecution said it would appeal, 
but no action has been taken.  On November 3 Judicial 
Inspectors visited the appeals court to investigate how the 
Alfonzo Martinez decision was leaked to the press. 
 
3.  (C)  Appeals Court Judge Jesus Ollarves, who wrote both 
decisions, told PolOff October 23 that the prosecutions were 
clearly political.  He said they were brought forward by a 
group of prosecutors who were willing to follow orders, with 
no regard to the facts, or the law.  Ollarves said he was 
afraid the two cases had been assigned to his Court to 
prepare the ground for an attempt to remove him from the 
judiciary, though witnesses told him they saw no signs of 
tampering in the assignment of the case.  Ollarves is a 
tenured judge, making it more difficult to remove him. 
Ollarves has ruled against prosecutors in allegedly political 
cases in the past, including the decision to free opposition 
leader Carlos Melo, after he was arrested during the 
disturbances in February-March of 2004  Ollarves told PolOff 
that he received threats after the Melo decision, and took 
several months vacation.  In an e-mail communication on 
November 5, Ollarves called the judicial inspection an 
\"intimidatory process.\" 
 
------------------------ 
Anderson Goes After Pena 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) On November 4 Prosecutor Danilo Anderson told 
reporters he had opened an investigation against Greater 
Caracas Mayor Alfredo Pena, the Metropolitan Secretary for 
Security Henry Vivas, and the Chief of the Metropolitan 
Police, Lazaro Forero, as the intellectual authors of the 
violence on April 11, 2002.  Vivas was chief of the 
Metropolitan Police at the time, and Forero his deputy.  The 
eight Metropolitan Police officers who have been in custody 
for eleven months charged with the deaths that occurred in 
April 2002 have begun to negotiate with Anderson, offering to 
cooperate in the investigation.   Prosecutors also opened an 
investigation against Pena on October 27 for corruption, 
after he withdrew from mayor\'s race.  Pena is presently in 
the U.S. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
While Continuing Carmona Investigation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Anderson has also opened investigations for civil 
rebellion against 28 persons of the 400 he expects to 
prosecute for their alleged participation in the proclamation 
of the Carmona Decree (see reftel), and has announced his 
intention to begin calling eight persons a day to be informed 
of the investigation to speed up the process.  Anderson told 
reporters on November 4 that he did not intend to pursue an 
investigation against reelected Zulia Gov. Manuel Rosales for 
the moment, because it would require special permission from 
the Supreme Court and the National Assembly. 
 
-------------------------- 
Poleo Investigation Closed 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Military Prosecutor General Eladio Aponte Aponte 
November 1 suspended the investigation of journalist Patricia 
Poleo in relation to her release of a video purporting to 
show Cubans in Venezuela\'s main military base, Fuerte Tiuna. 
The action releases Poleo from court-imposed travel 
restrictions. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  The 2nd Chamber of the Caracas Appeals Court is the 
only Chamber left which is not dominated by allies of the 
GOV.  It is by no means certain that the government will not 
continue to pursue them by appealing to the Supreme Court, at 
least in the case of Gen. Alfonzo given his interest in 
participating in politics now that he is free.  With the case 
against the NGO Sumate also in suspense, the Pena case and 
the Carmona investigation, which aim to establish the 
Chavista perspective on the April 2002 events and to fix 
blame, appear to be the GOV\'s priority now.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Pro-Chavez mayors won 270 of 337 municipalities in the 
October 31 regional elections, up from the previously held 
115.  The National Electoral Council settled the one 
remaining dispute in the governors\' races November 4, giving 
the victory to the pro-Chavez challenger in Carabobo State. 
International observers, largely from electoral authorities 
in the region, issued a statement calling the elections 
transparent and trustworthy and praising the automated voting 
system.  The GOV called its win \"a consolidation of 
democracy,\" while opponents warned that President Hugo Chavez 
now controls most political institutions in Venezuela.  Zulia 
State Governor Manuel Rosales, one of two opposition 
Governors elected, is likely to increase his visibility as a 
principal opposition leader.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Chavismo Takes Lion\'s Share of Mayoralties 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Pro-Chavez candidates won 270 of 337 mayoralties 
(including the Caracas federal district) in the October 31 
regional elections (ref), according to preliminary results 
from the National Electoral Council (CNE).  The Chavista 
sweep is a net gain of 155 mayoralties.  Accion Democratica 
candidates reportedly won 50 mayoralties, with Primero 
Justicia (PJ) finishing a very distant third with three 
mayoralties.  PJ candidate in Sucre Municipality in Caracas 
Carlos Ocariz, who had rejected the preliminary CNE results, 
conceded to incumbent Mayor Jose Vicente Rangel Avalos, the 
son of Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel.  Despite being 
declared the loser initially by the CNE, pro-Chavez Maracaibo 
Mayor Giancarlo DiMartino was proclaimed the winner after all 
the tally sheets were considered. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Opposition Governors Drop Challenges 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Miranda State Governor Enrique Mendoza, the head of 
the Coordinadora Democratica, conceded his defeat to Fifth 
Republic Movement (MVR) candidate Diosdado Cabello November 
3.  Mendoza\'s aides told poloff November 2 their own 
tabulation of the tally sheets gave the victory to Cabello by 
18,000 votes.  The failure of Accion Democratica poll workers 
to provide copies of the tally sheets hindered their 
tabulation of results to present a challenge.  They conceded, 
nonetheless, that the information indicated Mendoza had lost. 
 
 
4.  (C) For Carabobo State, the CNE proclaimed pro-Chavez 
challenger Luis Felipe Acosta Carles the winner November 4. 
Incumbent Henrique Salas Feo challenged the initial results 
prepared by the local electoral authorities.  The dispute led 
to an agreement by CNE director Jorge Rodriguez to review and 
re-count of the tally sheets November 3.  When Salas Feo 
complained that the CNE was not abiding by the agreement, 
Rodriguez and CNE President Francisco Carrasquero called him 
a liar, told reporters that CNE regulations do not allow for 
the actions Salas Feo claimed were needed to settle the 
dispute and refuted the incumbent\'s claims.  Rodriguez 
proclaimed Acosta Carles the winner of the election.  Two 
hours later, the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court 
rejected Salas\' petition to stay the results based on alleged 
procedural violations.  Movement to Socialism (MAS) Secretary 
General Leopoldo Puchi told poloff November 3 he thought some 
of Salas\' arguments were without merit and an attempt to 
raise doubts about the announced results. 
 
5.  (C) In Yaracuy State, one of the closest of the 
gubernatorial races, incumbent Eduardo Lapi also conceded on 
November 3.  Prior to his concession, the National Guard took 
over the Governor\'s Palace to ensure the change in office. 
Lapi had challenged the CNE\'s results announced November 1, 
saying they were based on too small a sample of returns.  He 
 
 
conceded after the local electoral board proclaimed his rival 
from Chavez\'s Fifth Republic Movement, Carlos Jimenez, the 
winner. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Undisclosed International Observers Back CNE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) A group of international observers convoked by the CNE 
November 1 praised the transparency and pacific nature of the 
elections.  The statement purports to be the consensus view 
of electoral officials from the region, the Andean 
Parliament, and local diplomats.  The statement specifically 
notes that the automated voting system, attacked by the 
opposition for fraud after the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum, is an \"important advance in the level of 
confidence and control of the results.\"  The CNE invited the 
observers just days before the election.  In Caracas, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs circulated a note to all 
embassies and diplomatic missions inviting Ambassadors to 
participate.  We did not respond.  The EU ambassadors 
discussed the invitation, according to an official at the 
British Embassy, but declined due to the late hour of the 
invitation and lack of minimum conditions to mount a credible 
observation mission.  The Mexican DCM participated in the 
observation but refused to join the statement due to concerns 
that the observers did not have sufficient access to truly 
pass judgment on the elections.  (Note: It was for similar 
reasons that the EU did not observe the presidential recall 
referendum.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) In addition to the five branches of the GOV, President 
Hugo Chavez now has control of nearly all state and 80% of 
local governments.  GOV domination of the regions raises 
questions about the future health of decentralized and 
pluralistic government in Venezuela.  This is a devastating 
loss of political space for Chavez opponents, who make up at 
least 40 percent of the Venezuelan electorate.  Rosales 
appears to be the last man standing in the opposition, but he 
is a regional star with baggage from his AD roots as well as 
from his apparent support of the short-lived administration 
of Pedro Carmona during the April 2002 coup.  He may, in 
fact, be the perfect candidate for Chavez to beat in the 2006 
elections.  For the MVR, with overwhelming control of the 
government will come increased responsibility and the need to 
satisfy voters.

Summary

1.  (C)  According to Jose Rafael Gomez, a former 
Presidential staffer who participated in Vice President 
Rangel\'s recent trip to Moscow, the Venezuelan-Russian deal 
for MI-17 helicopters is not yet final because of financial 
issues, and might go forward initially at least with a 
limited number.  He thought that the eventual sale of MIG-29 
fighters might go forward in one year.  Gomez also advised 
that he was returning in a senior capacity to Chavez\'s staff. 
 End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Copters  --  Money Issues 
------------------------- 
 
 2.  (C)  In a November 2 conversation, Jose Rafael Gomez 
(see bio below) discussed with econcouns Vice President Jose 
Vicente Rangel\'s October 2-6 trip to Moscow (ref A).  Gomez, 
who participated in the trip, said that arms sales were the 
only matter of substance considered during the visit.  He 
said that the deal to purchase MI-17 helicopters was not, 
despite news reports to the contrary, finalized.  The 
problem, he went on, was the fact that the Russians wanted 
immediate cash payment, while the GOV was seeking softer 
terms. 
 
3.  (C)  Asked about the published accounts that the deal 
could entail counter-trade, i.e. payment of oil from state 
petroleum enterprise PDVSA or aluminum from state industrial 
enterprise CVG, Gomez was skeptical.  He said that these 
state enterprises were strongly resisting the idea that they 
take a hit to their bottom line by giving up assets belonging 
to them in exchange for equipment which would benefit the 
Defense Ministry.  Gomez\'s bottom line:  the GOV would find 
\"a hundred and some odd\" million dollars and buy the first 
ten helicopters.  Others would have to wait.  (Note:  This is 
consistent with Rangel\'s public remarks which spoke of ten 
helicopters.  End note.)  He was doubtful whether any legally 
binding contract would be signed during Chavez\'s short trip 
to Moscow in December. 
 
-------------------------- 
Fighters - Maybe in a Year 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  However, Gomez refused to conclude from the 
difficulties with the helicopter sale that a sale of MIG-29 
fighters (see ref B) was not in the cards.  Paradoxically, he 
suggested, financing was likely to be easier for a big ticket 
fighter purchase than for the helicopters.  He suggested that 
the USG\'s restrictions on upgrades as part of a refit of 
Venezuela\'s existing fleet of F-16\'s and the absence of 
Eximbank financing for arms purchases were pushing the GOV in 
this direction.  Also, the Army, Navy, and National Guard 
were being given funding for equipment purchases and the Air 
Force could not be left behind.  He admitted to some desire 
at the political level to diversify Venezuela\'s defense 
purchasing away from it traditional U.S. orientation, but 
said that there was a strong desire to maintain the range of 
existing U.S. equipment in operable condition.  He thought 
that the MIG-29 initial contract could go forward as quickly 
as within one year. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Bio - A Rising Star at Miraflores 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Gomez, told econcouns that he had been named as 
President Chavez\'s senior staffer (\"jefe del despacho\") for 
inter-institutional affairs, a position, he said in which 
protocol, scheduling, and substantive follow-up with 
ministries would come under his authority.  Earlier in the 
Chavez administration, he had served as a lower ranking 
staffer (\"commisionado\") in the Presidency where he had had 
some contact with the Embassy.  More recently he has been in 
the private sector as a \"consultant,\" while retaining 
 
informal ties to the GOV.  (He showed econcouns a Defense 
Ministry identification badge, in which he had the title of 
\"ambassador.\")   It has been suggested to us that Gomez, 
while in the private sector, was involved in the emerging 
Russian helicopter deal, and may yet profit from it.  Gomez, 
a former Army cadet, said  that Chavez had been his 
instructor.  He is 38, and separated from his wife and 
children who live in Miami.  He has a valid U.S. B1/B2 visa. 
He advised that he has studied at Harvard\'s Kennedy School, 
and that his father had worked for the United Nations, 
including at the Economic Commission for Latin America and 
the Caribbean (CEPAL/ECLAC) in Chile. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  Gomez, whom econcouns met through a business 
contact, repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. to resume 
Eximbank programs as a way to maintain relations with the 
Armed Forces and to signal the USG\'s desire for improved 
relations.  He appeared a bit surprised at the suggestion 
that the USG might want to see some signals from the 
Venezuelan side.  Career, money, and personal ties appear to 
bind him to Chavez\'s \"revolution\" rather than ideology. 
 
----------- 
DAO Comment 
----------- 
 
7.  (C)  If Venezuela immediately starts the acquisition 
process for the MIGs, we believe it would take at a minimum 
one year before an actual contract is signed and at least two 
more years before Venezuela receives the MIGs and up to three 
years before the full fleet is delivered and personnel are 
trained to a minimum level of competence.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  At a November 10 luncheon with the Ambassador, 
Finance Minister Nobrega touched on a range of issues 
including:  Eximbank lending (he\'d like it to return, but 
downplays the impact of its absence); the GOV\'s surprise 
increase in petroleum royalties (he admits it was badly 
handled); Ministry-Central Bank relations (he\'s all for the 
Bank\'s independence, but it should do what he is asking); 
foreign exchange (he still wants to move to a dual rate); and 
the political environment (he will need to fight to maintain 
a measure of fiscal discipline).  He was concerned about 
still strained Venezuelan-U.S. relations.  The Ambassador 
stressed that USG policies were pragmatic, but principled and 
that he saw the economic area as one were progress was 
possible.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Eximbank and OPIC 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) On November 10, the Ambassador, accompanied by 
econcouns, lunched with Finance Minister Tobias Nobrega and 
his senior advisor Ali Lenin Aguilera.  The Ambassador led 
off by saying that on financial issues there were few areas 
of conflict between our two governments.  Nobrega agreed, 
stating that while the U.S. Export-Import Bank\'s \"delay\" in 
returning Venezuela to \"on-cover\" status was unfortunate, and 
was paralleled by similar policies among European credit 
agencies, the impact on Venezuela\'s ability to obtain 
financing was minimal.  The end result, he said, was that for 
certain equipment, Venezuelan customers turned to Brazilian, 
Indian, or Chinese suppliers. 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador agreed that such restrictions hurt 
both the U.S., which lost a potential market, and Venezuela, 
which lost opportunities to obtain products from preferred 
sources at advantageous terms.  However, he went on, 
relations between Venezuela and Eximbank and its sister 
agency OPIC depended in large measure on resolving specific 
issues.  In particular, he mentioned, OPIC\'s payment of an 
expropriation claim to U.S. firm SAIC as a result of state 
oil producer PDVSA\'s unilateral dissolution of their joint 
venture INTESA posed a problem.  While recognizing this was 
outside of Nobrega\'s direct responsibilities, he urged all 
effort to find a way to address this case. 
 
------------- 
Oil Royalties 
------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Nobrega asked the Ambassador how serious had been 
the fall-out from the GOV\'s unilateral increase in the 
royalty rates it received from the international oil 
companies for their Orinoco heavy oil production.  The 
Ambassador said that he had made clear the USG position. 
While Venezuela, like any other country, has the sovereign 
right to determine its own tax and royalty policies, the GOV 
is also bound by its international agreements and contracts. 
U.S. firms\' evaluation of the investment climate is affected 
by this kind of unpleasant surprise, which in their view runs 
contrary to specific contractual obligations assumed by the 
GOV.  They will have to determine what legal remedies, if any 
they have available to them.  Nobrega said that he thought 
the increase had been handled poorly, and said that, coming 
as it did before the recent gubernatorial elections, 
seemingly had been undertaken with an internal political 
motivation.  He observed that he himself had been surprised 
by this, as he has been by other decisions announced in the 
past on President Chavez\'s Sunday \"Alo, Presidente\" 
television show, such as the decrease in value-added tax, 
which he himself had opposed.  Despite the royalty flap, he 
insisted that Venezuela would remain open to international 
petroleum investment, and that the management of state oil 
concern PDVSA increasingly wanted a big PDVSA, producing more 
oil, and that this inevitably would mean more deals with 
foreign companies. 
 
 
------------ 
Central Bank 
------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Asked about his motivations for pressing the Central 
Bank to recalculate upwards the local currency profits 
generated by exchange rate devaluations which it was 
obligated to remit to the GOV, Nobrega said, that the Central 
Bank\'s management was hiding behind fallacious legal and 
accounting arguments.  Basically \"they are fanatical 
monetarists\" and are convinced that if the local currency is 
introduced into the economy there will be a big rise in 
inflation, despite all indications to the contrary under 
current economic circumstances.  In any event, the Bank is 
obligated to obey the law.  That said, he professed himself 
to be a supporter of Central Bank autonomy, and one of those 
who pressed to include it in the 1999 constitution.  He said 
that expiring terms meant there would be changes in Central 
Bank leadership.  He dismissed rumors that he would take over 
the Bank Presidency; a finance minister\'s moving to the 
Central Bank, he said would \"look bad.\"

Forex 
----- 
 
6.  (C)  Asked whether he was satisfied with the 
administration of foreign exchange controls, Nobrega said 
that he remained opposed to their indefinite retention, and 
preferred to move to a dual rate, while retaining reasonable 
reporting and control requirements for exchange flows such as 
those imposed by Brazil.  (Comment:  Planning Minister 
Giordani is a big fan of controls and thus far has thwarted 
Finance Ministry efforts to move to a dual rate from the 
current system under which there is rationing of foreign 
exchange at a fixed, preferential rate by the Foreign 
Exchange Administration Commission (CADIVI) and a parallel 
market with a freely set rate existing in a quasi-legal 
limbo.  End comment.) 
 
-------------------- 
Finance and Politics 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Nobrega suggested that continued high oil prices 
meant that Chavez was likely to remain highly popular and 
gain re-election in 2006.  He himself wanted to concentrate 
on reforming Venezuela\'s cumbersome tax law during the next 
year and on assuring sufficient savings to allow public 
finances to withstand any eventual weakening in oil prices. 
The current political environment, in which the absence of a 
viable opposition tended to encourage internal divisions 
among and within pro-Chavez parties made his task difficult, 
but he was prepared to be tough, and if necessary, become a 
sacrifice and \"take that long vacation I have earned\" if that 
would accomplish his ends.  He said that he would like to see 
improvement in the diplomatic front to match the progress on 
the economic front; strained Venezuelan-U.S. relations 
remained worrying.  The Ambassador said that USG policy was 
pragmatic, without ceding on areas of principle, and that 
economic and commercial issues were ones where hopefully 
progress could be made.

Comment

8.  (C)  Nobrega was evidently concerned about the impact of 
the oil royalties increase.  (He and Energy Minister Ramirez 
have repeatedly crossed swords in the past, most recently 
about putting the large PDVSA \"social investment\" 
contribution under normal budget discipline.  Nobrega has 
only partially won that battle.)  For the rest, he was 
upbeat, as befits a Venezuelan finance minister at a time of 
high oil prices.  His asserted commitment to fiscal 
discipline, while perhaps genuine in comparison with the 
position of other members of the GOV, rings a bit hollow in 
view of the continued populist spending policies at the heart 
of Chavez,s political and economic model.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) October and August electoral successes have renewed 
President Hugo Chavez\'s mandate, placed his loyalists in most 
of the governorships and key mayoralties, and positioned the 
Chavista movement to capture an overwhelming majority in next 
year\'s National Assembly elections.  Chavez supporters say 
that, with the opposition atomized and oil prices sky high, 
they have few excuses for not advancing the Bolivarian 
Revolution.  Chavez has denounced an inefficient and corrupt 
bureaucracy as the reason benefits are not reaching people. 
Pro-Chavez governors, many of them ex-military, are calling 
for radical overhauls of state governments, including the 
rapid integration of GOV \"mission\" programs into previously 
opposition-controlled areas.  Political persecution of the 
remaining opponents -- such as the media and Sumate -- also 
appears to be in the Chavista tool box.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Bolivarian Expansion 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) With President Hugo Chavez\'s victory in the August 15 
recall referendum and the subsequent sweep by his candidates 
of the October 31 gubernatorial and mayoral elections, Chavez 
now dominates government in Venezuela (refs a and b).  Nine 
of the 23 governors are retired military officers with ties 
to Chavez.  In addition, the executive continues to exercise 
controlling influence over Venezuela\'s other branches of 
government.  With opposition political parties beaten 59-41% 
in the referendum and 63-37% in the regional elections, the 
Chavistas\' prospects for next year\'s National Assembly 
elections are favorable.  Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) 
Deputy Saul Ortega told poloff November 2 that pro-Chavez 
parties hope to increase their majority, though achieving a 
two-thirds majority would be difficult.  Opposition deputies 
fear the Chavistas could win between 120 and 135 of the 165 
deputy positions, giving Chavez a ready two-thirds majority. 
 
--------------- 
No More Excuses 
--------------- 
 
3. (C) Chavez has called for sobriety in the wake of the 
regional elections victory.  He told the newly elected 
officials on November 1 it was time to close ranks and fight 
to the death against corruption, bureaucracy, and 
inefficiency, \"three vices that threaten the Bolivarian 
Revolution.\"  Chavez emphasized the point by adding \"the 
greatest enemy of the revolution is no longer the U.S., it is 
bureaucracy.\"  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said on 
November 5 that now there are no excuses not to govern. 
Opposition voices immediately seized on the GOV message, 
suggesting Rangel was admitting that Chavez had not governed 
for the last five years.  Chavez and other GOV leaders have 
stated that they must try to win over the four million 
persons who voted for the opposition.  Christian Democrat 
(COPEI) Deputy Cesar Perez Vivas told reporters November 5 
that governance was now the exclusive responsibility of the 
MVR, adding that no type of hegemony is healthy for any 
society.  Rangel noted that \"to govern without an opposition 
is the most annoying thing in the world,\" and called for new 
leadership from within the opposition \"capable of dialogue 
with the government.\" 
 
-------------- 
Change is Good 
-------------- 
 
4. (C) The \"three vices\" -- corruption, bureaucracy, and 
inefficiency -- have become the mantra for the newly elected 
pro-Chavez governors and mayors.  Upon taking office, most 
denounced their predecessors for allegQ administrative 
irregularities.  In Miranda State, for example, Governor 
 
Diosdado Cabello declared the health and education sectors to 
be in a state of emergency.  Cabello\'s supporters on Miranda 
State\'s legislative council told reporters they are 
considering granting Cabello power to legislate by decree. 
Patria Para Todos (PPT), the third largest pro-Chavez party, 
has staked out its role as the GOV conscience.  PPT Secretary 
General Jose Albornoz told poloff November 4 his party is 
organizing \"brigades\" in every state and municipality to 
monitor government programs and spending.  Alberto \"Chino\" 
Carias, an aide to incoming Metropolitan Caracas Mayor Juan 
Barreto, told poloff November 5 they planned to use \"social 
intelligence\" networks whereby political sympathizers inform 
on the misconduct of police and, in the case of public 
hospitals, medical personnel.  Carias, a member of the 
radical Tupamaro armed political group, also said he is 
participating in a committee to restructure and \"improve the 
image\" of the Metropolitan Police. 
 
5. (U) Pro-Chavez elected leaders in previously held 
opposition areas are rushing to integrate the GOV\'s various 
\"mission\" programs into state and local government plans.  In 
Metropolitan Caracas, for example, officials plan to convert 
existing public health clinics into outpatient care offices 
of Barrio Adentro, the medical assistance program operated by 
Cuban personnel in poor neighborhoods.  One of the first acts 
in office of Monagas State Governor Jose Gregorio Briceno was 
to invite the Cuban doctors of Barrio Adentro into all state 
hospitals and clinics, asserting that \"exclusion and 
stinginess\" had ended in his state.  In Miranda, state 
officials announced that all state schools would be 
integrated into the \"Bolivarian School\" program, which 
reportedly adds a revolutionary slant to subject matter.  The 
officials also announced that school facilities would soon be 
opened to Missions Robinson and Rivas (primary and secondary 
education for adults). 
 
---------------------------------- 
If They Don\'t Join You, Beat Them! 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The GOV continues to intimidate potential Chavez 
opponents using state powers.  Outgoing Metropolitan Caracas 
Mayor Alfredo Pena is in hiding (rumored to be in Miami) 
after charges that he misappropriated funds and was the 
intellectual author of killings during the events of April 
2002 (ref c).  Representatives of the NGO Sumate continue to 
face conspiracy charges, though the case has been delayed by 
an intervention from the Supreme Court (ref d).  Political 
crimes prosecutor Danilo Anderson is also working his way 
through the lists of people the GOV associates with the April 
2002 coup and the so-called Carmona Decree.  Coordinadora 
Democratica operations chief Enrique Naime was \"escorted\" by 
GOV intelligence police (DISIP) to court in the early morning 
of November 9, where he was fined for defamation of National 
Electoral Council officials in statements he made during the 
2000 mega-elections.  Furthermore, the pro-Chavez majority in 
the National Assembly is also proceeding at full steam on 
approving the Social Responsibility Law, which threatens to 
restrict what private television and radio outlets can 
report. 
 
------------------ 
Chavez Lays It Out 
------------------ 
 
7. (U) In an interview aired on state television on November 
11, Chavez  spelled out the lines his government after the 
August and October victories.  Quoted in the pro-GOV daily 
Diario Vea, Chavez said the Bolivarian Revolution would have: 
 
-- strengthened popular organizations, such as the \"electoral 
patrols\" and \"electoral battle units\"; 
-- new GOV institutions with social dimensions, such as the 
new Popular Economy Ministry; 
-- a humanistic \"social economy\" transcending the \"perverse\" 
capitalist model; 
-- increased production through \"endogenous hubs\"; 
-- a multipolar foreign policy, accelerated with Chavez\'s 
upcoming visits to Spain, Russia, China, and Iran; 
-- development of a new military structure; 
-- an electoral strategy in which pro-government political 
parties should elect their candidates; 
-- the creation of a new \"Anticorruption Moral Power\"; and 
-- a more efficient communications strategy incorporating 
 
community broadcasters. 
 
------------------------- 
Comment:  Happy Red Year! 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) With high oil revenues added to this rosy scenario, 
expectations among Chavez supporters are high; a state 
television program host even ends his show \"Feliz Ano Rojo!\" 
or \"Happy Red Year!\".  Chavez is consolidating his base and 
pinning down his enemies.  He has protected his flanks in his 
own political parties by having in governorships nine 
ex-military colleagues and his father, who are more loyal to 
Chavez than to the MVR.  The newly elected Chavistas are not 
shying away from the central government, which we expect will 
further dominate the Venezuelan political scene.  While some 
GOV leaders are counseling reflection and prudence in flexing 
their new muscle, the Bolivarian Revolution is indeed rolling 
along.  There remains pending, however, a clear definition of 
what that revolution really means, other than a collection of 
reformist and populist measures as determined by Chavez 
himself.  There are signs of jockeying among the pro-Chavez 
parties, but no serious indications so far of infighting 
among Chavez\'s core team.  Absent an external economic shock 
or major social unrest, it looks like smooth sailing for 
President Chavez -- but as the GOV admits, now it has to 
govern and to fulfill the expectations of the 60 percent who 
voted for Chavez.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  With his pockets full of petro-dollars, Chavez has 
created new Ministries of Food, Housing, Popular Economy, and 
Development Finance.  He is also moving forward with the 
creation of a new state airline and a telecommunications 
enterprise.  The establishment of the Ministries of Food and 
Housing appear to be aimed at providing an additional impulse 
and a stronger institutional base for signature oil-funded 
GOV anti-poverty programs.  The Popular Economy and 
Development Finance Ministries reflect the Bolivarian 
government\'s belief in stimulating growth (and obtaining 
political dividends) through directed state credits, 
especially to cooperatives.  The new aviation and telecoms 
enterprises are a throwback to 1950\'s vintage Latin American 
state capitalism.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Ministry of Food ) Building on a Popular Program 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  (C)  In September, President Chavez announced the 
creation of a new Ministry of Food (\"Alimentacion\") which 
will have as its principal function the administration of the 
GOV,s \"Mercal\" network of subsidized food markets for low 
income consumers.  Mercal had previously been a free-standing 
program, run by the military, with technical support from the 
Ministry of Agriculture.  The new Ministry of Food will also 
take over the operations of the Agricultural Supply and 
Services Corporation (\"CASA,\") an existing para-statal 
corporation previously reporting to the Ministry of 
Agriculture.  It had originally existed to operate 
state-owned silos and other food storage facilities, but 
under Chavez had become a purchasing agency for the imports 
required to fill the Mercal shelves.  The Ministry will also 
have responsibility for the Strategic Food Program (\"PROAL\"), 
a military-run program which distributes free food baskets 
and maintains soup kitchens for the neediest.  The new 
minister is General Jose Rafael Oropeza, who had previously 
served as head of the Mercal program. 
 
3.  (C)  Tomas Socias, chief of governmental relations for 
agri-business giant Cargill, told econcouns that the 
Ministry\'s creation of the Ministry of Food was an effort to 
improve coordination in a program that has become crucial to 
the GOV\'s overall anti-poverty strategy and key to the rise 
in Chavez\'s political fortunes over the last year.  Socias 
added that there had been constant in-fighting between CASA 
and Mercal management as well as consistent reports of 
corruption.  That said, however, he noted that Mercal and 
CASA programs have already moved far beyond their initial 
improvised aspect.  He had visited the Ministry\'s offices 
(formerly Mercal\'s), which had an elaborate, bustling 
operations center, and a large staff, with several Cubans 
present.  (Cuban state food purchasing agency Alimport has 
had a close relationship with Mercal and CASA).  The Mercal 
program, with more than 200 retail stores, plus a network of 
smaller \"Mercalitos\" run out of individual homes and corner 
stores, may be supplying 20-30 pct of national demand in some 
sectors such as cooking oil. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Ministry of Housing ) Re-starting a Shut-Down Sector 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (C)  At the same time as he announced the creation of the 
Ministry of Food, Chavez also unveiled a new Ministry of 
Housing, which would have responsibility for overseeing the 
existing National Housing Institute (INAVI), as well as  the 
Urban Development Fund (FONDUR).  The former is roughly the 
equivalent of the U.S. Federal Housing Authority, providing 
funding to commercial banks to support mortgage lending.  The 
latter has directly constructed low-income housing.  Both 
previously reported to the Ministry of Infrastructure, which 
also covers transportation, telecommunications and public 
works.  Chavez nominated as Minister Julio Montes, a 
 
 
long-time Chavez confidant who had served as Minister of 
Infrastructure, Ambassador to Cuba and Presidential chief of 
staff. (In none of these positions was he considered an 
especially strong figure.)  The Housing Ministry will be a 
\"ministry of state,\" enjoying a lesser status than a 
full-scale ministry. 
 
5.  (C)  What the new ministry will accomplish is unclear. 
The Chavez administration has admitted that it has been slow 
to resolve the \"housing deficit\" of 1.6 million dwellings 
that the country requires.  According to one private sector 
analyst, during the period of 1999-2003 an average of 20,000 
new homes were built per year, compared with 60,000 per year 
during the period of 1994-1998.  The Ministry will have the 
advantage of counting on resources from state oil company 
PDVSA, which has already staked out housing as one of the 
areas in which, through its Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation 
(CVP) subsidiary, it is engaged in \"social investment.\" 
Coordinating the Ministry\'s and PDVSA\'s activities in this 
area will be an important challenge. 
 
6.  (C)  The creation of the Ministry has been hailed by the 
Venezuelan Construction Chamber, the building industry\'s 
trade association (historically one of the less militantly 
anti-Chavez business groups).  Chamber President Alvaro Sucre 
told econcouns that he saw the creation of the Ministry as an 
effort to revive the one sector, construction, which has 
failed to participate in the recovery that the partial return 
of oil production, together with high prices, has encouraged 
elsewhere, and he was hopeful that important new resources 
would be dedicated to the sector.  The president of large 
commercial bank BANESCO was less optimistic, telling 
econcouns that, when representatives of the Banking 
Association had met with Chavez, discussion had centered on 
revitalizing lending for housing, and the banks had submitted 
their own plans for this sector.  However, he was convinced 
that the GOV would take the plans, and use them to design its 
own mechanisms which would channel housing finance through 
state-owned institutions, shutting the private banks out. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Two More Ministries ) The Lending Window is Open 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (C)  Chavez also re-organized the ministerial 
responsibilities for a range of state banks and institutes 
which lend money for non-housing-related development 
purposes.  Previously the range of institutions running 
credit programs, large and small, had reported to Nelson 
Merentes, Minister of Social Economy, and, more importantly, 
head of the large National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development (BANDES).  However, the smaller programs 
dedicated to micro-enterprise, i.e., the Bank of the 
Sovereign People, the Women\'s Bank, and the Micro-financial 
Development Fund, will now report to a new \"Ministry of 
Popular Economy,\" as will the National Job Training Institute 
(INCE), previously located within the Ministry of Education, 
and the Superintendency of Cooperatives (previously found in 
the Ministry of Education). 
 
8.  (C)  The new Ministry of Popular Economy (a \"ministry of 
state\" rather than a than a full ministry), will be headed by 
Elias Jaua, a former student radical, who is currently 
\"Director of Ideology\" for the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR), 
the principal pro-Chavez political party.    He also 
currently serves as head of the \"Inter-governmental 
Decentralization Fund,\" a GOV entity which distributes funds 
to the states, separate from constitutionally mandated 
revenue sharing.  He briefly served as Chavez\'s chief of 
staff.  (Comment:  As head of the Ministry of Popular 
Economy, he will be well placed to promote a key ideological 
and political interest of the GOV --  the promotion of 
cooperatives of small farmers and artisans, as an alternative 
to a less desirable mode of production  -- the medium- or 
large-scale business or ranch run by the garden-variety 
capitalist.  The cooperative sector, ever dependent on GOV 
credit, of course, also provides a new political clientele 
with its interests tied directly to the Bolivarian 
government.  End comment.) 
 
 
9.  (C)  While the Ministry of Social Economy will disappear, 
Merentes, however, will continue to hold ministerial rank, as 
Minister for Development Financing, a position in which 
BANDES and other larger state financial entities such as the 
Industrial Bank of Venezuela (the state-owned commercial 
bank), and the Bank for Andean Regional Development 
(BANFOANDES) will report to him.  This ministry too will be a 
ministry of state.  (Note:  Merentes, who served as Minister 
of Finance before being forced to resign in a shake-up 
following a scandal relating to the transfer of funds from 
the GOV\'s Macro-economic Stabilization Fund to the 
ministry,s budget, remains a person of substance within the 
GOV, all the more so as he had an important role in the 
organization of Chavez\'s successful campaign to defeat the 
recall referendum.  End note.) 
 
---------------------------------------- 
CONVIASA --  Flying the Bolivarian Skies 
---------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  The GOV has established a new, state-owned 
passenger airline - CONVIASA (Venezuelan Consortium of 
Aviation Industries and Services).  Its name deliberately 
evokes that of VIASA, once Venezuela\'s leading airline, which 
had originally been founded by private investors, but which 
had taken over by the GOV (under President Caldera), run into 
the ground, partially sold off to Spanish carrier Iberia, and 
ultimately closed down.  CONVIASA is headed by Minister of 
Production and Commerce Wilmer Castro, a former Air Force 
officer who participated in Chavez\'s failed 1992 coup, who 
after Chavez took office in 1998 served briefly as president 
of a small bankrupt air carrier which the GOV had taken over, 
and then as Vice Minister for Tourism. 
 
11.  (C)  CONVIASA, which is supposed to be in the air by 
December 2004, has as of now, one aircraft, a 47 seat Dash 7, 
provided in trust by the Navy, which, we understand had been 
largely used in the past to transport senior officers and 
their families to tourist destinations within Venezuela. 
CONVIASA reportedly has been in conversations with Airbus and 
General Electric Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) about 
renting other craft.  The first route is expected to be 
between Caracas and Margarita.  Grander plans outlined in the 
press include eventual flights to foreign destinations in the 
Caribbean, the Andes, and elsewhere in South America, as well 
as the U.S. and Europe.  The 2004 budget includes USD 20 
million for the state firm\'s operations, and USD 8.3 million 
reportedly is coming from the off-budget social 
infrastructure fund created from earnings from PDVSA. 
 
------------------------------ 
CVG Telecom - GOV As Cable Guy 
------------------------------ 
 
12.  (C)  As in civil aviation, the GOV is looking to return 
to another \"strategic\" industry - telecommunications - 
through the \"Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana\" (CVG), the 
steel, aluminum, and electricity generation para-statal based 
in eastern Venezuela.  A new entity, \"CVG 
Telecomunicaciones,\" has been created with the ultimate aim 
of providing an alternative to CANTV, the former state-owned 
telecoms carrier, now privatized (29 pct owned by U.S. 
company Verizon).  CVG Telecom\'s principal asset is the 5000 
kilometers of right-of-way suitable for fiber optic cable 
which its subsdiary, electricity generator and transmitter 
EDELCA owns.  CVG\'s secretary general told econcouns that CVG 
Telecom would partner with an international telephone company 
which would provide needed capital and technology.  Expanding 
telephone services to underserved rural areas would be an 
important part of the new entity\'s mission, he added. 
 
13.  (C)  Our private sector contacts are skeptical about the 
prospects for CVG Telecom.  They note that CANTV\'s 
privatization has led to enormous improvements from the 
extremely poor level of service which the firm had provided 
when it was state-owned, and see a new state corporation as a 
step back.  Ricardo Baquero, President of CASATEL, the 
telecommunications industry association, suggested that CVG 
Telecom would have an unfair advantage; while there was 
nothing in Venezuelan law which prevented it from being set 
up, it would inevitably use CVG\'s resources and 
 
legal/political clout to obtain market share.  Billionaire 
Oswaldo Cisneros, who holds a minority interest in cellular 
provider TELCEL, was more sanguine.  Only 1228 kilometers of 
fiber-optic cable was already laid on EDELCA rights of way, 
\"leading from one unpopulated location to another,\" he told 
econcouns.  He suggested it would be a long time before CVG 
Telecom provided any meaningful competition.  For its part, 
CANTV has maintained a rigorous silence on the issue of the 
new para-statal. 
 
---------------------------- 
Comment - Back to the Future 
---------------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  The creation of new ministries and state 
corporations obeys the usual mix of ideological and 
straightforwardly political motives that dominate so much of 
the Chavez government\'s economic decision-making.  The 
creation of a Ministry of Popular Economy oriented towards 
cooperatives is a perfect example.  And the re-creation of 
state telecoms and aviation enterprises is a return to the 
vision of 50 years ago when it was held that the \"commanding 
heights\" of the economy had to be in state hands to assure 
their rational development.  We also suspect a continuing 
concern within the GOV about having these strategic sectors 
largely in the hands of foreign (American) firms.  As for the 
creation of the Ministries of Food and Housing, here there 
may be a simple recognition of necessity.  Having identified 
these as key areas in which Chavez is supposed to be 
providing his low-income constituency with significant 
benefits, aided by the oil bonanza, he has chosen that tried 
and true remedy of chief executives the world over ) create 
a new bureaucracy. 
 
14.  (C)  Of course, this is Venezuela, and a considerable 
deflator must be applied to either the benefits or the damage 
to be done by these new ministries and state corporations. 
Our aviation and telecommunications contacts seem unimpressed 
by the threat posed by CONVIASA and CVG Telecom, which will 
require huge injections of capital if they are to become 
viable.  The cooperatives that the Ministry of Popular 
Economy is sponsoring still are far from challenging the 
private sector in most areas of the economy.  The Ministry of 
Food\'s Mercal program, which indeed is challenging normal 
distribution channels, and any future initiatives of the 
Ministry of Housing are entirely dependent upon petroleum 
money staying available.  As of now, Chavez,s new economic 
ministries are more an inefficient overlay on Venezuela,s 
unsuccessful economy than a major transformation.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s Coordinadora Democratica, the 
amalgamation of opponents to President Hugo Chavez that had 
begun to disintegrate before the regional elections on 
October 31, has been deemed dead by opposition parties and 
Chavez supporters alike.   Many opposition members, who tend 
to blame the government for cheating and fault Washington for 
abandoning them, have been too preoccupied with their bad 
fortune to plan a rebound from the drubbing they had expected 
in the regionals.  Some Chavez opponents predict an 
undemocratic end to his rule; others believe internal 
fissures already have his government on the brink of 
collapse.  While opposition party members muse about new 
interparty alliances, policies, and strategies, the 
opposition is not making a serious effort to cooperate and 
may encounter more setbacks before being able to mount a 
serious challenge.  In the meantime, the administration will 
have to answer for more now that it controls most of the 
government authorities.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Disunity and Disarray 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The union of Venezuelan political parties and 
interest groups opposing President Hugo Chavez, which had 
begun to unhinge before the regional elections on October 31, 
has disintegrated.  On November 2, Accion Democratica (AD) 
president Henry Ramos Allup publicly declared the 
opposition\'s Coordinadora Democratica (CD) \"finished.\" 
Social Christian Party (COPEI) deputy secretary general Cesar 
Perez Vivas confirmed to poloff the following day that the CD 
had outlived its usefulness.  Primero Justicia (PJ) had 
broken with the CD in late September because, according to a 
PJ official in Tachira State, the PJ\'s involvement merely had 
bolstered rival opposition parties on the verge of folding. 
Smaller parties such as Causa R and Alianza Bravo Pueblo 
(ABP) also had walked in late September over their refusal to 
participate in elections viewed as rigged, according to 
press. 
 
3.  (C)  Chavez opponents expected the President\'s candidates 
would dominate on October 31, but few were considering any 
strategy to rebound from the losses.  Indeed, parties were 
still divided over short-term tactics.  For example, no 
consensus existed within parties over whether their 
candidates should remain in regional elections, although most 
of the opposition ended up supporting participation.  In some 
cases, such disagreements led to internal party fractures; 
Proyecto Venezuela leader Henrique Salas Roemer dismissed 
Luis Carlos Rubio for dropping out of the Anzoategui 
gubernatorial race, according to a member of the CD\'s 
political committee. 
 
------- 
Pouters 
------- 
 
4.  (C)  The most common trait among opposition supporters is 
an inability to look past recent setbacks.  Chavez\'s 
opponents focused on rehashing examples of alleged 
governmental election fraud, the trumped-up criminal charges 
brought against fellow Chavez opponents, and other abuses to 
discussing ways to exploit Chavez\'s political 
miscalculations.  Alfredo Coronil, AD\'s national secretary of 
international affairs, told poloff nearly 90 percent of the 
country opposed communism, but when asked why the opposition 
did not try to turn public opinion against oil loans to Cuba, 
Coronil merely resumed bashing Chavez\'s foreign policy. 
Coronil said Venezuela\'s former enthusiasm for democracy had 
dissipated into unprecedented apathy. 
 
   5.  (C)  Some dispirited Chavez opponents expect the 
United States to rescue Venezuela.  Most Chavez opponents 
resent the Carter Center\'s endorsement of the referendum 
process, and many convey distrust of the Embassy\'s appeals 
for better bilateral relations.  National Assembly deputy 
 
Alfonso Marquina (AD) questioned poloff October 18 whether 
the United States really cared about civil rights in 
Venezuela.  On October 5, the alarmist political analyst 
Isabel Bacalao, who heads the think tank \"Servicios de 
Informacion Estrategica,\" lamented to poloff that the US had 
lost its ability and willingness to influence Venezuela. 
 
--------------- 
Chicken Littles 
--------------- 
 
      6.  (C)  Another view among opposition members is that 
Chavez is here to stay until he is overthrown.  Of these 
skeptics, many privately justify rebellion by citing article 
350 of the constitution, which provides for the public 
disavowal of antidemocratic or abusive leaders.  Some expect 
imminent violence, such as retired Vice Admiral Rafael Huizi, 
who told poloff in early October that unidentified military 
officers would stage a coup if the administration ignored the 
release of the CD\'s election fraud report (REFTEL) on October 
12. 
 
---------- 
Pollyannas 
---------- 
 
7.  (C)  A final opposition school of thought is that 
Chavismo is soon to collapse on its own.  Bacalao sees hints 
of desperation in pro-government media broadcasts and Chavez 
speeches that point to the administration\'s lack of control 
over the military.  Those opposition figures who dismiss 
Chavez\'s influence also tend to be confident of his 
opponents\' cohesion.  Chain emails announcing imminent, 
overwhelming street demonstrations circulate with such 
frequency that the radical pro-Chavez website www.aporrea.com 
prints them in derision. 
 
---------- 
Tacticians 
---------- 
 
   8.  (U)  A few politicians have considered the future of 
the opposition.  AD international affairs secretary Coronil 
said he envisioned a coalition of social democratic parties, 
to include AD, COPEI, Movement toward Socialism (MAS), and 
ABP.  His homologue in COPEI, Sadio Garavini, told poloff 
November 5 the same, although he consigned AD to another 
imaginary alliance because it was too left-leaning.  Causa R 
leader Andres Velazquez told poloff before the regionals he 
was considering a new leftist opposition bloc, and press 
reports on November 2 said ABP leader Antonio Ledezma had 
proposed a new opposition front, as well.  PJ and Causa R 
announced November 15 they would unite in a 8-member National 
Assembly bloc that they hoped would grow into a political 
alliance, according to press. 
 
      9.  (C)  Even fewer opposition figures have articulated 
a shift in platform.  Marquina, who is AD\'s floor leader in 
the National Assembly, told poloff before the regionals that 
most voters were interested in employment, not civil rights 
issues.  Reflecting on the \"it\'s the economy, stupid\" slogan, 
Marquina said the most important issues in Venezuela involved 
the people\'s empty stomachs.  PJ representatives in 
Anzoategui on October 26 also told poloff that the people 
were most interested in poverty alleviation.  An assistant to 
MVR National Assembly deputy Luis Tascon in early October 
privately credited PJ for engaging with lower-class 
neighborhoods. 
 
      10.  (C)  Primero Justicia, whose officials in Tachira 
and Anzoategui told poloffs they were more concerned about 
the 2005 National Assembly elections, is perhaps the only 
party to have formulated a post-regional election strategy. 
PJ backers said they wanted to show effective management and 
service provision in a few key mayoralties, from which they 
would radiate outward.  Anzoategui PJ backers won a local 
race with the campaign slogan \"just like in Baruta and 
Chacao,\" which refers to two relatively clean, safe, 
upper-class Caracas municipalities run by PJ mayors.  A 
Tachira PJ representative said PJ would concentrate on 
educating party members before the National Assembly 
elections next summer. 
 
      ------- 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C)  No serious interparty dialog about opposition unity 
is occurring yet.  Most opposition members are too focused on 
feeling sorry for themselves to plan for the future.  Because 
government coffers almost exclusively finance political 
campaigns in Venezuela, we may even see more splits as some 
opposition members approach the government seeking to cut 
deals to recoup financial losses.  PJ may be the only party 
making a promising effort to distance itself--both by 
choosing its allies and by managing its image--from the 
pre-Chavez past, but the young professionals failed to 
generate much support from Venezuelans at the national level. 
 Despite the Pollyannas\' hopes, Chavez\'s government is highly 
unlikely to implode anytime soon.  Nonetheless, the 
electorate now will have mostly Chavistas to blame for 
underemployment, public insecurity, and scarce government 
services.  Chavismo may begin to face a bigger threat from 
within as pro-government officials compete for spoils in the 
regions. 
 
12.  (C)  The splintering of the opposition reflects the fact 
that the opposition was a coalition of disparate groups 
united only by the prospect of defeating Chavez.  As a 
coalition, the opposition groups excelled in organizing the 
signature collection drive (thanks to Sumate) but were less 
adroit in responding to Chavez and in offering a credible 
alternative to Chavez. 
 
13.  (C)  The challenge to opposition groups remains that of 
presenting a credible alternative to Chavez and the MVR in 
the 2005 National Assembly elections and the 2006 
presidential elections.  New leaders need to emerge, and 
parties need to get in touch with their supporters, before 
there can be progress towards opposition unity.

ND D. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) U.S. Treasury representative for South America Mathew 
Haarsager visited Caracas from November 2-5, and in a series 
of meetings with the Venezuelan private and public sectors 
was treated to a variety of perspectives.  GOV officials 
asserted that, with the strike, presidential referendum, and 
regional elections behind them, high fiscal spending would 
continue to create sustained economic growth.  Private sector 
representatives, while acknowledging that economic indicators 
are currently healthy, believe that short-term growth depends 
entirely on maintaining current oil prices, and long-term 
growth will require the unlikely occurrence of structural 
reforms.  Multilateral lenders are trying to avoid any 
appearance of controversy, even if that means reducing their 
portfolios in Venezuela and not pressing the GOV to make 
needed reforms.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
GOV - NO MORE TROUBLE 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) GOV officials took the view that things are good, and 
are going to get better.  Guillermo Ortega, General 
Coordinator for Public Policy at the Ministry of Finance, 
emphasized increased non-oil revenues and a drop in debt/GDP 
ratio.  Luis Rafael Quiaro and William Grillet, respectively 
Vice President of Planning and General Manager of the 
state-owned Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES) 
cited the rapid increase of their lending portfolio to small 
businesses in particular.  Jose Rojas, Vice President of 
Finance of state oil corporation PDVSA, noted that it is 
currently contributing about half of 2004 GOV revenue (USD 15 
billion) in taxes and royalties, and added that PDVSA was 
spending close to USD 5 billion more (NOTE: at least USD 2 
billion is off-budget END NOTE) on social/infrastructure 
needs. 
 
3. (C) The GOV officials made it clear that they saw the 
government as the engine of growth for the economy.  Ortega 
said it was essential for expenditure to be sufficient to 
maintain growth, and that the GOV is still trying to bring 
spending up to its desired level.  Quiaro stated that BANDES 
has a special emphasis on micro-credit, especially to spur 
import substitution and in services, but also certain 
domestic \"value chains,\" citing cocoa as an example.  Rojas 
cited PDVSA\'s ability to spend more quickly and efficiently 
than the GOV in general as their contribution to growth. 
Generally, GOV officials emphasized that their development 
strategy - termed \"endogenous growth\" - is based on greater 
state involvement in the economy, import substitution, and 
reliance on domestic resources - ideas that were in vogue in 
the 1950s and 1960s, as freely admitted by Quiaro. 
 
4. (C) Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) directors Domingo Maza 
Zavala (noted for his independence and hence widely seen as a 
thorn in the GOV\'s side) and Bernardo Ferran, while 
recognizing the difficulties of dependence on oil revenues, 
were critical of GOV policy.  They stressed that GOV policy 
is to spend oil revenue now rather than invest it to create 
conditions for growth, a problem shared by previous 
administrations.  They noted that, though Venezuela has never 
suffered from hyperinflation, the current inflation rate is 
much higher than the 40-year average.  They asserted that it 
would be much higher if not for BCV operations.  Maza Zavala 
and Ferran praised the idea of the Macroeconomic 
Stabilization Fund (FEM - a separate account created in 1999 
to save high oil revenues to spend when revenue is low), but 
criticized the GOV for spending what had been saved (NOTE: 
the balance peaked at over USD 7.1 billion in 2001, but is 
currently only USD 708 million), plus increasing debt 
simultaneously.  Finance\'s Ortega, however, thought the FEM 
 
 
needed to be reformed, in part by setting the reference value 
(currently defined as the average of oil revenues for the 
last five calendar years) in real terms rather than nominal. 
A better guide, he said, would be determining the proper 
level of primary expenditure necessary for continued strong 
economic growth and saving anything above that. 
 
-------------------------------- 
PRIVATE SECTOR - WAITING IN VAIN 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Meanwhile, the private sector, after an extended 
period waiting to see if there would be a change in 
administration, is acknowledging that - fairly or not - 
Chavez is firmly in charge until at least 2006, and quite 
possibly more.  There is consensus that GDP growth will 
exceed 12% for 2004 (which still will not be enough to return 
economic output to 2001 levels), and be around 5% in 2005. 
Efrain Velazquez, President of the National Economic Council, 
thinks growth will continue through 2006, as long as oil 
prices remain high.  Inflation is dropping and could be even 
lower (but still above 10%) next year, and foreign exchange 
liquidations are at their highest since exchange controls 
were imposed in January 2003.  (September liquidations were 
more than the 2002 average.)  Alejandro Grisanti, economic 
advisor to Banco Santander, noted that public/private sector 
dialogue to promote growth has begun. 
 
6. (C) However, behind the recognition of good news, there is 
still a call for the GOV to implement structural reform, and 
little hope that it will.  Albis Munoz, President of business 
umbrella group FEDECAMARAS, opined that the public/private 
dialogue would be limited, as neither group trusted each 
other.  She cited continued punitive behavior by the 
Venezuelan tax authority (SENIAT - see reftel) and exchange 
control administration (CADIVI) as examples that political 
retaliation would not end.  She stated that both entities 
were using the list of those who signed in support of the 
presidential referendum as criteria for actions.  Banesco (a 
major private bank) Vice President and Chief Economist Pedro 
Coa noted that, should investors lose confidence in 
short-term GOV/BCV bonds, the money supply could quickly 
double, with terrible inflationary results.  He added that 
the BCV is indeed combating inflation through constant 
sterilization, but having to do so is putting its solvency at 
risk. since they are offering high interest bonds (currently 
over 11%, but some outstanding bonds have rates over 21%) to 
reduce liquidity.  Grisanti opined that increased CADIVI 
liquidations, given the artificially low official exchange 
rate, were like subsidies for the import sector - \"how can 
anyone compete with the price of imports from China?\" - which 
will further undermine local investment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
MULTILATERALS - DON\'T ROCK THE BOAT 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Multilateral development bank lending in Venezuela is 
currently below traditional levels, which local 
representatives attribute to efforts to avoid politically 
sensitive issues.  The World Bank, for example, according to 
consultant Angel Cardenas, does not plan to move forward with 
a new loan to the Venezuelan Supreme Court, despite pleasure 
with the results of a similar project that was recently 
completed, but will seek projects only in areas of 
infrastructure and urban development.  He also mentioned 
being \"afraid (the GOV) would change the rules of the game\" 
as another reason to avoid sensitive loans.  The 
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Andean 
Development Corporation (CAF) also plan to focus on 
infrastructure projects.  IADB rep Roman Mayorga and CAF Vice 
President Fidel Jaramillo both cited inefficiency in the 
public sector as limiting factors for greater disbursement. 
Cardenas added that the GOV thinks it is doing things right, 
and therefore does not want help from multilaterals.  Such 
help would, of course, also require greater transparency. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
 
 
------- 
 
8. (C) The stark disparity between public and private 
perspectives on the future of the Venezuelan economy 
underlines the uncertainty that the country faces.  The GOV 
appears hell-bent on not just spending its oil boom as 
quickly as possible, but taking on new debt to ensure the 
highest possible growth in advance of the 2006 presidential 
elections, ignoring the fact that it will leave Venezuela 
extremely ill-equipped to deal with a fall in oil prices. 
The new \"Bolivarian\" economic model - which is still only 
loosely defined - will also do nothing to address the 
uncompetitiveness of the non-oil sector.  Instead, it 
reverses the trend during the 1990,s toward both 
privatization and decentralization, forces the private sector 
into a position of dependence on the government and gives the 
central government an increasing role in industry and 
commerce, with little concern for efficiency or waste.  At a 
minimum, these mark a return to the failed policies of the 
70,s and 80,s.  This model seems certain to depress foreign 
investment and entrepreneurial activity (though we may see 
some new decisions to put money into deals which offer 
relatively rapid returns as recovery lasts).  As the 
multilateral lenders have no leverage with which to influence 
the GOV toward policy reform, and high oil prices require no 
change, the GOV will continue to set the agenda.  However, 
until it is clear which way it is pushing the Venezuelan 
economy, the conditions for private sector commitments will 
remain elusive.  Judicial insecurity, uncertainty over GOV 
macro-economic management, and high inflation (by regional 
standards) all lead to a situation which reduces the 
probability of significant investment - foreign or domestic - 
and takes the initiative from the private sector.  Without 
the job creation that those would bring, growth will last 
only as long as high oil prices can sustain the spending boom.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuelan prosecutor Danilo Anderson was killed the 
night of November 18, according to press reports and the GoV, 
as he traveled home in his personal vehicle.  More than a 
dozen GoV officials and government supporters, among them 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, went to the site of the 
incident while investigators scoured for evidence.  President 
Hugo Chavez scrubbed his attendance at San Jose\'s 
Ibero-American Summit, citing the seriousness of the 
incident, which opposition and government supporters have 
repudiated.  As the GoV\'s leading prosecutor on political 
cases, Anderson was pursuing cases against some 400 persons 
for the April 2002 events, including most recently charging 
the former Mayor of Caracas and his police chiefs for murder. 
 The GoV is likely to use the incident to further tar Chavez 
opponents as violent and to press for greater U.S. 
cooperation, with a dose of criticism, on doing something 
about foes in our country.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) At approximately 11:00 p.m. November 18, according to 
press reports, the car in which Venezeulan prosecutor Danilo 
Anderson was driving exploded on the streets of Caracas\' 
Santa Monica neighborhood.  Anderson was the government\'s 
leading prosecutor on political cases.  He had pressed the 
case against Baruta Mayor Henrique Capriles for allegedly 
failing to protect the Cuban Embassy during the events of 
April 2002.  He subsequently began investigating some 400 
persons for their alleged support of the short-lived 
government of Pedro Carmona in April 2002.  Most recently, 
Anderson had begun to prosecute former Caracas Mayor Alfredo 
Pena and his two highest ranking police officials, alleging 
that they were responsible for the deaths of demonstrators at 
the hands of the Metropolitan Police in April 2002. 
 
3.  (U) GoV authorities initially only speculated that the 
victim was Anderson, and more than half a dozen officials 
visited the site of the incident.  Among the officials 
present were Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, Ministers 
Andres Izarra (Communication and Information), Rafael Ramirez 
(Energy) and Jesse Chacon (Interior), Attorney General Isaias 
Rodriguez, National Electoral Council director Jorge 
Rodriguez, Mayors Juan Barreto and Freddy Bernal, Miranda 
State Gov. Diosdado Cabello and numerous pro-GoV National 
Assembly deputies.  An official at the capital\'s morgue 
confirmed that the victim was Anderson nearly twelve hours 
after the incident. 
 
4.  (U) President Hugo Chavez decided to cancel his trip to 
San Jose, Costa Rica to attend the Ibero-American Summit, 
Communications Minister Izarra told reporters.  Izarra did 
not comment on whether the President intended to cancel the 
rest of his foreign travel itinerary.  Chavez is scheduled to 
also travel to Spain, Russia and Iran on this jaunt out of 
the country. 
 
5.  (U) Pro-government and opposition figures alike 
repudiated the incident.  Spokesperson for various political 
parties called on Venezuelans to reject violence.  Caracas 
Mayor Juan Barreto, who had gathered a group of supporters in 
front of the Public Ministry to call for a full investigation 
of the incident, congratulated the opposition for condemning 
the violence.  VP Rangel said the GoV would investigate the 
case to its fullest capacity, and called for the people to 
remain serene.  Rangel called the killing a brutal act of 
terrorism, against dialogue and the rule of law. 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador spoke with VP Rangel at noon November 
19 to express condolences and offer any information we might 
develop on the incident.  Rangel asked that any communication 
be through the state intelligence service (DISIP), and asked 
why the U.S. had taken no steps against Orlando Urdaneta, a 
Venezuelan citizen who reportedly made threatening remarks 
against President Chavez on a Miami television station in 
October.  Ambassador responded that we so far had only 
received a diplomatic note of protest on the Urdaneta matter; 
should the GoV seek specific operational information or 
assistance, we would respond accordingly. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Initial reactions across the Venezuelan political 
spectrum appropriately repudiate and reject this act of 
violence.  Unfortunately, it will likely only be a matter of 
time before the GoV turns its sights to political enemies to 
blame for Anderson\'s killing regardless of the evidence. 
Anderson himself had certainly made many enemies in his 
investigations, so many that conducting any full professional 
investigation in itself would be daunting work. Easier 
targets for the government, for example, are the dissident 
military officers that have been in hiding for weeks and 
months.  Certainly we can expect pro-government voices to 
begin chastising opponents, alleging that their desire to get 
rid of President Chavez at whatever cost led to Anderson\'s 
demise.  We can also expect the GoV to set its sights on us, 
directly or indirectly, pressing with a dose of criticism for 
greater cooperation from us to do something about their foes 
-- all who they allege to be terrorists -- in our country. 
 
8.  (C) This act of terrorism will heighten the GoV and 
Chavez\'s fear that there are opponents who will try to kill 
them.  The murder also presents the GoV with an opportunity 
to seek ways to crack down on all opponents, including 
continuation of the cases Anderson has been prosecuting.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Veneuela\'s National Assembly approved 17 more articles 
in sessions on November 9, 11, 15, and 18. A top priority of 
President Hugo Chavez, the GoV seeks to complete the 
legislation by December 15. Beginning November 8, opposition 
parties withdrew from negotiations begun on September 23 with 
Minister of Communication Andres Izarra. Deputies postponed 
discussion of articles establishing the criteria for 
independent producers, which is likely to stir the most 
heated debate. With a total of 36 articles to discuss prior 
to approval, and a month to finish discussion, most observers 
and participants in the debate expect passage of the law, 
incorporating a few, relatively insignificant changes, by the 
end of the 2004 legislative session in December.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
PRESSURE FROM THE TOP 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) Minister of Communication and Information Andres 
Izarra is leading the government\'s public campaign in support 
of the media content law. Seeking to undermine media and 
opposition claims that the law is meant to censor the media 
and help strengthen President Hugo Chavez\'s control of the 
country, Izarra has sought to portray the law simply as a 
measure to protect children, parents, and families from 
inappropriate language, violence, and sexual content. On 
September 23, Izarra installed a \"technical committee\" to 
discuss the law\'s provisions, and come to agreement on 
priorities and specific bill language. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER ADMITS LAW IS \"IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
3. (U) In an interview with daily \"El Universal\" published on 
10/17, Izarra admitted that the law is impossible to apply at 
the present time. He said implementation would have to be 
gradual until enough national independent producers (NIPs) 
come on-line and can fulfill the NIP quota as prescribed in 
the law. Izarra admitted that in the meeting deputies 
convinced him that some articles need to be \"refined and made 
more precise\" because they are \"not viable\" as currently 
written. He also called the law\'s requirement that NIP\'s have 
no connection what-so-over to the media \"an aberration\" and 
\"unsustainable.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
THE VIEW FROM THE LEGISLATURE 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The National Assembly is two-thirds of the way through 
the second required reading of the bill. In a sign of how 
emotional the debate has been, attempts to begin this reading 
were marred by a near fist-fit, televised from the assembly 
floor. 
 
5. (C) Opposition legislators echo concerns raised by the 
media, particularly regarding the national telecommunications 
 
agency\'s (CONATEL\'s) role in the implementation of the law. 
The National Assembly\'s Media Committee President, Luis 
Berdugo (Accion Democratica), told Poloff he believed the 
strong push for the law before the October 31 regional 
elections was a move to \"turn up the heat\" and change the 
subject of the national debate away from allegations of fraud 
in the recall referendum.  He told Poloff that the 
opposition\'s only tactics are to \"denounce, delay, and 
distract,\" but thinks the effort is futile, predicting 
passage of the law (with a few changes) before year\'s end. 
 
6. (C) In a conversation with Poloff on October 25, Primero 
Justicia deputy Gerardo Blyde expressed optimism that 
Communications Minister Izarra was willing to negotiate in 
good faith to improve the law, incorporating some modest but 
important changes favored by the media. Blyde, who says he 
has known the minister for many years (since \"before he was a 
Chavista\") regarded Izarra as a reasonable interlocutor and 
negotiator. Blyde said the test would be to see if President 
Chavez continued to allow Izarra to negotiate, or forced a 
harder line. Citing a new lack of GoV willingness to 
negotiate, on November 8 Blyde announced that the Primero 
Justicia party would withdraw from the \"technical committee.\" 
The following day, first Accion Democratica (A.D.), then 
Copei and La Causa R also withdrew from the discussions. 
 
7. (C) Pro-GoV proponents of the law have been unwilling to 
discuss it with Poloff. Appointments were twice canceled and 
not rescheduled. However, one MVR deputy who is a proponent 
of the law, when approached in another setting, repeated the 
GoV\'s talking points about the \"protection of children and 
families\" nature of the law, and when challenged about the 
\"no violence\" journalism concerns, sought to reassure Poloff 
that the language was being changed to loosen those 
restrictions and that the news media had nothing to worry 
about. 
 
----------------------------------- 
CONDEMNATION AND CONCERN FROM NGO\'S 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) In November, several NGO\'s that deal with press issues 
have expressed their serious concern over the intent and 
likely effects of the law. Chief among them are the 
Inter-American Human Rights Commission (under the 
Organization of American States), the Inter-American Press 
Association (IAPA), and Reporters without Borders.  IAPA 
released a strongly worded statement after their annual 
conference in Guatemala, while the IAHRC statement provoked a 
quick reply from the Minister of Communications, who termed 
it unwelcome interference in domestic affairs. While Human 
Rights Watch has not recently commented on the law, their top 
Venezuela expert in Washington told Poloff earlier this fall 
that the content law and the overall issue of freedom of the 
press is the organization\'s top priority in Venezuela 
presently.

COMMENT

9. (C) The National Assembly is pressing article by article 
to pass the media content law. Pro-GoV deputies have the 
simple majority needed for passage. For their part, much of 
the media now seem resigned to their fate. Union Radio, the 
largest news radio station in the country, last week 
announced a revamped broadcast schedule, which they said 
 
would include less opinion-based programming.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Chavez supporter and Patria Para Todos 
(PPT) secgen Jose Albornoz talked with DCM November 18 about 
impending cabinet changes, policy challenges for Chavez and 
the MVR party, and potential to improve bilateral relations. 
PPT accepts that party stalwart Ali Rodriguez will leave 
PDVSA to be Foreign Minister, but is resisting a proposal to 
replace Ambassador to the US Bernanrdo Alvarez_ with William 
Izarra.  New PDVSA president may be Energy Minister Ramirez_. 
 Internally, Chavez\' challenge is to not let political 
hegemony be undone by corruption.  Albornoz said the GOV paid 
attention to international and to US views on human rights 
cases, pointing to the release of Henrique Capriles; he said 
the Sumate case essentially would remain in suspended 
animation, so that the case could be revived in 2006 if 
needed.  Albornoz made a strong pitch for improved bilateral 
relations, including a presidential summit in 2005; DCM said 
the summit was improbable, and stressed that improved 
relations would depend on the resolution of each sides\' 
concerns, including Sumate, the penal code, and press 
freedom.  End Summary. 
 
 
Cabinet Changes in the Works 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Chavez ally and PPT SecGen Jose Albornoz stated that 
PDVSA president Ali Rodriguez, a key PPT leader, would move 
to the Foreign Ministry as early as November 19.  Energy and 
Mines (MEM) Minister Rafael Ramirez_ was the leading candidate 
to replace Rodriguez; Albornoz warned that Ramirez_ was close 
to Cuba (comment:  Rodriguez was rumored to be very close to 
Castro as well).  Albornoz said that there was another idea 
floating around:  to move Ambassador to the U.S. Bernardo 
Alvarez_ back to replace Ramirez_, and to send to Washington 
William Izarra, the theoretician of the revolution, former 
coup plotter, and father of Communications Minister Andres 
Izarra.  The PPT was trying hard to resist this, Albornoz 
said, and warned that Izarra was harder-line than Alvarez_, 
and also that it was Marta Harnecker--who has an office in 
Chavez\' palace--that was pushing Izarra\'s candidacy. 
(comment:  Izarra is a low-key and approachable ideologue 
whom Chavez had distanced himself from.  Izarra did valuable 
work in the referendum, and in now back in Chavez\' favor.) 
DCM did not say, \"oh what a shame if Alvarez_ were to be 
replaced.\"  The other cabinet change in the works is to 
replace Health Minister Capella with the sister of Army 
commander Gen. Baduel.  Albornoz said that Capella had been 
forced out because his arrogance had caused considerable 
problems in a ministry which had to satisfy numerous unions 
and groups of customers. 
 
\"Hegemony is a Challenge:\" 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Albornoz said that during the November 13 meeting at 
Fuerte Tiuna with the Chavista governors and mayors, Chavez 
underscored the need to fight corruption and inefficiency. 
There were, however, initial signs of discord in Chavez\' MVR 
party.  Chavez\' recent order to the MVR to respond positively 
to the desire for cooperation from the Union party of 
Francisco Arias Cardenas (ex-Chavez coupplotter, and former 
Chavez rival) had really annoyed MVR deputies like Nicolas 
Maduro, Iris Varela, and William Lara.  These deputies feared 
that Arias Cardenas could somehow displace them, Albornoz 
asserted.  For the PPT, however, now was a time of 
opportunity:  the party now had 30 regional assembly 
delegates, and 27 mayors.  The PPT was pushing its deputies 
to get on accountability commissions in their respective 
assemblies in order to support anti-corruption efforts 
(comment:  in many cases, probably to ensure corruption flows 
their own way).  Meanwhile, the Chavistas are focused on the 
2005 national assembly elections.  The Chavistas supported 
the Electoral Council (CNE) decision to suspend the December 
recall elections (of opposition deputies) because any 
opposition victory would be a real boost for the opposition, 
whereas an MVR victory would have little additional impact on 
the heels of their August 15 and October 31 successes.  It 
was, however, a fiercely fought debate within the Chavista 
parties, Albornoz said. 
 
Better Relations with the U.S.? 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Albornoz stressed that Ali Rodriguez would, as 
Foreign Minister, aim for improved bilateral relations -- 
ideally to the point that there could be a Chavez-Bush summit 
in 2005.  DCM said that while nothing was impossible, this 
sounded very improbable.  The USG view is that presidential 
 
 
meetings reflect a positive bilateral relationship.  There 
would have to be considerable improvement on the issues each 
country is concerned about.  In the case of the U.S., these 
included Sumate, the penal code, and the media law.  Albornoz 
asked if we had not noticed that the Sumate case had moved in 
the favor of the defendants; he also claimed to have lobbied 
Chavez, at our request, to free the then jailed Henrigue 
Capriles.  DCM said we had.  Albornoz (who bears a grudge 
against Sumate from when Sumate trounced his own Comando 
Ayacucho in 2003-4) said that the judicial action against 
Sumate would be frozen, but not dropped altogether, so that 
the GOV could take it up again during the 2006 presidential 
campaign if needed.  On the penal code, Albornoz offered only 
that Venezuela was not as advanced a society as the US; on 
the media law, he agreed that it was \"crap\" (\"una cagada\") as 
drafted.  He nodded assent when the DCM observed that its 
purpose was to reduce TV network income by imposing local 
content rules.  Back to Rodriguez, Albornoz said that the new 
Foreign Minister would be interested in meeting privately 
early on with the Ambassador; DCM urged him to press 
Rodriguez to do so. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
5.  (C) Albornoz usually offers a tantalizing mix of 
insights, news, and self-promotion.  Our take: 
 
--While the decision to replace the ineffective FonMin Perez 
is logical, the choice of Ali Rodriguez is curious.  It would 
seem to foreshadow an increase in Chavez\' oil diplomacy, but 
it also raises questions about where PDVSA is headed.  The 
change would make some sense from Chavez\'s perspective:  it 
reduces the PPT\'s disproportionate power in PDVSA (Ramirez_, 
although a protege of Rodriguez, lacks the latter\'s political 
heft).  It would be a graceful exit for Rodriguez, and 
Rodriguez would offer Chavez far more ability to execute 
policies than FonMin Perez. 
 
--There is some churning about within the MVR and pro-Chavez 
groups.  Thus far we have seen nothing that Chavez can\'t 
 
easily control -- but there are differences out there over 
direction and resources and personalities, and we believe the 
Chavista hegemony will magnify those differences over time. 
 
--The international message on Sumate has had at least some 
positive effect.  Indeed, had prosecutor Anderson not been 
assassinated November 18, it is possible that the Sumate case 
might have evolved more positively in a short period of time 
-- although Albornoz\'s desire for what he called a \"sword of 
Damocles\" was and remains a plausible option.

SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGETS/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: STATE 239929 
 
1.  This message responds to action request (REFTEL). 
 
2.  Q:  How (or are) military expenditures audited? 
 
    A:  Each branch of the Venezuelan Armed Forces (army, 
navy, air force, and national guard) has its own budget and 
planning office.  The services submit proposed expenses and 
acquisition planning documents to a Ministry of Defense 
budget office.  The Defense Ministry in turn presents the 
armed forces budget to the Ministry of Finance\'s national 
budget office and to President Hugo Chavez for review.  The 
National Assembly also approves the budget. 
 
3.  Q:  Who audits military expenditures? 
 
    A:  The Defense Ministry\'s budget office performs audits 
of each military service.  The Armed Forces Inspector General 
oversees the process. 
 
4.  Q:  To whom are the audits reported? 
 
    A:  Ultimately, the military reports its audits to 
President Chavez.  Chavez micromanages the military budget 
with the assistance of a close circle of military advisors. 
The Defense Minister and the Finance Minister also receive 
reports. 
 
5.  Q:  Are any of the people who receive the audits civilian 
authorities? 
 
    A:  Hugo Chavez is an elected, civilian president.  The 
Defense Ministry\'s budget office contains some civilians. 
The Finance Minister is a civilian, but an army general 
currently heads the ministry\'s national budget office.  The 
Defense Minister and his second-in-command, the Inspector 
General, are active duty military officers. 
 
6.  Q:  Is there an existing framework for conducting annual 
audits of military expenditures? 
 
    A:  Yes. 
 
7.  Q:  Is there legislation or an instituted government 
policy that requires annual audits of receipts that fund the 
military? 
 
    A:  While not explicitly requiring an audit, the 
Venezuelan constitution requires the executive branch to 
present to the National Assembly the \"rendering of 
(budgetary) accounts\" within six months after the end of each 
year.  To post\'s knowledge, however, the government has never 
disciplined notoriously corrupt elements of the armed forces 
for failing to account for expenditures outlined in the 
budget. 
 
8.  Q:  Is control over the audit process effective? 
 
    A:  The President wields absolute control over the audit 
process; however, he has approved budgets without adequately 
addressing problems of corruption and off-budget 
expenditures. 
 
9.  Q:  What are the deficiencies of the audit process? 
 
    A:  Three major problems complicate auditing the military 
budget: 
 
-- Because of frequent policy changes and exogenous factors, 
proposed military budgets poorly demonstrate actual 
expenditures.  The militarization of the Venezuelan 
government and society has swollen the responsibilities of 
the armed forces at a pace faster than the official budget. 
For example, the GOV has begun to rely increasingly on the 
military to carry out health, education, and poverty 
reduction programs; therefore, each year\'s expenditures can 
differ significantly from the previous year\'s budget 
submission.  Economic factors, such as inflation and the 
price of oil, also tend to demand revisions to budget 
provisions. 
 
-- A significant portion of the budget remains hidden and 
exempt from audit.  The official budget did not grow 
significantly after Chavez imposed regulations in 2001 
requiring the disclosure of over three billion dollars of 
off-line funds. 
 
-- Corrupt contracts tend to enlarge budget inaccuracies, and 
the government has ignored and even detained some 
whistleblowers. 
 
10.  Q:  Are these deficiencies intentional or due to 
capacity constraints? 
 
     A:  Both.  Economic factors and an institutional lack of 
expertise have made the budgetary process more difficult for 
the GOV.  Nevertheless, the administration also has ignored 
opportunities to tackle corruption and to make the process 
more transparent. 
 
11.  Q:  Does the country\'s defense budget include the armed 
forces and security forces? 
 
     A:  Yes.  Although the budget does not include civilian 
police, law enforcement is a major part of the mission of the 
Venezuelan National Guard. 
 
12.  Q:  Are there significant off-budget military receipts? 
 
     A:  The military budget includes most significant 
line-item expenditures.  The President\'s military unit (Casa 
Militar), however, has an account of unknown size that 
remains separate from the audited Defense Ministry budget. 
The President also uses an undisclosed amount of 
\"discretionary\" petroleum revenue for expenses such as 
bonuses, pensions, military hardware, and other spot payments. 
 
13.  Q:  Are productive development objectives prioritized 
over unproductive (e.g., military) objectives? 
 
     A:  The government has prioritized poverty reduction 
over traditional military expenditures.  In fact, the 
military\'s mission has shifted towards social development 
projects at the expense of its national defense role. 
 
14.  Q:  Is there a mechanism for a debate over budget 
priorities, such as through a legislative assembly? 
 
     A:  The Ministry of Defense presents the completed 
budget to the National Assembly, which is constitutionally 
authorized to alter budgetary entries.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  A ruling by the Penal Chamber of Venezuela\'s Supreme 
Court November 16 is likely to result in a long delay in the 
case against the NGO Sumate.  The Chamber\'s ruling requires 
the lower court to admit several pieces of evidence into the 
case prior to a preliminary hearing, including testimony by 
four National Endowment for Democracy (NED) officials, which 
according to defense lawyers may take over a year. The Penal 
Chamber decision forbids the lower court from detaining the 
leaders of Sumate, determining that they are not a flight 
risk, or dangerous.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Penal Chamber Ruling 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The Penal Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court 
ruled November 16 on various issues in the case against 
directors fo the NGO Sumate.  The Chamber ordered the lower 
court hearing the case to admit 3 of 13 pieces of evidence 
the defense had requested, and which the prosecutor, Luisa 
Ortega, and the control court had rejected.  The Chamber 
ordered the court not/not to order pre-trial detention for 
the suspects, ruling that they were neither dangerous, nor a 
flight risk.  Justice Alejandro Angulo Fontiveros, considered 
a strong Chavez supporter, wrote the decision. 
 
3.  (U)  The Penal Chamber ordered the court to admit as 
evidence transcripts Chavez\' weekly television program Alo 
Presidente where he accused Sumate of receiving funds from 
the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to overthrow the 
GOV, financial records which the defense claims prove that 
Sumate used the NED funds for licit purposes, and the 
testimony of 4 of the 32 NED officials the defense had 
requested. These are: President Carl Gershman; President of 
the Board of Directors Vin Weber; Vice President of the Board 
of Directors Thomas Danahue; and Treasurer Julie Finley. 
 
4.  (U)  The Chamber instructed the prosecutor to question 
the NED officials on four points, which the Chamber indicated 
demeaned Venezuela\'s democratic institutions. The first is 
Carl Gershman\'s statement, while visiting Venezuela, that 
Venezuela is \"neither a democracy nor a dictatorship, but 
something in-between.\" The second is whether the NED 
considers democracy to be government by the majority. The 
third is whether the NED believes the mandates of the UN 
should be obeyed by member states. The fourth is exactly how 
Sumate spent the NED money it was given. 
 
---------------- 
Defense Reaction 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Sumate defense lawyer Jesus Loreto told PolOff 
November 19 that the defense would request the testimony of 
the NED officials through letters rogatory. He said that in 
his experience this process could take a year or more.  He 
noted that the ruling was not clear  on whether the ten other 
pieces of evidence were disallowed, or just not specifically 
authorized. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  This ruling kicks the case against the Sumate 
directors down the road several months, at a time when the 
USG and others were exerting heavy pressure on the GOV and 
the Supreme Court to do something about the case.  The 
Supreme Court has an independent interest in maintaining its 
international standing, and the case was endangering it. The 
ruling delays, rather than solves the problem, but that may 
be the best the Supreme Court can do, given the obvious GOV 
interest in the case.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Fresh from electoral victories in August and October, 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is deepening his Bolivarian 
Revolution with a new ten-point strategy.  Chavez now plans 
to create a \"new political infrastructure\" that integrates 
social action groups and forces political parties to elect 
their candidates for office.  He has also launched a round of 
international outreach based on his desire to create a 
\"multi-polar\" world where U.S. influence is lessened, aiming 
at Spain, Libya, Russia, Iran, Qatar, and China by the end of 
the year.  Rather than deepening the revolution, Chavez\'s 
plans seem more geared toward ensuring his re-election in 
2006.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Many Meetings To Chart The Course 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On November 11, President Hugo Chavez announced ten 
strategies, called \"The New Strategic Map,\" meant to 
re-orient the political, social, economic, bureaucratic, and 
geopolitical posture of the GOV.  He followed up the 
announcement with a two-day retreat of senior government 
officials and allied governors and mayors November 12-13 at 
Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas.  The GOV announced that a 
coordinating mechanism consisting of ministers and governors 
had been established to carry out the new strategy.  Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel announced he would head a 
presidential committee to flesh out an anti-poverty plan, 
following Chavez\'s strategies, to be unveiled before 
Christmas.  While most of Chavez\'s strategies are his usual 
statist policies (refs a and b), his proposal for a \"new 
political structure\" and a \"multi-polar\" foreign policy are 
particularly relevant, especially given Chavez\'s increased 
control of state and local governments and the lack of an 
organized political opposition. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
\"A New Political Structure\" In The Works 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Domestically, Chavez plans overhaul his political base 
among the social organizations that support his 
administration.  Chavez asserted that his revolutionary 
movement has until the 2006 presidential elections to 
consolidate and make these organizations stronger.  He 
included in this list the Electoral Battle Units (UBEs); the 
Francisco Miranda Front (Cuban-trained Venezuelan \"social 
workers\"); the Cuban-operated medical clinics; health 
committees in the slums; land committees in rural areas 
(which work for land re-distribution for the poor); working 
groups on water; and the facilitators for the \"mission\" 
programs.  Minister of Communication Andres Izarra said the 
UBEs would be re-christened \"Endogenous Battle Units,\" a 
reference to Chavez\'s philosophy for fomenting domestic 
production among the poor.  Izarra said the new UBEs would be 
fortified by \"popular communication centers\" to bring 
technology to poor areas.  He also said this infrastructure 
would be used to mobilize voters in 2006, with the ambitious 
goal of winning 10 million votes for Chavez. 
 
4. (C) Chavez also vowed to institute procedures for 
democratically selecting pro-Chavez candidates in future 
elections, instead of naming them personally as he did for 
the October 31 regional elections.  He said that the high 
abstention rate among Chavez supporters during the October 31 
referendum was caused by resentment over the manner in which 
candidates are selected.  Chavez lamented that in the past he 
has had to resort to hand-picking candidates, but claimed he 
was forced to do so by party leaders who \"had not consulted 
anyone\" at the grass roots level.  (In fact, the 1999 
Constitution mandates internal election of candidates and 
political party chiefs, though this has yet to be 
implemented.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Bi-Polar Plus Uni-polar Equals Multi-Polar 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Internationally, Chavez has returned to his 
\"multi-polar world\" theme as a rhetorical defense against the 
perceived dominance of the United States.  Chavez claimed 
that, after the recall vote, Venezuela had been 
\"re-legitimized,\" not only his government but his political 
system, which he said had been stigmatized by the media. 
Since the regional elections, Chavez has visited Brazil, 
Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba.  He also recently 
received a state visit from Paraguayan President Nicanor 
Duarte.  He is currently on a trip to Spain, Libya, Russia, 
Iran, and Qatar.  Chavez plans to visit China in December. 
In addition, newly-appointed Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez 
told reporters in Spain November 21 the GOV will push for the 
\"democratization\" of international organizations such as the 
UN and OAS. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Chavez\'s ten strategies are the beginnings of his 
campaign for the 2006 presidential election.  His \"new 
political structure\" attempts to maintain the network of 
diverse social action groups, largely state-subsidized, that 
supported his successful recall referendum campaign. 
Integrating \"mission\" personnel and Cuban-trained social 
workers into this political structure blurs the lines between 
the state and pro-Chavez political organizations even more. 
Chavez also shows his preference for mass organizations over 
political parties, which are highly suspect in his 
leader-people model of governance. 
 
7. (C) Feeling drenched in legitimacy from the referendum 
win, Chavez will continue to reach out personally to 
countries that might be sympathetic to his anti-U.S. rhetoric 
(China, Spain, Libya, etc.).  He will push regional 
integration efforts such as Mercosur that might challenge 
U.S. interests.  He also seems disposed to use his oil muscle 
to influence smaller countries, geo-politically unimportant 
but with votes in the OAS and other international 
organizations.  International outreach is important to Chavez 
domestically as it allows him to portray the Bolivarian 
Revolution as gaining acceptance in the world, no matter what 
the reality might be.

2. (U) The Ambassador visited Maracay, Aragua State, a 
pro-Chavez agricultural state, November 16, 2004.  He briefly 
toured an agricultural research laboratory that receives U.S. 
funding.  The Ministry of Science and Technology had declined 
the request for a formal visit.  The Ambassador called on Dr. 
Juan Ibarra, president of the Aragua State judicial circuit 
and a former IV grantee.  Ibarra explained the progress the 
courts of Aragua had made as a direct result of U.S. 
assistance (modernization, congruency of decisions, etc. and 
said he was interested in increased cooperation, especially 
in the courtroom management and logistics.  The Ambassador 
also met with former Army colonel Humberto Prieto, mayor of 
Maracay (Movimiento Quinta Republica*MVR), and about 20 
leaders of American and Venezuelan businesses, granting press 
interviews after each.  He then spoke with the boards of the 
two leading newspapers, the centrist \"El Aragueno\" 
(circulation 55,000) and the anti-Chavez \"El Siglo,\" 
(circulation 75,000) agreeing to an interview at the latter. 
Filippo Sindoni, President of \"El Aragueno,\" confirmed 
several business leaders\' assertions that the economy in 
Aragua State seems to be recovering. 
 
-------------------------- 
The Message and the Media 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (U) During each meeting and press event the Ambassador 
highlighted previous U.S. assistance and the benefits it has 
produced for Aragua State.  He emphasized cooperation and 
progress in areas where the U.S. and Venezuela coincided 
(energy, illegal drugs, and terrorism), and said that while 
the USG would maintain its principled positions, he hoped to 
reduce the tone and volume of the rhetoric in areas in which 
the countries disagreed (democratic institutions, regional 
politics, human rights, etc.).  Fielding questions the 
Ambassador said Secretary Powell\'s resignation was in line 
with cabinet changes that typically occur after the first 
term; he praised Condoleezza Rice\'s nomination; and he 
reiterated President Bush\'s commitment to Latin America and 
the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). 
 
4. (U) Both \"El Siglo\" and \"El Aragueno\" featured front-page 
coverage of the Ambassador\'s visit.  There was also local 
radio and regional television coverage.  The message 
concentrated on the benefits that relations with the United 
States bring, reduced tone and volume of rhetoric, Secretary 
Powell\'s resignation, and Condoleezza Rice\'s nomination.  \"El 
Universal,\" the leading conservative newspaper, briefly 
mentioned the Ambassador\'s comments on the latter. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador\'s visit publicly highlighted the 
people-to-people benefits a relationship with the United 
States could bring in a traditionally pro-Chavez state.  The 
Ambassador\'s originally approved requests for a meeting with 
Chavista Governor Didalco Bolivar and the visit to the 
 
agricultural research laboratory partially sponsored by the 
U.S. were both canceled at the last minute with improbable 
explanations.  The request to meet with Garrison Commander 
General Gustavo Rangel Briceno went unanswered.  The informal 
call on the laboratory despite the Ministry of Science and 
Technology declining showed that we would not be sidelined by 
the GOV\'s attempt to limit Embassy access.

SUBJECT: Ramirez_ TAKES OVER PDVSA WHILE KEEPING ENERGY 
MINISTRY 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Richard M. Sanders.  Reasons 1.4 (B) 
AND (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  Minister of Energy and Mines Rafael Ramirez_ has been 
sworn in as President of state oil corporation PDVSA, while 
maintaining his ministerial position.  Energy experts who 
have opposed Chavez publicly assert that his appointment 
marks the definitive end to PDVSA as a commercial (vice 
political/developmental) institution. Private reaction among 
our energy contacts is somewhat more nuanced.  Ramirez_, 
originally viewed as a mere protege of outgoing PDVSA 
President Ali Rodriguez, had already become an important 
figure in his own right as Minister, and has been prepared to 
use Venezuela\'s oil resources to Chavez\'s direct political 
advantage.  He takes over a firm which is being subjected to 
ever greater demands for resources to fund Chavez\'s 
\"revolution,\" including, according to recent press reports, a 
tasking to provide an additional USD two billion for 
infrastructure projects.   End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Announcement Not a Surprise 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  On November 20, President Chavez swore in Minister 
of Energy and Mines Rafael Ramirez_ as President of \"Petroleos 
de Venezuela, S.A.\" (PDVSA), the state oil enterprise.  He 
replaces Ali Rodriguez Araque, who leaves to take over the 
Foreign Ministry.  Rumors about Ramirez_ assuming the position 
had circulated for the previous week.  He will retain his 
Ministerial position.  In a subsequent statement issued by 
GOV state press agency Venpres, Ramirez_ asserted that he 
would keep in mind the necessary separation between these two 
functions, saying:  \"We will be very scrupulous in this.  To 
the Ministry that which is for the Ministry, to PDVSA, that 
which is for PDVSA.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Unsurprisingly, petroleum experts opposed to Chavez 
took a dim view of his keeping the two positions.  Alberto 
Quiros, former head of MARAVEN, a nationalized oil company 
ultimately folded into PDVSA, and later of Shell\'s Venezuelan 
operations, said that in having the energy minister head the 
state oil corporation, the GOV was following the \"Saudi 
model,... which is applied by authoritarian governments to 
guarantee control of economic resources.\"  Former Energy 
Minister and OPEC Secretary General Humberto Calderon Berti 
described the decision as \"the formalization of the 
subordination of PDVSA to the desires of the executive 
branch.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
Mixed Reactions from Industry 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  Private reactions from local energy community are 
more nuanced.  One well-connected local energy analyst 
reacted very positively to the (then) possibility that 
Ramirez_ would assume the presidency of PDVSA in a November 18 
conversation with econoff.  This analyst pointed to the 
stature that Ramirez_ has gained, both within the GOV and 
internationally, since he was named as Minister and posited 
that Ramirez_ would be able to put a stop to the continuing 
in-fighting within PDVSA and get the company going again. 
This would, he said, be a positive move for international oil 
companies trying to advance projects in Venezuela. 
 
5. (C)  However, other industry observers were less positive 
about Ramirez_, saying he has proven himself a good soldier 
who will do whatever Chavez orders him to do.  A leading 
energy attorney in Caracas commented to econoff November 19 
that there would probably be very little change since the 
Ministr already has total control over PDVSA.  In fact, she 
said, things could be worse because Ramirez_ doe not have 
time to be Minister, much less both Miister and PDVSA 
President, because of the politial responsibilities levied 
 
 
on him by Chavez.  ExxonMobil de Venezuela President Mark 
Ward also commented to econoff on November 18 that he 
believed that Ramirez_ would, in fact, continue \"to play the 
political side of things,\" and that the relationship of the 
international oil companies with PDVSA would not improve. 
 
------------------ 
Technician and Pol 
------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Ramirez_ has shown a combination of 
technical/managerial skills and political loyalty that has 
made him a highly valuable to Chavez.  A mechanical engineer 
who worked on natural gas issues for the Ministry, he was 
elevated to run it when Rodriguez left to take over PDVSA in 
2002.  Originally viewed as very much Rodriguez\'s man, he 
became a figure in his own right, and indeed a \"star\" within 
the Bolivarian government, when as Minister, he coordinated 
the successful effort to bring PDVSA production back up, thus 
breaking the December 2002-February 2003 general strike which 
threatened to bring the Chavez government down.  Since then, 
he has taken a lead role in making PDVSA the direct 
bankroller and to a considerable extent the executor of the 
\"missions\" in education and housing which were been so 
crucial to Chavez\'s August 15 defeat of the effort to recall 
him.  His ministry has increasingly been the center of 
gravity for strategic decisions on hydrocarbons policy. 
While international oil companies have been able to move 
forward on negotiations, as in the case of ChevronTexaco with 
regard to the Deltana Platform natural gas project, they have 
also had to face abrupt, politically motivated decisions, 
such as the recent unilateral increase in royalties the GOV 
requires on production from the Orinoco heavy oil 
installations. 
 
-------------------------- 
Chavez Asks for More Money 
-------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Almost simultaneous with the naming of Ramirez_ to 
PDVSA has come a requirement that PDVSA replenish a USD two 
billion infrastructure account that it had previously funded, 
according to press reports.  An initial USD two billion had 
been provided to this fund, which is kept at the state-owned 
Bank for Economic and Social Development (BANDES). 
Reportedly, the funds have been designated for major 
projects, such as a highway to eastern Venezuela.  (Comment: 
Our understanding is that while the money may have been 
designated for specific uses, much of it is still unspent. 
Presumably with that process now beginning, the GOV wants to 
top it off again, given that the fund has been described as 
\"revolving.\"  End comment.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C)  Ramirez_\'s nomination underscores the fact that Chavez 
has little talent - or at least little talent that he trusts 
- to call upon.  It also makes clear the importance he gives 
to direct political control of PDVSA.  Ramirez_\'s appointment 
will not have much near-term impact on the problems faced by 
the international oil companies in their dealings with PDVSA, 
i.e., the slowness of decision making, new concerns about 
contract sanctity and so on. 
 
10.  (C)  It is not clear what whether as new president of 
the firm, Ramirez_ will have the go-ahead to resolve the 
constant squabbling over turf (and attendant graft) among the 
factions entrenched at PDVSA.  Since the purges at the 
company following the December 2002-February 2003 general 
strike, the main factions found within PDVSA management are 
made up of officials linked to Ali Rodriguez\'s \"Patria Para 
Todos\" (PPT) party, ones linked with the far larger 
\"Movimiento Quinta Republica\" (MVR), the principal pro-Chavez 
political vehicle, and military officers directly linked to 
Chavez.  Some PDVSA-watchers have also identified a faction 
linked with Hector Ciavaldini, a former PDVSA President who 
later broke with Chavez (though not before tossing some 
 
lucrative PDVSA contracts in the direction of companies 
associated with his own family), and a rump group of 
\"institutionalists,\" who did not actually walk out during the 
strike and hence retained their jobs.  It has also been 
suggested that Ramirez_ will bring his own people, a group of 
fellow graduates of the University of the Andes in Merida, 
into senior positions at PDVSA.  While Ramirez_ was originally 
beholden to Ali Rodriguez, as part of the PPT, to which 
Ambassador to the U.S. Bernardo Alvarez is also affiliated, 
his appointment to PDVSA is recognition of his own 
politico-revolutionary credentials.

Classified By: Abelardo A. Arias, Acting Deputy Chief of Mission, 
for Reasons 1.4(b). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Movement to Socialism President Felipe Mujica believes 
a first step for the Venezuelan opposition is to wage a 
\"campaign of rights,\" perhaps beginning with a referendum to 
overturn the soon-to-pass media content law.  Additionally, 
the opposition must regain institutionality in the National 
Electoral Council, which would permit two or three opposition 
political fronts to form and compete in elections.  Barring 
this, Mujica asserted, the GOV may choose to ramp up the 
political fight against opposition groups, which will lead to 
more radical conflict.  Mujica concedes the GOV continues to 
hold tremendous sway over Venezuela\'s poor, loyalty that goes 
beyond financial benefits.  While he is idealistic, Mujica at 
least is giving serious thought to tangible actions for 
Venezuela\'s beleaguered opposition.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Opposition:  Leaderless and Confused 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Felipe Mujica, president of the opposition Movement to 
Socialism (MAS) party, told poloff November 23 that groups in 
opposition to President Hugo Chavez are confused and in 
disarray.  The opposition\'s half-hearted call for abstention 
of the October 31 regional elections greatly weakened 
opposition political parties, he said.  He asserted that had 
turnout rivaled that of the August 15 presidential recall 
referendum, several key races would have gone for the 
opposition.  Mujica said the only viable opposition leader 
remaining is Zulia State Governor Manuel Rosales.  Mujica 
suggested that Rosales might be able to mount an effective 
campaign against Chavez in the 2006 elections, but first the 
opposition must \"re-discover\" itself. 
 
--------------------- 
A Campaign For Rights 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) Mujica suggested the opposition may find its voice by 
opposing the draft media law currently before the National 
Assembly.  MAS publicly proposed a referendum to abrogate the 
media law in the likely event it passes (which will probably 
happen in December).  Mujica noted the constitutional 
requirements for such a referendum are 10 percent of 
registered voters signing a petition and 40 percent of 
registered voters calling for the law to be repealed. 
(Comment:  The constitution prohibits referenda to repeal 
laws that protect or develop human rights, which the GOV 
would surely argue in defense of the media law. 
Additionally, the 40-percent threshold amounts to a whopping 
5.6 million votes.)  Mujica suggested that, regardless of the 
outcome of their efforts to hold referendum, it could help 
cement the opposition behind a human rights message and, 
thus, regain some credibility. 
 
------------------------------ 
Building Confidence in the CNE 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Calling it a best case scenario, Mujica suggested one 
of the opposition\'s first priorities is to negotiate with the 
GOV for some level of institutionality in the National 
Electoral Council (CNE), a sufficient change in personnel to 
assure fair elections.  Mujica said this would allow two to 
three opposition political fronts to compete for some elected 
offices.  He suggested a center-left bloc formed by MAS, 
Accion Democratica (AD), Union, and others and a center-right 
bloc formed by Primero Justicia (PJ), COPEI (Christian 
Democrats), and possibly Causa R (which recently formed a 
parliamentary alliance with Primero Justicia).  Mujica said 
that GOV-allied parties are positioned to capture at least 
two-thirds of the National Assembly in next year\'s elections 
(probably in December).  He said current CNE rules undermine 
the constitutional mandate of proportional representation, 
giving pro-Chavez parties an immense advantage.  He suggested 
a change in the law would be necessary before opposition 
parties can be guaranteed of winning a sufficient number of 
seats. 
 
------------------------------ 
Or Things Could Just Get Worse 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Mujica admitted that carving out political space for 
the opposition would require the GOV to recognize and value a 
democratic opposition movement, which he thought unlikely. 
He said it is possible for the GOV to continue to defeat the 
opposition in elections, first in the March make-up elections 
for governor of Amazonas State and about four mayoralties, 
and later in the June parochial (neighborhood level) 
elections and then the December National Assembly races. 
Mujica predicted an increase in political persecution of 
opposition figures as well.  He thought it possible in this 
case that radical Chavez opponents could find they have 
\"nothing left to do\" but resort to violent acts, alluding to 
the killing of political prosecutor Danilo Anderson. 
 
--------------------------- 
\"Chavez Nos Toma En Cuenta\" 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Mujica said the opposition\'s challenge to win the 
support of Venezuela\'s poor is daunting.  He noted that his 
own party\'s traditional lower class base had been mostly 
co-opted by Chavez, leaving MAS without a niche.  Mujica said 
Chavez\'s most popular program by far is \"impunity.\"  The 
spread of the informal economy, informal housing, and land 
and building invasions, a plight for previous governments, 
have purposely gone unchecked by Chavez.  Chavez does not 
spend anything on these people, Mujica asserted, and yet they 
are grateful to Chavez for letting them violate property 
rights or tax laws.  Mujica said Chavez gives them hope that 
things will get better (though they arguably do not).  He 
summed this up with a phrase he says is repeated in 
Venezuelan shanty towns:  \"At least Chavez keeps us in mind.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) There are many pitfalls to Mujica\'s optimistic 
scenario, but he is an intelligent opposition leader who is 
at least thinking about the future.  It might behoove a more 
sophisticated Chavista movement to open up political space 
for a democratic opposition; we do not, however, see Chavez 
likely to do so, either because he wants to mold his own 
\"democratic opposition\" or because he would not risk 
upsetting his more radical followers.  Mujica\'s view of 
Rosales as the future presidential candidate is still an 
embryonic concept, not widely shared by the opposition still 
two years away from elections.  It may also be that Chavez 
will encourage the opposition in this direction so as to hand 
the Zulia Governor a decisive and ostensibly legitimate 
defeat come election time.

FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS? 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO A. ARIAS FOR REASONS 1.4 (d 
) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The administration of justice in Venezuela faces 
criticism on two principal grounds.  The first is the claim, 
voiced by the political opposition, NGOs, judges, and the 
World Bank, that the justice system is not politically 
neutral, and that prosecutors and judges are acting according 
to political orders from the Executive Branch.  The second 
complaint is that the justice system is not efficiently 
protecting citizens from crime, and that impunity can be 
bought through money or influence.  These complaints call 
into question ten years of judicial reform programs 
(described septel).  This cable looks at the present 
situation of Venezuela\'s justice system and areas for future 
improvement.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Judicial Independence 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Human Rights Watch released a report in June calling 
Venezuela\'s Supreme Court Law a danger to judicial 
independence. The law expanded the number of justices from 20 
to 32 and made it easier for sitting judges to be removed or 
suspended by other branches of government.  Given the 
structure of the Venezuelan judiciary, the law is widely seen 
as an attempt to ensure the political reliability of the 
judiciary.  The report also focused on the Supreme Court 
Judicial Committee\'s firing of temporary and provisional 
judges without due process.  The report cited the fact that 
over 80% of judges in Venezuela are provisional or temporary, 
and alleged that the Judicial Committee has removed many of 
them for apparently political reasons. 
 
---------------------- 
With Us or Against Us? 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Beatriz Perez, a trial judge in the penal courts of 
Caracas, told PolOff August 4 that a fellow judge, 
ideologically identified with the GOV, had asked her, \"Are 
you with us, or against us?\"  Perez speculated that she was 
asked the question because she had not signed the petition 
for the Presidential recall referendum.  Perez, who tried a 
case against Chavista street leader Lina Ron in 2000, 
described an atmosphere inside the Caracas courts where 
judges did not talk to their colleagues, for fear of 
political retaliation.  Vicente Mujica, alternate Appeals 
Court judge and a law professor at the Central University, 
told PolOff November 5 that judges went to work afraid, 
knowing they would have no support from their judicial 
superiors if they took decisions against the political 
interests of the GOV.  Mujica complained that only judges 
politically loyal to Chavismo are assigned to training. 
 
------------------ 
This is Political! 
------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  Caracas 9th Appeals Court Judge Cesar Sanchez told 
PolOff June 3 that, in reference to the cases arising from 
the Feb-March disturbances, a colleague had told him, \"This 
is not judicial, its political.\"  Sanchez criticized the 
firing of tenured judges on a technicality, after a ruling 
freeing an opposition leader arrested in March.  Sanchez said 
judges get around the political pressure by delaying cases, 
and trying to get themselves taken off political cases. 
Caracas 2nd Appeals Court Judge Jesus Ollarves told PolOff 
June 21 that he received threats after ruling on the same 
case.  Ollarves, nonetheless, returned to the Court recently 
to take two high profile decisions against the apparent 
wishes of the GOV. 
 
------------ 
TSJ Solution 
 
SIPDIS 
------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Candido Perez, head of Administration at the Supreme 
Court, and Ricardo Jimenez, head of IT at the Court, told 
PolOff November 8 that corruption and the tenure of judges 
 
 
would be addressed in a new Judicial Reform proposal the 
Supreme Court was proposing to the World Bank.  Jimenez said 
the new proposal would solve the problem of provisional 
judges by creating a National School of Magistrature (ENM). 
All prospective judges would be evaluated to determine if 
they should be admitted, trained for 18 months, and then 
given an exam, on the basis of which they would be assigned 
as tenured judges, alternate judges, or judicial assistants. 
Edgar Lopez, judicial correspondent for El Nacional, told 
PolOff November 21 that Supreme Court Justice Ivan Rincon 
rejected a proposal to have a respected jurist lead the ENM, 
allegedly to reserve the position for himself, or someone 
else who would screen applicants politically as well as 
academically. 
 
------------------------- 
World Bank Doesn\'t Buy It 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  David Varela, resident representative of the World 
Bank, told PolOff November 16 that a Supreme Court proposal 
for a Judicial Modernization project had been rejected by the 
Bank due to concerns about judicial independence.  Varela 
cited the Supreme Court Law, and the high percentage of 
provisional judges as reasons the plan was rejected.  Varela 
said that the Bank could not accept the idea that the Supreme 
Court would use the loan to solve these problems, when it had 
taken no steps to do so during this year.  He said there was 
no prospect of any but low level World Bank involvement with 
the Venezuelan courts until steps were taken to increase 
independence. 
 
---------------------- 
Political Prosecutors? 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  The role of judges in political cases is most 
important in terms of their willingness to confront 
prosecutors who are pursuing weak cases, and their 
willingness to order suspects be detained.  Under Venezuelan 
judicial procedures, prosecutors initiate investigations and 
accuses suspects.  There are persistent claims of political 
prosecutions in Venezuela, largely associated with a small 
group of prosecutors who are assigned all controversial 
cases.  Speaking to PolOff November 10, Danilo Anderson, one 
of the most active of the political prosecutors, rejected the 
notion that there is a political directorate in the Attorney 
General\'s office (Note: Anderson was killed November 18 - 
Caracas 03577).  Prosecutors simply follow the orders of 
Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez, Anderson said.  Anderson 
maintained that the prosecutions are simply based on the 
evidence, and that it was up to the judges to decide if cases 
have merit.  Ali Marquina (protect), a prosecutor presently 
suspended, told PolOff August 30 that Rodriguez had removed 
prosecutors who were not considered loyal to the GOV.  (Note: 
The A/G is nominally part of an independent branch of 
government, the Citizen Power, but Rodriguez was Chavez\' Vice 
President in 2000.) 
 
--------------- 
Or Just Scared? 
--------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Carmen Alguindigue, number three in the Attorney 
General\'s Office until February, told PolOff November 4 that 
there was virtual sit-down strike in the Attorney General\'s 
office, as prosecutors were afraid to take on any cases, 
since they did not know what connections those involved might 
have.  Alguindigue claims to have been fired for failing to 
show loyalty to the GOV.  She alleged that the chaotic 
internal organization of the Attorney General\'s Office 
encouraged corruption and incompetence, as there was no way 
to track cases to make sure they were receiving the correct 
treatment, or to verify that necessary investigations were 
being done.  The result of this situation, according to 
Alguindigue, was ineffective criminal prosecutions, 
corruption, and a breakdown in public faith in prosecutors. 
 
------------------- 
Police Deficiencies 
------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Alguindigue also said problems with the police 
affected the administration of justice.  They are not 
generally competent to carry out investigations, she 
 
 
asserted, or control a crime scene.  Anderson made the same 
complaint to PolOff, and also complained about the lack of a 
ballistic archive in Venezuela.  Alguindigue suggested that 
basic criminal investigative techniques should be focus of 
training for Venezuelan police forces. 
 
------- 
Prisons 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  Beatriz Perez noted that one of the principal 
causes of delayed justice in Venezuela is the corruption in 
the prisons, where prisoners are forced to pay guards to take 
them to their hearings.  If they cannot pay, according to 
Perez and others who have voiced these concerns, the suspects 
miss their hearings, which can extend cases by months. 
Interior Minister Jesse Chacon has acknowledged this problem 
in the press, and promised to solve it. 
 
----------------- 
What Can Be Done? 
----------------- 
 
11.  (C)  Rogelio Perez Perdomo, Deacon of the Metropolitan 
University Law School, told PolOff November 4 that any money 
invested in the judicial system would be wasted in the 
present political situation.  Perez Perdomo studied the first 
Judicial Modernization Project the World Bank financed 
(septel), and found that it did improve the efficiency of the 
courts, and improved public service.  He said, however, that 
it did nothing to speed justice or improve its transparency, 
alleging that real problems are in the Attorney General\'s 
Office.  Ligia Bolivar of the Human Rights Center at the 
Catholic University Andres Bello, also called on the World 
Bank to demand serious reforms before agreeing to finance any 
project. 
 
12.  (C)  The Ambassador, meeting with Attorney General 
Isaias Rodriguez, suggested continued collaboration between 
the Embassy and the Attorney General\'s Office to mprove 
training and organization.  The Ambassado also suggested 
that the Embassy would like to etablish ties with Venezuelan 
law schools to help increase understanding f the adversarial 
system.  Rodriguez strongly endorsed both ideas.  Rodriguez 
also suggested that the Embassy talk to Interior and Justice 
Minister Jesse Chacon about collaborating on projects to 
improve the prison system. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (C)  After 10 years of overlapping, ill-coordinated, 
incomplete reforms, the Venezuelan justice system faces a 
crisis of confidence over its political independence, and its 
overall effectiveness.  The failure of judicial reform to 
produce a strong, effective and respected administration of 
justice system is a result of the politicization of the 
judiciary and the Attorney General\'s Office, and of the 
failure to effectively reform institutions to comply with the 
Penal Procedures Code.  The key issue, as the World Bank 
found, is to what extent there is political will to institute 
an independent judiciary.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s judicial system, according to a variety 
of experts, suffers a number of structural flaws, including 
politicization of the courts and the shock waves of the 
switch to an adversarial court system.  Judges, academics, 
and journalists concur that judicial reform has had mixed 
results, and that the problem is more complex, judicially and 
politically, than may appear.  Several argued that the 
justice system is getting worse, not better, under the 
current Supreme Court leadership, and questioned the wisdom 
of supporting current reform proposals.  This cable looks at 
the history of Venezuela\'s judicial reform and the evolution 
of the judicial system.  Reftel examines the present state of 
the judicial system.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Pre-Chavez Justice 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Venezuelan judges, academics, and NGO\'s agree that 
incompetence, long delays and corruption marked Venezuela\'s 
judicial system prior to the election of President Hugo 
Chavez.  Maria Gracia Morais, Director of the Center of 
Juridical Investigations at the Catholic University Andres 
Bello (UCAB), told PolOff October 12 that incompetence was 
very common, especially among judges in the criminal courts. 
Judicial delays meant that 80% of persons in prisons in 1998 
were waiting for a final decision on their case, which could 
take up to eight years.  The judicial system was 
administrative, written, and secret, with the judge 
responsible for investigating and judging cases.  Morais said 
the closed nature of the system encouraged judicial 
corruption, since there was no effective watchdog.  Most 
judges, she said, were politically identified with one of the 
main political parties, for whom judges did favors in return 
for the parties\' help in becoming a judge. 
 
---------------- 
Judicial Council 
---------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Prior to the 1999 Constitution, the justice system 
had two heads.  One was the Supreme Court, which was the 
final court of appeal.  The other was the Judicial Council, 
which had responsibility for administering the lower courts, 
and disciplining judges. The Council was independent of the 
Supreme Court, though the Court named three of its five 
members.  Supreme Court Administrator Candido Perez told 
PolOff November 11 that there was no mechanism for the Court 
to exert control over the members of the Council once they 
were named.  Morais said that the Council was highly 
politicized, as were the lower courts and the Supreme Court. 
She said the Council named judges based on quotas for the 
established political parties, rather than for their 
competence. 
 
4.  (C)  According to Morais, the division of judicial power 
among political parties protected the parties from judicial 
oversight, or legal persecution, as judges had to face the 
possibility that their party might one day be out of power. 
Morais said this arrangement did not protect those parties or 
groups that were not part of the political system, especially 
left wing groups.  She argued that for this reason, many 
supporters of Chavez do not feel any need to hide the 
political motive of their decisions today, having experienced 
politicized and repressive justice in the past. 
 
5.  (C)  Professor Ligia Bolivar, Director of the Human 
Rights Center at the UCAB, told PolOff October 28 that in 
1989 25% of judges were tenured, while 75% were provisional. 
This meant that 75% of judges could be fired after a an 
investigation by judicial inspectors, and a decision by the 
Council, rendering them more susceptible to political 
pressure.  Bolivar argued that the Council had taken steps to 
correct this situation by instituting exams to tenure judges. 
 She claimed that this process brought the number of tenured 
judges up to 70% by 1996-7.  Appeals Court Judge Jesus 
Ollarves, and the former head of the Executive Directorate of 
 
the Magistrature (DEM) Ricardo Jimenez, however, told PolOff 
they believe there had never been a significant number of 
tenured judges in the past. 
 
------------------- 
1st World Bank Loan 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  In 1992 the Council undertook a Judicial Reform Plan 
with the World Bank. According to Bolivar, the World Bank 
pushed the plan, but it never had strong support within the 
Venezuelan judiciary or the GOV. The project promised $30 
million from the World Bank, to be matched by $30 million 
from the GOV.  A 1996 report by human rights groups 
criticized it as an attempt by then President Carlos Andres 
Perez to force judicial reform through despite opposition 
from the legislature.  According to Candido Perez, who was 
responsible for implementing the project, the aim was to 
improve the organization of the Judicial Council and the 
courts, to make them more transparent and efficient. 
Bolivar, who was an advisor to the program until 1999, said 
the reform was isolated from the rest of the justice system. 
 
7.  (C)  Perez said the project began in 1994, but was 
practically suspended from 1997 to 2000, as the Judicial 
Council suffered a crisis which ended when it was replaced by 
the Executive Directorate of the Magistrature (DEM) in August 
2000.  At that point, $10 million remained from the original 
loan, and the DEM reactivated the project with an extension 
from the World Bank.  According to Perez and Jimenez, the 
project, based on the computer program Juris 2000, has 
allowed centralization of judicial support teams, leading to 
increased efficiency, uniform practices, and reduced 
corruption, by rotating judicial assistants.  Several new 
regional court buildings have also been constructed, and many 
computers purchased.  According to Perez, many of the reforms 
begun with the World Bank funds have been continued with GOV 
funds, including the spreading of the Juris 2000 system, and 
the upgrading of facilities throughout the country.  The 
World Bank also funded a similar, though much smaller, reform 
project at the Supreme Court, from 1997 to 2000. This project 
reorganized the court, and greatly increased its 
technological capability, according to Perez and Jimenez. 
 
----------------- 
1999 Constitution 
----------------- 
 
8.  (U)  The December 1999 constitution changed the 
organization of Venezuela\'s judiciary,   creating a single 
organizational structure, under a new Supreme Tribunal (TSJ). 
 The TSJ is organized into six Chambers; Constitutional, 
Penal, Civil, Social, Electoral, and Administrative.  Under 
the new constitution, the Constitutional Chamber\'s 
interpretation of the constitution has the force of law.  The 
constitution puts the organization responsible for 
administering the lower courts, the DEM, directly under the 
control of the TSJ.  The judges\' disciplinary courts, which 
have not yet been created, are also under the authority of 
the TSJ.  The constitution also guarantees the judiciary at 
least 2 percent of the national budget, to be administered by 
the TSJ, giving it budgetary independence and greatly 
increased resources. 
 
9.  (C) Metropolitan University law faulty dean Rodrigo Perez 
Perdomo told PolOff that the new judicial organization 
overburdened, and over empowered the TSJ.  It has led to the 
creation of a powerful Judicial Committee, consisting of the 
vice-presidents of each Chamber and the President of the 
Plenary Chamber.  This Committee supervises the DEM and 
disciplines judges.  According to the constitution, judges 
are to be trained in a judicial school and tenured after an 
exam to guarantee their independence, but the TSJ suspended 
the exams in March 2003 because they were expensive. 
 
------------------ 
Judicial Emergency 
------------------ 
 
10.  (C)  In August 1999 the Constituent Assembly declared a 
judicial emergency, and named a Committee to purge corrupt 
judges.  Later that year, the Committee became the Commission 
on the Functioning and Restructuring of the Judicial System, 
and under that name it continues to function today, under the 
authority of the TSJ.  Perez Perdomo asserted that 400 
tenured judges were fired or forced to resign by the 
 
Committee. Elio Gomez Grillo, a member of the committee, said 
the number of fired judges was 184, with 33 suspended judges 
by the end of 2001, according to the TSJ Journal.  About 200 
judges passed exams to be tenured following the purge, before 
the program was suspended.  Bolivar, who quit as an advisor 
to the modernization process because of the purge, said the 
Committee reversed the work the Judicial Council had done to 
increase the number of tenured judges. 
 
----------- 
COPP Reform 
----------- 
 
11.  (U)  In July 1998 the Venezuelan legislature passed a 
new Penal Procedures Code (COPP), which changed the 
Venezuelan legal system from an administrative law system to 
an adversarial system.  The COPP came into effect in 1999, 
after a year to adjust the judicial system.  Bolivar asserts 
the COPP had very little support within the GOV or within the 
judicial system.  The reform introduced the presumption of 
innocence, forced prosecutors to take suspects before a judge 
within 24 hours, made pre-trial detention the exception, and 
called for jury trials in serious cases. Rules against having 
prisoners in jail for more than two years without trial led 
to the release of over 10,000 inmates. 
 
12.  (C)  Public reaction to the prisoner release and the 
perception that the COPP was giving more weight to the rights 
of the suspect than to the victim led to a reform of the COPP 
in 2001.  The reform eliminated jury trials, made pre-trial 
detention easier in more serious cases, and lowered the 
requirements for police to claim to have caught suspects in 
the act, among other changes.  Carlos Ponce, of the judicial 
NGO Consortium Development and Justice, told PolOff November 
8 that the reform \"gutted\" the COPP, making it much easier 
for the police and prosecutors to continue to work in their 
traditional, and secretive way. 
 
13.  (C)  Vicente Mujica, law school professor at the Central 
University, and an alternate Appeals Court judge, told PolOff 
November 5 that the Attorney General\'s Office so opposed the 
COPP that it did nothing to prepare prosecutors for their 
new, greatly expanded responsibilities.  Carmen Aguindigue, 
formerly the number three in the A/G\'s office told PolOff 
November 4 that the A/G\'s office had not yet undergone the 
kind of reorganization that was taking place in the courts, 
and could not monitor the treatment prosecutors were giving 
cases, or ensure adequate investigations.  Prosecutor Ali 
Marquina (protect) told PolOff August 30 that each prosecutor 
has a nominal case load of 8,500. 
 
14.  (C)  The COPP also changed the role of the police in the 
judicial system. Aguindigue told PolOff that under the 
administrative law system, only the Technical and Judicial 
Police had responsibility for obtaining evidence for the 
judge.  Now know as the Cientific and Penal Criminal 
Investigation Corps, it and the state and municipal police 
now have responsibility for guarding the crime scene and 
obtaining evidence.  These are responsibilities for which the 
police forces are totally unprepared, according to 
Aguindigue.  She said this increases impunity as many cases 
cannot be won in the courts because neither the police nor 
the prosecutors are capable of completing or supervising a 
competent investigation.  Jimenez also complained that the 
police do not understand their responsibilities under the 
COPP.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Micro-lending has long been a neglected area in 
Venezuela, though it is currently getting more attention than 
ever.  Banks have been required since November 2002 to commit 
at least three percent of their credit portfolio to 
micro-lending, but the GOV is now taking more direct role 
through state development bank BANDES.  GOV officials cited a 
substantial increase in loans, stated the intention to focus 
on import substitution, and demonstrated more concern for 
getting money into the economy than the prospect of having 
those loans repaid.  (There are allegations that the GOV 
micro-lending policies have more to do with building its 
political base than with a serious effort at poverty 
reduction.)  The private sector had already ventured into 
micro-lending, not only with the minimum requirement, but one 
lender, BanGente, has been dedicated solely to micro-lending 
since 1999.  BanGente has been quite successful; it remains 
to be seen if BANDES will be as successful, or even what 
terms they use to define success.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
THE GOVERNMENT METHOD - SPEND IT SOON 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Bank for Economic and Social Development 
(BANDES) was created in November 2000 from previously 
existing state-owned institutions, primarily the Venezuelan 
Investment Fund (FIV).  The FIV had a focus on \"strategc 
industries,\" in particular the basic industrie (such as 
mining, steel and aluminum production,hydroelectric 
generation) provided by state-owne conglomerate CVG (see ref 
A).  While FIV was not particularly large,funding for BANDES 
has incresed dramatically over the last three years, with a 
current portfolio of over USD 300 million.  The urrent 
banking law, in effect since November 200, requires that 
each bank commit at least 3% of is lending portfolio to 
\"micro-businesses.\"  BANDS has been designated as the 
primary institutionfor disbursement of funds from PDVSA\'s 
Social Deelopment Fund (see ref B and previous), and is par 
of the new Ministry of Development Finance - theMinister, 
Nelson Merentes, was and remains the Pesident of BANDES. 
 
3. (C) BANDES Vice President of Planning Luis Quiaro and 
General Manager William Grillet explained to econoff on 
November 3 that the basis of the bank\'s strategy was 
articulated by the UN\'s Economic Commission for Latin America 
in the 1960\'s, endeavoring to use internal resources for 
overall development - as he admitted, import substitution. 
In addition, Quiaro opined that, as many segments of the 
population do not have access to banking services, it was the 
State\'s responsibility to provide it for them.  The vast 
majority of loans are what the bank defines as micro - under 
30 million bolivars (USD 15,625).  However, President Chavez 
has apparently also ordered BANDES to place a priority on 
lending to \"cooperatives,\" loosely defined groups of people, 
perhaps neighbors, people engaged in a common economic 
effort, even a church.  In fact, Quiaro said that lending to 
cooperatives could be based on a \"solidarity security\" - 
credit based solely on this loose association - rather than a 
traditional form of collateral.  These loans would be larger 
than micro loans, but would be disbursed further by the 
cooperative itself. 
 
4. (C) BANDES is rapidly increasing its lending portfolio. 
The current portfolio is about 23,000 loans for a total of 
600 billion bolivars (USD 313 million, 13,600 average), 
having grown about one-fourth of that amount each year since 
2001.  (Quiaro showed statistics that indicated the 
portfolios of some other smaller GOV lending entities which 
 
have been established to provide micro-credit - such as the 
Woman\'s Bank or the Sovereign People\'s Bank - were shrinking 
as the GOV endeavored to \"group\" the micro-finance 
institutions in the new Ministry.)  Its 2003 budget was 
approximately 650 million dollars.  The bank makes its loans 
at as little as 10-12% annual interest (NOTE: the current 
average commercial bank rate is just under 19%), with up to 
2-year grace periods plus the possibility of deferred 
interest.  When asked how to define the success of the bank\'s 
lending plan, Quiaro showed statistics about job creation - 
both direct and indirect - as a result of the bank\'s lending. 
 He also shied away from citing loan repayment as a criterion 
for success, instead arguing that the important concept was 
\"accompaniment,\" i.e., the holistic approach of taking a 
person from whatever stage of life - illiterate, uneducated, 
needing finance - and ushering them through as many Missions 
(ad-hoc government social welfare schemes) and programs as 
necessary to achieve \"independence.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
PRIVATE BANKERS\' VIEWS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Oscar Garcia Mendoza, President of private Banco 
Venezolano de Credito, was quite scathing about GOV 
micro-credit programs.  He suggested that, given the apparent 
lack of interest in repayment, they can hardly be considered 
banking at all.  Criteria for issuing loans, he asserted, 
were quite political, and that the loans were, as is the case 
with GOV \"missions\" in education and housing, they became 
largely vehicles for regarding their supporters.  This was 
especially so in rural areas.  Another banker told econcouns 
the minimum 3% requirement for micro-lending by private 
commercial banks are often ignored, or applied rather 
elastically.  He stated that it was easy enough for a bank to 
break out part of a larger loan to an existing client, make 
it a separate transaction, and qualify it as a micro-loan. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLAN - SPEND IT SMART 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Apart from the 3% of portfolio required of 
commercial banks, there has been little effort in the private 
sector to support microlending.  There is only one bank in 
Venezuela fully dedicated to it - BanGente (Bank of the 
People), which currently has fifteen branches in five cities. 
 The bank was founded in 1997 (the Inter-American Development 
Bank provided 10% of its financing) and issued its first loan 
in early 1999.  It has been quite successful, with 10,000 
clients and profits at 70% of expenses.  President Juan Uslar 
says the primary reason for the bank\'s success is its 
presence in the poorest neighborhoods (\"barrios\") and its 
method of basing creditworthiness not on documents, but on 
visits to the business and interviews of neighbors and others 
who know the business owners.  Uslar also said that, as 
BanGente\'s entire portfolio was micro-loans, commercial banks 
could provide funds and be able to count them towards the 3% 
micro-lending minimum. 
 
7. (SBU) Operations are simple - a loan officer will go to 
the business and put the necessary information into a PDA, 
which is downloaded into a computer for quick decisions.  If 
a loan is approved, the initial terms are usually three 
months at 5% per month (80% annually).  Uslar said that loan 
sharks, who are the traditional source of finance for these 
businesses, charge between 10 and 20% per month.  Good 
payment history may make the customer eligible for larger 
loans at lower rates.  The current arrears ratio is a mere 
1.35%, and the average loan size is about 1.5 million 
bolivars ($800).  BanGente also offers savings and time 
deposits, but sub-contracts all cash transactions to a large 
commercial bank.  Uslar says that, on BanGente\'s scale, this 
saves money, but also reduces the risk of crime, allowing it 
to operate in the areas it serves.  He noted that the 
limiting factor for the bank to grow faster was having to 
train new loan officers, as micro-credit was not established 
as in other countries in the region. 
 
8. (C) When asked about competition with the GOV, 
 
particularly BANDES, Uslar commented that there was so much 
need for micro-finance, there was no competition.  He then 
added that some of BanGente\'s clients have left to seek loans 
from BANDES, but then returned some months later citing an 
inability to get funds. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) The lending philosophies of BANDES and BanGente are 
clearly opposed: BANDES believes in quantity, while BanGente 
goes for quality.  The \"holistic\" approach indicates that 
BANDES does not place high priority on loan repayment.  We 
share the strong suspicion of our private sector contacts 
that the spending, disguised as loans, is just another way 
for the GOV to get money into the economy as quickly as 
possible (see ref D), seeking to force up growth and build 
political support without concern for sustainability.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  Venezuelan police investigating the killing of 
prosecutor Danilo Anderson searched the Hebrew Club in 
Caracas November 29 for three hours.  The search, which began 
at 6:30 a.m. and disrupted the arrival of 1,500 students to 
the school on the premises, turned up no evidence or weapons. 
 Leaders of the Jewish community in Venezuela expressed 
outrage at the timing of the search, and questioned whether 
further actions could be expected.  GOV officials said they 
searched the Caracas Jewish community\'s principal cultural 
facility because they had reports of weapons on the grounds. 
Newspaper reports suggested that rumors of Israeli 
involvement in the Anderson assassination might be behind the 
search.  End Summary 
 
------------------- 
Unsuccessful Search 
------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Members of Venezuela\'s Investigative Police (CICPC) 
carried out a search order issued by Control Judge Maikel 
Moreno for the installations of the Hebrew Club in Caracas 
November 29. The Hebrew Club contains a school, cultural 
center, and sports facilities. Judge Moreno is responsible 
for the investigation of the car bomb assassination of Danilo 
Anderson, Venezuela\'s most visible and controversial 
prosecutor, on November 18.  The officers arrived at 6:30 am 
and left at 9:30 am.  According to a statement released by 
the Confederation of Israeli Associations of Venezuela 
(CAIV), the official report the officers filled out after the 
search stated that no evidence or weapons were found. 
Minister of Interior and Justice Jesse Chacon told reporters 
he did not know the exact reason for the search, but that it 
could be related to reports of weapons being hidden at 
various installations around Caracas.  Police have searched 
various businesses and homes linked to the case. 
 
--------- 
Reactions 
--------- 
 
3.  (C)  David Slimak, President of the CAIV, told PolOff 
November 30 that the search had been conducted at the worst 
possible time, just as 1,500 students were arriving at the 
school housed within the Club.  He said he did not know if 
this was a mistake, or intentional. Slimak said members of 
the Jewish community were extremely upset to find the school 
closed and a police operation underway as they brought their 
children to school. He said the parents feared there was a 
omb threat or an attack had taken place. He claime that it 
was more upsetting to him that the searh implied that the 
Jewish community was somehow implicated in the Anderson 
attack, than if there hd been a bomb threat. Slimak observed 
that the oficers were polite, and behaved professionally 
troughout the search. 
 
4.  (U)  The head Rabbi ofthe Jewish community in Venezuela, 
Pinchas Brener, released a press statement in which he 
expresse his \"consternation\" and \"horror\" at the search, 
pointing out that itwas unheard of throughout theworld to 
search a school. He asked how anyone cold think that the 
Jewish community was involved i the assassination of 
Anderson, and defended theapolitical nature of the Jewish 
community, thoug individuals might be politically active. He 
endd the statement by saying, \"We hope that this is nt the 
beginning of a greater action; if this is tday, we do not 
know what tomorrow will bring.\" 
 
-------------- 
Israeli Angle? 
-------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The daily newspaper El Nacional November 30 
suggested that the raid traced back to the comments of 
Venezuelan satirist Orlando Urdaneta in an interview on Miami 
television on November 23. According to the newspaper he 
suggested that an Israeli commando would be the best way to 
kill President Chavez. (Note: In fact, Urdaneta\'s comments 
were more elliptical, and in response to a question about 
dictators such as Fidel Castro.)  Tupamaro leader Jose Pinto 
 
then reportedly warned that Mossad agents were active in the 
group that killed Anderson. On November 24 the Israeli 
Embassy in Caracas released a statement categorically denying 
any Israeli role in the assassination, and warning that such 
statements could confuse people. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  Venezuelan police have conducted various raids since 
the death of Anderson.  We do not know if there was any 
genuine investigative reason for this or other searches. 
There may be some fear among Chavistas of Israeli involvement 
in Anderson\'s murder, which led them \"logically\" to the 
Hebrew Club.  Rumors quickly circulated, for example, linking 
the incident to President Hugo Chavez\'s visit to Iran, and 
the \"possibility\" that the Iranians warned the President of 
Mossad\'s alleged capabilities and links to the U.S.  The 
timing of the raid could also be a product of police 
incompetence and indifference to public convenience. Post 
will continue to monitor the situation, alert to any 
indications of anti-Semitism.

2002, Rodriguez was Secretary General of OPEC.  He was 
Chavez\'s first Minister of Energy and Mines between February 
1999 and January 2001.  Before joining the executive branch, 
Rodriguez served as a congressman representing Bolivar State 
between 1983 and 1999 and served briefly as a senator in 1999 
before the Senate was abolished by the new constitution.  He 
was elected on the tickets of leftist parties, including 
Causa R and Patria Para Todos (PPT), a Causa R offshoot 
created in 1997 that later joined in political alliance with 
Chavez. 
 
3. (U) During his tenure in the Chamber of Deputies, 
Rodriguez served as the president of the Energy and Mines 
Committee.  He also served on the Latin American Parliament\'s 
Energy and Mines Commission.  Rodriguez opposed the opening 
of PDVSA to foreign investors, authoring a book in 1997 
challenging the legalities of PDVSA\'s privatization process. 
As Energy Minister and OPEC Secretary General, Rodriguez 
pressed for Venezuela\'s strict adherence to OPEC quotas.

Better U.S. Relations, While Respecting Sovereignty 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (U) Upon taking office as Foreign Minister, Rodriguez 
accompanied Chavez on a trip to Spain, Libya, and Iran. 
Rodriguez told reporters his objectives will be to fight 
terrorism, promote Latin American integration, and pursue 
Chavez\'s \"multi-polar\" vision of the world.  On this last 
point, Rodriguez called for the \"democratization\" of 
international organizations such as the UN and OAS.  On 
U.S.-Venezuela relations, Rodriguez acknowledged the 
long-standing oil relationship, called for respect for 
Venezuelan sovereignty, and promised to work to \"reduce 
friction\" between the two countries. 
 
------------- 
Personal Data 
------------- 
 
5. (U) Rodriguez was born on September 9, 1937 in Lara State, 
Venezuela.  He received a law degree from Venezuelan Central 
University in Caracas in 1961.  He also studied economics and 
energy issues at the University of the Andes in Merida State. 
 Rodriguez was active in communist guerrilla organizations 
during the 60\'s and 70\'s.  Before beginning his political 
career, Rodriguez worked as a lawyer specializing in labor 
law.  He is reportedly married but separated.  He does not 
speak English. 
 
------- 
Comment 
 
 
------- 
 
6. (C) Rodriguez is a serious and responsible policy maker 
and will probably be an improvement over his bumbling 
predecessor, Jesus Perez.  As PDVSA president, he maintained 
discreet contact with the Embassy.  It is too soon to tell 
whether Rodriguez will continue the purge at the Foreign 
Ministry of diplomats who do not fully support the 
revolution, though we note it was Rodriguez in charge of 
PDVSA when 18,000 employees were fired for joining the 
2002-2003 national strike.  Rodriguez has been a senior 
adviser to Chavez since his election as president, though at 
times Chavez has expressed frustration with the 
independent-minded Rodriguez.  Rodriguez is also rumored to 
have his own ties to Fidel Castro, a holdover from the 
former\'s guerrilla days.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Most Venezuelan press reports on the Chavez-Uribe 
summit in Colombia November 9 focused on security issues, 
especially Chavez\'s declaration that the GOV does not support 
the FARC.  The joint declaration, on the other hand, avoided 
such topics, focusing almost completely on economic issues 
such as energy (including a Chavez proposal to re-route a gas 
pipeline under consideration) and trade.  A Colombian 
diplomat in Caracas confirmed that indeed, economics 
predominated.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
CHAVEZ: \"WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE FARC\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez traveled to Cartagena on 
November 9 and met with his Colombian counterpart, Alvaro 
Uribe.  While the joint declaration that resulted focused 
nearly 100% on economic issues (see below) - press reports in 
Venezuela were dedicated almost entirely to security issues, 
in particular President Chavez\'s emphatic denial of support 
for the FARC.  Chavez stated in Cartagena, swearing upon his 
mother, \"We say to the Colombian people, let no one believe 
this great lie that some keep repeating up there, above all 
in the North.  We do not support the FARC; we want peace in 
Colombia.\"  He added, \"it is very important that the 
community know in what direction the Venezuelan government is 
going: that of commitment to reestablish the dominion of the 
Colombian democratic institutions and of security so that our 
peoples are not affected by drug trafficking, guerrilla war, 
or paramilitaries.\"  Uribe for his part said that he 
recognized \"the interest of the Chavez government to help us 
in this security problem.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
PIPELINE PLANS: GAS AND OIL 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Patricia Cortes, Colombian political counselor in 
Caracas,  however told econoff November 17 that discussions 
largely focused on economic themes.  She highlighted the 
discussions for possible gas and oil pipelines connecting the 
two nations, noting that both items were pushed by her 
government.  She noted that the gas pipeline could be 
approved by early next year - a technical meeting is 
scheduled to take place in Caracas November 23 to 27 - but 
added that Chavez suggested a new route for the pipeline 
during the Cartagena meeting.  The previously discussed route 
was from Lake Maracaibo to Ballenas, on the northern shore of 
Colombia, but Chavez\'s new proposal was from Punto Fijo (the 
port serving the giant Paraguana refinery) to the border of 
the two countries on the Gulf of Venezuela.  The former route 
would be primarily over land, with about equal parts in each 
country, while the latter route would be almost entirely in 
Venezuelan territorial waters. 
 
------------------------- 
THE OTHER ECONOMIC ISSUES 
------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The declaration had more text devoted to trade than 
any other subject, calling for increased cooperation in 
agriculture and fighting smuggling.  Chavez raised 
electricity purchases (western Venezuela has chronic power 
shortages), and the two leaders \"endorsed\" work already 
completed toward that end.  There was also agreement to 
create an undefined \"binational nucleus of endogenous 
development\" with an eye toward a total of four, two in each 
country.  Agriculture ministers will meet in January 2005 to 
further that plan.  (NOTE: \"endogenous development\" is 
 
 
Chavez-speak for aggressive state sponsorship of small scale 
agricultural and manufacturing cooperatives.  END NOTE.) 
 
5. (C) Cortes indicated that the Colombians considered 
contraband a major issue.  There has long been a problem with 
illegal imports of gasoline, given the cheap price thanks to 
GOV subsidies.  However, the fixed exchange rate has created 
a whole new area for rent-seeking, as buyers purchase 
products based on their dollar value at the official exchange 
rate and sell them at the parallel rate.  A major example is 
steel - SIDOR, the largest steel manufacturer in Venezuela, 
is producing in near-record quantity (see ref B) - and Cortes 
acknowledged that steel was a product that was being imported 
illegally into Colombia. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Since the killing of Venezuelan soldiers and a 
civilian in Venezuelan territory on September 17 (ref C), 
Chavez\'s denials of support for the FARC have grown stronger 
- in the lead-up to the summit, he swore \"on his mother\" that 
the GOV did not support the organization.  But while the 
press, aided by some of Chavez\'s comments, tended to focus on 
that aspect, the economic agenda clearly predominated in 
terms of substance.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  Police investigating the assassination of Venezuelan 
prosecutor Danilo Anderson have killed two suspects, while a 
judge has ordered three former police officers (two brothers 
and their cousin), detained on charges of murder.  Lawyers 
and family members allege that the three were tortured while 
being illegally held by police, and that police used 
excessive force against the two dead suspects.  Police have 
carried out various raids and have allegedly found weapons 
stockpiles and incriminating evidence, though defense lawyers 
claim the searches were carried out illegally.  The search of 
Caracas\' Hebrew Cultural Center, with negative results, drew 
rebuke and caused consternation among the Jewish community 
(reftel A). Authorities have offered no explanation on the 
motive for the attack, though USG involvement has been 
insinuated by GOV officials.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
The Arrested and the Dead 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Interior and Justice Minister Jesse Chacon claimed 
December 2 to have discovered the operational part of the 
plot that assassinated prosecutor Danilo Anderson November 
18.  Chacon also announced changes in the investigative team. 
 He denied newspaper reports that the removal of the Homicide 
Division of the Investigative and Criminal Police Corps 
(CICPC) from the case had to do with allegations of 
disappearances, torture, illegal searches, as Caracas\' two 
leading newspapers had claimed that day.  He said that the 
investigation was now focusing on finding the intellectual 
authors of the attack, and that other investigative abilities 
were required than in the investigation of the material 
authors. 
 
3.  (U)  The investigation thus far has led to the arrest of 
Otoniel Guevara, one time number three in the Directorate for 
Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP), his brother 
Rolando Guevara, former hief of the Homicide Division of the 
CICPC, on Nvember 26, and their cousin, Juan Bautista 
Guevaa, former inspector with the CICPC, on November 28 
CICPC officers also killed Antonio Lopez in a shoot out in 
the center of Caracas November 23. Lopz was a lawyer who 
frequented the firing range oned by Otoniel Guevara.  Marco 
Antonio Rodriguez the lawyer for Lopez\' family, told 
reporters Noember 27 that Lopez\' body had a bullet wound 
under the chin with powder burns, indicating, accordingto 
Rodriguez, that Lopez was executed.  (Comment  There is no 
other corroboration of this report but it is plausible.) 
CICPC officers also kille Carlos Sanchez_ in a shootout in a 
hotel room in arquisimeto November 25. Sanchez_ was also a 
formr CICPC inspector, and was a partner with Rolando 
Guevara in a security company. 
 
------------------ 
Searches Questioned 
------------------- 
4.  (U)  CICPC officers searched the home of Antoni Lopez\'s 
parents, where he lived, November 23.  hey allege to have 
found automatic weapons, C-4 explosive, an anti-tank mine and 
a rocket launcher.  Lopez\' parents, ex-COPEI senator Haydee 
Castillo and Antonio Lopez Acosta, allege that the police did 
not allow them to observe the search, that the prosecutor 
arrived late, and that he did not have a warrant.  They say 
the police planted the evidence in their house.  CICPC 
officers detained the elderly couple after the search and 
took them handcuffed to detention facilities, where they were 
held for two days.  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel and 
Chacon have criticized the treatment the pair received. 
Police also searched Caracas\' Hebrew Culture center November 
29 (ref A). 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Allegations of Disappearances and Torture 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  There are several unresolved questions about the 
 
detention of the three suspects arrested for murder. Juan 
Bautista Guevara\'s wife reported him missing, and alleged he 
had been detained by CICPC officers, on November 20.  On 
November 23, Chacon said that no police force had detained 
him.  On that same day Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez told 
reporters that Guevara had not been detained, but was being 
questioned by police. DISIP officers then allegedly captured 
Juan Guevara in Portuguesa on November 28.  Defense lawyer 
Pedro Miguel Castillo told reporters November 30 that Juan 
Guevara testified before Control Judges Maikel Moreno that he 
was moved from place to place and tortured while in the 
custody of unknown individuals.  Guevara, the lawyer said, 
described being given psychotropic drugs, having a hood 
placed over his head, and being told his wife was being raped 
in the next room, and his child tortured.  Judge Moreno 
ordered an investigation of Guevara\'s charges, and ordered 
him detained for 45 days pending formal accusation by the 
prosecutor. 
 
6.  (U)  Otoniel and Ronaldo Guevara were seized by unknown 
persons on November 23, and then \"found\" by National Guard 
officers outside of Valencia on November 26.  They were bound 
and gagged, and the marks on their wrists indicated they had 
been tied for a long time, according to Chacon.  Castillo 
told reporters that Otoniel testified before Moreno that his 
captors tortured him with electric shock and also applied 
mentholated liquid to his genitals, among other abuses. 
 
------------------- 
Shadowy Backgrounds 
------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  Speaking to reporters, Deputy Cilia Flores 
(Movimiento Quinto Republica) November 29 alleged that the 
Guevaras had all been involved in hiding Former Peruvian 
National Security Advisor Vladimir Montesinos in Venezuela in 
2001, and that she and other Deputies had completed an 
investigation into their involvement, and given it to the 
Attorney General\'s office. She called on the A/G\'s office to 
proceed against the Guevaras not only for the Anderson case, 
but for Montesinos as well. The fact that Antonio Lopez 
reportedly took counter terrorism and explosives courses in 
the U.S., and that the law firm he worked for has an American 
partner led Chacon to claim on November 26 that there might 
be CIA involvement in Anderson\'s murder. Flores also alleged 
that Jose Guevara, another cousin, boasted of CIA connections 
during the Montesinos case. Speaking on November 19, 
Communications Minister Andres Izarra alleged that the USG 
was at least guilty by omission, for not shutting down 
anti-Castro training camps in Florida, where anti-Chavez 
militant are allegedly training.  He also complained that 
satirist Orlando Urdaneta had not been arrested or deported, 
after suggesting on Miami television October 23 that someone 
could solve the problem of dictators with a telescopic rifle. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  Despite the deaths of two suspects, three 
detentions, and various high profile searches, there has been 
no explanation by the GOV of the motive for the attack on 
Anderson.  The serious and repeated abuses which appear to 
have taken place during the various detentions of the 
Guevaras show all the signs of police out of control, while 
prosecutors judges and Chacon try to catch up, if only to 
cover-up their actions.  That two suspects who may have had 
valuable information could both have been killed by police, 
while three others were apparently held under unexplained 
circumstances prior to being officially detained, not to 
mention the speed with which all this is occurring, casts 
doubt on the investigation.  Additionally, the lack of 
independence and professionalism among Venezuelan police, 
prosecutors and judges (see ref B) seems to be coming home to 
roost in the Anderson investigation.

REF: CARACAS 3110 
 
Classified By: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR RICHARD M. SANDERS FOR REASON 1.4 B A 
ND D 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Amidst good news on the economic front, the GOV\'s 
thirst for cash remains unslaked.  Third quarter GDP grew 
15.8% versus the same period in 2003, and the official 
unemployment figure for October was 13.7%, the lowest since 
2001.  However, the GOV\'s row with the Venezuelan Central 
Bank continues, as the GOV is now demanding foreign exchange 
earnings on not only the Bank\'s cash reserves, but also its 
gold holdings.  A Central Bank Director told econoff he 
expects the matter only to be settled in the Supreme Court, 
as negotiations have made little progress.  President Chavez 
has called for more money in the GOV\'s special development 
fund, but the Director thinks PDVSA is already allocating as 
much money as it wants.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
GOOD NEWS - ECONOMIC INDICATORS IMPROVING 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) released GDP results 
for the third quarter of 2004, which show a healthy 15.8% 
growth over the same period of 2003.  This is the fourth 
straight quarter of growth, the first such stretch since 
2001, and also puts GDP ahead of 2001 totals for the first 
time, by 1.6%.  It also exceeds pre-Chavez levels, beating 
1998 3rd quarter GDP by 5.1%.  Independent economists 
attribute the growth in large part to increased GOV spending. 
 Banco Mercantil Vice President Philip Henriquez told econoff 
December 1 that the GOV has 15-20% of market share in food 
sales, thanks to its low-cost MERCAL grocery-store program. 
He also noted that, while people had been hesitant to make 
major purchases (such as cars, homes, or remodeling) due to 
the political uncertainty of the last two or more years, 
Venezuelans are finally moving forward with spending that has 
been put off, given that the political landscape is not 
likely to change for at least two years.  He also suggested 
that the rush to spend could be related to the fact that the 
recently approved budget assumes a 12% currency devaluation, 
which current rumors say will take place on January 1. 
(NOTE: press reports quote Finance Minister Nobrega as having 
said December 2 that \"the Government will adjust the fixed 
exchange rate starting January 1 to 2150 bolivares per 
dollar.\"  END NOTE) 
 
3. (C) Unemployment, according to figures from the National 
Institute of Statistics (INE), dropped to 13.7% for the month 
of October, 3.0% better than October 2003 and the lowest 
since December 2001.  Private estimates differ; economic 
consultant and pollster Datanalisis places unemployment at 
17%.  Post also has reason to question the GOV\'s numbers, as 
a report provided by Luz Bastidas of the INE shows the sample 
for the October survey was heavily skewed toward rural areas. 
 (She indicated in an email that this was due to a high 
no-response rate in more populous areas, but opined that 
month-to-month comparisons were nonetheless valid \"under 
certain considerations.\") 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
CENTRAL BANK, CAN YOU SPARE SOME (MORE) CASH? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Meanwhile, the GOV continues to demand more foreign 
exchange earnings - 3.1 trillion bolivars (USD 1.6 billion) - 
from the BCV (see reftel), above and beyond the 1.5 billion 
already given for the first half of 2004.  Earlier press 
reports cited a difference in accounting method (first-in, 
first-out vs. last-in, first-out), but BCV Director Armando 
Leon confirmed to econoff on December 1 that method was never 
an issue (which helps explain why the BCV has in fact 
regularly turned over substantial exchange earnings), but 
only whether or not profits should also be determined on the 
gold portion of the international reserves (11.25 million 
 
troy ounces, currently worth about USD 5.1 billion).  The GOV 
insists that the gold should be treated like cash reserves, 
but Leon said the BCV position was that there were no profits 
since the gold was never sold like currency reserves and no 
gain was realized. 
 
5. (C) The issue has continued to receive significant play in 
the press, though negotiations between the GOV and BCV (led 
by Leon) have ended.  Efrain Velazquez, President of the 
oft-ignored advisory National Economic Council, repeated in 
the press November 28 his organization\'s warnings that using 
exchange control profits \"can cause two kinds of economic 
imbalances: inflation and an exchange rate crisis.\"  Domingo 
Maza Zavala, another BCV Director, criticized the GOV demand 
for more cash in a conversation with econoff on November 3. 
He cited not only the demand for forex profits, but the 
spending of over USD 6 billion from the Macroeconomic 
Stabilization Fund (FEM) in 2002 and 2003 as well as the fact 
that central GOV internal debt has increased from USD 1 to 12 
billion since 1998.  Finance Minister Tobias Nobrega (who 
called the BCV\'s accounting problems \"very grave\" and said 
the discussion \"is over!\" in October) and Banking 
Superintendent (SUDEBAN) Trino Diaz have made repeated public 
calls for the money, which Leon says has no influence on the 
BCV, but reflects a \"competition\" between the two to see who 
will become BCV President in January 2005 (when the term of 
current President Diego Castellanos expires) or get some 
other key role in the administration.  Leon added that the 
BCV would deliver a report on the profits to SUDEBAN on 
December 8, but that he expected this issue to be resolved 
only by the Supreme Court. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
TO ROTATE, OR NOT TO ROTATE - THAT IS THE QUESTION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (C) Amid reports that the PDVSA Social Fund (see reftel) 
balance has reached USD 1.6 billion (80% of its stated 
maximum), President Chavez has renewed statements that the 
fund should be \"rotating\" in nature, that is, the USD 2 
billion limit is on the balance, not total deposits.  Maza 
Zavala told the press in November that \"the fund is not 
rotating,\" that it was only a one-time approval, but 
clarified that such a change could be formally requested by 
the GOV.  Leon, however, believes that PDVSA is already using 
the Fund as if it were rotating, and noted that the BCV has 
no audit role and the only information it has on the Fund are 
the reports PDVSA prepares for the Bank.  Press reports 
(apparently based on the PDVSA reports) state that, while all 
of the funds so far in the Fund have been committed to 
specific projects, only USD 290 million have actually been 
disbursed. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) The GDP growth is clearly good news for Venezuela, but 
the fact that the GOV feels a cash crunch in a time of record 
income - both oil and non-oil - seems paradoxical.  Maza 
Zavala compared it to the oil boom of 1974, saying it is 
\"like winning the lottery and going to the bank for a loan.\" 
Even if the GOV gets the exchange earnings it wants, its 
deficit would only be cut in half.  Moreover, it would only 
be a one-time benefit, with potentially inflationary results. 
 In other words, it could cost the GOV more in the long run. 
For now, the GOV seems unconcerned.

President Ivan Rincon, Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez, 
Interior and Justice Minister Jesse Chacon, National Assembly 
Vice President Ricardo Gutierrez, Armed Forces Inspector 
General Vice Admiral Orlando Maniglia, and its Secretary, 
Gen. Melvin Lopez Hidalgo, met on November 23.  The CODENA 
called on Chacon and Defense Minister Jorge Luis Garcia 
Carneiro to reinforce port and airport security and register 
pre-paid cell phone purchases.  The Council also decided that 
all GOV officials who might be at risk, including 
prosecutors, judges and high GOV officials, should be given 
24 hour protection. 
 
------------------ 
Anti-Terrorism Law 
------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  Following the meeting, the Assembly formed a special 
anti-terrorism committee to develop anti-terrorism 
legislation.  The committee will work from the draft of the 
Special Law Against Acts of a Terrorist Nature which includes 
the creation of a Financial Intelligence Directorate in the 
Finance Ministry, to avoid the use of the banking system to 
destabilize the country.  (Note: A financial intelligence 
unit, aimed at controlling money laundering, already exists 
in the Banking Superintendency, which reports to the Finance 
Ministry.)  The bill would also create a \"Terrorist 
Investigation Division\" in the Ministry of Interior and 
Justice. The bill contemplates the extradition of foreigners 
implicated in terrorist activities, the use of informants, 
undercover agents, and the creation of a witness protection 
program. The GOV would create a victims compensation fund 
from seized assets. 
 
4.  (U)  Deputy Iris Varela (Movimiento Quinta Republica) 
announced December 1 that a partial reform of the Penal Code, 
currently under consideration by the Assembly, would be 
amended to include anti-terrorism provisions.  Deputy Osman 
Gomez (MVR) told reporters that the special committee would 
consider the possibility that the anti-terrorism law should 
include life sentences for the most serious terrorist crimes, 
though that would require a constitutional amendment. Deputy 
Nicolas Maduro (MVR) added the possibility that the 
constitution might also be reformed to permit \"faceless\" 
judges and prosecutors. 
 
------------------ 
Anti-terror Judges 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Following the CODENA meeting, Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Ivan Rincon announced that the Court\'s Judicial 
Committee had designated of a group of judges to handle all 
terrorism cases.  The designated Control Judges are Maikel 
Moreno, Rita Hernandez, and Florencio Silano.  Rincon also 
announced that two Appeals Courts Chambers would review the 
 
decisions in terrorism investigations.  All of these judges 
work in the Caracas judicial district.  An assistant to 
Supreme Court Justice Alejandro Angulo Fontiveros called the 
designation of the judges \"a slap at the autonomy and 
independence of the judiciary.\"  She asserted that the 
designation would allow the GOV to \"control the whole 
investigation, so if the police and prosecutor miss 
something, the judge can cover it.\" 
 
---------------------- 
Prosecutors Reassigned 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez reassigned some of 
Anderson\'s most important cases.  Luisa Ortega, the 
prosecutor in the Sumate case, will pursue the investigation 
against 400 persons linked to the Carmona Decree of April 
2002.  Ortega has also taken the lead in the investigation of 
Ivan Simonovis, ex-head of security for the Metropolitan 
Police, for the deaths on April 11, 2002.  Haifa Aissami, a 
human rights prosecutor, will continue the case against the 
eight Metropolitan Police officers who have been jailed for 
over a year on murder charges relating to April 11. 
Prosecutor Gilberto Landaeta has been placed in charge of the 
Anderson murder investigation, with the assistance of other 
prosecutors. These prosecutors have been assigned 24 hour 
bodyguards.  All of these prosecutors have investigated 
political cases of interest to the GOV in the past. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  The GOV is not likely to waste this opportunity to 
pass an anti-terrorism law that is to its liking and suited 
to its political needs.  The designation of inexperienced but 
completely loyal judges as \"anti-terrorism\" judges will 
guarantee that there is virtually no impartial supervision of 
how this power is used.

1. (C) In response to tasking in ref a, Post sees no evidence 
that the GOV has undertaken policies or actions to advance 
democracy, human rights, or fundamental freedoms in Cuba over 
the last six months.  President Hugo Chavez is a close ally 
of Fidel Castro and often praises Cuba as a \"bastion of 
dignity\" in the face of U.S. imperialism.  Chavez has 
publicly differed with Castro over the communist model, but 
this has never approached the level of criticism. 
 
2. (C) We are not aware of investment in Cuba by host country 
nor of joint ventures with the GOC.  In the past year, there 
have been press reports about proposals for PDVSA to partner 
with Cuba\'s state oil company, CUPET, in projects such as the 
overhaul of the Cienfuegos Refinery.  We have to date seen no 
information that such proposals have been acted upon. 
 
3. (C) Venezuela maintains a significant trading relationship 
with Cuba, the principal factor of which is oil.  Under a 
bilateral agreement, the GOC purchases Venezuelan oil on 
concessional terms.  Under the agreement, Venezuela provides 
Cuba with 53,000 b/d of crude and other products.  In fact, 
however, we believe that daily exports exceed this number. 
The GOC, in return, provides the GOV with non-monetary 
support, such as Cuban doctors to work in poor Venezuelan 
neighborhoods or curricula for the Venezuelan literacy 
program \"Mission Robinson.\"  Although the GOV does not 
publish data regarding the oil trade with Cuba, private 
estimates suggest the GOC is US$1.5 billion in arrears with 
the Venezuelan state oil company, PDVSA.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Venezuelan authorities took former Metropolitan Police 
commissioners Henry Vivas and Lazaro Forero into police 
custody on December 3, after the government of El Salvador 
refused their request for political asylum.  The former 
police leaders sought asylum at the Salvadoran Embassy in 
Caracas on November 26.  The GOV accuses Vivas and Forero of 
being the \"intellectual authors\" directing police operations 
during the April 11, 2002 events when approximately 20 people 
were killed and many more injured during an opposition march 
on the Presidential Palace that resulted in president Hugo 
Chavez\'s temporary ouster.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Arrested and Charged 
-------------------- 
 
2. (U)  Venezuelan authorities took former Metropolitan 
Police commissioners Henry Vivas and Lazaro Forero into 
police custody on December 3.  They were moved from the 
Salvadoran Embassy in Caracas, where they had sought 
political asylum on November 26, to the Investigative and 
Criminal Police Corps (CICPC) headquarters under heavy guard 
after the Salvadoran government officially refused their 
request for political asylum.  As the two left the Salvadoran 
Embassy, Prosecutor Luisa Ortega advised Vivas and Forero 
that they were charged with directing police operations 
during the April 11, 2002 events when 20 people were killed 
and many more injured.  At the time, an opposition march 
moved to the Presidential Palace, and police clashed with 
government supporters.  (Note: Former Caracas mayor Alfredo 
Pena was also under investigation for April 11 events.  Pena 
fled from Venezuela, allegedly to Miami, and has also been 
formally charged with corruption charges.)  Vivas and Forero 
are now being held in pre-trial detention at CICPC 
headquarters. 
 
-------------- 
Asylum Attempt 
-------------- 
 
3. (U) Salvadoran Foreign Minister Francisco Lainez told 
reporters Vivas and Forero were refused asylum based on 
treaties and international agreements on political asylum. 
Lainez said the decision was made after an exhaustive 
analysis and meetings with the GOV, diplomatic community, and 
the Catholic Church.  The Salvadoran Ambassador to Costa 
Rica, Hugo Carrillo, was sent to Venezuela as a special envoy 
in the Vivas-Forero asylum request and met with Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel November 29.   Lainez denied 
any ties between the asylum decision and supposed oil 
negotiations or the search for votes for El Salvador\'s 
ex-president and candidate for the Secretary General of the 
Organization of American States (OAS), Francisco Flores. 
 
4. (U) Vivas and Forero\'s lawyer, Juan Garanton, said they 
had sought asylum because political persecution made them 
fear for their safety. Lainez reassured reporters that Vivas 
and Forero were delivered to the Venezuelan authorities only 
after reaching an agreement to guarantee their physical and 
mental well-being.  Mexico, Argentina, Costa Rica and El 
Salvador were part of the agreement.  According to the press, 
the leftist opposition in El Salvador had urged that the 
asylum request be denied and celebrated the decision. 
 
5. (C) Constitutional lawyer Tulio Alvarez told PolCouns 
December 3 that he had met with Forero and Vivas the day they 
entered the Salvadoran Embassy.  From the beginning, Alvarez 
asserted, it was evident that the Salvadorans were not going 
to grant asylum.  He said the Salvadoran Charge had wanted 
him to convince Forero and Vivas to leave the Embassy 
premises, but he refused because he \"could not have asked the 
men to give up the legal right to request asylum.\"  Asked why 
they went to the Salvadorans, Alvarez said the two were being 
pursued (Alvarez encountered political police (DISIP) agents 
 
 
in the building\'s basement) and feared for their lives. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C)  More than two years after the April 11 events, Chavez 
and his supporters are still looking to hold some 
non-Chavistas responsible and Vivas and Forero are good 
candidates.  After a year in custody, eight Metropolitan 
police officials charged with the shootings of April 11 began 
to change their story and allegedly implicated Vivas and 
Forero.  Apparently unable to produce a viable case against 
the street cops, the GOV has turned to their more visible and 
well known superiors to place blame.  It is good public 
fodder, regardless of whether there will be sufficient 
evidence to prove the case.  Much is likely to rest on tapes, 
of questionable origin, in GOV possession of the police 
commanders issuing operational orders on April 11. 
 
7. (C) From here, the reasoning behind the Salvadoran denial 
is unclear, although the Salvadoran OAS candidacy may be an 
important element.  Rumors and conventional wisdom also 
attribute the decision to \"petro-pressure,\" but we do not put 
much store in that.  For Chavez opponents, however, it is 
another demoralizing blow that the GOV was able to close out 
the option of obtaining asylum at a foreign embassy in 
Venezuela.

SUBJECT: VENEVUELAN VICE PRESIDENT RANGEL ON BILATERAL 
ACCESS 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen McFarland 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The Ambassador met December 8 with Vice 
President Rangel to get a read on bilateral access. 
Stressing he would meet with GOV officials at whatever level 
the GOV determined, the Amb noted the relatively restricted 
current access to the GOV made it more difficult to address 
issues in our bilateral relationship.  Rangel initially took 
a stand on reciprocity -- Amb Alvarez_ did not have much 
access in Washington -- but agreed to facilatate meetings 
with the Ministers of Interior/Justice, Foreign Relations, 
and Education.  The Ambassador also raised the many USG 
programs/visits that have been turned down or withdrawn from 
by GOV officials;  Rangel said this did not reflect GOV 
policy, but he agreed to review the list the Ambassador 
provided.  In subsequent statements to the press, the 
Ambassador made clear that the GOV should listen to the 
criticisms made by human rights and press freedom NGOs 
regarding the new media law.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador, joined by the DCM, met with  Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel and chief of staff Amb Rene 
Arreaza on December 8.  The Ambassador reminded Rangel that 
he had promised to assist the Ambassador in meeting key 
members of the GOV.  He said that two months after presenting 
credentials, he had only met three cabinet ministers, two of 
whom had already resigned.  The Ambassador stressed that he 
did not stand on protocol, and of course would be willing to 
meet with vice ministers or office directors -- with whomever 
the GOV designated who could speak with authority Did this 
situation reflect, he asked, a lack of GOV interest in the 
bilateral relationship, or skittishness on the part of 
individual ministers?  Neither, said Rangel, what it 
reflected was the GOV\'s concern that its Ambassador to the 
U.S., Amb. Bernardo Alvarez_, was not received at an 
appropriately high level in the USG; reciprocity was very 
important, as was rank. 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador responded that Alvarez_ had never 
complained to him about lack of access; Rangel said that 
Alvarez_ had done so with him.  Rangel urged that the USG look 
at improving Alvarez_\' access within State and other agencies. 
  The Ambassador repeated that in his case, he was not 
insisting on meeting with higher-ranking officials; he only 
wanted to be able to meet with officials who could discuss 
and act upon our various bilateral issues.  Rangel eventually 
offered to facilitate meetings for the Ambassador with 
Interior Minister Chacon, new Foreign Minister Rodriguez, and 
Education Minister Isturiz. 
 
4.  (C)  The Vice President asked about the recent denial of 
visas to a Venezuelan bicycling group; the Ambassador replied 
that the denial resulted from fraudulent documents, 
apparently on the letterhead of the Vice Ministry of Sports. 
The Sports Vice minister has ducked our requests for a 
meeting for six months; this incident underscored the need 
for bilateral meetings and dialogue.  Rangel agreed. 
 
5.  (U)  In responding to press queries after the visit about 
the new media content law, the Ambassador stressed that the 
GOV should listen to the observations and criticisms of the 
law made public by international human rights and press 
freedom groups. 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  The Ambassador spoke to Amb. Alvarez_ in 
Washington after the meeting.  Alvarez_ made clear that he and 
Rangel had discussed and coordinated the reciprocity argument 
before the meeting.  The GOV has made its points about 
wanting higher level contact in Washington; that said, Rangel 
conceded that it would be good to facilitate some additional 
Embassy-Gov high level contacts.  Rangel is loyal to his 
government and is no friend of the U.S., but he probably 
prefers more rather than less contact with the US Embassy.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez asked Venezuela\'s 
Supreme Court (TSJ) December 2 to overturn its decision which 
freed four alleged military leaders of the April 2002 events 
and rejected his request to try the officers for military 
rebellion.  The case is important because it established the 
\"power vacuum\" doctrine to explain the April events, against 
the Chavez administration\'s argument that there was a coup. 
The A/G argues that the Constitutional Chamber should review 
the decision to correct several \"gross errors\" committed by 
the Court.  TSJ President Ivan Rincon promised the Chamber 
would accept such a case in a November 25 interview, leading 
to speculation about a concerted GOV strategy.  Critics have 
called the request a threat to the rule of law, which 
undermines the basic legal precept of double jeopardy, and 
the latest example of the \"judicialization\" of politics.  End 
Summary 
 
------------------------------- 
A/G Asks TSJ to Overturn Itself 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez filed a motion 
with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court December 
2, asking it to review the August 14, 2002 TSJ decision not 
to allow two generals and two admirals to be tried for 
military rebellion in relation to the events of April 2002. 
(Note: The TSJ in plenary session is responsible for 
authorizing prosecutions of high ranking government and 
military officials.)  The officers were Gen. Efrain Vesquez 
Velasco, Gen. Pedro Pereira, Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez, and 
Adm. Daniel Comisso Urdaneta.  Rodriguez argues that 
Venezuela\'s constitution gives the Constitutional Chamber the 
right to review the constitutional decisions of all other 
courts, including those taken by the Supreme Court in plenary 
session.  Franklin Arrieche, author of the decision, and Vice 
President of the Supreme Court until his removal by the 
National Assembly on June 15, told reporters December 3 that 
the Plenary\'s decision was penal in nature, and thus not 
subject to the Constitutional Chamber\'s constitutional review 
powers. 
 
------------------------------- 
Plenary Chamber Ruled \"No Coup\" 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Rodriguez himself sought to charge the four officers 
in 2002 with military rebellion.  On August 14 of that year, 
the TSJ refused, arguing: 1) That the specific charge brought 
before the court had no penalty in the Military Penal Code; 
2) That the facts of April 11 did not back up a charge of 
military rebellion, because the officers did not lead armed 
troops against the government, but rather refused orders to 
lead armed troops against the people; 3) That the officers 
acted in good faith believing President Chavez had resigned, 
as Gen. Lucas Rincon had declared publicly. The vote was 11 
to 9, with two alternate justices, who split their votes, 
replacing two hard line Chavista justices. This decision 
established the \"power vacuum\" doctrine to explain what 
happened i April 2002, as opposed to the \"coup\" theory 
pused by Rodriguez and other Chavista officials. 
 
----------- 
Gross Errors 
------------ 
 
4.  (U)  Rodriguez asserts the points on which the TSJ based 
its decision are \"gross errors\" which the Constitutional 
Chamber should review. According to Rodriguez, the Court 
should suggested applying another article of the Military 
Penal Code to punish rebellion, if the one the prosecutor 
cited had no penalty. Arrieche dismissed this argument in 
comments to reporters, pointing out it is improper for judges 
to do so under an adversarial legal system. The A/G further 
argued that it was improper for the Court to examine the 
details of the case, as in whether troops were used, to 
decide if the case had merit.  Rodriguez also attacked the 
 
 
\"Rincon argument\", saying Gen. Rincon\'s announcement did not 
absolve all actors of responsibility, especially those who 
were with Chavez and knew he had not resigned.  Finally, 
Rodriguez questioned the basis under which alternates joined 
the plenary to tip the balance towards a negative vote. 
Rodriguez suggested that if the Constitutional Chamber agreed 
with him, the Moral Council (A/G, Controller General, and 
Ombudsman) would consider suspending the judges who were 
responsible for the errors, and calling on the National 
Assembly to remove them. This could effect six sitting 
justices. 
 
-------------------- 
Rincon Offers Review 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Supreme Court Chief Justice Ivan Rincon seemed to 
invite Rodriguez\' motion in an interview on VTV November 25. 
In the interview, Rincon suggested that he knew Rodriguez was 
planning the motion, and said if he presented it, the 
Constitutional Chamber would accept the case. Rincon said 
that the TSJ decision had created a sensation of impunity in 
the country, and may therefor have contributed to the death 
of prosecutor Danilo Anderson. He mentioned various times the 
fact that the Court had two alternates sitting on it when it 
made its decision. (Note: This may be the basis on which the 
Constitutional Chamber overrules the decision.) 
 
--------------- 
Double Jeopardy 
--------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Alberto Arteaga, former dean of legal studies at the 
UCV and frequent commentator on penal issues,  called the 
case a grave precedent, in a newspaper interview on December 
5. The Constitutional Chamber\'s authority to review cases for 
constitutional reasons is unquestionable, according to 
Arteaga. What Rodriguez is challenging, however, is a penal 
decision, from the highest court, in favor of the accused. 
To overturn the case, and allow a trial to go forward, would 
constitute double jeopardy, and  undermine the entire 
judicial system, according to Arteaga. Penal Chamber Justice 
Blanca Rosa Marmol de Leon called the A/G\'s request very 
dangerous, as it would add judicial uncertainty to all the 
cases that might be subject to this new level of judicial 
review. She also rejected that the decision denied that there 
was a coup, saying the decision ruled only on the existence 
or not of the crime of military rebellion. 
 
-------------------- 
Justice or Politics? 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  National Assembly Deputy Nicolas Maduro (Movimiento 
Quinto Republica) December 2 said the move was long overdue, 
and a fitting tribute to assassinated prosecutor Danilo 
Anderson. He called for a trial which would reveal the role 
in the April 11 events of economic, political and military 
factors, as well as the role of the USG, El Salvador, Spain, 
and Colombia. Deputy Carlos Talbante (Movimiento Al 
Socialismo) called it a decision which would accentuate 
retaliation and vengeance. Deputy Pastor Heydra (Accion 
Democratica) said the decision revealed the totalitarian, 
authoritarian, and autocratic nature of the regime. 
 
---------------------- 
Who is Left to Decide? 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  The Constitutional Chamber assigned Justice Carmen 
Zuleta de Merchan to decide if the case should be accepted. 
She is the only justice in the Chamber who did not rule on 
the case on August 14. If the Chamber accepts the case, 
alternate justices should make the decision in behalf of the 
four other justices who ruled in August 2002. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C)  The Attorney General\'s action is part of a GOV 
effort to keep focus on the April 2002 events. The goal is to 
buttress the GOV\'s internal and external revolutionary 
 
 
legitimacy with a legal history enshrining the concept that a 
military coup, backed by imperialist powers, occurred.  The 
decision in this case, and the trial that will follow are 
practically pre-ordained, and will probably lead to further 
prosecutions for the events of April 2002. The opportunity to 
rewrite history is as important to the GOV in this case as 
the opportunity to punish its enemies.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) On December 5 President Chavez announced that Finance 
Minister Tobias Nobrega would be replaced by Nelson Merentes, 
a former Minister of Finance and current Minister of 
Development Finance and President of the National Bank for 
Economic and Social Development (BANDES).  While Chavez gave 
no explanation, local pundits noted that the announcement 
came on the heels of a December 2 statement by Nobrega that 
the devaluation planned in the 2005 budget (from 1920 to 2150 
bolivars/USD, see reftel A) would occur on January 1, a 
comment he rescinded the next day after a marked move in the 
parallel market.  While punishment for such an error seems 
plausible, many here believe that Nobrega is stepping down to 
facilitate his candidacy for President of the Central Bank, a 
position that will become vacant in January 2005.  We believe 
that Merentes\'s appointment will make little difference at 
the Finance Ministry.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
CHAVEZ\'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
--------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) While formally closing the \"Meeting of Intellectuals 
and Artists in Defense of Humanity\" the night of Sunday, 
December 5, President Hugo Chavez casually mentioned that 
Nelson Merentes would become the new Minister of Finance, 
replacing Tobias Nobrega, who has held the position since May 
2002.  Merentes had been Minister of Finance for less than a 
year from 2001 to early 2002.  Merentes was then named 
Minister of Science and Technology.  After that, he became 
President of BANDES, and acquired the additional hat of 
Minister of Development Finance in September 2004.  (There is 
no word yet on who may fill those roles.)  He also held a key 
role in Chavez\'s recall referendum campaign structure. 
Merentes\'s tenure in various positions has been characterized 
by scandals.  The Comptroller Committee of the National 
Assembly cited him for at least three legal violations over 
the alleged misuse of 3.3 billion bolivars (about USD 4.4 
billion at the time) from the Investment Fund for 
Macroeconomic Stabilization (FIEM, which became the FEM in 
December 2003) during his first tenure as Finance Minister. 
He was never prosecuted.  While at BANDES, he is alleged to 
have diverted USD 2 billion to President Chavez\'s campaign. 
A more complete bio follows in paragraph 8.

NOBREGA - CUT FOR A MISTAKE, OR A PROMOTION? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Nobrega attracted significant negative attention when 
he announced December 2 (while in New York to arrange the 
issuance of USD 500 million in new bonds) that \"the 
Government will adjust the fixed rate of exchange to 2150 
bolivars per dollar from its current level of 1920 on January 
1.\"  This caused an immediate increase in the parallel rate 
(from about 2300 to 2500/USD), as well as widespread shock 
that the date of a devaluation would be announced in advance. 
 The next day Nobrega reversed himself, saying that the 
timing of the devaluation \"will depend on the decision of the 
Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) directors and is something that 
I can\'t know exactly when it will be.\"  He added that 
Planning Minister Giordani, as one of the BCV directors, 
would be part of that decision, not himself. 
 
4. (SBU) In the meantime, Nobrega\'s departure from Finance 
has been rumored for months.  He is thought to want the 
position of Central Bank President, which will become 
available at the end of January 2005.  There is speculation 
that Nobrega was replaced as Minister in order to facilitate 
such a move.  The Minister of Finance is a participant in the 
 
ad-hoc board that will consider who will replace the BCV 
president.  That board has already discussed who will replace 
one Director (Manuel Lago) whose term ends this month. 
Nobrega\'s departure avoids at least the appearance of 
conflict of interest by the committee. 
 
------------------ 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Efrain Velazquez, President of the National Economic 
Council, told econoff December 6 that he did not believe the 
switch would have a significant impact on short-term economic 
policy, though he thought that bond issuances could be more 
inefficient at first, given that Merentes is a mathematician, 
not an economist like Nobrega.  The only major longer-term 
effects he saw would be if Nobrega became BCV President. 
Should that occur, Velazquez foresees a loosening of monetary 
policy, which would have inflationary results by 2006 and 
2007.  Other opinions were mixed.  Credit Suisse analyst Jan 
Dehn was quoted as saying the move \"represents a policy shift 
to the left and a move further away from orthodoxy in 
economic policy.\"  Caracas Stock Exchange President Nelson 
Ortiz (who, unlike Dehn, lives in Venezuela) told the press 
\"I don\'t believe there will be a huge impact.\" 
 
6. (C) Alejandro Dopazo, an advisor to Nobrega who until two 
months ago was Director of Public Credit at the Finance 
Ministry, told econoff December 7 that he expects no change 
in policy at the Ministry.  He also downplayed the rumor of 
Nobrega going to the BCV, saying that Nobrega was concerned 
about the optics of being associated so closely with the 
current administration and making such a move so quickly.  He 
did not, however, discount Nobrega for a position as Bank 
Director.  He implied that the leaving the Ministry was 
largely Nobrega\'s choice, that he had been waiting for the 
right time to leave after having such a difficult tenure 
through 2002 and 2003. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) Nobrega\'s own comment December 3 about the lack of a 
role for the Finance Minister in deciding when the planned 
devaluation will occur underscores the relative unimportance 
of the Minister\'s role in economic policy formation in 
Chavez\'s government, as does the fact that five Ministers 
have now left the position in less than six years.  Nobrega\'s 
first New York announcement about the devaluation date could 
have been a misstatement, or it could have been a trial 
balloon floated just before moving to another position.  This 
happened recently with Ali Rodriguez, who barely a month 
before his appointment as Foreign Minister floated a 
suggestion that the GOV was considering raising the price of 
gasoline (reftel C).  While this was roundly denied by other 
GOV officials, the precedent is out there. 
 
8. (C) Nobrega had a certain amount of credibility with some 
investors, and he was recognized for his success and 
creativity in restructuring Venezuela\'s debt.  Merentes\'s 
appointment will probably mean little at the Ministry of 
Finance.  Velazquez told econoff on November 2 that the GOV 
treated Finance as just \"an ATM machine,\" a ready source of 
cash on demand and not a policy advisor.  Given that Merentes 
is more revolutionary and less of an economist than Nobrega, 
that could change, though perhaps Chavez already considers 
such advice from Merentes.  The biggest potential change from 
this switch will depend on where Nobrega lands.  If indeed he 
takes a key role at the Central Bank, it will be a major step 
towards achieving GOV control of that institution.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
9. (SBU) Bio data on Merentes: 
 
Born May 6, 1954, Merentes earned a degree in Mathematics 
from the Central University of Venezuela in 1978 and a Ph.D. 
in Mathematics (summa cum laude) from the Scientific 
University of Budapest in 1991. 
 
Prior to his role as Minister of Finance from July 2001 to 
February 2002, he was Vice Minister of Regulation and Control 
at Finance from October 2000 until becoming Minister. 
Merentes was a founder of the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR, 
Chavez\'s political party) and participated in the Constituent 
Assembly that drafted the 1999 Constitution.  He was also 
head of the Finance Committee in the Provisional Congress 
that followed the ratification of the Constitution until the 
first National Assembly elections were held. 
 
More recently, Merentes was President of the National Bank 
for Economic and Social Development (BANDES) and had also 
been named Minister of State for Development Finance in 
September 2004.  While head of BANDES, he also served as 
Director of Technology in Comando Maisanta, the organization 
designated to run Chavez\'s recall referendum campaign.  In 
our meetings with him he has been engaging, while always 
defending the Chavista line.  He comes across as sharp, 
shrewd and ambitious.

Summary

1. (C) Caracas\' El Coche food market is a blend of formal, 
informal, public and private economies.  Accompanied by 
members of the NGO Asociacion Nina Madre (Child Mother 
Association, ANM), poloff visited the market December 7 to 
observe child labor conditions there.  More than a dozen 
children aged 5 to 13 sold produce performed menial tasks in 
the market.   The ANM reps also showed poloff a model 
government \"Bolivarian School,\" nearby.  At the school, walls 
were decorated with references to children\'s rights and the 
need to \"rescue\" Venezuelan values.  In one classroom full of 
world flags, the U.S. flag was conspicuously missing.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Food Distribution Center A Hub of Social Ills 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Poloff visited a sprawling retail-wholesale food 
market in the early morning of December 7 accompanied by 
Marta Moronte and Gladys Madriz, directors of the NGO 
Asociacion Nina Madre (The Child Mother Association, ANM). 
ANM holds workshops and training classes to help young girls 
avoid premature pregnancy and help young mothers cope with 
the challenges of raising children.  The market is located in 
the lower-middle class neighborhood of El Coche and is ringed 
by lower class slums on nearby hills.  Hundreds of 
wholesalers from throughout Venezuela come to the market with 
agricultural products, mostly for sale to small grocery 
stores.  Clientele to the market is a mixture of middle and 
lower class.  The Municipal Caracas Police have an office on 
site and were observed making rounds in the market.  Several 
commercial banks have branch offices on the premises for 
facilitating the cash deposits generated by the sales. 
 
3. (C) Poloff observed more than a dozen children between 5 
and 13 years old working as errand boys and selling products 
in outdoor stalls.  One child told us he had been working 
since 3 a.m. and was not enrolled in a school (some boys 
indicated they did attend school).  Madriz said some children 
pick through piles of rejected produce for items to sell on 
the street.  In the night hours, Madriz said, young girls are 
hawked, often by their family members, to the truck drivers 
parked outside the market prior to opening.  Madriz and 
Moronte also claimed that drug use is rampant in the market, 
and children often serve as mules.  One vendor complained 
that very young children -- as young as three years old -- 
are working as street performers at the entrance to the 
highway that runs near the market. 
 
4. (C) The GOV operates a large building on the market 
grounds with more than one hundred storage or retail sites. 
The hallways of the building are painted in yellow, red, and 
black, the colors of President Hugo Chavez\'s Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) party.  The government-subsidized goods for 
sale appeared to be of good quality and reportedly priced 
lower than the private sector.  Moronte said that prior to 
the August 15 presidential recall referendum, shopping in 
this part of the market required MVR membership.  Moronte 
said that requirement was dropped because \"Chavez owns 
everything now.\"  Poloff observed Ministry of Defense trucks 
loading products supposedly for sale in the GOV subsidized 
markets known as \"Mercals.\"  Poloff also saw an office nearby 
for \"Barrio Adentro,\" the GOV medical program for poor areas; 
the Cuban doctor, according to a sign on the door, was on 
vacation. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Bolivarian School A Model of Order 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Poloff also visited a Bolivarian School, with grades 
first through sixth, where ANM holds workshops.  Bolivarian 
Schools receive special funding and offer breakfast, lunch 
and a snack, a rarity among public schools.  The buildings 
had been remodeled and were well maintained, in stark 
contrast to the surrounding rundown slum.  The students wore 
uniforms and seemed to have well supplied classrooms.  The 
 
school\'s interior was decorated with references to the 
children\'s rights contained in the Bolivarian Constitution. 
One bulletin board read \"Together, with the family and 
school, we are rescuing our values.\"  The values included 
participation, cooperation, responsibility, and solidarity. 
Another said, \"I am honest because my family, school, and 
environment help me train myself.\" 
 
6. (U) The school\'s assistant principal said the GOV also 
used the facility for other educational programs, including 
Mission Robinson (literacy), Mission Ribas (high school), and 
Mission Sucre (college).  Poloff observed several television 
sets with video players in the classrooms.  In a sixth grade 
class, the students were practicing handwriting by copying 
articles of the Bolivarian Constitution out of the trademark 
blue booklets often flashed by President Hugo Chavez.  An 
exhibition entitled \"Traveling Through The Countries Of The 
World\" contained a stylized globe with a projection that 
occluded North America.  Flags of the nations included Cuba, 
Iraq, and China, but not the United States.  Poloff also 
noticed the older classes were supplied with the Bolivarian 
libraries, sets of books produced last year in cooperation 
with the Government of Cuba.

Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) What was noticeable about this trip to the barrio is 
that the level of political propaganda has been ratcheted 
down compared to pre-referendum levels.  As for the children 
working in the market, while there was a sense that perhaps 
things could be better, their activity was not the object of 
repudiation.  We had heard from Chavez critics that the 
Bolivarian Schools are indoctrinating poor children in 
revolutionary thought.  The visit suggested the schools\' 
approach, when there is an attempt to inject ideology, is 
likely to be subtle, as evident in the absence of U.S. flags 
in the school.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) President Hugo Chavez visited Spain, Libya, Russia, 
Iran, and Qatar during November 23-30 as part of what GOV 
officials called an \"international offensive\" to promote the 
new phase of the Bolivarian Revolution.  In Spain, Chavez 
capitalized on Foreign Minister Moratino\'s assertion that the 
Aznar administration supported the April 2002 coup against 
Chavez.  In Libya, Muammar Qadhafi awarded Chavez a human 
rights award.  In Russia, Chavez told reporters of plans to 
purchase Russian weapons and other military equipment \"to 
confront any aggression.\"  He also accused the United Sates 
of \"having its hands\" in the electoral crisis in Ukraine.  In 
Iran, President Ali Khatami praised Chavez for carrying out a 
revolution without violence and for resisting unilateralism 
in international affairs.  End summary.

Chavez Meets World 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) President Hugo Chavez\'s trip to five countries was 
billed by the GOV as a chance to generate new commercial 
deals and to share Chavez\'s visions of a \"multipolar world.\" 
Chavez visited Spain (11/22-23), Libya (11/24), Russia 
(11/25-26), Iran (11/27-29), and Qatar (11/30), a 50,000-mile 
tour that Chavez claimed marked a new era in Venezuelan 
diplomacy.  At each stop, Chavez touted his August 15 
\"re-legitimation\" in the recall vote, denounced U.S. 
coup-plotting and imperialism, and called for a worldwide 
movement of \"popular democracy.\"  Traveling with Chavez 
during all or parts of the trip were Foreign Minister Ali 
Rodriguez, Minister of Defense Gen. Jorge Garcia Carneiro, 
Minister of Commerce and Production Wilmar Castro, Minister 
of Communications Andres Izarra, and Minister of Agriculture 
Arnoldo Marquez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Spain:  All Is Forgiven, And There Is Much To Forgive 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3. (U) Chavez arrived in the wake of Spanish Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Moratinos\' assertion a few days earlier that the 
administration of Jose Maria Aznar had supported the 
temporary ousting of Chavez during April 2002.  Chavez 
dismissed it as water under the bridge, but added that he has 
no doubts Moratinos\' comments are true.  Chavez claimed that 
when the government of Pedro Carmona was briefly installed 
during his absence, \"the Spanish Ambassador in Caracas was 
the only ambassador, together with U.S. Ambassador, to 
recognize the tyrant.\"  Aznar\'s Partido Popular rebuked 
Chavez for overstepping his bounds during a diplomatic visit. 
 Chavez later told a group of union leaders that if the U.S. 
were to act militarily against Venezuela, not only 
Venezuelans but millions of Latin Americans would rebel 
against it. 
 
4. (U) During the visit to Spain, Chavez proposed the 
formation of a \"Revolutionary Democratic International\" 
similar to the Socialist International.  He said workers must 
free themselves from partisan connections and work toward 
\"social justice.\"  Chavez proposed a binational fund to help 
solve the debt problems of Latin American countries.  Chavez 
also brought a delegation of businessmen, including some from 
the opposition, according to press reports, for commercial 
events with the Spanish private sector.  He highlighted 
investment opportunities in the Venezuelan oil sector as well 
as ongoing projects undertaken by the Spanish oil company 
Repsol.  Chavez, however, failed to show at a scheduled event 
at Spanish business confederation.  According to press 
reports, many disgusted Spanish businessmen walked out rather 
than listen to his substitute, Trade Minister Castro. 
(Chavez later dined with King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia 
on November 30, which Chavez described as the \"broche de oro\" 
(\"cherry on the sundae\") of his trip.) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Libya: Dr. Chavez Wins Qadhafi Prize 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) In Libya, Chavez received the Muammar Qadhafi Prize 
for Human Rights for his \"tireless fight for liberty, 
justice, and the economic and political emancipation of his 
people and of all of Latin America.\"  (Previous winners from 
Latin America include Fidel Castro and Evo Morales.)  Former 
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega presented the award to 
Chavez, according to GOV press.  Chavez dedicated his award 
to the memory of deceased Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat 
and slain Venezuelan prosecutor Danilo Anderson.  Chavez also 
received an honorary doctorate from the \"Academy of Popular 
Thought,\" which is the first such award granted to a head of 
state, according to official Libyan media.  Chavez did not 
divulge the details of his two meetings with Qadhafi, but 
praised the Libyan leader as a \"friend and brother\" who 
shares his thesis regarding the development of institutions 
to help the poor. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Russia:  Bullets, Ballots, and Barrels 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) After a working lunch with Russian President Vladimir 
Putin, Chavez told reporters that Venezuela is modernizing 
and strengthening its armed forces to \"confront any 
aggression.\"  He added that the GOV is in discussion with the 
GOR to purchase 40 helicopters, 100,000 automatic weapons, 
and a \"large quantity of anti-tank and air defense weapons.\" 
Speaking about the Ukrainian electoral crisis, Chavez said 
one can feel the hand of Washington behind it... If there 
were elections on the moon or Mars, the United States would 
be there.\"  Chavez signed a joint declaration with Putin on a 
range of bilateral and multilateral issues.  The declaration 
included a Russian congratulations to Chavez for winning the 
recall referendum in an atmosphere of complete respect for 
the constitution, and with the endorsement of \"prestigious 
international observers.\" 
 
7. (U) During a petroleum event in Russia, Chavez said the 
current OPEC price band of USD22-28 is no longer feasible, 
suggesting a new floor of USD30/bbl.  Venezuela state oil 
company PDVSA also reportedly signed a memo of understanding 
with Lukoil for increased cooperation in oil exploration and 
refinery.  Chavez told Russian oil firms they would be 
welcome to come and invest in Venezuela.  International press 
reports said the two leaders also signed an agreement 
supporting Russia\'s accession to the WTO. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Iran:  Standing Against Unilateralism 
------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) In his meeting with Iranian President Mohammad 
Khatami, Chavez extolled the Iranian Revolution, which had in 
30 years a technological, social and political leap, \"just at 
the Chinese did, and just as we are just beginning to do.\" 
Khatami praised Chavez for carrying out a revolution that 
relies on people rather than military or force, according to 
press reports.  Khatami said he shared Chavez\'s position of 
opposing unilateralism in the international community. 
 
9. (U) Chavez said one of the most notable achievements of 
this his fourth trip to Iran is that Venezuelan para-statal 
industrial corporation CVG and an Iranian state enterprise 
would enter into a joint venture under which Iranian tractor 
components would be assembled in Venezuela.  Chavez also said 
the GOV had agreed to buy 486 tractors direct from Iran that 
will be financed by PDVSA.  Chavez hoped to acquire Iranian 
technology for irrigation systems as well.  The two also 
agreed to cooperation in communications which would have the 
Iranians assisting with the installation of \"TVSUR,\" Chavez\'s 
proposal for a South American television station.  Iran will 
also help Venezuela improve its domestic production of 
television programming.  On petroleum, Foreign Minister 
Rodriguez said he plans to have several meetings with GOI 
officials in December to finalize an agreement on 
petrochemicals. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) We think Chavez\'s goals were: 
 
-- showcase Venezuela\'s ability to deal with a broad swath of 
countries and leaders, building on post-referendum momentum; 
-- burnish Chavez\'s credentials as an independent who can 
challenge the U.S. and represent the oppressed; and 
-- advance various energy, commercial, and arms deals. 
 
11. (C) How he did: 
 
-- In Spain, Fonmin Moratinos criticized the Aznar government 
and the USG for supporting the 2002 coup.  His rapprochement 
with Spain may prove important as the EU assesses its policy 
toward Venezuela and Cuba. 
 
-- In Russia, he completed commercial deals and pushed oil 
investment. 
 
-- In Libya, he came off rather foolish as he accepted the 
Gaddafi human rights prize. 
 
-- In Iran and Qatar, he apparently continued oil, gas, and 
other commercial cooperation. 
 
-- Throughout the trip, Chavez ripped into the USG, choosing 
themes (need for multi-polarity etc.) that would resonate 
with the audience and that would boost Chavez\'s leadership 
and his vision for a hemisphere with reduced U.S. influence 
and participation.

Summary

1. (C) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez told an Al-Jazeera 
interviewer December 3 that the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and 
Iraq were \"more horrendous terrorism\" than the terrorist acts 
they were intended to combat.  Speaking in a televised 
interview from Doha, Qatar, Chavez called for world 
solidarity against U.S. imperialism.  He spoke of his vision 
for a South American union as a means to bring about a 
\"multi-polar\" and \"balanced\" world.  Chavez said his 
Bolivarian Revolution is a new attempt at achieving 
socialism, which had been misapplied in the Soviet Union. 
Throughout the interview, Chavez quoted the Bible and made 
multiple references to his Christian faith.  Chavez is 
shopping around his \"multi-polar world\" foreign policy, which 
seemed well received by the Al-Jazeera interviewer.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Chavez Rips U.S. \"Terrorism\" in Iraq, Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (C) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gave an interview on 
Al-Jazeera television on December 3 during a stopover in 
Qatar.  The interviewer praised Chavez for \"caring about the 
poor and downtrodden\" and for defying the United States. 
Chavez said confrontation with the United States is 
inevitable when a country tries to wipe out poverty.  Asked 
about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Chavez said it was 
the wrong way to fight terrorism.  The U.S. had, he asserted, 
engaged in a \"more horrendous terrorism\" by dropping bombs on 
\"innocent children, women, men, and entire families.\"  He 
expressed solidarity with the people of Iraq and said they 
have a right to confront the United States.  He repeated 
accusations that the USG tried to overthrow him in April 
2002, but was unsuccessful because Venezuelans were armed and 
ready to defend their sovereignty and revolution. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Regions Must Unite Against U.S. Power 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Chavez said that, in the face of the imperialist power 
of the U.S., the world has no choice but to unite.  A united 
Africa, South America, and Europe, what he calls \"the 
multi-polar world,\" can gather enough economic and political 
force to offset U.S. power, according to Chavez.  On Arab 
unity, Chavez declined to give advice other than it is a 
question to be settled by sovereign nations.  Chavez 
highlighted South America as a region on the verge of a new 
era.  He called for the creation of a South American Union, 
which he said would encompass a new civilization that rivals 
the Middle East for natural resources.  He said the South 
American Union is the fulfillment of the dream of Simon 
Bolivar that would bring about \"a balanced world.\"  He also 
asserted that the multipolar world will guarantee that the 
21st Century will be a \"century of peace and will provide the 
opportunity for people to live as brothers and sons of the 
same God.\"  (Note:  Chavez and other South American leaders 
signed a declaration on December 9 to create a South American 
Community of Nations.) 
 
------------------------------ 
Socialism Is Alive and Kicking 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) Acknowledging his intent to go \"the opposite 
direction\" from market-oriented economic policies, Chavez 
offered socialism as an alternative.  The Soviet Union fell, 
he said, because Stalin and Lenin distorted the model. 
Neo-liberal policies that are now dominant in the world will 
one day threaten life on earth, he said, and take it into 
\"the fifth hell.\"  He said he uses oil in his \"offensive war\" 
against neo-liberalism by signing energy agreements with 
\"peoples who need our assistance.\"  Chavez said his 
revolution was in the process of collecting new ideas for an 
advanced phase of enlightened thinking, noting that the 
 
 
Bolivarian project aims to place the human being at the top 
of its priorities.  He cited Fidel Castro\'s endorsement of 
Bolivarianism, which Castro called a \"struggle for social 
justice and equality and the full freedom of man.\" 
 
------------------- 
Chavez Gets Preachy 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) Throughout the interview, Chavez cited morality as the 
basis for his world struggle.  He described his revolution as 
an attempt to wipe out spiritual and cultural poverty, and to 
restore peoples\' love of country.  He said the love with 
which Venezuelans work for the revolution is so immense that 
it drives out fear of U.S. imperialism.  In characterizing 
his fears, Chavez quoted Simon Bolivar, \"our spiritual and 
eternal guide,\" as saying he always feared the power of God, 
or whatever you care to call him.  Chavez made multiple 
references to his Christian faith, the Bible and to Jesus 
Christ.  He said his revolution is based on fighting poverty, 
which was the path of \"the Savior Jesus Christ.\"  Invoking 
Castro again, Chavez said the Cuban leader had told him he 
could call his revolution anything he wanted:  socialism, 
Bolivarianism, or Christianity. 
 
--------------------- 
Exaggerated Successes 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Chavez hailed his revolutionary successes in Venezuela 
with some embellishment.  He claimed to have wiped out 
illiteracy, breaking a 300-year cycle of poverty.  He said 15 
million Venezuelans (out of a population of approximately 24 
million) currently receive free health care, thanks to the 
assistance of Cuban doctors.  He asserted that some 10 
million Venezuelans are fed via government food programs. 
The interviewer complimented Chavez for \"lifting millions of 
people\" out of poverty in Venezuela. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez was trying to play the statesman and project an 
idealized version of his revolution internationally.  Even in 
the friendly environment of Al-Jazeera, Chavez resisted 
leading by the interviewer to elicit even harsher attacks 
against the U.S.  While Chavez routinely makes religious 
references, this interview went to new heights.  Chavez no 
doubt understood his Muslim audience and was trying to come 
off as \"People of the Book.\" 
 
8. (C) Chavez is a shrewd politician and a skilled 
communicator.  While his message was crafted so as to appeal 
to his audience, the principal elements of that message have 
been in place for years for those willing to listen to his 
speeches: 
 
-- the inequality and immorality of the United States\' 
international role; 
-- the immorality and illegality of USG policy in the Middle 
East and in the global war on terrorism;

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U)  Venezuela\'s National Assembly appointed 17 new 
Supreme Court justices and 32 alternates December 13.  The 
appointments expanded the Court by 12 justices, and replaced 
5 retired or removed justices.  Opposition Deputies boycotted 
the vote.  Among those appointed are two Deputies from 
President Chavez\' Fifth Republic Movement and the National 
Electoral Council President Francisco Carrasquero.  These 
appointments give President Chavez full control of the 
Supreme Court.  The pro-Chavez Assembly majority pressed 
through legal procedures in record time, scheduling 
controversial special sessions on days when the legislature 
does not normally meet, to be able to approve the candidates 
with the vote of a simple majority.  End Summary

TSJ Expansion 
 
SIPDIS 
------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Venezuela\'s National Assembly appointed 17 new 
Supreme Court Justices and 32 alternate Justices December 13. 
The appointments expand each chamber of the Supreme Court by 
two members, from three to five, except for the 
Constitutional Chamber, which goes from five to seven 
members. The Assembly also replaced four justices who had 
retired and one who was removed by the Assembly. These 
changes to the Court follow the passage of the Organic Law of 
the Supreme Court in May, which expanded the Court from 20 to 
32 justices.  Human Rights Watch called the Supreme Court law 
a grave threat to the independence of the judiciary at the 
time, among other reasons because the expansion of the court 
would allow the GOV to stack the Court with partisan 
justices. 
 
3.  (C)  National Assembly Deputy Leopoldo Martinez 
(Construyendo Pais) said the appointments also increase the 
potential for corruption. He told A/DCM December 14 that the 
practice is for the justices alternates to set up offices, 
staffed with several lawyers, which then \"advise\" interested 
parties on matters that they have, or may wish to bring, 
before the court.  The alternates receive no direct salaries, 
only stipends when they actually sit in for the justices, so 
they obtain income from their offices.  The justices 
themselves receive a monthly salary of 18 million bolivares 
(approx.$9,300) and are paid 15 months per year. 
 
-------------------- 
4th Time\'s the Charm 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  The Supreme Court law requires that the Assembly 
make three attempts to obtain the two-thirds majority to 
appoint justices called for in the constitution.  If the 
Assembly is unable to arrive at a consensus, however, the law 
allows the Assembly to appoint the justices with a simple 
majority on the fourth vote.  The Assembly met three times 
beginning the week of December 6, including special sessions 
on idle days and days assigned to committee work, to elect 
the justices.  The pro-Chavez Assembly leadership staged no 
votes during these sessions, nor did it reveal the name of 
the proposed justices.  They instead canceled the sessions on 
confirming that they did not have the required two-thirds 
majority.  The opposition boycotted the culminating December 
13 session as a consequence. 
 
5.  (U)  The simple majority requirement meant that the 
pro-GOV parties in the Assembly could appoint justices with 
their 86 Deputies alone. They used the opposition boycott, 
however, to bring in the pro-GOV alternates of some 
opposition Deputies to bolster the vote. (Note: Some 
opposition Deputies have pro-Chavez alternates, because they 
were originally elected on a pro-Chavez ticket.) This led the 
final vote on the judicial appointments to be 100 to 101 
votes (depending on the candidate) in favor. 
 
------------ 
Famous Faces 
------------ 
 
6.  (U)  Among those appointed to the Court were former 
 
 
Electoral Council president Francisco Carrasquero, pro-Chavez 
Deputies Luis Franceschi and Luis Velasquez Alvaray, and the 
chief military prosecutor, Eladio Aponte.  Deputy Juan Carlos 
Caldera (Convergencia) told reporters December 13 that 
Carrasquero and Velasquez Alvaray were being \"rewarded\" by 
the GOV for services rendered. Former Supreme Court Justice 
Carlos Escarra, nominated for one of the positions, claimed 
that many of the candidates had \"excellent credentials\", 
including Carrasquero. Rafael Simon Jimenez (Vamos), claimed 
that, \"many of these persons do not have the qualifications 
to occupy a seat on the Supreme Court.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  The National Assembly has given Chavez a tailor-made 
Supreme Court.  It did so with new-found characteristic 
efficiency, using questionable parliamentary tactics and 
absent an opposition to, at a minimum, make the process more 
difficult.  These appointments guarantee Chavez complete 
control of the Supreme Court. The most significant change is 
in the Penal Chamber, which until now has shown occasional 
flashes of independence.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Venezuela\'s Christian Democratic party (Copei) 
agreed to restructure during party federal council and 
general assembly meetings December 8-9.  Frustrated with 
Copei\'s refusal to cede leadership space at the national 
level and failure to share funds, the leadership of the Copei 
youth wing offered resignations and asked that the party 
executive follow suit.  Copei president Eduardo Fernandez 
offered his resignation (refused by the party) in solidarity 
with the movement.  The agreement to reorganize appeased 
Copei youth wing national secretary Raul Chirinos, although 
Chirinos described the process as too slow.  The youth 
movement is prudent to worry about the future viability of 
Copei, but neither its proposals nor the party leadership\'s 
hand-wringing and foot-dragging will serve to prepare the 
declining party for next year\'s legislative elections.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C)  During party federal council and general assembly 
meetings during December 8-9, Venezuela\'s Christian Democrats 
(Copei) agreed to begin to reorganize the party and its 
leadership.  Copei announced that an executive board headed 
by party president Eduardo Fernandez, secretary general Cesar 
Perez Vivas, and nine other members would oversee the 
restructuring.  The party also agreed to name committees 
charged with internal dialog, statutory reform, platform 
revision, and political alliances.  According to Copei 
officials, the party will meet again in January-February to 
discuss proposed changes.  Copei national coordinator of 
organization Luis Ignacio Planas told poloff the party is 
also considering scrapping its dual president/secretary 
general leadership structure in favor of a single, more 
clearly defined leader.  He mentioned that Fernandez enjoyed 
the support of over 90 percent of the party, while less than 
half the party backed Perez Vivas. 
 
----------- 
Angry Youth 
----------- 
 
3.  (C)  Copei called the meetings partly at the behest of 
the party\'s youth wing, whose leadership offered its 
resignations as an example to the party executive to 
surrender positions to those who better reflect the party 
\"base.\"  A visibly angry Raul Chirinos, the national 
secretary of the Copei youth, told poloff before the meetings 
 
SIPDIS 
that the party leadership benefited from his movement 
politically but refused to reciprocate with either positions 
or resources.  Chirinos singled out former Miranda governor 
and Coordinadora Democratica leader Enrique Mendoza for 
failing to provide one million bolivars (approximately USD 
500) that he had promised the youth wing.  (NOTE:  Mendoza 
maintains distance from the Copei party structure.) 
 
4.  (C)  Chirinos was not optimistic about his ability to 
promote leadership change, saying the old guard probably 
would not be willing to step down until after the 2005 
legislative elections.  He said the about 30,000 Copei youth 
would consider walking if the party leadership was not 
accommodating, although he downplayed the influence of the 
youth movement in the party.  Fernandez also offered his 
resignation (rejected by the party) as an effort to promote 
party restructuring, but Perez Vivas told the press that he 
would not resign as secretary general because the party 
\"base\" already trusted him.  He added that he did not view 
the \"33- or 34-year old\" Chirinos as the leader of Copei 
youth. 
 
-------------------------------- 
New Urgency Confronts Old Apathy 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Chirinos told poloff on December 13 he remained 
dissatisfied with the pace of change.  According to press, 
Chirinos advocates realignment with parties of similar 
ideology, and he told poloff he hoped to bring former 
President Rafael Caldera\'s family and former Governors 
Henrique Salas Feo (Proyecto Venezuela) and Eduardo Lapi 
(Convergencia) back into the Christian Democratic fold.  The 
youth leader avowed that an alternative to President Hugo 
 
Chavez would emerge one way or another and would \"run over\" 
the current opposition if it refused to change.  During a 
December 14 meeting with poloff, party executives--more 
concerned with recounting the administration\'s abuses--seemed 
unfazed about the prospect of being \"overrun.\"  Asked if they 
had been talking with other opposition parties, the Copei 
officials merely mentioned eating lunch recently with old 
friends from Primero Justicia. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  For the near term, an agreement to restructure and 
to discuss proposed changes in February appears to have 
appeased Chirinos, but the youth movement\'s concerns about 
the party\'s uncertain future are warranted.  With legislative 
elections that could relegate Copei to Venezuelan electoral 
history less than a year away, Copei can ill afford a lengthy 
period of self-reflection.  Now scrapping for funds, Copei is 
a network of friends and families whose politicians lack 
public support and whose political base has been gradually 
emigrating from Venezuela.  Digging up discredited fossils 
such as former President Caldera and figures like Salas Feo, 
however, would hardly offer life support to a party that 
needs above all to shed its \"oligarchic\" image, which Chavez 
so successfully exploits.

SUBJECT: TACHIRA STATE: VISIT TO THE VENEZUELAN BORDER 
 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Abelardo A. Arias for Reason 1.4(d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Representatives of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) working near Venezuela\'s 
border with Colombia described the refugee situation as a 
growing political problem, particularly in the face of 
increasing security concerns on the border, during Poloffs 
visit to Tachira State December 13.  The director of the 
office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Tachira State also 
told Poloff that gaining cooperation from other government 
agencies to assist refugees hampered by security concerns. 
There has been good response on necessities, she said, but 
the legal system lags behind.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Conditions of a Refugee Town 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff visited a Colombian immigrant town of 6,000 to 
8,000 people close to the Venezuelan border town of Urena 
December 13.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) field worker Marisol Suarez introduced Poloff to five 
Colombian women living in the town, at least four of whom 
were seeking refugee status.  Living conditions varied from 
brick shanties to wood and plastic bag constructions, 
depending on the length of time a family had been there. 
Some had arrived as recently as three months ago, while 
others had more than four years living there.  Two of the 
women\'s homes had provisionary water collection tanks, one 
had unreliable electricity. 
 
---------------------------- 
UNHCR: Refugees and Security 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (C) UNHCR field officer Markku Aikomus said that as of 
December 13, almost 3,800 Colombians had requested refugee 
status in Venezuela, and approximately 1,500 of those were in 
Tachira.  Aikomus said that traditionally most Colombians 
crossing the border came in small groups and assimilated into 
the local population, so only three or four towns like Urena 
existed in Tachira.  In the face of growing security concerns 
on the border, Aikomus said, police and National Guard 
authorities are becoming increasingly suspicious of 
Colombians, alleging that many are guerrilla or paramilitary. 
 Aikomus conceded it is hard to distinguish between genuine 
refugees and irregular forces.  He pointed out the 
inconsistency between the authorities alleged concern about 
who was coming across the border and the GOV,s lack of 
funding and focus on identifying individuals crossing the 
border. 
 
4. (C) Aikomus also reiterated concern, expressed by UNHCR 
regional representative Maria Virginia Trimarco in early 
December, about the radio statement made by the General in 
charge of the Theater of Operations in Apure State where he 
linked UNHCR activities to the CIA.  Aikomus said if the 
rumor became widespread, it could effect both the security of 
UNHCR\'s employees and its ability to do its job. 
 
5. (C) Aikomus asserted that he had seen a notable 
deterioration in the security situation on the border and an 
increased presence of paramilitary forces in the past year. 
Aikomus said he feared a backlash in the Venezuelan community 
that has traditionally been accepting and helpful towards 
refugees and Colombians crossing the border.  Aikomus said 
some Venezuelans worried about the deteriorating security 
situation are linking the Colombians to pro- or anti- GOV 
efforts.  Aikomus said some Venezuelans blame President Hugo 
Chavez\'s alleged affiliation with the FARC for his ignoring 
the deteriorating security situation on the border. Others, 
he said, blame the U.S. backing of Colombian security forces 
for pushing the conflict into Venezuela.  Others still blame 
the Colombian population directly for helping President 
Chavez defeat the opposition in the August 15 referendum. 
 
------- 
Caritas 
------- 
 
6. (U) Mercedes Ascano, the Caritas field office director in 
San Cristobal told Poloff that about 70% of the people 
 
Caritas helps in Tachira State were on the border, while 30% 
were dispersed throughout local communities in the interior 
of the state.  While security is a concern for Caritas 
workers, Ascano said she felt protected by the people Caritas 
helps.  After two years in the field, Ascano said the 
relationship with the National Guard and police had improved 
because Caritas was becoming more recognizable.  Ascano 
asserted that of the approximately 300 refugee cases that 
have been adjudicated in 2004, all the applicants were from 
Caracas where the National Refugee Commission headquarters is 
located, or from Tachira State where the GOV,s local refugee 
Technical Secretariat office accepts applications.  She 
lamented that the Technical Secretariat refugee field offices 
that were supposed to open in bordering Apure and Zulia 
State, where almost 60% of the refugee applications come 
from, were still conceptual rather than a reality. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Defensoria: Defending People\'s Rights 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Ilia Medina, the director of the Human Rights 
Ombudmans (Defensoria del Pueblo) in Tachira State, told 
Poloff December 14 that gaining cooperation from other 
government agencies to assist refugees was slow, but that 
that was to be expected because the work was long-term. 
Medina claimed that the most progress had been made in the 
areas of water, electricity and transportation.  The 
prosecutor\'s office, the judges and the court system, she 
said, were the most resistant to the Defensoria,s 
intervention and requests for information.  The deteriorating 
security situation in Tachira made the job more difficult 
because employees never knew who the person they were 
requesting information or an accounting from was associated 
with (guerrilla, paramilitaries). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Security was a consistent topic of conversation in 
each meeting.  While the refugee workers did not cite 
incidents, the atmosphere of uncertainty makes their work 
more difficult.  The clearest sign of progress is that the 
GOV has adjudicated nearly 10% of the requests for refugee 
status; progress that exacerbation of the security situation 
on the border could easily stymie.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Venezuela\'s economic recovery continues based on 
high government expenditures and strong consumption levels. 
Unemployment has continued its slow decline.  Inflation, 
while slowing, remains somewhat high.  The balance of 
payments has moved from strong surplus to a near even 
position.  Foreign exchange controls have contributed to the 
accumulation of excess liquidity in the economy and low 
interest rates during 2004. However, controls have been 
administered in an increasingly more accommodative fashion 
as oil revenue has increased and reserves have risen. 
Demand for credit has begun to rise with the economic 
recovery.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
--------------- 
 
2.  (U) Total GDP increased by 20.4 percent in real terms 
during the period January-September of 2004 compared with 
the levels of economic activity registered during the same 
period of the previous year, after two consecutive years of 
deep economic recession. However, January-September 2004 GDP 
level is still below the GDP level for the same period of 
2001. The 2004 economic recovery has been driven by a large 
increase in government expenditures, based on higher than 
expected oil prices, which in turn has generated higher 
consumption levels.

UNEMPLOYMENT 
------------ 
 
3. (U) September 2004 figures from the National Institute of 
Statistics (INE) indicate an average unemployment rate of 
14.5 percent. This figure represents 1.77 million unemployed 
out of a labor force of 12.25 million, and a total 
population of 26.09 million. INE\'s figures are disputed by 
the private sector. (According to Datanalisis, a private 
pollster and consultancy which uses a different methodology, 
the unemployment rate is around 17 percent.) Shifts in the 
work force from the formal to the informal sector of the 
economy, which accounts for almost a half of the occupied 
working labor force, have mitigated unemployment to some 
extent.

OPEC production quota has been 3.11 million barrels a day 
since November 1, 2004. Venezuela\'s oil production has been 
below the quota, according to OPEC figures. Oil prices

MONEY SUPPLY/M2

5. (U) Monetary liquidity increased 48.3 percent from 
October 2003 to October 2004, largely as a result of 
exchange controls and increases in government expenditure. 
Much of the excess liquidity accumulated in the economy 
during these months has been withdrawn by the BCV by issuing 
government bonds and certificates of deposits to domestic 
banks.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (U) The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) reported that 
consumer prices for the Caracas metropolitan area rose 19.5 
percent from November 2003 to November 2004. Consumer prices 
lagged producer prices, however, as wholesale prices 
increased by 24.2 percent during the same period. (Note: The 
GOV imposed price controls February 11, 2003 on some primary 
food items, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products as a 
complement to the exchange control regime.) Core inflation 
removes the most volatile categories from the CPI. The GOV 
periodically adjusts regulated basic food staples, the last 
time at the beginning of November 2004.

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
7.  (U) Interest rates reported by the Central Bank in 2004 
continue the downward trend of 2003. Excess liquidity 
arising from the application of exchange controls was the 
most important cause of this trend. However, credit card, 
mortgage, and auto loan rates have been kept at levels that 
are now than double the average loan rate for most 
consumers. The spread between lending and deposit rates 
decreased from 6.59 percent in January 2004 to 3.21 percent 
in November 2004.

EXCHANGE RATES AND BCV LIQUIDATIONS 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) The exchange control system pegged the bolivar at 
1,600/USD on February 5, 2003. One year later, on February 7, 
2004, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank devalued the 
Bolivar 20 percent, to 1,920.00. The National Exchange Control 
Administration (CADIVI) oversees all official foreign exchange 
transactions. As official foreign exchange liquidations have been 
increasing during the last months, the exchange rate in the 
parallel market has been decreasing. The national budget for 2005 
assumes that the new official average exchange rate will be 
2,150/USD, representing a devaluation of 12 percent. The parallel 
market exchange rate closed at around 2,500/USD at the end of 
November 2004.

9. (U) Non-oil exports increased 38.4 percent during January- 
September 2004 compared with the same period of last year. 
According to INE, exports of base metals (aluminum, steel, 
and others) accounted for 42.2 percent of total non-oil 
exports for the period January-September 2004, followed by 
mineral products (19.7 percent), and chemicals (14.9 
percent). The United States was the largest recipient of 
Venezuela\'s non-oil exports (41.8 percent), followed by 
Colombia (13.5 percent), and Mexico (5.8 percent). Imports 
increased by 62.7 percent during January-September 2004 
compared with the same period of last year as approvals and 
liquidations of foreign exchange increased during 2004.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 
------------------- 
 
10. (U) Venezuela\'s balance of payments registered a surplus 
of USD 294 million during the period January-September of 
2004, compared with a surplus of USD 3.79 billion during the 
same period of last year. Although the current account 
surplus was higher than the year before because of the rise 
in oil prices, the capital and financial deficit was much 
more higher, contributing to the overall balance\'s lower 
surplus during the first nine months of 2004. PDVSA\'s 
operations, including the buyback of part of its external 
debt, and higher private sector repatriation of capital 
contributed to these results.

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES

11.  (U) BCV-held international reserves increased nearly 
continuously after exchange controls were imposed in 
February 2003 until May 2004. PDVSA\'s sales of dollars to 
the Central Bank were partially suspended in order to direct 
oil revenues to a USD 2.0 billion Social Development Fund, 
the creation of which has been very controversial. Reserves 
dropped USD 2,509 million on August 2, after PDVSA completed 
the buyback of part of its external debt. During September, 
October, and November 2004 reserves have been increasing 
slightly.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.  (U) Total central government expenditures are expected 
to increase by 46.2 percent during 2004 in comparison with 
last year, according to a projection made by Banco 
Mercantil. Increased spending during 2004 has continued the 
same trend of expansion initiated in mid-2003. This has been 
possible because of stronger oil prices, as well as higher 
collection of internal taxes.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT 
------------------ 
 
13. (U) The government has been actively refinancing its 
domestic and external debt during 2003 and 2004. Domestic 
bonds and treasury promissory notes dramatically increased 
both in the share of domestic banks\' portfolio holdings and 
in the share of the GOV\'s debt. At the end of September 
2004, the Ministry of Finance issued bonds for the 
equivalent of USD 1.5 billion to exchange old bonds for U.S. 
dollar-denominated global bonds due 2014.

BANKING SYSTEM 
-------------- 
 
14.  (U) Credit demand increased during January-September 
2004 as a result of the rebound of the economy, although at 
a lower level than 2002. The percentage of past due loans 
decreased from December 2003 to September 2004. This figure 
has been decreasing since 2002 as banks have been cleaning 
up their credit portfolios, declaring more past due loans as 
outright losses.

CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 
---------------------------- 
 
16. (U) The Caracas Stock Exchange (CSE) index closed at 
29,306.54 at the end of November 2004, decreasing 1.1 
percent from the end of the previous month but up 37.0% from 
November 2003. A primary catalyst in this rise is the use of 
CSE shares to acquire American Depositary Receipts on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are then used as foreign 
exchange vehicles. However, the CSE has also benefited from 
the lack of other investment opportunities in the broader 
economy and from the recovery.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Venezuela\'s economic recovery continues based on 
high government expenditures and strong consumption levels. 
Unemployment has continued its slow decline.  Inflation, 
while slowing, remains somewhat high.  The balance of 
payments has moved from strong surp 
lus to a near even 
position.  Foreign exchange controls have contributed to the 
accumulation of excess liquidity in the economy and low 
interest rates during 2004. However, controls have been 
administered in an increasingly more accommodative fashion 
as oil revenue has increased and reserves have risen. 
Demand for credit has begun to rise with the economic 
recovery.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
--------------- 
 
2.  (U) Total GDP increased by 20.4 percent in real terms 
during the period January-September of 2004 compared with 
the levels of economic activity registered during the same 
period of the previous year, after two consecutive years of 
deep economic recession. However, January-September 2004 GDP 
level is still below the GDP level for the same period of 
2001. The 2004 economic recovery has been driven by a large 
increase in government expenditures, based on higher than 
expected oil prices, which in turn has generated higher 
consumption levels.

UNEMPLOYMENT 
------------ 
 
3. (U) September 2004 figures from the National Institute of 
Statistics (INE) indicate an average unemployment rate of 
14.5 percent. This figure represents 1.77 million unemployed 
out of a labor force of 12.25 million, and a total 
population of 26.09 million. INE\'s figures are disputed by 
the private sector. (According to Datanalisis, a private 
pollster and consultancy which uses a different methodology, 
the unemployment rate is around 17 percent.) Shifts in the 
work force from the formal to the informal sector of the 
economy, which accounts for almost a half of the occupied 
working labor force, have mitigated unemployment to some 
extent.

OIL PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) The total value of oil exports reached USD 23.7 
billion during the period January-September 2004 with an 
average export price of USD 32.4 per barrel. Venezuela\'s 
OPEC production quota has been 3.11 million barrels a day 
since November 1, 2004. Venezuela\'s oil production has been 
below the quota, according to OPEC figures. Oil prices 
(Venezuelan basket) have been increasing during 2004, 
reaching a record high of USD 43.09 per barrel during 
October 2004.

MONEY SUPPLY/M2 
--------------- 
 
5. (U) Monetary liquidity increased 48.3 percent from 
October 2003 to October 2004, largely as a result of 
exchange controls and increases in government expenditure. 
Much of the excess liquidity accumulated in the economy 
during these months has been withdrawn by the BCV by issuing 
government bonds and certificates of deposits to domestic 
banks.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (U) The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) reported that 
consumer prices for the Caracas metropolitan area rose 19.5 
percent from November 2003 to November 2004. Consumer prices 
lagged producer prices, however, as wholesale prices 
increased by 24.2 percent during the same period. (Note: The 
GOV imposed price controls February 11, 2003 on some primary 
food items, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products as a 
complement to the exchange control regime.) Core inflation 
removes the most volatile categories from the CPI. The GOV 
periodically adjusts regulated basic food staples, the last 
time at the beginning of November 2004.

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
7.  (U) Interest rates reported by the Central Bank in 2004 
continue the downward trend of 2003. Excess liquidity 
arising from the application of exchange controls was the 
most important cause of this trend. However, credit card, 
mortgage, and auto loan rates have been kept at levels that 
are now than double the average loan rate for most 
consumers. The spread between lending and deposit rates 
decreased from 6.59 percent in January 2004 to 3.21 percent 
in November 2004.

EXCHANGE RATES AND BCV LIQUIDATIONS 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) The exchange control system pegged the bolivar at 
1,600/USD on February 5, 2003. One year later, on February 7, 
2004, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank devalued the 
Bolivar 20 percent, to 1,920.00. The National Exchange Control 
Administration (CADIVI) oversees all official foreign exchange 
transactions. As official foreign exchange liquidations have been 
increasing during the last months, the exchange rate in the 
parallel market has been decreasing. The national budget for 2005 
assumes that the new official average exchange rate will be 
2,150/USD, representing a devaluation of 12 percent. The parallel 
market exchange rate closed at around 2,500/USD at the end of 
November 2004.

9. (U) Non-oil exports increased 38.4 percent during January- 
September 2004 compared with the same period of last year. 
According to INE, exports of base metals (aluminum, steel, 
and others) accounted for 42.2 percent of total non-oil 
exports for the period January-September 2004, followed by 
mineral products (19.7 percent), and chemicals (14.9 
percent). The United States was the largest recipient of 
Venezuela\'s non-oil exports (41.8 percent), followed by 
 
Colombia (13.5 percent), and Mexico (5.8 percent). Imports 
increased by 62.7 percent during January-September 2004 
compared with the same period of last year as approvals and 
liquidations of foreign exchange increased during 2004.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 
------------------- 
 
10. (U) Venezuela\'s balance of payments registered a surplus 
of USD 294 million during the period January-September of 
2004, compared with a surplus of USD 3.79 billion during the 
same period of last year. Although the current account 
surplus was higher than the year before because of the rise 
in oil prices, the capital and financial deficit was much 
more higher, contributing to the overall balance\'s lower 
surplus during the first nine months of 2004. PDVSA\'s 
operations, including the buyback of part of its external 
debt, and higher private sector repatriation of capital 
contributed to these results.

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES

11.  (U) BCV-held international reserves increased nearly 
continuously after exchange controls were imposed in 
February 2003 until May 2004. PDVSA\'s sales of dollars to 
the Central Bank were partially suspended in order to direct 
oil revenues to a USD 2.0 billion Social Development Fund, 
the creation of which has been very controversial. Reserves 
dropped USD 2,509 million on August 2, after PDVSA completed 
the buyback of part of its external debt. During September, 
October, and November 2004 reserves have been increasing 
 
slightly.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.  (U) Total central government expenditures are expected 
to increase by 46.2 percent during 2004 in comparison with 
last year, according to a projection made by Banco 
Mercantil. Increased spending during 2004 has continued the 
same trend of expansion initiated in mid-2003. This has been 
possible because of stronger oil prices, as well as higher 
collection of internal taxes.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT 
------------------ 
 
13. (U) The government has been actively refinancing its 
domestic and external debt during 2003 and 2004. Domestic 
bonds and treasury promissory notes dramatically increased 
both in the share of domestic banks\' portfolio holdings and 
in the share of the GOV\'s debt. At the end of September 
2004, the Ministry of Finance issued bonds for the 
equivalent of USD 1.5 billion to exchange old bonds for U.S. 
dollar-denominated global bonds due 2014.

BANKING SYSTEM 
-------------- 
 
14.  (U) Credit demand increased during January-September 
2004 as a result of the rebound of the economy, although at 
a lower level than 2002. The percentage of past due loans 
decreased from December 2003 to September 2004. This figure 
has been decreasing since 2002 as banks have been cleaning 
up their credit portfolios, declaring more past due loans as 
outright losses.

CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 
---------------------------- 
 
16. (U) The Caracas Stock Exchange (CSE) index closed at 
29,306.54 at the end of November 2004, decreasing 1.1 
percent from the end of the previous month but up 37.0% from 
November 2003. A primary catalyst in this rise is the use of 
CSE shares to acquire American Depositary Receipts on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are then used as foreign 
exchange vehicles. However, the CSE has also benefited from 
the lack of other investment opportunities in the broader 
economy and from the recovery.

SUBJECT: CONTENT LAW NOW IN EFFECT, MEDIA STRUGGLE TO ADJUST 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ABELARDO ARIAS FOR REASON 1.4 (D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Signed by President Hugo Chavez Frias on December 7, 
the \"Law for Social Responsibility in Radio and Television\" 
went into effect with its publication in the official gazette 
December 8. The final legislation reflects some last minute 
changes to a handful of articles, but remains much the same 
as reported in reftels. Television and radio stations began 
adjusting their content and news coverage immediately, as was 
evident in the media in Caracas on the day the law was 
finalized. While some adjust, others have taken a more 
defiant or fatalistic attitude, awaiting government reaction. 
Meanwhile, stations are rushing to train employees to avoid 
violations, while reconfiguring hours and even making changes 
to their physical facilities, all in anticipation of March 7, 
when another tier of the staggered requirements goes into 
effect. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
STREET VENDORS AND POLICE CLASH, BUT FEW WITNESS THE RIOT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (C) As Venezuela\'s media content law came into effect 
December 8, street vendors and Caracas police clashed in the 
city center as the authorities attempted to remove the 
vendors\' stalls from the sidewalks. The disturbances left 
dozens hospitalized, but while it was in progress, most 
broadcast media only spoke of the melee, and referred viewers 
to their respective web pages where more complete and graphic 
coverage could be included.  Private media executives told 
Emboffs that at first they didn\'t feel comfortable using 
images of the incident, while confusion reigned in newsrooms 
over what could be shown under the law. Several said they 
decided to begin transmitting certain images only after state 
television channel Venezolana de Television (VTV) broadcast 
live coverage. All-news channel Globovision, a primary target 
of government action in recent years, broadcast some select 
footage live. They held all taped footage until after 23:00, 
when violent images are permitted under the law. Radio 
Caracas Television (RCTV) said they broadcast scenes of the 
disturbances as they normally would. The largest station, 
Venevision (who competitors derisively accuse of capitulating 
to the government), refrained from any live coverage of the 
incident. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND: MEDIA TRY TO CONFORM 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (C) Most broadcast media are complying as best they can 
with the vaguely-written law,  difficult since the directory 
of rules has yet to be written by the state 
telecommunications regulatory agency, CONATEL. Stations are 
holding special training sessions for employees, many of whom 
worry about making one small mistake, such as forgetting to 
visually identify \"archive\" footage. Such mistakes can lead 
to a hefty fine, and count as one strike of two that would 
lead to a station\'s suspension for up to 72 hours. The same 
type of mistake, if made four times within five years, would 
incur a penalty ranging from suspension for up to five years 
or, most seriously, revocation of the stations\'s broadcast 
concession. 
 
4. (C) Venevision has put a five-second monitored delay on 
all broadcasts, 24 hours a day, the cost of which is 
prohibitive for most other stations. The channel, owned by 
Gustavo Cisneros, has also built a special new suite of rooms 
outside their master control room to limit access to the 
station\'s nerve center.  Most private media confess to being 
worried about government-aligned \"spies\" in their midst who 
would sabotage the station to incur fines and shut-downs. 
Venevision\'s changes ensure that only the most trusted 
employees have access to the master control, while taped 
programming is passed through a small window to an anteroom 
where it is screened, then passed through to the control room 
for broadcast. 
 
5. (C) The most obvious on-screen changes are expected in 
March 2005, when the new mandated hourly schedules come into 
effect. In the meantime, stations have focused on new 
advertising limitations. RCTV reported sending numerous 
prerecorded spots back to their clients, affecting 6,000 
already-sold advertising slots. They are also focused on the 
requirement to maintain their logo on-screen during all 
 
programming and promotions (the final bill does not require 
the logo to be displayed during ads), and avoidance of sex, 
foul language, and most importantly, violence. 
 
6. (C) Globovision appears to have lessened on-the-scene live 
reporting. There are a lot more press conferences from 
government ministries, fewer opposition voices, and more 
taped reports which have the time and date of the recording 
clearly visible at the bottom of the screen.  Though 
Globovision denies it, it is now broadcasting more \"CNN en 
Espanol\" and RCN Colombia. Globovision executives believe 
that carrying the live feed of a third (non-Venezuelan) 
network qualifies as \"live\" coverage and exempts them from 
some of the more onerous aspects of the media law. 
 
7. (C) Radio Caracas Television (RCTV) has decided to 
maintain the status quo in coverage. Executives of the 
station say that they expect the government to find ways to 
fine them, or worse. They also report having made no 
adjustments to their news coverage (which only airs in the 
morning, at mid-day, and at 11:00 PM). Executives say they 
will focus on cleansing their entertainment programming of 
sexual and other inappropriate content, to deny the 
government \"moral cover\" for any action against the station, 
but will not adjust news coverage. They believe the GoV will 
be hard-pressed to close a station without \"valid\" reasons as 
this would hurt the regime\'s reputation in the international 
arena. The same executive said that, regardless, given the 
vague wording and the multitude of different requirements 
imposed, it is \"impossible to fully comply with the law.\" 
 
------------------------- 
FINAL PRE-PASSAGE CHANGES 
------------------------- 
 
8. (U) The National Assembly changed two provisions of the 
law governing the sanctions regime and the requirements for 
National Independent Producers (NIPs), in the final version. 
Under the sanctions regime, fines are now expressed as a 
percentage of a station\'s gross annual revenue (maximum of 
two percent). Station executives told Emboffs that the new 
fines regime would be even more costly to them than the old 
version, which based fines on \"tributary units.\" Also, fines 
are subject to penalty interest while under appeal to the 
executive branch. The changes in definition for National 
Independent Producers include excising the language that 
would prevent someone who is married to or cohabiting with a 
person employed by a radio or television service provider 
from gaining NIP status. Lawmakers also eliminated the 
requirement that a NIP applicant not have any relationship to 
a radio or TV service provider for 12 months preceding 
application, instead prohibiting any current relationship to 
such a provider. 
 
-------------- 
IMPLEMENTATION 
-------------- 
 
9. (U) In public comments on December 21, CONATEL director 
Alvin Lezama said that the regulatory agency has \"noted with 
satisfaction\" the efforts toward compliance made to date by 
most media. Specifically, he cited actions observed on 
national television stations to include date and time stamps 
on taped news footage, as well as the disappearance of some 
inappropriate advertising. Lezama also said that at the 
beginning of 2005 the agency will launch an aggressive 
campaign to register National Independent Producers (NIPs) 
and User Committees, in accordance with the law. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) Most media leaders are in a transitory period of 
confusion in the wake of the enactment of the media law. They 
generally deny that they are self-censoring, while at the 
same time providing several examples of how they are doing 
just that. The law has also made the broadcasting business 
less profitable. Few in the private media have any confidence 
that the law will be applied fairly, and therefore seem 
resigned to a fate that is largely beyond their control. The 
full effect of the law will not be felt for nine months, at 
which point the majority of the its requirements will have 
been phased-in. Most in the media agree that the goal of the 
law is to scare them into self-censorship, while also 
agreeing that the teeth of the legislation is in how it is 
applied.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Recent economic news in Venezuela is mixed.  Third 
quarter GDP growth is an impressive 15.8%, and total 2004 
growth estimates are being revised upward to as much as 18%, 
though the GOV predicts 15-16%.  Venezuelan oil prices for 
December, on the other hand, are 28% below their October 
high.  Meanwhile, pressure on the Venezuelan Central Bank 
continued, as Chavez demanded the resignation of the Bank\'s 
President - whose term is just weeks away from its end.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
THE GOOD - GDP GROWTH EXCEEDING OLD ESTIMATES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) announced in 
November that 2004 3rd quarter GDP was 15.8% higher than the 
same period in 2003, including 18.6% growth in the non-oil 
sector.  The overall result was 4.6% higher than the 2nd 
quarter, and the cumulative growth through September is 
20.4%.  This positive result has influenced various 
economists to raise estimates for total 2004 growth.  Albis 
Munoz, President of business umbrella group FEDECAMARAS, 
while conservatively estimating growth at 12-13%, called 2004 
the year of \"economic reactivation\" in a press conference 
December 20.  Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, noting the 
traditional fourth quarter GDP jump, told press on December 
15th that there was no doubt growth would be \"greater than 15 
or 16 percent.\"  Central Bank Director Domingo Maza Zavala 
predicted December 21 a year-end result \"between 14 and 16%.\" 
 Credit Suisse calls these figures \"conservative,\" predicting 
a 17.8% increase for the year, as does the Andean Development 
Corporation (CAF), while the UN\'s Economic Commission for 
Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has estimated 18%. 
 
3. (C) Munoz, however, was critical of government 
performance, calling it \"not very efficient,\" and exhorting 
the GOV to resume \"institutional dialogue,\" \"create friendly 
environments for investment,\" and to give space to the 
private sector, especially to allow job creation.  Despite 
the GDP recovery, and the fact that unemployment in November 
(according to the National Statistics Institute, INE) was 
12.8% (2.6% below November 2003), it is not clear that jobs 
are being created.  There are nearly 14,000 fewer people 
employed than in November 2003; the statistical reduction is 
due to an increase of over 800,000 people who are not 
actively seeking employment.  Local pollster and consultant 
Datanalisis estimates that true unemployment is around 14%. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
THE BAD - OIL PRICES DROPPING FROM RECORD HIGHS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (C) According to the Ministry of Energy, the average price 
for the Venezuelan \"basket\" of oil was USD 31.57 per barrel 
in December, 28% off the record high of USD 44 per barrel set 
in October, and even 3% below the second quarter average, 
when the steady price increase began.  A continued drop would 
put the 2005 budget at risk, given that GOV spending is 
estimated at 30.9% of GDP and dollar-denominated oil income 
represents about half of ordinary GOV revenue.  Lower oil 
prices might force a devaluation in order for the reduced 
amount of USD income to cover local expenses in bolivars. 
Eduardo de las Casas, Citibank Country Treasurer, told 
econoff in October that he thought USD 25/barrel was the 
threshold of risk for such a devaluation, which could perhaps 
be even greater than the 12% (from 1920 to 2150/USD) assumed 
in the recently approved budget. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
THE MESSY - THE LATEST ON CHAVEZ VS. THE CENTRAL BANK 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
5. (C) The row between President Chavez and the Central Bank 
(BCV) over foreign exchange profits (see reftel) took a 
negative turn when Chavez said December 20 that \"there will 
have to be a trial,\" implying that BCV President Diego 
Castellanos should go to jail.  He said that \"Castellanos is 
of the age that he would be confined to home if a judge 
sentenced him to prison.  So he will be in his house or he 
should quit his job and leave and make way for someone who 
wants to fulfill their duty to the country, because that Bank 
is not the bank of the Central Bank President,\" and added 
that it was \"the Board of the BCV that doesn\'t want to 
understand, they don\'t understand, there are the completed 
calculations, once and again and corrected.\"  Just four days 
before, Arlex Fuentes, a banking superintendency employee 
involved in the negotiations with the BCV, told econoff that 
an agreement had been completed and the BCV would give 2.2 
trillion bolivars (1.15 billion USD) to the GOV during the 
week of December 20. 
 
6. (SBU) Domingo Maza Zavala, one of the BCV Directors, told 
the press on December 21 \"the BCV owes nothing to the 
government, to the national treasury; the assigned foreign 
exchange profits have been given.\"  He added that a trial 
would be \"very inconvenient\" for the interests of the 
country, and argued that \"the Directors, including the Bank 
President, have no other interest but the higher interests of 
the Republic, nor are we interested in retaining money that 
belongs to the national treasury.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) GDP growth, while expected to be high after two years 
of heavy downturn, is better than expected.  However, the 
lack of job creation implies that this is primarily a 
spending boom, which will only last as long as oil income can 
support it.  The drop in oil prices will need to be sustained 
for a considerable period before the GOV, committed to using 
the exchange peg as an inflation fighting tool, considers a 
devaluation beyond the 12% assumed in the 2005 budget.  The 
latest demand for cash was probably not motivated by the drop 
in oil prices, since this has been as ongoing event. 
However, the price drop sets the latest demand for cash in 
stark relief, underscoring the amount of funds the GOV needs 
to fulfill its spending plans.  When Maza Zavala says that 
the BCV\'s methodology \"is in accordance with the law\" and 
international accounting standards, his background (and that 
of other BCV directors) leads us to believe that any 
calculation errors are on the part of the GOV.  We doubt that 
the GOV will back down from its demands, so this dispute may 
well end up in court.  The question is, will Castellanos too?

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez laid out plans for 
his Bolivarian Revolution to a group of loyalist governors, 
mayors, and other officials November 12-13 in Caracas. 
According to an account of Chavez\'s presentation put together 
by veteran Marxist writer and Chavez adviser Martha 
Harnecker, Chavez tasked his troops with a \"strategic map\" 
for implementing ten major objectives -- a \"leap forward\" -- 
over the next two years.  He ordered his people to work hard, 
be disciplined, and to dedicate themselves \"heart and soul\" 
to the revolution.  Chavez acknowledged weaknesses in his 
movement, such as failure to communicate effectively the 
GOV\'s successes and to reform the bureaucracy.  On substance, 
he outlined a foreign policy that explicitly seeks to reduce 
U.S. influence in the world.  On economic models, he rejected 
communism \"at this time\" but called for a humanist economic 
model to replace capitalism.  Caracas major daily newspapers 
published portions of Harnecker\'s account in mid-December. 
End summary.

Chavistas Hold Skull Session 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) President Hugo Chavez held a two-day workshop on 
strengthening his \"Bolivarian Revolution\" on November 12-13 
at Fuerte Tiuna military headquarters in Caracas.  He 
convened newly-elected and re-elected loyal to him, 
ministers, military officers, and other key officials (ref 
a).  Post obtained an account of Chavez\'s address to the 
participants put together by Chilean socialist and 
revolutionary writer Martha Harnecker.  The two major Caracas 
dailies published portions of the transcript in mid-December. 
 Separately, post obtained a slide presentation supposedly 
from the event that generally tracked with Harnecker\'s 
account. 
 
---------------------- 
Mapping Out A Strategy 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) Chavez introduced what he called a \"strategic map\" for 
the last two years of his current term.  He noted that since 
his release from prison in 1994 after the failed coup, he has 
always relied on a master plan to guide his political 
movement.  He ordered every minister, governor, and mayor to 
develop their own action plans with quantifiable goals based 
on his guidelines.  Chavez told the conference participants 
at the end of his presentation he would return the following 
day to hear presentations of their preliminary ideas for 
moving forward.  (Note:  The due date for the action plans 
was December 12.)  Since then, there has been a steady stream 
of governors, mayors, and ministers delivering their plans to 
Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, who heads a designated 
strategy commission that also includes Planning Minister 
Giordani, Director of the Office of the Presidency Vice 
Admiral Luis Alfredo Torcatt, and National Armed Forces 
Inspector General Vice Admiral Ramon Maniglia. 
 
4. (C) Chavez laid out ten major objectives during his speech 
(ref b): 
 
1) Revamp social programs (\"missions\") to give \"power to the 
people,\" with an emphasis on education, inclusion, and 
equality. 
 
2) Develop a public relations strategy that effectively 
communicates the successes of the revolution to the masses 
and counters criticism from the private media. 
 
3) Better organize grassroots movements that support Chavez, 
with an emphasis on mission participants, electoral 
committees (\"patrols\"), and local planning councils (a 
public-private council that works with mayors to ensure a 
\"participatory budget process.\").  Chavez proposed a new 
Ministry of Popular Participation to oversee this objective. 
 
4) Accelerate the creation of a state bureaucracy that 
ensures \"social rule of law and justice.\" 
 
5) Fight corruption via new anti-corruption police, 
prosecutors and a presidential anti-corruption office (under 
Vice President Rangel\'s supervision). 
 
6) Arrive at the 2006 presidential elections in \"optimal 
conditions\" that guarantee 10 million votes for Chavez (there 
are currently 14 million registered voters).  The key to this 
is continued issuance of national identity cards (\"cedulas\") 
without which, Chavez said, he would not have won the 
presidential referendum. 
 
7) Strengthen Mission Vuelvan Caras (job creation via 
cooperatives) to create a new production model that relies on 
state-subsidized cooperatives and micro-enterprise. 
 
8) \"Make war\" against outdated land holding practices by 
elite Venezuelans by forcing them to surrender large shares 
of their rural land.  (Note:  On December 16, the Chavista 
governor of Cojedes State announced the \"intervention\" of 16 
major holdings of land in that state). 
 
9) Recapture an \"authentic\" Venezuelan military doctrine that 
erases all vestiges of \"imperialist doctrine.\"  He called for 
redoubled efforts in the development of military reserves and 
of a military-industrial capacity. 
 
10) Implement a \"multipolar\" international system (refs c and 
d) to counter the U.S. dominated \"unipolar\" world (see paras 
8 and 9). 
 
------------------------------------- 
Work Hard, Study Hard, Be Disciplined 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  Chavez told the participants they must support the 
revolution \"heart and soul.\"  He said the era of elected 
officials sitting in their offices and doing favors for 
friends, relatives, and party loyalists is over.  He told 
mayors they are responsible for making the revolution work at 
the local level, ordering them to house and feed the Cuban 
doctors of Mission Barrio Adentro and to visit every day the 
education classes of the Missions.  He promised the most 
supportive mayors funds for pilot projects, and warned that 
though he could not fire elected officials, he could do 
\"other things\" to ensure their loyalty.  Chavez encouraged 
the participants to read philosophy and literature (he 
recommended \"Les Miserables\" and \"Don Quijote\") and be well 
informed on current events.  He told governors and mayors to 
improve their public speaking skills and not to shy away from 
media opportunities.  Chavez asked Rangel to keep track of 
positive and negative points that Chavez observes about each 
official\'s performance. 
 
-------------------------- 
Weaknesses Still Plague Us 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Chavez raised several risks to the success of the 
revolution, comparing it to Accion Democratica (AD) in the 
1950s, which enjoyed popular support but later abandoned its 
popular base.  He noted that abstention rates among the poor 
in the October regional elections were higher than expected 
and warned of future electoral defeats if the figure is not 
reversed.  He acknowledged that significant numbers of poor 
people voted against him in the presidential referendum, 
attributing it to a failure to convince them of the GOV\'s 
advocacy for the poor.  He blamed incompetent ministers and 
stifling bureaucracies for prompting him to launch the 
missions as a kind of parallel government.  He admitted the 
bureaucracy had misled him with inaccurate or biased 
information in the past and lamented that shortcomings in the 
 
missions -- such as students and teacher not getting paid on 
time -- are exploited by the private media. 
 
------------------- 
Opposition As Enemy 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) Chavez advised his governors to include opposition 
mayors in their planning, suggesting that not every 
\"adversary is corrupt\" and might be better skilled at 
carrying out some government programs.  Despite this 
overture, Chavez said most opposition governors and mayors 
would likely work against his \"strategic map\" and would 
therefore have to be neutralized.  Chavez said the enemy -- 
opposition governors and mayors, the private media, elements 
of the armed forces, and opposition deputies in the National 
Assembly -- will not rest and will continue to cause problems 
for the GOV. 
 
--------------------------- 
An Anti-U.S. Foreign Policy 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (C) In describing his \"multipolar\" foreign policy, Chavez 
revealed his deep suspicion of the USG.  He said USG actions 
in Fallujah showed that President Bush would continue an 
interventionist, aggressive, genocidal, and savage foreign 
policy and that Venezuela should prepare itself.  He 
predicted that the USG would increase its aggression toward 
him and would undertake new efforts to weaken the GOV.  The 
USG, he said, would try to exploit his mistakes, create 
scandals, demean and belittle him, and try to develop 
opposition leadership to defeat him in the 2006 presidential 
race.  He discounted the idea of a U.S.-backed coup attempt 
or assassination plot, though he said he is sure there are 
\"crazies\" in the United States that might try to kill him. 
Nevertheless, he mentioned the possibility of having to 
defend Venezuela from a land invasion by the United States 
and vowed to wage a guerrilla war against such an occurrence. 
 
9. (C) Chavez said the strengthening of the four major poles 
-- Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America -- would also 
contribute to his vision for a new international system.  He 
urged an embrace of Spain\'s new socialist government to take 
advantage of the rift between Spain and the United States. 
Chavez said the GOV supports the continued consolidation of 
the European Union (e.g., a strengthened euro) because it 
\"weakens the position of the United States.\"  Chavez also 
welcomed new popular leaders in the ex-Soviet Union, where he 
said the seeds of socialism and social justice are 
re-emerging.  In South America, he spoke of the need to break 
Washington\'s influence over Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, 
and Chile, what he called the \"Monroe Axis,\" by forming the 
South American Community.  He said the decision to move 
forward on a pipeline through Colombia would allow Venezuela 
to export hydrocarbons to Asia and thereby resolve 
Venezuela\'s \"geopolitical vulnerabilities\" of having to 
export principally to the United States. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Communism Not An Option For Now 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) On economic models, Chavez denied he is trying to 
follow a communist model because it would abolish private 
property, which he said he opposes.  \"No one knows what will 
happen in the future,\" he said, \"... but for this moment it 
would be crazy, those who propose it are crazy.\"  Chavez 
instead advocated a \"social, humanist, and egalitarian\" 
economic model.  He said this kind of economy is a long-term 
goal and warned against utopian thinking.  Despite his 
endorsement for private property, he vowed to strip idle land 
from rural landowners via executive branch harassment and the 
creation of new agrarian judges to challenge the authenticity 
of land titles. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) Harnecker\'s account is almost certainly an authentic, 
 
accurate rendition of what the President said.  She enjoys 
special access to him as a chronicler of revolution in the 
Americas, and reportedly has an office in Miraflores Palace. 
That said, the account is no doubt intended to put the best 
face on the direction which Chavez\'s Bolivarian Revolution is 
to take.  For example, Chavez\'s instructions for waging a 
\"war on bureaucracy\" are reduced to a single sentence. 
 
12. (C) Chavez is the hardest working politician in 
Venezuela.  He is making plans -- strategic and tactical -- 
to deepen all aspects of his revolution.  Chavez used the 
meeting to make clear to the elected governors and mayors 
that they work for him; defections of the type that marked 
his first years in office will be dealt with harshly.  The 
Chavez in the transcript is more candid than in public about 
his ideology, especially on foreign policy and economics. 
 
13. (C) Chavez\'s remarks show a leader who is increasingly 
showing his commitment to shift Venezuela\'s political, 
economic, and foreign policy orientation towards the left. 
Rhetoric aside, Chavez -- unfortunately -- has a strategic 
direction, and is aware that he faces obstacles and 
contradictions in his movement.  He may, however, be 
overreaching; Embassy will send septel its analysis of the 
weak spots in Chavez\'s strategy and how they could best be 
countered by USG initiatives.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Alberto \"Chino\" Carias, a member of the urban 
guerrilla group Tupamaros (now a political party) and now a 
public security official for the Caracas metropolitan 
district, discussed with poloff December 21 the 
re-structuring the Metropolitan Police and the December 8 
street vendor riot in downtown Caracas.  Carias described his 
\"constant\" contact with Tupamaros and other groups in other 
countries, while denying any direct contact with the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  He predicted 
a calm political scenario for 2005, though a fellow Tupamaro 
warned that the \"terrorists\" in the radical opposition would 
be dealt with harshly.  End Summary. 
 
------------------- 
Tupamaros in Charge 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff had lunch on December 21 with Alberto \"Chino\" 
Carias, a member of the Tupamaro urban guerrilla group that 
registered as a political party this year.  Fellow Tupamaro 
Oswaldo Rivero also attended.  Carias said he, like many 
early Tupamaros, was once a member of former guerrilla 
movement and now political party Bandera Roja, but joined the 
Tupamaros when Uruguayan exiles of the original group sought 
refuge in Caracas in the 1970s.  Carias acknowledged press 
reports that he tried to blow up a church in 1978 but denied 
responsibility for the 1979 killing of a policeman, for which 
Carias was imprisoned.  He described the Tupamaros as having 
functioned as a vigilante street gang in poor Caracas 
neighborhoods in the 80\'s and 90\'s in the absence of 
competent police forces.  Carias said the Tupamaros aided 
Chavez\'s 1992 coup by forcefully clearing areas around the 
Miraflores presidential palace to facilitate movement by 
dissident military units.  During the Chavez administration, 
the Tupamaros surfaced as Chavez supporters who occasionally 
engaged in violent street protests against opposition 
targets, at times led personally by Carias.  Carias led a 
protest at the Embassy in 2003 against U.S. interventionism; 
despite his boasts that there are more than 3,000 Tupamaros, 
only 17 showed for the event. 
 
3. (C) Carias made headlines recently, including in the Miami 
Herald, when in November he joined the administration of 
newly elected Metropolitan Caracas Mayor Juan Barreto as 
Sub-Secretary for Citizen Security.  Carias, who was 
Barreto\'s aide in the National Assembly prior to Barreto\'s 
election as mayor, said he joined the mayor\'s office to help 
re-structure the Metropolitan Police (PM) and serve as a 
political adviser.  Carias said his decision to join the 
Caracas district government caused six Tupamaro leaders to 
quit on the grounds the group risked losing its objectivity 
as an independent Chavez ally.  Carias noted that he is not a 
police officer but is usually armed and accompanied by 
bodyguards.  (Note:  The mayor\'s Office of Citizen Security 
has oversight for the Metropolitan Police and is headed by 
Reynaldo Garcia, Carias\' boss and an alternate deputy in the 
National Assembly for Chavez\'s Fifth Republic Movement. 
Active duty National Guard General Manuel Escalona is the 
chief of the Metropolitan Police.  The Caracas metropolitan 
mayor has coordinating responsibilities for the five 
municipalities of the district and their respective police 
forces. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Reorganizing the Metropolitan Police 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Carias is leaing a commission to re-structure the 
Metropolita Police and improve its image among Caracas 
resients.  Carias said the first steps of the commissin 
were to replace the head of the PM\'s elite brigde and two 
other zone commanders who he said wer involved in organized 
crime.  He noted that oneof the replacement commanders is an 
opposition mmber (\"escualido\") but is a respected officer. 
Te commission has also made changes to police cadet 
training, Carias added.  Carias told poloff previusly the 
 
 
commission is planning to introduce \"social intelligence,\" 
whereby citizens can report on the misdeeds of police 
officers. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Tupamaros Mediate Fireworks Riot 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Carias blamed the December 8 riot in downtown Caracas 
that left 52 injured on police from the Libertador 
Municipality (Policaracas).  Carias said the police stole the 
traditional Christmas fireworks from street vendors, who 
reacted by burning buses and attacking police.  Rivero said 
the police used only non-lethal force such as tear gas and 
rubber bullets.  He said the fighting deteriorated into 
shootings between rival street vendor associations.  Carias 
claimed he was forced to step in and mediate a solution 
between Policaracas, municipality officials, and the street 
vendors.  Carias said his office is developing a plan for 
managing the street vendors that is due out in January. 
 
---------------------------- 
Repression of the Opposition 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Carias denied his appointment portends a crackdown on 
the political opposition.  He said the coming year would be 
peaceful.  Rivero added, however, that the GOV would deal 
harshly with \"terrorists\" of the opposition that plant bombs 
or conspire to commit violence.  Asked if that included 
peaceful marches and demonstrations, Rivero said no, that 
they encourage peaceful protests.  Rivero said he considered 
the most radical and dangerous sectors of the opposition to 
be Primero Justicia and Bandera Roja, which he asserted are 
armed.  Carias had told poloff some weeks before that, under 
the administration of opposition Mayor Alfredo Pena, the PM 
used armed patrols to clear the way for opposition marches, a 
practice Carias considered to show political bias. 
 
---------------- 
Foreign Contacts 
---------------- 
 
7. (C) Carias said he is in \"constant communication\" with 
groups bearing the Tupamaro name and other radical groups in 
Latin American countries, mentioning he had spoken that day 
with colleagues in Peru and Nicaragua.  Asked about the Armed 
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Carias denied he 
speaks with them, saying \"FARC is really messed up.\"  He 
added, however, that he would not tell poloff about inner 
workings of the FARC in the same way poloff would not talk 
about how other USG agencies work.  Carias claimed the recent 
capture of FARC international leader Rodrigo Granda occurred 
in Caracas and not in Colombia as early press reports had it, 
asserting that Granda had been detained in a Caracas hotel 
(Note:  December 23 stories in mainstream Caracas newspapers 
appear to support Carias\' version.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Carias is a street thug and hustler with a penchant 
for self-promotion and exaggeration.  It seems unlikely the 
Tupamaros have a coordinated international network as Carias 
implied.  They have, however, found allies in the GOV, 
notably Chavez and Barreto, who have in the past deployed 
these irregular street fighters when the political situation 
required it.  Politically, Carias is intent on stripping the 
opposition of critical PM street protection should the era of 
mass marches against the GOV return.  Carias and company have 
a broad influence in the Metropolitan Police, but the 
placement of a National Guard colonel as the police chief may 
be a recognition that the PM needs some measure of 
organization and discipline.  The fireworks riot is a 
reminder that the GOV, despite enjoying the support of the 
local authorities and a majority of street vendors, still 
face governance challenges among its constituencies.

STATE 
 
Classified By: WILLIAM R. BROWNFIELD, AMBASSADOR, FOR REASON 1.4 (d). 
 
------ 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Ambassador\'s visit to the central city of Valencia on 
December 9 - 10, 2004 included meetings with the Governor and 
Mayor, although for the third consecutive trip, the military 
declined to meet.  Newspaper coverage was excellent, and 
there was an abundance of media reporters and questions at 
most events.  Press focused on the bilateral relationship and 
reaction to the upcoming Media Content Law.  Valencia is an 
industrial center, attracting Venezuelans from all regions 
for job security, relatively inexpensive housing,and a clean, 
well-run community.  Carabobo state has two airports, and the 
largest port in Venezuela, through which enters approximately 
65% of Venezuela\'s merchandise.  The port of Puerto Cabello 
was highlighted as a strong point of the region\'s continued 
economic success.  Among all parties, most especially in the 
political and economic sectors, and in the business 
community, there is a \"Wait and See\" attitude with the new 
Chavista governor.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
Political Climate 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) Governor Luis Felipe Acosta Carles formally received 
the Ambassador in the governor\'s office.  A former National 
Guard commander of the region, Governor Acosta Carles was 
recently elected governor in October 2004, ending the 12 year 
hold on the governor\'s seat of the Salas family.  Acosta 
Carles stressed the need to reach out more to the public, and 
to all elected officials in Carabobo state, in an effort to 
bring to a close the political strife and animosity that has 
reigned in Venezuela in recent years.  He expressed a desire 
to increase economic collaboration with the United States, 
especially working with the three major auto industries 
operating in Valencia (GM, Ford, Daimler-Chrysler), and 
working to further develop the two major airports in the 
region, that at Puerto Cabello, and the Valencia 
International Airport.  He was positive on recent dialogue 
with Coca-Cola, whose local plant he had seized as National 
Guard commander during the national strike in 2003. 
 
3. (C) Mayor Francisco Cabrera Santos, a popular figure 
re-elected in October for his third term, is regarded as 
having devoted his time and office to the revitalization of 
Valencia.  He described himself as a political independent, 
believing in social investment in the people of his 
district-- by providing jobs, health programs and training. 
Mayor Cabrera hopes to work with Governor Acosta Carles on 
various projects, specifically a low-cost housing project for 
the poorest citizens, slated to begin construction in January 
2005.  2005 marks the anniversary of Valencia and the mayor 
requested the assistance of the US Embassy in scheduling 
cultural events. 
 
4. (C) An informal meeting with former governor Henrique 
Salas Feo provided an opportunity for the opposition 
perspective.  Salas Feo, defeated in the October 31 elections 
by Acosta Carles, expressed his concern over the election 
procedures and probable fraud, and the difficulty in 
obtaining information or help from the National Electoral 
Council.  As regards the new governor, he expressed a \"Wait 
and See\" attitude.  Since the election, his Proyecto 
Venezuela party is struggling to maintain momentum and 
support. 
 
5. (C) The Boston Group, comprised of pro-government and 
opposition legislators, has formed a permanent group in 
Valencia as a platform for discussion, conflict resolution 
and building a common agenda.  Twelve members attended a 
meeting with the Ambassador and openly discussed their 
concerns and issues.  Each one expressed satisfaction with 
the group and progress, and viewed it as a very positive 
experience.  They hoped that the Valencia group will be a 
model throughout Venezuela, reducing dissension between 
pro-government and opposition and building a better bilateral 
relationship with the United States. 
 
------------------ 
Economic Interests 
------------------ 
 
 
6. (U) The Valencia regional chapter of the Venezuelan- 
American Chamber of Commerce hosted a luncheon for the 
Ambassador with approximately 40 participants representing a 
variety of the industries present in the region, including 
the auto industry, banking, agriculture, and construction. 
The Q & A session immediately following the luncheon 
concentrated on economic growth in the region, and how to 
collaborate bi-nationally for the continued economic vitality 
of the region. 
 
7. (C) In a separate meeting, the Venezuelan 
Presidents/General Managers of Ford, Daimler/Chrysler and 
General Motors offered their general impression of the new 
governor and his effect on their industry.  Production is 
expected to rise for all three companies; however GM is 
currently negotiating with its union, and tensions are up. 
Chrysler and Ford also expressed concerns with their unions 
and the relationship with their employee force.  Chrysler 
wants to invest more in local social programs, especially 
environmental education in local area schools. 
 
8. (C) The Ambassador visited Protinal/Proagro, a pioneer in 
the agriculture and aviculture business in Venezuela, 
producing poultry, animal feed and deli products.  The 
company employs 3,000, and is majority owned (51%) by Ag 
Processing Inc. (AGP), the largest farmer-owned cooperative 
and soybean producer in the US.  Protinal distributes its 
animal feed products to the meat producing states to the 
south, and its grain and deli products throughout Venezuela. 
Economically, the company has improved its production, 
growth, and profits in the last six years, and has an 
innovative housing program for its employees, co-sponsored by 
a Venezuelan bank. 
 
--------------- 
Media/Education 
--------------- 
 
9. (U) El Carabobeno newspaper, the leading conservative 
daily paper in the central region of Venezuela, met with the 
Ambassador, conducted an interview, and provided substantial 
coverage in the next day\'s edition on his visit.  Radio Lago 
conducted an on-air 30 minute interview, filmed by a local TV 
station for future presentation.  Preceeding the interview 
Notitarde, the second largest newspaper in the region, 
attended a breakfast for the Ambassador, which was hosted by 
Radio Lago. 
 
10,(U) The Ambassador met with the Rector of the University 
of Carabobo, a public university located on four campuses 
with a combined student population of over 40,000.  Also in 
attendance were the major deans and a former International 
Visitor Program (PAS) grantee, who expressed in glowing terms 
the impact of her experience in the IV program.  Issues of 
discussion included stronger collaboration between the 
university and the US, expecially in the area of exchange 
programs with American universities, scholarships and 
opportunities for research (to include American Studies), 
visiting scholars, and PAS assistance with cultural and arts 
programs on the campuses. The rector said the American 
private sector represented in Valencia could also be 
instrumental in providing financial suppport in the programs 
and activities of the university. 
 
-------------- 
Social Support 
-------------- 
 
11. (C) The Ambassador also visited a recent recipient of a 
USAID grant, the Organization \"Refugios Pana,\" a small house 
for at risk street children, located in the center of 
Valencia.  Founded in 1998, the building houses street 
children, who live in a family-like setting, attend local 
schools, and learn social skills and receive counseling from 
professional social workers.  A USAID funded industrial 
kitchen, inaugurated with the Ambassador\'s visit, will 
provide food for the house, and an opportunity for the 
students to manage a restaurant/lunch delivery business. 
 
 
12. (C) Press coverage was excellent, offering the Ambassador 
the opportunity to deliver our message on the importance of 
the bilateral, people-to-people US/Venezuela relationship. 
The visit clearly caught the Chavista governor\'s attention; 
 
 
he dispatched his wife uninvited to join the event midway 
through the visit.

REF: STATE 240980 
 
1. (U) Summary: The Following is Embassy Caracas\' submission 
for the 2005 National Trade Estimate Report. This document 
was also submitted as a MS Word document to G. Blue and B. 
Harmon at USTR by e-mail on December 23, 2004. End Summary 
 
------------- 
TRADE SUMMARY 
------------- 
 
2. (U) The estimated U.S. trade deficit with Venezuela for 
2004 is projected at $19.5 billion, an increase of $5.2 
billion from the trade deficit of $14.3 billion in 2003. 
U.S. goods exports to Venezuela were approximately $4.5 
billion, up $1.8 billion from 2003.  U.S. imports from 
Venezuela are estimated at about $24 billion in 2004, an 
increase of $7 billion from the level of imports in 2003. The 
large increase in imports is related primarily to the 
increase the price of petroleum, which represents the vast 
majority of U.S. imports. 
 
3. (U) The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in 
Venezuela in 2003 was $10.8 billion according to U.S. 
Department of Commerce statistics.  U.S. FDI in Venezuela is 
concentrated largely in the petroleum, telecommunications, 
manufacturing and finance sectors. 
 
--------------- 
IMPORT POLICIES 
--------------- 
 
Tariffs 
------- 
 
4. (U) Venezuela is part of the Andean Community.  In 2002, 
the five member countries of the Andean Community (Venezuela, 
Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia) agreed to establish an 
Andean free trade zone, a common external tariff (CET), and a 
customs harmonization policy by January 2004.  The CET 
agreement established a unified tariff schedule that would 
have come into effect at the end of 2003 (decision 535).  In 
October 2002 the member Ministers of the Andean Community met 
and agreed upon tariff rates for 62 percent of import items. 
In April 2003 all the Andean members except Peru reached 
consensus on a CET for the remaining 38 percent. 
 
5. (U) In December 2003, however, the members decided to 
postpone implementation of the CET, previously set for 
January 1, 2004, until May 10, 2004.  In May members again 
decided to postpone the implementation of the CET, this time 
for a year until May 2005. The members have agreed to review 
the CET,s effect on individual tariffs with the intention of 
possibly modifying the rates.  The CET has a four-tiered 
tariff structure of zero, five percent, ten percent and 
twenty percent. 
 
6. (U) In December 2003 the Andean Community signed a free 
trade agreement with MERCOSUR, the Southern Cone Common 
Market. Key elements of the agreement such as the length of 
phase-in periods for tariff removal require further 
negotiation.  In Mid-2004, Venezuela joined MERCOSUR as an 
associate member, which does not provide access to the tariff 
benefits of full membership. Venezuela was among the 12 South 
American countries that signed the \"Cuzco Declaration\" on 
December 8, 2004 announcing the formation of the South 
American Community of Nations which would ultimately unite 
and replace both the Andean Community and MERCOSUR. Work on 
the mechanics of the new entity is slated to begin in 2005. 
 
7. (U) Venezuela has been using the tariffs established under 
the Andean Community,s price band system since 1995 for 
certain agricultural products, including feed grains, 
oilseeds, oilseed products, sugar, rice, wheat, milk, pork 
and poultry.  Yellow corn was added to the price band system 
in 1996, and processed poultry was added in 2001.  Ad valorem 
rates for these products are adjusted according to the 
relationship between commodity market reference prices and 
established floor and ceiling prices.  When the reference 
 
 
price for a particular commodity falls below the established 
floor price, the compensatory tariff for that commodity and 
related products is adjusted upward.  Conversely, when the 
reference price exceeds the established ceiling, the 
compensatory tariff is eliminated.  Floor and ceiling prices 
are set once a year based on average prices during the past 
five years.  Venezuela publishes these prices each April. 
 
8. (U) In addition to the traditionally high import tariffs 
of the Andean Community,s price band system, Venezuela also 
protects its agricultural producers through a non-legislated 
system of guaranteed minimum prices and the restrictive use 
of import licenses and permits.  Management of tariff-rate 
quota commitments by the Government of Venezuela has been 
arbitrary and nontransparent and has negatively affected 
trade in basic agricultural commodities as well as processed 
products.  The Venezuelan Government has denied import 
licenses for both in-quota and over-quota quantities, even 
though importers are willing to pay the over-quota tariff for 
additional quantities of products. 
 
9. (U) U.S. agricultural exporters advise that the Venezuelan 
Government also routinely fails to open the quotas in a 
timely manner, and for some products, such as pork, has 
refused to \"activate\" the quota at all.   Venezuela announced 
in 2001 that it would not grant import licenses for corn 
until all domestic white corn had been marketed, resulting in 
an effective import ban.  Venezuela also has restricted the 
issuance of import licenses for sorghum, soybean meal, yellow 
grease, pork, poultry, oilseeds, and some dairy products. 
The government no longer publishes information and statistics 
on license requests or license issuance. 
 
10. (U) Under the Andean Community,s Common Automotive 
Policy (CAP), assembled passenger vehicles constitute an 
exception to the 20 percent maximum tariff and are subject to 
35 percent import duties. 
 
 
Non-Tariff Measures 
------------------- 
 
11. (U) In response to the rapid decline in the value of the 
national currency, the Bolivar, following a two-month general 
strike that brought oil production to a near standstill, the 
Central Bank of Venezuela halted trade in Bolivars on January 
22, 2003.  President Chavez announced the creation of an 
Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI) on February 5, 2003 to 
regulate the purchase and sale of foreign currency.  During 
much of 2003, CADIVI was unable to process requests for 
authorization of foreign exchange in an efficient and timely 
manner and only supplied $3.6 billion or approximately two 
months worth of transactions.  There has been significant 
improvement over time.  The supply of foreign currency 
reached a level of approximately $15 billion in 2004, or 55 
percent of approved authorizations.  A number of goods have 
also been added to the list of imports eligible for foreign 
exchange including intangibles such as services and the 
repatriation of capital, which totaled $1.5 billion at the 
end of the third quarter.  A new resolution allows importers 
to ship products without pre-approval by the government. 
There continue to be delays with pre-inspection companies 
thereby increasing storage costs.  Although the number of 
currency certificate approvals has increased steeply, 
operating with a 50 percent backlog in liquidations puts 
significant constraints on imports which accounted for 68.5 
percent of requests, followed by private foreign debt with 
12.5 percent and foreign investments with 8.6 percent. 
Exchange control authorities have repeatedly said that the 
exchange control system will be eased but will remain a 
permanent long-term mechanism. 
 
12. (U) Agricultural products have received the majority of 
dollars under the CADIVI system, since most basic food 
products are on the import list.  Even so, the problems with 
coordinating the timing of access to dollars, approval of 
import permits and licenses, and contracting the shipments 
have led to numerous delays and cancelled shipments.  Trade 
in higher value products, such as apples, pears, grapes, 
 
 
nectarines and other fruits and nuts, has been dramatically 
reduced as they are not included among the list of high 
priority products for which foreign exchange is available 
under the current currency control regime. 
 
13. (U) Venezuela also requires that importers obtain 
sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) permits from the Ministries 
of Health and Agriculture for most pharmaceutical and 
agricultural imports.  The government increasingly has 
appeared to use this requirement to restrict agricultural and 
food imports without providing evidence of a scientific 
basis, raising concerns about the consistency of these 
practices with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements. 
The Venezuelan Government continues to issue SPS permits in 
an arbitrary manner without citing specific phytosanitary 
concerns. This restriction in particular affects trade in 
pork, poultry, beef, apples, grapes, pears, nuts, onions and 
potatoes. 
 
14. (U) Though the GOV has not published requirements on 
absorption agreements, it has been common practice for years 
to require the purchase of domestic production before issuing 
import licenses or permits.   Imports of yellow corn are 
dependent upon the purchase of local sorghum and/or white 
corn.  Soybean imports are dependent upon the purchase of 
\"locally produced\" soybean meal, and permits for grape and 
black bean imports have been tied to the purchase of local 
product.  The use of absorption requirements is extremely 
subjective, since Venezuela lacks a good statistical system 
to track levels of domestic crop production. 
 
15. (U) This discretionary use of import licensing and permit 
procedures to curtail agricultural imports has become a major 
problem for the United States and other countries.  Various 
countries have notified Venezuelan government officials that 
these and other licensing practices appear to violate their 
WTO commitments.  In 2002, the United States Trade 
Representative initiated formal WTO consultations with 
Venezuela on its agricultural import license procedures for a 
wide-range of products.  Canada, the EU, Chile, Argentina, 
and New Zealand participated in the first round of 
consultations and posed questions to the government of 
Venezuela. 
 
16. (U) Venezuela prohibits the importation of used cars, 
used buses, used trucks, used tires and used clothing.  No 
other quantitative import restrictions exist for industrial 
products.  Some products such as cigarette paper, bank notes, 
weapons of war and certain explosives can only be imported by 
government agencies, (tax authorities calculate the cigarette 
tax on the volume of cigarette paper imported by the 
manufacturers).  The government can delegate authority to 
import on its behalf, and can place orders for such products 
with the local sales agents of the foreign manufacturers. 
 
17. (U) Venezuelan officials continue to discuss plans to 
improve customs procedures to better control the entry of 
illicit merchandise.  The Venezuelan Commission on 
Antidumping and Safeguards has started investigations on the 
importation of steel and paper products as well as clothing 
and footwear.  It appears that deficient customs procedures 
and the proliferation of contraband were contributing factors 
in those industries, calls for protection. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
18. (U) Some Venezuelan importers of U.S. products have 
alleged that the Venezuela applies product standards more 
strictly to imports than to domestic products. The 
certification process is expensive, increasing the cost of 
U.S. exports relative to domestic products.  The Venezuelan 
Commission for Industrial Standards normally requires 
certification from independent laboratories located in 
Venezuela but at times accepts a certificate from established 
standards institutes abroad. 
 
19. (U) In 2003 the Government of Venezuela passed Decree 
 
 
2444, which requires importers of goods to Venezuela to 
obtain pre-shipment inspections of all imports.  Four 
companies are certified to do these inspections: Bivac 
Venezuela (Veritas Group), SGS Trade Assurance Services, 
COTECNA, and Intertek Foreign Trade Standards. 
 
20. (U) With regard to labeling, U.S. industries have raised 
concerns regarding Venezuela,s labeling regulation for 
clothing and footwear.  The regulations as proposed by 
Venezuela,s Autonomous National Service for Standardization, 
Quality, Metrology and Technical Regulations (SENCAMER) were 
notified to the WTO Technical Barriers Trade Committee in 
July 2002 and the notice was published in the Official 
Gazette of Venezuela in August 2002.  The regulations, which 
became effective in December 2002, establish the register of 
domestic manufacturers and importers of clothing and footwear 
and minimum labeling requirements for all clothing and 
footwear products marketed in Venezuela.  Of primary concern 
to U.S. manufacturers is the requirement that labels must be 
customized to include detailed information about the importer 
of the goods. 
 
---------------------- 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
---------------------- 
 
21. (U) Venezuela,s government procurement law covers 
purchases by government, national universities, and 
autonomous state and municipal institutions.  The law 
requires a contracting agency to prepare a budget estimate 
for a given purchase based on reference prices maintained by 
the Ministry of Production and Commerce.  This estimate is to 
be used in the bidding process.  The law forbids 
discrimination against tenders based on whether they are 
national or international.  However, the law also states that 
the President can mandate temporary changes in the bidding 
process \"under exceptional circumstances\" or in accordance 
with \"economic development plans\" to promote national 
development, or to offset adverse conditions for national 
tenders.  These measures can include margins of domestic 
price preference; reservation of contracts for nationals; 
requirements for domestic content, technology transfer and/or 
the use of human resources; and other incentives to purchase 
from companies domiciled in Venezuela.  For example, 
government decree 1892 establishes a 5 percent preference for 
bids from companies with over 20 percent local content.  In 
addition, half of that 20 percent of content must be from 
small to medium sized domestic enterprises. 
 
22. (U) In an effort to move away from proprietary software 
products, the Government of Venezuela in 2004 introduced a 
law mandating the use of open-source software in government 
and public institutions.  This is expected to reduce the 
demand for U.S. software products somewhat, though much 
software currently in use is unlicensed or pirated. 
 
23. (U) In the international arena, Venezuela has 
reinstituted state controlled purchases of basic food 
products for its new internal distribution system, Mercal, a 
network of state-owned stores aimed at low-income 
Venezuelans.  The state-trading entity, CASA, has to date 
purchased sugar, rice, wheat flour, black beans, milk powder, 
edible oil, margarines, poultry and eggs from a variety of 
countries.  The private sector has complained that CASA has 
an unfair advantage in that its access to dollars is assured, 
as is its access to import licenses and permits. Furthermore, 
CASA, as a government entity, brings in products without 
tariffs and customs duties. 
 
24. (U) A new ministry has been created called the Ministry 
of Food. The new ministry is now responsible for a large 
number of activities formerly under the Ministries of 
Agriculture and Lands, Health and Social Development, and 
Production and Commerce.  Among the duties taken away from 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands are the issuances of 
sanitary permits and import licenses.  Price setting for all 
food and feed products has been moved from the Ministry of 
Production and Commerce into the Ministry of Food.  In 
addition, the government is working to move food registration 
 
 
from the Ministry of Heath and Social Development into the 
new food ministry. 
 
25. (U) Venezuela is not a signatory to the WTO Agreement on 
Government Procurement. 
 
---------------- 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
---------------- 
 
26. (U) Exporters of selected agricultural products - coffee, 
cocoa, some fruits and certain seafood products - are 
eligible to receive a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the 
export,s value. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
27. (U) Venezuela is a member of the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO).  It is also a signatory to the 
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic 
Works, the Geneva Phonograms Convention, the Universal 
Copyright Convention, and the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property.  Through Andean Community 
Decision 486, Venezuela has ratified the provisions of the 
WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS). 
 
28. (U) The Venezuelan Industrial Property Office (SAPI) 
leaves much room for improvement, and its actions and 
occasional publicly stated antagonism towards IPR often draw 
criticism from IPR advocates and rights holders. Protection 
of IPR is also hindered by the lack of adequate resources for 
the Venezuelan copyright and trademark enforcement police 
(COMANPI) and for the special IPR prosecutor,s office. 
Venezuela\'s tax agency SENIAT is promoting several measures 
to fight piracy in an effort to reduce tax evasion, including 
a new anti-piracy law and the introduction of a tax on street 
vendors.  According to industry representatives, SENIAT seems 
to be a promising enforcement entity due to its better 
technical and financial capabilities. 
 
29. (U) Unfortunately, pirated software, music and movies 
remain readily available throughout the country.  In the 2003 
Annual Review, Venezuela remained on USTR\'s Special 301 Watch 
List. 
 
Patents and Trademarks 
---------------------- 
 
30. (U) Venezuela provides the legal framework for patent and 
trademark protection through Andean Community Decision 486 
and the 1955 National Industrial Property Law.  Andean 
Community Decision 486 takes major steps towards bringing 
Venezuela into WTO TRIPS compliance.  However, without 
corresponding local laws, Venezuela is not completely TRIPS 
compliant.  Andean Community Decision 345 covers patent 
protection for plant varieties. 
 
31. (U) U.S. companies remain concerned about the impact of 
the Andean Tribunal\'s 2002 interpretation of Articles 14 and 
21 of Decision 486, which do not allow for the patenting of 
\"second-use\" products.  Under pressure from the Andean 
Community and in line with some changes in leadership at 
SAPI, Venezuela has revoked previously issued patents.  Very 
few patents were awarded in 2004.  Since 2002, Venezuela\'s 
food and drug regulatory agency (INH) began approving the 
commercialization of new drugs, which were the bioequivalents 
of already patented drugs, thereby denying the patent-holding 
companies protection of their test data.  In effect, the 
government now allows the test data of patented drugs or 
those for which patents have been requested, most of which 
required lengthy and expensive development, to be used by 
others seeking approval for their own unlicensed versions of 
the same products. 
 
Copyrights 
---------- 
 
 
32. (U) Andean Pact Decision 351 and Venezuela\'s 1993 
Copyright Law provide the legal framework for the protection 
of copyrights.  The 1993 Copyright Law is modern and 
comprehensive and extends copyright protection to all 
creative works, including computer software.  A National 
Copyright Office was established in October 1995 and given 
responsibility for registering copyrights, as well as for 
controlling, overseeing and ensuring compliance with the 
rights of authors and other copyright holders.  Industry 
experts are concerned about a proposed new copyright law 
proposal, which would require the mandatory registry of 
works, reduce protection terms, hamper distribution 
agreements and increase royalties. 
 
33. (U) The Venezuelan copyright and trademark enforcement 
branch of the police (COMANPI) continues to provide copyright 
enforcement support with a small staff of permanent 
investigators.  A lack of personnel, coupled with a very 
limited budget and inadequate storage facilities for seized 
goods, has forced COMANPI to work with the National Guard and 
private industry to improve enforcement of copyrighted 
material.  COMANPI can only act based on a complaint by a 
copyright holder; it cannot carry out an arrest or seizure on 
its own initiative, which leads to weaker enforcement. 
 
----------------- 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
----------------- 
 
34. (U) Venezuela maintains restrictions on a number of 
service sectors.  Professions subject to national licensing 
legislation (e.g., engineers, architects, economists, 
business consultants, accountants, lawyers, doctors, 
veterinarians and journalists) are reserved for those 
individuals who meet Venezuelan certification requirements. 
In addition, only Venezuelan nationals may be licensed as 
architects.  Some (particularly government-related) 
accounting and auditing functions require Venezuelan 
citizenship, and only Venezuelan nationals may act as 
accountants for companies with public stock greater than 25 
percent.  Also, foreign professionals wishing to work in 
Venezuela must revalidate their credentials at a Venezuelan 
university on the condition of reciprocity.  A foreign lawyer 
cannot provide legal advice on foreign or international law 
without being licensed in the practice of Venezuelan law. 
 
35. (U) Foreigners are required to establish a commercial 
presence for the provision of engineering services.  Foreign 
consulting engineers must work through local firms or employ 
Venezuelan engineers.  There is a law for public tenders, 
which gives preferential treatment to Venezuelan companies if 
they have the capability to carry out the work and if the 
project is financed by public funds.  Foreign capital is 
restricted to a maximum of 19.9 percent in professional 
associations. 
 
36. (U) Venezuela limits foreign equity participation (except 
from other Andean Community countries) to 20 percent in 
enterprises engaged in television and radio broadcasting, 
Spanish language newspapers, and professional services whose 
practice is regulated by national laws.  Finally, in any 
enterprise with more than 10 workers, foreign employees are 
restricted to 10 percent of the work force, and Venezuelan 
law limits foreign employee salaries to 20 percent of the 
payroll. 
 
37. (U) The government enforces a \"one-for-one\" policy that 
requires foreign musical performers giving concerts in 
Venezuela to share stage time with national entertainers. 
There is also an annual quota regarding the distribution and 
exhibition of Venezuelan films.  At least half of the 
television programming must be dedicated to national 
programs, and at least half of FM radio broadcasting must be 
dedicated to Venezuelan music. 
 
Financial Services 
------------------ 
 
 
38. (U) By signing the 1997 WTO Financial Services Agreement, 
Venezuela made certain commitments to provide market access 
for banking, securities, life and non-life insurance, 
reinsurance and brokerage activities.  Venezuela did not make 
commitments on pensions, or on maritime, aviation and 
transportation insurance, and it reserved the right to apply 
an economic needs test as part of the licensing process. 
Only local insurers may insure imports that receive 
government-approved tariff reductions or government financing. 
 
39. (U) New rules governing civil aviation, maritime 
activities and transportation insurance also have been issued 
in the package of 49 laws passed under enabling powers by 
President Chavez.  Many of the laws still need implementing 
regulations.  The impact of the legislation is, therefore, 
still unclear. 
 
------------------- 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
------------------- 
 
40. (U) The government continues to control key sectors of 
the economy, including oil, petrochemicals and much of the 
mining and aluminum industries.  Venezuela began an ambitious 
program of privatization under the Caldera administration, 
but under President Chavez further privatization has been 
halted. 
 
41. (U) Foreign investment continues to be restricted in the 
petroleum sector.  The exploration, production, refining, 
transportation, storage, and foreign and domestic sale of 
hydrocarbons are reserved to the state.  However, private 
companies may engage in hydrocarbons-related activities 
through operating contracts or through equity joint ventures 
with state owned PDVSA.  The Venezuelan constitution reserves 
ownership of the state oil company (PDVSA) to the Venezuelan 
government.  It does allow the sale of subsidiaries and 
affiliates of PDVSA to foreign investors.  In the early 
1990\'s, the Venezuelan government partially opened the sector 
to private investment in order to promote new petrochemical 
joint ventures and to bring inactive oil fields back into 
production.  Almost 60 foreign companies, representing 14 
different countries, participated in this process.  PDVSA and 
foreign oil companies signed 33 operating contracts for 
marginal fields after three rounds of bidding. 
 
42. (U) The Hydrocarbons Law of 2001 has raised concerns in 
the industry as it mandates a minimum 50 percent national 
participation in future projects and increases most royalties 
from 16.67 percent to 30 percent.  No projects have yet been 
negotiated under this law. The Gaseous Hydrocarbons Law 
offers more liberal terms, and Venezuela\'s government has 
sought foreign investment to develop offshore natural gas 
deposits near the Orinoco delta.  The Venezuelan Government 
recently unilaterally eliminated a royalty holiday ceded to 
joint venture projects devoted to the development of 
Venezuela\'s extra heavy crude. These projects created as 
strategic associations during the partial opening of the 
sector enjoyed 35 year contracts endorsed by the National 
Congress. 
 
43. (U) The government passed legislation in 1998 aimed at 
introducing domestic and foreign competition into the 
domestic gasoline market.  The law allows foreign and 
non-governmental Venezuelan investors to own and operate 
service stations, though the government retains the right to 
set product prices.  Government controlled gasoline prices 
have not risen in several years and a number of currency 
devaluations and a high inflation rate have eliminated profit 
margins. 
 
44. (U) Hydroelectric power generation in Venezuela is 
reserved to the state, although private sector participation 
is permitted in transmission and distribution.  In early 
2000, the U.S. power generating company, AES Corporation, 
successfully took control, by means of a stock swap, of 
Electricidad de Caracas (EDC), the local electrical company 
that provides power to the Caracas metropolitan area. 
 
 
45. (U) A range of other natural resources - including iron 
ore, coal, bauxite, gold, nickel and diamonds - is gradually 
being opened to greater private investment by means of 
strategic alliances.  In 1996, CVG, the state-owned mining 
firm, announced its first joint venture with a foreign 
company to develop the Las Cristinas gold mine.  President 
Chavez personally announced the beginning of operations in 
May 1999. Low gold prices, however, forced CVG and its 
partners to suspend the project.   In 2001, the concession 
was revoked on grounds of the concessionaire\'s alleged 
inability to comply with the contract by not developing the 
reserves as stipulated, and the concession has been granted 
to another firm.  In April 1999, the Venezuelan Government 
updated the 1945 Mining Law in order to encourage greater 
private sector participation in mineral extraction.  However, 
in 2003 in line with a policy to centralize mining rights 
under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), the government 
ratified a 1996 decree requiring CVG to turn over to the 
Ministry the original files on concessions granted by CVG. 
In September 2003 the Ministry acted unilaterally to 
terminate some concession areas of a private diamond mining 
company in southern Venezuela alleging failure to comply with 
the terms of the concession. 
 
46. (U) Under the Andean Community Common Automotive Policy, 
Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador impose local content 
requirements as a condition for reduced duties on imports. 
The local content requirement for passenger vehicles was 32 
percent in 1997.  It was raised to 33 percent for 1998, and 
was then lowered to 24 percent for 2000.  Under the WTO 
Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS 
Agreement), the three countries were obligated to eliminate 
local content requirements by the year 2000.  However, in 
December 1999, the Andean Automotive Policy Council 
determined that it would not eliminate the local content 
requirement as it had initially indicated, but instead 
decided to increase it gradually to 34 percent by the year 
2009.  This automotive policy may be inconsistent with 
Venezuela\'s WTO obligations under the TRIMS Agreement.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelan judges issued arrest warrants on December 
23 for eight former state oil company executives accused of 
civil rebellion and other crimes for their role in the 
December 2002 - February 2003 national strike.  Included 
among those sought are Juan Fernandez, leader of the civil 
society group \"Gente de Petroleo\" and Horacio Medina, head of 
UNAPETROL, the union formed by the 18,000 oil workers who 
ultimately lost their jobs as a result of the strike. 
Separately, prosecutors obtained measures against 30 persons 
involved in the alleged coup of April 2002 to prevent their 
departure from Venezuela.  In addition, prosecutors obtained 
orders prohibiting Coordinadora electoral fraud investigator 
Tulio Alvarez_ and former opposition governor of Anzoategui 
State David De Lima from leaving the country.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Former PDVSA Chiefs Accused of Civil Rebellion 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (U) Venezuelan prosecutors obtained arrest warrants on 
December 23 for eight former executives of state oil company 
Petroleos de Venezuela, (PDVSA) for their role in the 
national strike of December 2002 - February 2003.  The 
accused strike leaders are:  Juan Fernandez, Horacio Medina, 
Mireya Ripanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Edgar Quijano, Juan Luis 
Santana, Edgar Paredes, and Juan Lino Carrillo.  The charges 
include civil rebellion, incitement to commit a crime, 
improper interruption of supply of gasoline, and 
computer-related espionage.  Civil rebellion is the most 
serious charge, carrying a 20-year prison term.  Fernandez is 
the head of \"Gente de Petroleo,\" the NGO formed by oil 
workers who were ultimately fired as a result of the strike. 
He was also a member of the Coordinadora Democratica\'s 
campaign committee for the August 15 recall referendum 
campaign.  Medina is the president of UNAPETROL, the labor 
union (unrecognized by the GOV) formed by the fired workers. 
Though the strike leaders had been charged in February 2003 
after the strike ended, an appeals court ruled that 
prosecutors had not followed proper procedures and ordered 
prosecutors to start from scratch.  Prosecutors opened a new 
case in July 2004 against Juan Fernandez, just as he was 
managing the opposition\'s communications strategy for the 
referendum.  Cases against Medina and Ripanti were opened 
thereafter, though prosecutors did not formally open new 
cases against the remaining five. 
 
3. (C) Poloff met with Quijano on December 22 before his 
arrest warrant was announced.  Quijano said the prosecutors 
had asked for the arrests because they had not finished the 
investigation within the six months stipulated by Venezuelan 
law, resorting to detention as a means of holding the cases 
open.  Medina issued a statement on December 25 accusing the 
judge of violating legal procedures by issuing an arrest 
warrant without the prerequisites spelled out in the law. 
Medina further accused prosecutors of violating procedure by 
seeking arrest warrants against the five suspects who did not 
have open investigations. 
4. (C) The timing is also suspicious, Quijano asserted, as 
the courts are closed for all but emergency cases until 
January 10, making impossible any legal maneuvers to stay the 
arrest orders.  Quijano said his lawyer had not been given 
access to the file as required by law.  Quijano noted that 
the Ministry of Labor\'s inspectorate simultaneously convened 
hearings for Medina\'s and his complaints for wrongful 
dismissal from PDVSA, filed nearly two years ago.  Quijano 
said they would have just 72 hours (which expired on 
Christmas Eve) to appear at the Ministry of Labor to present 
their evidence or lose the case.  Quijano noted that 
Fernandez, Medina, and he held Spanish passports and believe 
they would not be extradited should they flee to Spain.  Post 
has learned that Fernandez, in fact, has been in Spain on 
personal business for two months.  Quijano said he had no 
intention of turning himself over to authorities because he 
believes he has no chance for a fair trial. 
 
------------------------- 
 
 
Chavez:  Justice Restored 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) During his state visit to China on December 23, 
President Hugo Chavez called the arrest warrants \"the 
resurrection of justice in Venezuela.\"  He recalled that 
during the strike Venezuela was \"on the border of economic 
and political collapse\" and that the strikers \"sabotaged 
refineries and even killed people.\"  He said Venezuelans 
lived in anguish because they could not get gasoline during 
the strike.  Chavez said the country is looking forward, but 
added that justice cannot forget the past. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Travel Restrictions Placed on Carmona Signers 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Prosecutors investigating the events of April 2002 
obtained court orders on December 18 preventing the 30 people 
under investigation for complicity in that case from leaving 
Venezuela.  Prosecutors, who are picking up the case from 
murdered prosecutor Danilo Anderson, told the judge the 30 
people were flight risks.  Among those prohibited from 
leaving the country are Fedecamaras President Albis Munoz and 
Sumate leader Maria Corina Machado.  Some 400 people are 
under suspicion for their presence in Miraflores Palace on 
April 12, when then Fedecamaras President Pedro Carmona swore 
himself in as interim President of Venezuela during Chavez\'s 
temporary absence.  The travel restrictions were applied to 
the 30 persons for whom formal investigations had already 
begun. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Tulio Alvarez_ and Former Governor De Lima Also Grounded 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
7. (C) Separately, prosecutors obtained a travel restriction 
on Tulio Alvarez_, a lawyer known for bringing lawsuits 
against Chavez and his key supporters for alleged corruption. 
 Among these are a suit against pro-Chavez Fifth Republic 
Movement (MVR) deputy Willian Lara for alleged irregularities 
in the finances of the National Assembly (AN) employees\' fund 
when Lara was AN president.  Alvarez_ also spearheaded the 
Coordinadora Democratica\'s investigation of alleged fraud 
surrounding the presidential recall referendum.  According to 
an Alvarez_ e-mail circulated to opposition members, when the 
new judges for the Supreme Court (TSJ) were sworn in on 
December 13, Alvarez_ accused the judges of being hand-picked 
supporters of Chavez and filed a motion to overturn the new 
TSJ law that led to their appointment.  The next day, a court 
 
SIPDIS 
restricted Alvarez_\'s international travel based on defamation 
charges brought by Lara in relation to the pension case. 
Opposition members have suggested to poloffs that the GOV is 
trying to keep Alvarez_ from traveling overseas to present the 
opposition\'s electoral fraud allegations, as he had been 
doing in recent months. 
 
8. (U) On December 18, a judge in Anzoategui State issued a 
travel prohibition against former opposition governor David 
De Lima for damaging the governor\'s mansion and embezzling 
furniture.  The wife of MVR Governor Tarek William Saab 
accused De Lima of negligence in upkeep of the house and of 
illegally removing some furniture.  Saab reportedly had to 
spend US$180,000 to renovate the house.  De Lima, who did not 
live in the mansion during his administration, denied the 
charges and vowed to remain in Venezuela to defend himself.

Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Political persecution via the courts is growing.  The 
GOV recognizes that attacking symbolic opposition figures has 
a terror effect on countless other Chavez opponents.  While 
Chavez has unleashed a new wave of political persecution, he 
is usually adept at gauging how much repression he can apply 
without public backlash.  For both sides, the issue is 
impunity.  Chavistas see the wave of legal actions as 
necessary for punishing past sins of the opposition and 
preventing future plotting against the GOV.  Chavez opponents 
view it as Chavista-controlled courts undermining the rule of 
law without fear of punishment.  In light of the new 
composition of the Supreme Court, now that the court-packing 
 
 
law has been fully implemented, we expect that the GOV will 
be able to take these cases as far as they choose to go.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) Director Jorge 
Rodriguez is the odds-on favorite to replace outgoing CNE 
President Francisco Carrasquero, who will move to the 
recently-expanded Supreme Court (TSJ) in January. 
Carrasquero\'s departure will leave two vacancies on the CNE\'s 
five-person board that the TSJ will need to fill.  The CNE 
continues to make personnel changes, replacing career 
employees with persons loyal to President Hugo Chavez. 
Preparations have begun for three electoral events in 2005. 
CNE Director Oscar Battaglini proposed to use Venezuela\'s 
Smartmatic voting machines in Haiti and Honduras, but 
Smartmatic officials indicate the idea was a non-starter. 
End summary. 
 
------------------ 
Changes At The Top 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) National Electoral Council (CNE) President Francisco 
Carrasquero was named in early December to one of the new 
magistrate positions in the Constitutional Chamber of the 
Supreme Court (TSJ) that was created by the TSJ law passed 
earlier this year.  An illness (some say heart problem) 
prevented Carrasquero from being sworn-in with the other 
appointees on December 15, and his swearing-in was 
re-scheduled for January 17.  Carrasquero\'s departure means 
there will be two vacant seats on the CNE\'s five-person 
board, the other left when the CNE\'s pro-opposition Vice 
President Ezequiel Zamora resigned in protest in September 
over a dispute involving the regional elections.  (Note: 
When the National Assembly failed to reach a two-thirds 
majority to name the CNE board in 2003, the TSJ\'s 
Constitutional Chamber found the Assembly in omission and 
appointed the five board members with a 3-2 advantage to the 
GOV.  Electoral law stipulates that vacancies be filled by 
alternates, but Zamora\'s alternates were viewed as too 
sympathetic to the opposition.  CNE Director Jorge Rodriguez 
said Carrasquero\'s replacement will once again be decided by 
the Constitutional Chamber rather than the National Assembly.) 
 
3. (C) Rodriguez is widely believed to be a shoo-in for 
Carrasquero\'s job.  As the head of the National Electoral 
Board (JNE), the electoral operations committee subordinate 
to the CNE board, Rodriguez was the organizing force behind 
the August 15 presidential recall referendum and the October 
31 regional elections.  Chavez opponents complain that 
Rodriguez, a psychiatrist by training, manipulated both 
elections to ensure GOV victories.  Jorge Tirado, a 
consultant for the Smartmatic consortium that provides the 
CNE\'s electronic voting system, told poloff December 20 that 
Rodriguez is lobbying for the job.  Tirado said Rodriguez and 
Carrasquero do not get along and rarely consult with one 
another outside of the board meetings.  Tirado said Rodriguez 
is pushing for his key assistant (and alternate director), 
Tibisay Lucena, to succeed him as head of the JNE.  Tirado 
said another alternate, Esther Gauthier, has political 
backing from the National Assembly to fill the Vice President 
position.  Tirado said that neither candidate had the job 
locked up and predicted the debate would continue until after 
Carrasquero departs. 
 
------------------------ 
CNE Faces Heavy Schedule 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Tirado said the CNE is planning for three electoral 
events in 2005.  The recall referendum against nine 
opposition National Assembly deputies and the election of the 
governor of Delta Amacuro State and six make-up elections for 
mayoral seats will take place April 10 (using Tirado\'s 
tentative planning dates).  Elections for city councils and 
neighborhood councils (\"parroquias\") are tentatively set for 
July 31.  This election, Tirado said, will encompass 
thousands of positions and tens of thousands of candidates, 
making it the most difficult from a technical standpoint. 
Lastly, National Assembly elections are planned for December 
5. 
 
-------------------------------- 
But CNE Continues To Clean House 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Prior to the presidential recall referendum, the 
pro-Chavez majority of the CNE board began to replace career 
employees, either forcing them into retirement or firing 
them.  Pedro Valladares, the leader of the CNE workers\' union 
(aligned with the opposition), told poloff December 21 that 
260 employees have been forcibly retired and 110 dismissed 
since September 2003.  Prior to Chavez, Valladares said, 
political parties filled CNE positions on a loose quota 
system, with rotations in management jobs based on which 
party was in power.  Under Chavez, the CNE has been removing 
those employees and replacing them with pro-Chavez loyalists, 
he said.  Valladares said some fired workers had successfully 
contested their dismissals in administrative labor courts. 
Work areas such as computer systems and the electoral 
registry were \"completely closed off\" to all but a handful of 
select employees, Valladares added. 
 
6. (C)  Valladares said that, despite the removal of career 
employees, the number of total employees on the payroll had 
increased from about 2,000 in September 2003 to about 4,000 
today.  Valladares, who sees payroll records as a part of his 
union duties, said many new positions were added in regional 
CNE offices in state capitals.  In addition, Valladares said 
that many of the temporary employees hired to process the 
signatures collected by the opposition for the recall 
referendum are still on the job, but do not have much to do. 
He alleged that some people on the CNE payroll are phantom 
employees and or do not work at CNE facilities.  Valladares 
said the workers received a 40-percent pay increase when the 
new board was installed (which included the same increase for 
board members), but he said no raises are contemplated for 
this year.  He said this had caused a morale problem among 
workers, especially since the CNE received its full budget 
for 2004 plus a supplemental, most of which went to purchases 
of the Smartmatic electronic voting machines and Cogent 
fingerprint capture system. 
 
-------------------------- 
CNE Thinks Internationally 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Tirado confirmed that CNE Director Oscar Battaglini -- 
considered the most revolution-minded of CNE directors -- had 
offered to lend a number of Venezuela\'s Smartmatic machines 
to the OAS for upcoming elections in Haiti.  Smartmatic Vice 
President Bob Cook told poloff December 23, however, that 
there had been no follow-up to the Battaglini proposal.  Cook 
said the company is, in fact, working independently from the 
CNE with a Haitian consortium to sell the OAS and GOH with an 
electronic voting system for Port-au-Prince using up to 6,000 
voting machines.  Tirado said he accompanied the CNE\'s Lucena 
to Honduras to offer the machines and technical assistance 
for the Honduran presidential elections in 2005.  Tirado did 
not believe the offer would work out, however, as the 
machines will be needed in Venezuela about the same time for 
the National Assembly elections.  Tirado said a group of 
Central American countries may instead collaborate on a World 
Bank loan to purchase common election equipment, which 
Smartmatic hopes to supply.  Cook pointed out that any CNE 
offer to lend equipment to a third country would require 
Smartmatic participation, since the company still owns the 
rights to most of the operating software. 
 
8. (C) Tirado mentioned that the CNE owed Smartmatic more 
than US$10 million for the additional machines purchased for 
the regional elections, a result of Smartmatic\'s foregoing a 
letter of credit to cover the sale.  Cook said his company 
plans to sell between 4,000 and 5,000 new voting machines to 
the CNE in 2005.  He said Smartmatic will roll out a new 
voting machine early next year that will be cheaper than the 
previous model.  Smartmatic has yet to sign service contracts 
with the CNE for the 2005 electoral events, but Cook said he 
has no reason to expect his company would not win the 
contracts. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Chavez needs a compliant CNE open to manipulation to 
maintain his grip on elected offices.  Rodriguez is 
intelligent, crafty, and particularly mean-spirited when it 
comes to the opposition.  Given the inability of the National 
Assembly to fulfill its constitutional role of approving CNE 
directors with a two-thirds majority, we expect the TSJ to 
name Rodriguez to Carrasquero\'s position as well as the two 
replacement directors.  It is likely the replacements will be 
Chavez sympathizers, giving Chavez a sure 4-1 vote on future 
electoral questions.  The CNE loaning out its voting machines 
and giving technical assistance to other countries seems for 
now to be a nascent concept.  The idea probably surfaced as a 
way to shore up the CNE\'s image both internationally and 
domestically.  The CNE\'s technical assistance to other 
countries, however, may be also be a means to influence the 
management of electoral processes throughout the region.

SUBJECT: VENEZUELA\'S MAGNATE DISCUSSES CHAVEZ AND THE REGION 
 
Classified By: William R. Brownfield, Ambassador, 
for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C ) SUMMARY.  Gustavo Cisneros, who has massive business 
interests in Venezuela and throughout the Western Hemisphere, 
believes we should prepare for a more confrontational, 
long-term approach to Hugo Chavez; we have a lot of work 
ahead of us to develop a coherent regional containment 
policy; and the USG should engage more broadly in Latin 
America.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) At his request, Venezuelan magnate Gustavo Cisneros 
(Cisneros Group, Univision, Venevision, Direct TV, Regional 
Beer) met with Ambassador evening of December 28.  Cisneros 
planned to meet with the President in early January and 
wanted to compare notes on Venezuela before the conversation. 
 In light of Cisneros\' meeting, his key points are summarized 
below.  Please protect. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Venezuela Internal: Stay Focused; Think Long Term 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (C) Cisneros believes Chavez came out of the recall 
referendum stronger than before.  We must think of him as a 
long-term problem.  He will be weakened and vulnerable 
eventually, but not now. 
 
-- There is no political opposition at present.  It is 
completely atomized.  USG short-term internal policy should 
focus on the independent press.  Among the newspapers, only 
\"El Nacional\" and \"El Universal\" are reliable opposition 
supporters.  All other print media has caved in to Chavez. 
 
-- USG should pick carefully the issues on which it confronts 
Chavez.  Don\'t respond to him.  Challenge him on issues that 
he does not want to discuss. 
 
-- We should pay attention, monitor, and collect information 
on the corrupt activities of Chavez supporters.  These are 
not front burner issues today, but will eventually pay big 
dividends. 
 
-- Sumate is the most effective opposition NGO in Venezuela 
today, even after four months of legal intimidation by 
Chavez.  That said, the USG should be careful about funding 
it.  Sumate needs more funding from European sources to 
protect it from accusations of being a US pawn. 
 
-- The USG should be clear and precise in its criticism of 
Chavez.  Internal opposition and regional governments need to 
know that they are not tackling Chavez alone. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Venezuela External: Tough Times for Containment 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (C) Cisneros believes that regional and international 
containment is the only realistic policy toward Chavez right 
now.  He is not optimistic about massive support.  He is 
convinced that without clear US leadership, there will be no 
containment whatsoever. 
 
-- Among the Europeans, Spain is the greatest disappointment. 
 The loss of Aznar was fatal.  Zapatero not only will not 
confront Chavez; he is actively courting him and blocking EU 
efforts to challenge Chavez. 
 
-- The UK and Netherlands are the only Europeans willing to 
make an effort to take on Chavez.  Italy\'s Berlusconi will 
engage if the issue is brought to him, but his Foreign 
Ministry and Embassy in Caracas are adamantly opposed to 
political engagement. 
 
-- France has a good and tough Ambassador in Caracas, but he 
cannot deliver his government. 
 
5. (C) The Latin Americans are in full flight: 
 
-- Lula in Brazil is increasingly annoyed and frustrated with 
Chavez.  But he will not risk being outflanked from the left 
by actively taking him on. 
 
-- Cisneros once thought Chile\'s Ricardo Lagos had the 
stomach to stand up to Chavez, but Lagos is now contemplating 
an early 2005 invitation to Chavez for a state visit. 
Cisneros suspects Lagos is reinforcing his coalition\'s left 
flank in preparation for the 2005 presidential elections. 
 
-- Colombia\'s Uribe has the biggest problems with Chavez of 
 
all the Latin Americans, but Cisneros thinks he will accept a 
deal with Chavez to give him some stability on the border 
with Venezuela. 
 
-- Vicente Fox has backed off confrontation with Chavez, 
probably to avoid giving Lopez Obrador a leftist campaign 
issue against the PAN in the next presidential elections. 
 
-- Chavez has purchased most of the Caribbean micro-states, 
as well as the Dominican Republic, with subsidized oil sales. 
 
-- The lack of Latin American leadership on Venezuela makes 
the selection of the next OAS Secretary General incredibly 
important.  El Salvador\'s Flores is clearly the candidate 
most willing to take a firm line on Chavez.  Cisneros was 
also positive on Chile\'s Insulza.  Cisneros found him to be 
tough and pragmatic.  Mexico\'s Derbez would be a disaster; 
once clear of Fox\'s oversight and control, he would lurch to 
the left. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
U.S. Policy in the Region: Time to Re-engage 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Cisneros closed by assuring that he would urge senior 
USG officials to re-engage in Latin America.  During the 
three-plus years that we had focused on international 
terrorism and the Middle East, China had moved visibly into 
the region.  Our relatively passive position gave Hugo Chavez 
operating room.  Cisneros thinks the solution for the U.S. 
was partly one of resources (i.e. ) put more money into 
Latin American programs) and partly a question of greater USG 
visibility. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Mr. Cisneros is a man of strong opinions.  That said, 
when he cites the position or opinion of a Latin American or 
European leader by name, odds are good that he has actually 
heard it directly from the leader\'s own mouth.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (C)  Venezuelan Governors in Cojedes and Monagas States 
have issued decrees ordering land \"interventions\" and 
charging committees of government and goverment-allied 
officials to review the ownership rights of over three dozen 
ranches and rural properties.  The first decree, issued by 
Governor Jhonny Yanez Rangel in Cojedes on December 9, 
affects a profitable British cattle company and a popular 
wildlife reserve.  Another Cojedes decree cordons off land 
for the installation of a used Cuban mill, according to a 
sugar industry representative.  President Hugo Chavez, who 
urged local leaders to combat large, idle estates in 
November, has reaffirmed the agrarian reform of state 
governments.  Eight other governors have backed the 
intervention, and both IRS equivalent SENIAT and state oil 
corporation PDVSA have announced policies to support land 
reform.  Althugh opposition figures have railed against the 
dcree, rancher spokesmen have reacted cautiously.  overnor 
Yanez cited widespread cooperation by ladowners and 
justified the initiative as an attemp to fulfill 
constitutional demands while the Natonal Lands Institute, 
legally responsible for lad redistribution, has tarried. 
Although Yanez sad he did not expect to have to expropriate 
land,his committee probably will compel property owners o 
\"offer\" land to the government.  Other states re likely to 
follow in moves that could encourag future invasions and 
discourage investment.  En summary. 
 
2.  (C)  On December 9, Cojedes stateGovernor Jhonny Yanez 
Rangel issued a decree ordeing \"interventions\" in all idle 
lands, \"latifundos\" (i.e., giant, idle estates), and 
territorieswith ownership conflicts and/or \"distribution 
prblems.\"  Although the decree failed to define 
\"itervention,\" it singled out 25 private properties ad 
ranches for \"occupation.\"  Aother decree provided for the 
establishment of a sugar mill and surrounding sugar cane 
farms on private land.  A third decree established a 
high-level technical committee made up of state government, 
military, academic, judicial, and para-statal officials 
charged with presenting a report to the governor on each of 
the 25 cases within 90 days.  Monagas Governor Jose Gregorio 
Briceno followed Yanez\'s lead on December 27, decreeing 
\"intervention\" in the cases of 14 specific properties, 
according to press.  Briceno\'s decree granted a committee 12 
months to resolve property issues. 
 
3.  (U)  The decree in Cojedes affects at least two 
significant properties.  The technical committee has chosen 
to begin its work on January 8 with the controversial 
intervention of Hato Charcote, a property owned by a 
profitable regional cattle ranching subsidiary of the British 
company Vestey.  The decree also singled out Hato Pinero, an 
estate that serves as a ranch, wildlife reserve, 
environmental research center, and popular tourist 
destination.  Yanez justified the intervention of Hato 
Primero to the press by remarking that \"such an important 
animal reserve cannot be private property.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
Reactions to Cojedes Decree 
--------------------------- 
 
      4.  (C)  During his December 27 message to military 
personnel, President Hugo Chavez praised Yanez\'s \"war against 
the latifundio,\" which Chavez during his November 12-13 
speeches at Fuerte Tiuna (REFTEL) had ordered regional 
leaders to wage in their respective territories.  Vice 
President Jose Vicente Rangel also supported the 
intervention, affirming that it served to implement the 
federal land and agrarian development law.  An undetermined 
number of Chavista Governors met on December 22 with their 
legal advisers to analyze the Cojedes initiative, and eight 
of them signed an accord supporting the decree.  An 
 
opposition internet columnist mused that the other 
pro-government governors refused to sign because they lacked 
the funds to support peasant cooperatives.  At least one 
Chavista governor publicly warned of potential problems; 
Portuguesa Governor Antonia Munoz said the Cojedes initiative 
could instigate more land invasions and owner-peasant 
standoffs. 
 
      5.  (C)  Other government agencies have towed the line 
on land reform.  Tax collection agency SENIAT reported on its 
 
website December 7 that it would impose a new tax on idle or 
underutilized land.  According to December 29 press reports, 
state oil corporation PDVSA executive Rafael Aleman promised 
PDVSA financial backing to guarantee agricultural 
self-sufficiency in Cojedes. 
 
6.  (U)  Many opposition press outlets have reported that the 
states lack authority to enforce the federal land law.  Pedro 
Pablo Alcantara, an Accion Democratica (AD) National Assembly 
deputy who chairs heads the agriculture and ranching 
subcommittee, told the press that Yanez needed legal training 
and called his decree an \"absurdity.\"  According to a 
December 21 press report, Albis Munoz, president of umbrella 
private sector organization FEDECAMARAS, doubted the legality 
of the decree and noted that her organization worried the 
Cojedes plan would encourage land invasions and discourage 
investment. 
 
7.  (C)  Ranchers thus far have tempered their remarks. 
Venezuelan rancher association (FEDENAGA) president Jose Luis 
Betancourt, who told poloff on November 23 that the 
government had seemed more disposed to resolve problems by 
approaching ranchers directly, said that the governor had not 
fulfilled a commitment to draft another decree providing for 
negotiations with the private sector, according to December 
19 press reports.  Nonetheless, he affirmed the governor\'s 
jurisdiction to administer territory and said FEDENAGA would 
comply with a reorganization of land if the government 
proceeded legally.  Alberto Cudemus, president of pork 
producer association FEPORCINA and one of the business 
leaders closest to the GOV, told the agriculture counselor 
that the administration has to make noise on the land reform 
issue, but he expected few results because state technical 
committees typically accomplish little. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Governors Try to Make Plans Palatable 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Faced with such criticism, Yanez has since aimed at 
making his decree sound more moderate.  During his December 
27 press conference, Yanez--interrupted by several phone 
calls from President Chavez--asserted he was only carrying 
out the precepts of the constitution.  (Note:  the Venezuelan 
constitution requires the government to promote national 
agricultural self-sufficiency, in part by dictating land 
tenure.  It also provides for government reclamation of 
\"latifundios.\")  Arguing that the intervention will clear up 
doubts about land ownership, he added that land expropriation 
\"is not foreseen.\"  Yanez predicted that over 90 percent of 
the landowners--many of whom had already offered to surrender 
territory--would reach agreements with the state over land 
tenure.  In response to criticism from the British Embassy, 
he spun the decree as an effort to address British requests 
for the state to deal with peasant land invasions on Vestey 
property. 
 
9.  (C)  Governor Briceno\'s plan included provisions to 
preempt criticism.  Briceno attached to his decree a 
moratorium on land invasions in \"intervened\" land.  Monagas 
State will also have a committee for negotiation and 
conciliation, whose goal will be to resolve problems that 
arise during the implementation of the decree. 
 
--------------- 
INTI Unreliable 
--------------- 
 
      10.  (U)  The federal bureaucracy legally charged with 
implementing the land reform law, the National Lands 
 
Institute (INTI), has yet to play a prominent role in the 
interventions.  Yanez has faulted INTI, headed by former 
intelligence chief Eliecer Otaiza, for impeding the 
constitutional drive for land reform.  In October, INTI 
announced a freeze on the handover of land titles while the 
agency underwent a restructuring.  INTI has also come under 
fire from both the opposition and the government for the 
amount of uncultivated government land that remains 
undistributed.  According to the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Land, 53 of INTI\'s largest rural properties average 112,000 
hectares, whereas under the land law, a \"latifundio\" is 
defined as having over 5,000 hectares. 
 
-------------- 
The Cuba Angle 
-------------- 
 
11.  (C)  The president of a sugar refinery in neighboring 
Portuguesa state suggested to poloff that a sweetheart deal 
with Cuba was behind the GOV\'s drive to produce sugar while 
world prices remain low.  According to the executive, the GOV 
purchased the mill second-hand from Cuba, which has been 
forced to close 60 mills in the past two years.  He said he 
could not imagine why erecting the complex would cost the USD 
250 million outlined in the federal budget, especially since 
the mill was already at port in Puerto Cabello.  National 
Assembly deputy Salomon Centeno (AD), whose Cojedes property 
was named in the decree, told the press that Cubans had been 
in the state studying the feasibility of erecting the mill 
there over the past few years. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
      12.  (C)  The plan has run the typical course of 
Chavista initiatives; that is, a radical decree, a follow-on 
plea for better understanding coupled with a slight 
rhetorical retreat, and an outcome that--short of drastic 
changes in the near term--sets a precedent for greater state 
control over the private sector.  All parties may indeed 
\"agree\" in 90 percent of the cases, but landowners will have 
no guarantee that current cooperation exempts them from 
future arm-twisting to cough up territory.  Because the 
micromanaging Chavez is encouraging the \"interventions,\" 
other governors likely will follow by ordering property 
redistribution in their own states. 
 
      13.  (C)  Fears that the initiative will incite new 
invasions and discourage investment are justified.  Land 
reform of a sort has long been part of the Chavez 
government\'s policies, and televised public ceremonies in 
which the President hands out \"cartas agrarias\" to allow land 
occupation have been a recurring part of the country\'s 
political theater.  \"Cartas agrarias,\" however, cannot be 
sold or mortgaged and thus do not serve as an adequate basis 
for sustainable rural development.  There is every reason to 
think that we will see more legal and rhetorical attacks on 
large landowners as Chavez contrives to \"deepen the 
revolution.\"

Summary

1. (U) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez visited China from 
December 21-26 and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, 
Premier Wen Jiabao, ex-president Jiang Zemin, and other 
senior GOC and business officials.  Chavez claimed that 
Venezuela has become the number one destination for Chinese 
investment in Latin America and estimated that in 2005 the 
trade relationship would reach almost USD 3 billion.  Chavez 
announced the signing of eight bilateral agreements focused 
on increasing cooperation in the energy, agriculture and 
technology fields.  He also said Chinese Vice-President Zeng 
Quinghong and Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) 
officials would visit Venezuela January 27-29 to begin the 
implementation of the signed agreements.  While praising 
Mao\'s dictum about every country learning to walk on its own 
two feet, Chavez again criticized U.S. \"imperialism\" and 
praised China as a big country that does not act like an 
empire.  End Summary.

Second Best Is Good Enough 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) President Hugo Chavez visited China December 21-26, 
meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, 
ex-president Jiang Zemin, and other senior GOC and business 
officials.   Chavez signed eight agreements in Beijing that 
will reportedly lay the foundation for giving Chinese oil 
companies preferential access to oil and gas projects in 
Venezuela as well as in the development of infrastructure 
projects. (Note: The Chinese National Petroleum Corporation 
(CNPC) currently operates two oil fields in Venezuela.)  The 
press has reported that China and Venezuela also reaffirmed a 
commitment to the development of a second orimulsion (a 
water/extra heavy crude mixture used for electrical 
generation) plant by the Chinese in Venezuela. 
 
3. (U) With respect to oil exports, Chavez said Venezuela 
would look to build an oil pipeline through Panama to 
facilitate oil exports to China.  After 100 years of U.S. 
domination, said Chavez, he was going to put Venezuela\'s oil 
exports at China\'s disposition, especially now that China had 
become the world\'s second largest importer of crude oil. 
Chavez said Venezuela would continue selling oil to the U.S., 
\"but not only to them.\"  (Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez 
later told reporters that Venezuela would increase production 
to accommodate increasing sales to China so as not to disrupt 
service to its \"traditional partners.\") 
 
4. (U) China\'s Minmetal and Venezuela\'s Corpozulia also 
agreed to increase coal production in Zulia State and to 
explore the possibility of an alliance to expand the iron and 
steel industry in Guayana.  Separately, the GOV approved a 
credit for USD 40 million to buy Chinese farm tools and 
machinery for small- and medium-sized farms in Venezuela, 
while the Chinese agreed to loan Venezuela USD 700 million 
for house construction.   The Chinese also agreed to 
increased investment for the construction of a Venezuelan 
national railroad. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Mao and Bolivar: The Best of Friends 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Speaking at a press conference, Chavez asserted that 
national heroes Mao Tse Tung and Simon Bolivar would have 
been friends if they had known each other \"because their 
thoughts, despite the distance in time and geography, sprang 
from the same source.\"  If Bolivar had lived a few more 
decades, Chavez asserted, he would have ended up a socialist. 
 Citing Mao\'s dictum about every country learning to walk on 
its own two feet, Chavez said Latin America had paid a high 
price to be free and not follow the decisions coming from the 
Washington consensus and the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).  He again criticized U.S. \"imperialism\" and called 
capitalism \"the path to hell,\" while complimenting China for 
being a big country without being imperialistic.  Chavez 
described himself as \"Bolivarian, Christian, and Maoist.\"  He 
also reaffirmed Venezuela\'s \"one China\" policy and opposition 
to Taiwanese independence. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
6. (C) In trying to follow his \"multi-polar world\" foreign 
policy, Chavez is seeking support from countries he sees as 
sympathetic to his anti-U.S. message.  He is also playing his 
oil card.  While Chavez clearly wants to diversify 
Venezuela\'s oil export market away from the U.S., we doubt 
that China would be the optimal partner from a strictly 
business point of view.  The cost of shipping heavy 
Venezuelan crude to China, much less the costs associated 
with tooling Chinese refineries to receive it, would be 
large.  However, purely economic considerations seem to 
figure less and less in the policy decisions of the GOV.  The 
future of Venezuela\'s patented orimulsion fuel is a case in 
point.  Stating that it wished to optimize the state\'s return 
on each barrel of extra heavy crude produced, the GOV moved 
in the past year to terminate orimulsion expansion deals with 
the Canadians and the Italians.  Despite this, as noted 
above, Chavez has reportedly agreed to the development of a 
second orimulsion plant by the Chinese.  If this project 
moves ahead, it will be a clear indication of the political 
bent of Venezuela\'s energy policy.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on 
December 27 addressed the armed forces in an over two hour 
pep rally and romanticized Venezuelan history lesson that 
glorified the military\'s growing role in society.  Peppering 
his remarks with anti-US rhetoric, he unveiled to the public 
a retro, olive-drab uniform for Venezuelan troops and 
announced a change in military doctrine that he said would 
hail back to Venezuela\'s independence-era \"roots.\"  He 
outlined the growth of domestic military manufacturing and 
reminded the troops of spending increases aimed at increasing 
their standard-of-living.  The press reported opposition 
criticism of Chavez\'s attempts to emulate the Cuban armed 
forces in both doctrine and appearance.  Although the media 
analysis is not far off the mark, the Venezuelan Armed Forces 
will be unlikely to translate doctrine into military 
readiness.  In both timing and content, the speech shows 
Chavez\'s grip over the military is strengthening.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Back to the Roots:  New Look, New Doctrine 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez addressed troops at 
Fuerte Tiuna, Caracas\'s principal military base, in a 
longer-than-usual (two hours and 15 minutes) year-end salute 
on December 27.  Employing his usual histrionic cadence of 
calculated pauses and crescendos, Chavez announced the armed 
forces would return to its \"roots\" after a century of being 
hijacked by \"imperialist\" interests.  Venezuelan history, 
recounted through his perspective of military heroes who 
resisted the designs of \"imperial\" powers, littered his 
speech.  In particular, he singled out the exploits of 
independence hero Francisco de Miranda, although he glossed 
over Miranda\'s downfall at the hands of Simon Bolivar, who 
surrendered him to the Spanish.  Chavez referred inaccurately 
to US history on two occasions, calling Alexander Hamilton 
president and mentioning Lincoln as a contemporary of 
Washington and Jefferson.  Later, he faulted \"colonialist\" 
interests with trying to erase the true version of Venezuelan 
history.  He concluded his speech with a swipe at SOUTHCOM 
and remarked that the military must \"throw out the 
imperialist venom they have injected in us for 100 years.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Chavez hailed the olive drab fatigues sported by 
soldiers in attendance as the new Bolivarian uniform, which, 
he asserted, resembled those worn by Venezuelan soldiers in 
the 18th century.  (Note:  the uniforms also resemble current 
Cuban uniforms.  End note.)  He said all soldiers should have 
the new uniform--dubbed \"The Patriot\"--by 2005.  Chavez 
returned in the course of his speech to interject how well 
the new look suited his troops. 
 
4.  (C)  Chavez also invoked Bolivar to change Venezuela\'s 
military doctrine.  Bolivar, he said, opposed defensive 
strategies, which Chavez interpreted to mean Venezuela should 
accelerate its \"ideological offensive.\"  Chavez urged the 
creation of a civil-military committee to help his former 
military academy classmates draft a national security 
doctrine to be employed in \"asymmetrical wars.\"  Extolling 
the virtues of military education, he tasked all military 
schools, services, and commands with fomenting the new 
strategy. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Engine of the Revolution 
---------------------------- 
 
      5.  (C)  A second current in Chavez\'s speech was his 
vision of the military as a tool to help spread his 
revolution throughout Venezuelan society.  The ideological 
offensive, he said, should radiate outside the ranks of the 
armed forces to help build a new country.  He celebrated the 
role of the military in the referendum and regional 
elections.  In an outburst of poetic hyperbole, he said 
\"there aren\'t enough stones in the world to erect a statue in 
honor of the military\'s worthy role in fighting poverty...\" 
Chavez predicted the military would reach to \"the farthest 
corner of the planet\" in its  humanitarian mission. 
Expanding on the country\'s economic growth, which was 
\"first-place in Latin America,\" Chavez tasked the military 
with helping the economy recover and singled out the 
leadership roles played by active duty and retired officers 
in parastatals. 
 
      6.  (C)  Chavez took issue with the view that the 
military should be apolitical, although he conceded it should 
not be \"partisan.\"  He lambasted media sources for sowing 
\"indiscipline\" by criticizing its political role.  Later in 
the speech, he spent several minutes praising retired 
officers for running for governor. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Spending: A Bolivarian Military-Industrial Complex 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
      7.  (C)  Chavez catalogued materiel being repaired in 
Venezuela, including tanks, submarines, thousands of rifles, 
and the first frigate ever refurbished in Venezuelan 
territory.  Aircraft such as the Tucanos, the Broncos, and 
the F-5s also made his list.  Although he admitted that 
fabric of sufficient quality could not yet be produced 
locally, he predicted that in 2005 Venezuela would be able to 
manufacture its own uniforms.  (Note:  We know of one major 
textile manufacturer who offered to bid on the uniforms but 
was turned down, presumably for political reasons.  End 
note.)  Chavez also noted the refurbishing of Venezuela\'s 
F-16s (refs A and B), without mentioning that such upgrades 
violate USG contract agreements.  In an oblique jab at the 
United States, he said Venezuela has more powerful friends 
each day willing to assist its technological development 
without attaching strings.  These friends became apparent to 
listeners as Chavez next referred to \"advanced negotiations\" 
for radar systems (note:  Venezuela currently is considering 
buying such equipment from China and Ukraine.  end note.) and 
the purchase of 41 Russian helicopters and 100,000 Russian 
rifles. 
 
      8.  (C)  Chavez also spent considerable time listing 
progress made in raising the military\'s standard of living. 
In particular, he highlighted that military personnel in 2004 
had received a 30 percent raise, credits to buy cars, and 
hospital upgrades worth USD 8 million.  Future plans included 
creating more military commissaries to sell subsidized food 
and improving military housing.  Chavez noted he had just 
secured in China the financing of about USD 700 million for 
public and military residences (ref C). 
 
------------------- 
Opposition Reaction 
------------------- 
 
      9.  (C)  Opposition reactions, which tended to focus on 
the change in uniform, were predictably pessimistic. 
Chavez\'s first defense minister, General (ret.) Raul Salazar 
suggested to the press that the military could be stocking 
itself with new munitions to repress the Venezuelan public. 
According to a press account, another retired senior officer 
predicted the new doctrine would embrace the Cuban strategy 
of engaging civilians in national defense. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  Chavez\'s control of the military quite likely is 
strengthening.  The year-end speech marks six years that 
Chavez has had to marginalize and dismiss opposition 
officers.  Meanwhile, new recruits have experienced six years 
of indoctrination, which his proposed \"ideological offensive\" 
will only serve to intensify.  In addition to his attempts at 
flattery, the use of the military in nearly all aspects of 
his \"revolution\" signals to officers that a career in the 
armed forces offers opportunities.  Moreover, the 
aforementioned perks are trickling down to key military 
personnel. 
 
11.  (C)  The Venezuelan Armed Forces are currently incapable 
of warfighting and will remain so.  Chavez probably will 
successfully replace Venezuela\'s old, US-based doctrine at 
least in part with Cuban military theory; his \"asymmetrical 
warfare\" strategy will be aimed at making a US invasion 
cost-prohibitive.  Nevertheless, the consequences of the 
doctrinal shift will be merely ideological.  The offensive 
nature of many of the weapons systems mentioned would be 
useless in an envisioned war with the United States.  The 
announced acquisitions, production, and refurbishment, thus 
show Chavez seeks to distance his troops from the taint of US 
materiel while expanding his economic model of import 
substitution.

SUBJECT: ARCHBISHOP URGES MORE USG CRITICISM OF CHAVEZ 
 
Classified By: Mark Wells, Acting Political Counselor, 
for Reasons 1.4(b). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Venezuelan Archbishop Baltazar Porras, head of the 
council of Catholic bishops of Venezuela, told Ambassador 
January 6 the USG ought to be more outspoken in its criticism 
of Hugo Chavez.  Porras urged more international community 
involvement to contain Chavez\'s regional aspirations, though 
he admitted that political will to do so is minimal.  He 
asserted that Chavez will continue to dismantle democratic 
civil society such as organized labor, the business sector, 
and the church.  The Archbishop lamented the GOV\'s subtle 
campaign to sideline the church from its traditional work in 
poor neighborhoods, the educational system, and the military. 
 End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Senior Church Leader Urges Engagement, Containment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (C) At the invitation of the Papal Nuncio, the Ambassador 
attended a lunch on January 6 with Baltazar Porras, 
Archbishop of Merida and head of the Venezuela Council of 
Bishops (CEV).  Porras, one of President Hugo Chavez\'s 
strongest public critics, told the Ambassador that there is 
widespread perception among the opposition that the USG 
softened its message against Chavez after the August 2004 
referendum because of energy interests.  Porras suggested 
that the USG be more clear and public in its criticism of the 
Chavez administration. 
 
3. (C) Porras said the international community also needs to 
work and speak out more to contain Chavez and the export of 
his revolution.  Porras said most regional governments have 
deferred to Brazilian President Ignacio \"Lula\" da Silva to 
handle Chavez because the two share leftist ideologies.  Lula 
has been unwilling to engage, however, which has stymied 
regional efforts to contain Chavez, the Archbishop asserted. 
Porras said the Europeans have been just as weak on Chavez, 
especially since the departure of Spanish President Jose 
Maria Aznar.  The Archbishop said that both Latin America and 
Europe need strong leadership from the USG. 
 
------------------------- 
Fighting Chavez Long Term 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Porras described Chavez as a \"long-term problem.\"  He 
said Chavez will continue to dismantle civil society groups 
necessary to foster democratic rule:  organized labor, the 
independent press, the business community, and the church. 
The Archbishop cited as an example the GOV efforts to 
penetrate the Catholic school system in Merida.  GOV 
officials insisted that the Catholics accept \"community 
representatives\" on their school boards, and once accepted 
these individuals began to push revolutionary \"reforms.\" 
Porras also noted reduced contacts with the military, which 
had traditionally invited him to change of command ceremonies 
but had not done so in more than three years. 
 
5. (C) Porras offered to facilitate any USG efforts at the 
community level to demonstrate that non-GOV entities -- the 
church, the private sector, etc. -- can have a positive 
impact on Venezuela\'s poor.  He welcomed USG visits to church 
social programs in poor neighborhoods.  Porras warned that 
the longer the USG waits, the more successful GOV will be at 
undermining traditional democratic organizations.  He 
acknowledged an inherent conflict in his own analysis: 
Chavez is a long-term problem but the longer it takes to 
address, the stronger he becomes.

Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Porras and the rest of the Catholic leadership have 
kept low profiles since the referendum, the results of which 
they grudgingly accepted.  Chavez has targeted the church, 
especially its leadership, which he sees as an ally of the 
previous political regime.  Chavez has a long-running 
conflict as well with Porras, who was among the first to 
accuse Chavez of authoritarian tendencies.  Rivalries aside, 
Porras is in touch with current domestic and international 
thought on Venezuela.  The Catholic social projects Porras 
seeks to promote, while not on the scale of the GOV\'s 
\"missions,\" do have a history of solidarity with Venezuela\'s 
poor that is not so easily undone, despite Chavez\'s efforts.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Maria Corina Machado and Roberto Abdul, leaders of the 
NGO Sumate, briefed CODEL Dodd on January 10 on future plans 
of the electoral advocacy group.  Machado lamented the 
tightening control President Hugo Chavez now held over 
Venezuela\'s branches of government, especially the National 
Electoral Council.  She said that despite the setback of 
losing the August 2004 referendum to recall Chavez, Sumate is 
moving forward with training for many of its 40,000 
volunteers.  Sumate leaders said they will continue to seek 
financial support from the National Endowment for Democracy 
and USAID, though they are looking for resources -- and at 
least moral support -- from other governments and foreign 
organizations.  Machado denied that Sumate had aspirations to 
become a political party, still hopeful that opposition 
parties will find a candidate to beat Chavez in the 2006 
elections.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
Sumate Briefs Codel 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) Maria Corina Machado and Roberto Abdul, leaders of the 
Venezuelan NGO Sumate, met with Senators Christopher Dodd 
(D-CT), Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), and William Nelson (D-FL) at 
the Ambassador\'s residence on January 10.  Also present were 
Senate Foreign Relations Staffer Janice O\'Connell, Dodd 
Staffer Jonathan Pearl, Nelson Staffer Dan McLaughlin, and 
Chafee Staffer Deborah Brayton.  Machado described Sumate as 
a group of concerned citizens, mostly professionals, who came 
together in 2002 to promote an electoral solution to 
Venezuela\'s political crisis, namely, the recall referendum 
against President Hugo Chavez.  Without Sumate, Machado 
asserted, the referendum would not have occurred.  Machado 
said political rights in Venezuela are more vulnerable than 
ever now that Chavez has control of all branches of 
government.  The National Electoral Council (CNE) is so 
blatantly politicized, she said, that opposition voters have 
lost faith in Venezuela\'s electoral system and may opt out of 
future elections.  Machado said the NGO is now advocating 
steps to restore credibility to the CNE, such as auditing the 
voter registry and naming new CNE directors through the 
constitutional method (ref a).  Abdul noted that Sumate also 
plans to widen its watchdog mission to other measures of 
democratic rule such as judicial autonomy or public spending. 
 
3. (C) After the defeat in the referendum, Machado said, 
volunteer participation in Sumate dropped off.  Interest 
later returned, she added, as the dithering of political 
parties have failed to inspire participation in them . 
Noting that Sumate has some 40,000 members nationwide, 
Machado said that in the first half of 2005 they plan to 
provide training on human rights and the Constitution to 
27,000 people.  (Note:  Abdul later told poloff this training 
is a continuation of a project financed by National Endowment 
for Democracy (NED). End note.) 
 
-------------------- 
Financing and Travel 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Asked by Senator Dodd about financing sources, Abdul 
said that 95 percent of Sumate\'s funding comes from 
Venezuelan individuals and companies.  Machado said donations 
have become scarcer as GOV intimidation tactics against 
contributors have increased.  She alleged, for example, that 
some companies have been raided by the tax service (SENIAT) 
as retribution for supporting Sumate.  On foreign financing, 
Abdul said that Sumate had received $31,000 from NED and an 
additional $53,000 from USAID.  Senator Dodd encouraged 
Sumate to seek international financing from non-U.S. sources 
 
so that Chavez cannot credibly label Sumate as a USG-backed 
organization.  Machado contended that foreign financing for 
NGOs is legal, despite the GOV\'s contention to the contrary, 
and that Sumate will continue to apply for NED and other 
grants, lest it appear they were conceding the point to the 
GOV. 
 
5. (C) Machado said Sumate representatives are planning 
several trips to seek foreign support as well as to learn 
from other countries that have survived threats to democratic 
rule.  She attributed foreign governments\' reluctance to 
provide funding to Sumate to a wrong perception of the 
Venezuelan political conflict or economic interests in the 
country.  Senator Dodd suggested Sumate approach Spain and 
Brazil as a way to reach Europe and Latin America, 
respectively.  When Machado said the Zapatero government\'s 
warming up to Chavez is complicating contact in Spain, Dodd 
offered to help with his own contacts in the U.S.-Spain 
Council.  Machado said they received an invitation from the 
Canadian foreign ministry to visit Ottawa the last week of 
January.  She noted that the courts investigating the events 
of April 2002 have imposed a restriction on her international 
travel (though the judge allowed her to go to France for 
Christmas vacation).  Machado said she would seek permission 
nonetheless to travel to Canada; if not forthcoming, she 
said, other Sumate representatives would make the trip. 
(Abdul told poloff separately that Sumate representatives are 
also considering visits to Davos for the World Economic Forum 
and the Czech Republic, where former Czech President Vacslav 
Havel has agreed to meet them.) 
 
----------------------- 
What\'s Next For Sumate? 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) Senator Dodd asked whether Sumate had considered 
becoming a political party given its extensive political 
activism and infrastructure.  Machado rejected the idea, 
saying Sumate can best serve as an autonomous voice in civil 
society rather than as a political party.  Machado expressed 
hope that the political parties would regroup and develop a 
viable alternative to Chavez for the December 2006 
presidential elections. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Sumate is the most viable Chavez opponent in 
Venezuela\'s political landscape.  Its upper-middle class 
leadership is not linked to the previous political regime. 
The organization earned its reputation from its superior 
technical capacity and ability to mobilize people for the 
various signature drives leading to the referendum.  In fact, 
most of its national leadership are engineers by training. 
Sumate\'s credibility makes it a prime target for the GOV as 
Venezuela enters yet another year of elections.  As Sumate 
seeks to define its post-referendum mission, Machado and 
company are being careful not to spend their political 
capital rashly.  The more Sumate can diversify its 
international support -- both moral and financial -- beyond 
the USG, the more credibility it will have. 
 
7. (U) CODEL Dodd did not have an opportunity to review this 
message.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The alleged abduction from Caracas to Colombia of 
FARC \"foreign minister\" Rodrigo Granda during December 13-14 
has become the most publicized news story of the new year 
after initially garnering little attention from the 
Venezuelan press.  On December 15, the Colombian Defense 
Ministry claimed Granda had been arrested in Cucuta, 
Colombia.  On January 3, the FARC protested the action in an 
official communique.  Venezuela\'s National Assembly named a 
committee to investigate the action, while Interior and 
Justice Minister Jesse Chacon and other government officials 
proceeded cautiously and inconsistently, facing mounting 
evidence that Granda was living in Venezuela with the 
connivance of the GOV.  After opponents of President Hugo 
Chavez publicized proof of Granda\'s Venezuelan 
naturalization, Chavez said it should be revoked because the 
FARC leader had obtained it under false pretenses.  The 
Chavez administration\'s dilemma is how to contend with 
criticism for harboring terrorists or for allowing Colombian 
officials to operate in Venezuela with impunity.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C)  The alleged abduction of senior FARC official 
Rodrigo Granda--known as the guerrillas\' \"foreign 
minister\"--from Venezuela to Colombia has become Venezuela\'s 
lead news story of the new year.  On December 15, the GOC 
announced Granda\'s arrest in the Colombian border town of 
Cucuta on December 14.  The FARC, protesting through an 
official communique on January 3, and Granda, via his lawyer, 
attested to press rumors alleging he was \"kidnapped\" in 
downtown Caracas.  According to Granda\'s version, Colombian 
officials posing as Venezuelan intelligence (Disip) officers 
shoved him into the trunk of a car on the afternoon of 
December 13 and drove him 16 hours to Cucuta, Colombia. 
Other media outlets speculated about GOV complicity in the 
abduction, generating criticism of the GOV from the left. 
Colombian Defense Minister Jorge Uribe disavowed the FARC 
story, saying Granda was captured in Cucuta on the 14th. 
While sticking to the story that no violation of Venezuelan 
sovereignty occurred, he averred on January 12 that the GOC 
had paid for information leading to Granda\'s arrest.  A 
radical pro-Chavez advisor for citizen security issues in the 
Caracas metropolitan mayor\'s office told poloff in late 
December that the GOV knew the operation had taken place in 
Caracas.  Separately, on 6 January an anti-Chavez official in 
the Venezuelan Ministry of Interior and Justice (MIJ) 
confirmed to poloff the GOV had known about the Caracas 
capture. 
 
--------------------- 
GOV Publicly Cautious 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Faced with Colombian press reports asserting the 
capture had occurred in Venezuela, Interior and Justice 
Minister Jesse Chacon on December 29 ordered the 
investigation of a kidnapping that took place on December 13 
near a Caracas metro station.  By early January, a media 
storm had erupted over the issue.  On January 5, Chacon said 
that it was difficult to determine the true identity of the 
victim, but he accepted that corrupt Venezuelan officials in 
collusion with Colombians may have captured Granda at the 
site.  The National Assembly followed by announcing its own 
investigation on January 6.  Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez 
urged patience while authorities completed their 
investigation. 
 
------------------------------ 
Granda\'s Business in Venezuela 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  According to a pro-Government tabloid, National 
Assembly deputy Marelys Perez said on 6 January that Granda 
had been living in Venezuela for years.  Perez immediately 
denied making the statement but admitted that Granda had been 
in Venezuela to attend a \"Bolivarian Congress of the People\" 
on 7-8 December.  The FARC communique stated Granda had 
participated at the invitation of the Venezuelan Government, 
which Perez also denied.  Granda\'s lawyer, meanwhile, said 
Granda had obtained Venezuelan citizenship and offered his 
Venezuelan cedula number as proof.  Chacon countered that 
many people obtain cedulas illegally at the border.  Granda 
was not a citizen, the Minister said, adding that the GOV had 
no record of him entering the country. 
 
---------- 
GOV Busted 
---------- 
 
5.  (U)  On January 7, former president of the Venezuelan 
Congress Cristobal Fernandez Dalo held a press conference in 
which he showed a copy of the July 9, 2004 official GOV 
gazette listing Granda as a naturalized citizen.  Fernandez 
cited the gazette as proof that the GOV had lied about 
Granda\'s citizenship and--if Granda did not complete five 
years of Venezuelan residence before applying--had 
naturalized him illegally.  Granda\'s lawyer, in a follow-on 
interview, attested that Granda had waited in line for 11 
hours to receive naturalization.  Granda\'s citizenship has 
played into the hands of government critics, who have 
asserted that the GOV\'s pre-referendum citizenship drive was 
fraudulent (REFTEL).  Opposition members also have circulated 
via email a 2002 article from Caracas daily El Universal 
alleging that Granda had served on a secret Disip committee 
charged with providing Colombians illegal access to 
Venezuela; the newspaper has since republished the story.  To 
further embarrass the GOV, the press has reprinted Colombian 
President Alvaro Uribe\'s 2002 avowal that Colombian 
authorities would capture guerrillas in Venezuela if Chavez 
did not hand them over as promised. 
 
---------------------- 
GOV Scrambles to React 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  On the same day as Fernandez\'s conference, Chacon 
affirmed that Granda had been kidnapped in Caracas.  Chavez 
weighed in on January 9 during his \"Alo Presidente\" broadcast 
that Colombian police had lied about having captured Granda 
in Colombia, although he cautioned at a press conference the 
following day that the GOV had not yet established Colombian 
police involvement in the \"kidnapping.\"  He added that he 
would bring up the issue with Colombian President Uribe. 
Having committed himself to protesting Granda\'s abduction, 
Chavez began to try to explain his presence in the country. 
Showing an alleged copy of Granda\'s passport, Chavez accused 
Granda of using false documents to obtain naturalization, 
which he said should be revoked.  He deflected charges of 
having protected a terrorist by demanding that countries 
request extradition of such criminals  rather than violating 
international law by extraterritorial kidnappings.  On 
January 12, ex-intelligence chief and current National Land 
Institute (INTI) director Eliezer Otaiza suggested the CIA 
could have been involved in the operation.

Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  The FARC\'s going public on the Granda case has 
forced the GOV into a situation in which it has had 
difficulty saving face.  Disavowing Granda would be 
tantamount to admitting it has allowed a violation of 
Venezuelan sovereignty.  Protesting the arrest leaves the GOV 
vulnerable to charges of protecting a terrorist and padding 
electoral rolls with foreigners.  For the time being, Chavez 
has hedged his bets by criticizing Colombian cops while 
stopping short of faulting the Colombian government directly, 
a position made more tenable by Colombia\'s recent admission 
of having paid for information (ostensibly from corrupt 
Venezuelan officials) on Granda.  Chavez may also take 
greater advantage of his tried-and-true trick of blaming the 
United States to distract the public from the real nature of 
the problem.  End comment.
