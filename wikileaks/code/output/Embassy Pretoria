AF FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY CROCKER FROM AMBASSADOR PERKINS 
 
E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS: SF, PGOV 
SUBJECT: MBEKI\'S RELEASE -- WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. I BELIEVE THAT THE RELEASE OF GOVAN MBEKI SHOULD 
BE SEEN AS A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT TO LOOSEN UPTHE POLITICAL 
GRIDLOCK IN THE COUNTRY ON THE KEY ISSUE OF 
BLACK/WHITE DIALOGUE.  I SUSPECT, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
GESTURE AND THE OTHER RELEASES WHICH WE HOPE WILL 
OCCURIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ARE AIMED MORE AT 
DRAWING MODERATE INTERNAL BLACK LEADERS INTO A 
DIALOGUE, RATHER THAN AT ENGAGING THE EXTERNAL ANC. 
SIMPLE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, 
I.E., THE POSSIBLE DEATH IN PRISON OF AGED ANC 
PARTIARCHS, ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN PRETORIA\'S GAMBIT. 
 
 
THE HUMANITARIAN ANGLE 
 
3.  DFA DIRECTOR GENERAL NIEL VAN HEERDEN TOLD US 
YESTERDAY JUST BEFORE MBEKI\'S RELEASE THAT TO SOME 
EXTENT P.W. BOTH\'S DECISION SHOULD BE SEEN AS 
SOMETHING \"FROM ONE OLD MAN TO ANOTHER.\"  VAN HEERDEN 
SAID THAT IN THE NOVEMBER 4 SAG SESSION WHICH 
FINALIZED THE DECISION, P.W. SAID THE MAN IS SEVENTY 
SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IN GOOD HEALTH FOR  A MAN THAT 
AGE, BUT HE IS NOT A YOUNG MAN.  P.W., IN VAN 
HEERDEN\'S VIEW, SEEMED TO BE MUSING OVER HIS OWN 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE TWILIGHT YEARS OF HIS LIFE. 
 
4.  VAN HEERDEN SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO ARGUMENT 
ABOUT THE UNCONDITIONALNATURE OF MBEKI\'S RELEASE. 
THERE WAS ALSO GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT, IF ALL WENT 
WELL, THIS WOULD BE ONLY THE FIRST STEP INA PROCESS 
INVOLVING THE FREEING OF MORE ANC PRISONERS OVER THE 
NEXT FEW MONTHS.  HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION 
MANDELA BUT OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT HE WOULD BE THE 
FINAL ACT IN THE PROCESS. 
 
 
THE POLITICAL ANGLE 
 
5.  VAN HEERDEN STRESSED THAT IN A BROADER CONTEXT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS WELL AWARE THAT THE SITUATION IS 
\"TUMBLING HEAD OVER HEELS TOWARD SOME KIND OF 
CATASTROPHE.  A GESTURE OF SOME SORT WAS NEEDED TO 
BREAK UP THE MOMENTUM AND BRING PEOPLE AROUND TO THE 
NEED TO TALK. 
 
6.  CENTRAL TOTHIS CONTEXT IN MY VIEW IS THE 
PERCEPTION INSIDE THE SAG,RECENTLY EXPRESSED TO ME 
BY STOFFEL VAN DER MERWE, THAT CREDIBLE BLACK LEADERS 
INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA SUCH AS BUTHELEZI HAVE PAINTED 
THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER BY REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH PRETORIA UNTIL THE POOLSMORE/ROBBEN ISLAND 
GOVERNMENT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO MEET THAT CONDITION. 
HOWEVER, IN DOING SO, THERE IS NO INTENTION AT THIS 
STAGE TO DEAL WITH THE LUSAKA AND. 
 
7.  I WOULD SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT STOFFEL HAS ANY 
ILLUSIONS ABOUT AN IMPENDING SEA OF CHANGE IN BLACK 
REJECTION OF CHRIS HEUNIS\' NATIONAL COUNCIL. 
HOWEVER, IN PLAYING A LONGER TERM GAME VIS A VIS 
INTERNAL BLACK POLITICAL FIGURES, THE SAG MUST FEEL 
IT MAY NOW BE ABLE TO MOVE A FEW PIECES IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION. IN THAT CONNECTION, INFORMATION DUPUTY 
DIRECTOR DAVID STEWART REMARKED TO US EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING FROM A 
POSITION OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH,AT SOME STAGE A 
POLITICAL DIALOGUE MUST TAKE PLACE, \"IF NOT IN THE 
NATIONAL COUNCIL, THEN IN WHATEVER FORUM FOLLOWS IT 
OR WHATEVER COMES AFTER THAT.\" 
 
 
OUR REACTION 
 
8.  IN SUM, WE SHOULD HEARTILY WELCOME MBEKI\"S 
RELEASE AS WE HAVE DONE AND GENTLY PRESS THE SAG TO 
FOLLOW UP WITH OTHER PRISONERS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. 
(AT THE SAME TIME, WE MIGHT QUIETLY URGE THE ANC NOT 
TO CROW VICTORY TOO LOUDLY.)  HOWEVER, WE SHOULD HAVE 
NO ILLUSION THAT THIS PARTICULAR SAG STRATEGY -- 
ASIDE FROM ATTEMPTING TO CLAIM SOME HIGH GROUND -- IS 
IN A SENSE AIMED AT A NEAR TERM SAG/ANC DIALOGUE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  THE LEVEL OF PROTEST ACTION CONTINUES TO RISE IN THE 
WAKE OF PRESIDENT DE KLERK\'S FEBRUARY 2 PARLIAMENTARY 
SPEECH.  A GROWING NUMBER OF BLACK COMMUNITIES HAVE 
ORGANIZED RALLIES AROUND LOCAL ISSUES, WHILE THE REBEL 
CRICKET TOUR AND THE UNBANNING OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE 
PROVIDE A NEW FOCUS OF ACTIVITY.  MOST DEMONSTRATIONS 
CARRY A PALPABLE RISK OF CONFRONTATION AND VIOLENCE 
BETWEEN POLICE AND PROTESTERS, OR BETWEEN PARTICIPATING 
ANTI-APARTHEID FACTIONS.  THIS TENSION PREVAILS AT THE 
VERY TIME PRETORIA IS UNDER PRESSURE TO RELEASE MANDELA 
(SURE TO ROCKET BLACK ENTHUSIASM) AND REMOVE THE STATE OF 
EMERGENCY IN FULL. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.  IN THE PRETORIA-JOHANNESBURG AREA ALONE, AT LEAST 5 
RALLIES TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE PAST WEEK.  THIS DOES NOT 
COUNT THE PROTEST ACTIONS SURROUNDING THE REBEL BRITISH 
CRICKET TOUR WHICH IS ATTRACTING ALMOST DAILY PROTESTS. 
 
--------- 
ALEXANDRA 
--------- 
 
4.  IN PERHAPS THE LARGEST EVER DEMONSTRATION IN ALEXANDRA 
(NORTHERN JOHANNESBURG), AN ESTIMATED 50,000 RESIDENTS LED 
BY THE ALEXANDRA CIVIC ORGANIZATION MARCHED ON FEBRUARY 3 
FROM THE LOCAL STADIUM TO THE CITY COUNCIL OFFICES AND THE 
POLICE STATION TO PRESENT PETITIONS.  EVEN BEFORE WINNIE 
MANDELA APPEARED ON THE SCENE, THE DEMONSTRATION HAD 
BECOME VOCIFEROUSLY AN ANC UNBANNING CELEBRATION.  THE 
POLICE MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE. 
 
-------------- 
ATTERIDGEVILLE 
-------------- 
 
5.  THE ATTERIDGEVILLE-SAULSVILLE RESIDENTS ORGANIZATION 
(ASRO) SPONSORED AND DIRECTED A SIMILAR EXERCISE IN MASS 
MOBILIZATION THE NEXT DAY (FEBRUARY 4) OUTSIDE PRETORIA. 
SOME 60-80,000 RESIDENTS JOINED THE MARCH TO LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT OFFICES WHERE A PETITION WAS DELIVERED GIVING 
THE CITY COUNCILLORS ONE MONTH TO ADDRESS A MYRIAD OF 
TOWNSHIP GRIEVANCES (RENT INCREASES, EVICTIONS, 
MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS, ETC.). 
 
6.  AGAIN, ANC SYMPATHIZERS DOMINATED THE GATHERING; ONLY 
ANC, SACP, UDF, COSATU, AND SWAPO BANNERS WERE IN 
EVIDENCE.  PARTICIPANTS WHO APPEARED WITH T-SHIRTS BEARING 
AZAPO (BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS) OR PAM/PAC (AFRICANIST) LOGOS 
WERE SUMMARILY TOLD TO REVERSE THE SHIRT OR GO HOME. 
 
7.  POLICE AT TIMES SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO PROVOKE A 
CONFLICT AS THEIR VEHICLES SPED RECKLESSLY THROUGH THE 
THRONGS OF PROTESTERS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  THE PEOPLE, 
WHO HAD BEEN WARNED AGAINST SUCH PROVOCATIONS BY COMMUNITY 
LEADERS RETREATED TO NEARBY YARDS TO AVOID INJURY. 
 
------- 
TEMBISA 
------- 
 
8.  VIOLENCE ERUPTED IN TEMBISA (OUTSIDE JOHANNESBURG) 
DURING A FEBRUARY 5 PROTEST CALLED BY LOCAL MASS 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT LEADERS.  A PETITION DELIVERED TO 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED FOR AN END TO THE STATE OF 
EMERGENCY AND RESTRICTION ORDERS ON 20 TEMBISA ACTIVISTS, 
LOWER RENTAL RATES, AND THE RESIGNATION OF THREE SECONDARY 
SCHOOL PRINCIPALS.  APPARENTLY, YOUNG DEMONSTRATORS 
ATTACKED NON-PARTICIPANTS IN THE ANNOUNCED STAYAWAY, WHICH 
BROUGHT RETALIATORY POLICE ACTION.  SEVEN PEOPLE WERE 
SERIOUSLY INJURED BY POLICE TEARGAS CANISTERS AND 
BIRDSHOT. 
 
--------- 
GARANKUWA 
--------- 
 
9.  ABOUT 70,000 PEOPLE ON FEBRUARY 7 MARCHED TO LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN GARANKUWA, SOME 30 MILES NORTHWEST 
OF PRETORIA INSIDE BOPHUTHATSWANA.  THE PETITION LODGED BY 
COMMUNITY LEADERS FOCUSED AGAIN ON LOCAL GRIEVANCES (E.G., 
HIGH RENT AND SERVICES BILLS), BUT ALSO CALLED FOR THE 
RESIGNATION OF BOPHUTHATSWANA PRESIDENT MANGOPE\'S 
GOVERNMENT AND THE REINCORPORATION OF THE \"INDEPENDENT\" 
HOMELAND INTO SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
10.  AGAIN, CHARTERIST-ORIENTED GROUPS PROVIDED THE BULK 
OF MARCHERS, THOUGH A FEW STEVE BIKO (BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS) 
POSTERS COULD BE SEEN HELD HIGH.  THE BOPHUTHATSWANA 
POLICE, TOO, WERE PLAYING A FAMILIAR ROLE, TRYING 
(UNSUCCESSFULLY) TO SEAL OFF THE PROTEST ROUTE.  IN 
FRUSTRATION NEAR THE END OF A LONG DAY, SEVERAL GROUPS OF 
POLICE FIRED TEAR GAS AND BIRDSHOT INTO THE DISPERSING 
CROWD, HARMING AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE.  AT ANOTHER POINT 
A POLICE VEHICLE SPED INTO A GROUP KILLING ONE PERSON, AND 
SERIOUSLY INJURING SEVERAL OTHERS.  DESPITE THESE POLICE 
ACTIONS, THE DEMONSTRATION REMAINED GENERALLY PEACEFUL. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SOWETO CELEBRATION OF ANC UNBANNING 
----------------------------------- 
 
11.  EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVITED TO ATTEND THE UDF-AFFILIATED 
SOUTH AFRICAN YOUTH CONGRESS (SAYCO) RALLY IN SOWETO ON 
SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 11 TO CELEBRATE THE ANC\'S UNBANNING.  WE 
SUSPECT OTHER LOCATIONS WILL HAVE SIMILAR RALLIES IN THE 
DAYS AHEAD, BUILDING TO A CRESCENDO FOR MANDELA\'S RELEASE. 
 
---------------------------- 
COMMENT:  STEADY AS SHE GOES 
---------------------------- 
 
12.  THE TOWNSHIP MOBILIZATION TACTICS ADOPTED BY THE 
CHARTERIST-LED OPPOSITION ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN 
PRESSURE ON THE SAG IN THIS PERIOD OF NASCENT DIALOGUE. 
THESE ACTIONS HOLD SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR VIOLENT 
CONFRONTATION EITHER WITH THE AUTHORITIES OR, CONCEIVABLY, 
WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT.  SUCH A 
VIOLENT OUTBREAK, DEPENDING ON ITS SCALE, COULD DELAY THE 
SAG\'S TIMETABLE FOR TAKING ADDITIONAL STEPS TOWARD 
NEGOTIATION, LIKE THE RELEASE OF MANDELA AND THE LIFTING 
OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY.  YET, THESE MAY BE THE VERY 
MEASURES REQUIRED TO GET \"TALKS ABOUT TALKS\" OFF THE 
GROUND.  WHILE THE OPPOSITION PONDERS ITS RESPONSE TO DE 
KLERK\'S BREATH-TAKING PARLIAMENTARY SPEECH (SEPTEL), WE 
WONDER IF THE SAG ALSO FEELS THE SQUEEZE.  END COMMENT

         THWARTING THATCHER MEETING 
 
1.  (C) - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  NELSON MANDELA IS \"FURIOUS\" WITH TOP ADVISER 
ZWELAKHE SISULU FOR PERSUADING THE ANC LEADERSHIP TO 
VETO HIS PLANS TO MEET MARGARET THATCHER IN LONDON IN 
MID-APRIL, ACCORDING TO A CLOSE SISULU ASSOCIATE. 
GABU TUGWANA (PROTECT), SISULU\'S DEPUTY AT THE \"NEW 
NATION\" NEWSPAPER, TOLD USIS OFFICER APRIL 27 THAT 
SISULU HAD BEEN THE MOST PERSUASIVE SPEAKER AT THE 
ANC EXECUTIVE MEETING WHICH DECIDED THE ISSUE OF 
WHETHER TO MEET THATCHER.  WE UNDERSTAND MANDELA WAS 
KEEN FOR A THATCHER MEETING, BUT THAT SISULU ARGUED 
SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST IT. 
 
3.  SISULU, WHO HAS BEEN SECONDED FROM THE \"NATION\" 
TO WORK AS MANDELA\'S APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY, HAS ALSO 
DRAWN FIRE FROM ANC RANK AND FILE FOR HIS HANDLING OF 
MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE.  WE ARE REGULARLY SURPRISED AT 
HOW OPENLY ACTIVISTS DISPARAGE SISULU\'S MANAGEMENT OF 
MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE TO US.  TRANSKEI LEADER BANTU 
HOLOMISA BECAME SO FRUSTRATED BY DEALING WITH SISULU 
FOR MANDELA\'S VISIT THERE APRIL 21-27, HE TOLD US HE 
INSISTED ON COMPLETE CONTROL OF MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE AS 
THE PRICE FOR THE TRANSKEI GOVERNMENT\'S COOPERATION 
WITH THE VISIT.  SISULU RELENTED.  FOR OUR PART, 
SISULU HAS BEEN NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE IN ARRANGING 
MEETINGS BETWEEN MANDELA AND US OFFICIALS -- IT TOOK 
SEVEN WEEKS OF STEADY HOUNDING TO OBTAIN AN 
APPOINTMENT FOR AMBASSADOR SWING WITH MANDELA.  IN AN 
IRONIC TWIST, THE FORMERLY UNDEPENDABLE WINNIE HAS 
NOW BECOME ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE CHANNELS TO 
MANDELA. 
 
3.  COMMENT: TUGWANA\'S STORY ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS OVER 
THE THATCHER VISIT RINGS TRUE.  MANDELA HAS ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED HIS EAGERNESS FOR AN 
EARLY MEETING WITH THATCHER TO EXPRESS THE ANC\'S 
OBJECTIONS TO HER POLICY.  WE WERE CONSEQUENTLY 
SURPRISED WHEN THE MEETING DIDN\'T MATERIALIZE ON HIS 
MID-APRIL VISIT TO LONDON, AND SUSPECTED THAT ANC 
HARDLINERS HAD NIXED MANDELA\'S PLANS. 
 
4.  SISULU IS A MAN OF MANY TALENTS, AND WE DON\'T 
DOUBT HE HAS THE INTELLECTUAL FORTITUDE TO CONVINCE 
HIS SENIORS IN THE ANC OF ALMOST ANYTHING.  BUT THE 
OVERWHELMING JOB OF KEEPING MANDELA\'S APPOINTMENT 
BOOK IS TAKING ITS TOLL.  \"MANDELA NEEDS A GOVERNMENT 
AROUND HIM, NOT JUST ME, TO HANDLE HIS SCHEDULE,\" HE 
RECENTLY LAMENTED TO US.  WITH THE STILL TIGHT 
COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE IN THE MANDELA ENTOURAGE, 
SISULU\'S LACK OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACUMEN COULD PROVE A 
DISTINCT LIABILITY.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  IN A TWO HOUR MEETING WITH DCM MCCALLIE, ANC 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR THABO MBEKI OUTLINED 
DEVELOPMENTS IN ANC-INKATHA PEACE TALKS, CONTINUING SIGNS 
OF FOUL PLAY BY SECURITY FORCE ELEMENTS, AND THE STATUS OF 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SAG.  OF KEY IMPORTANCE, MBEKI SAID: 
 
  --  ANC AND INKATHA HAVE AGREED TO COOPERATE ON LOCAL 
PEACE TREATIES IN THE NATAL AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY 
VIOLENCE, LEADING TO A SUMMIT MEETING OF TOP OFFICIALS 
FROM EACH SIDE, INCLUDING MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI. 
 
  --  EVIDENCE, THOUGH NOT FIRM PROOF, CONTINUES TO 
SURFACE THAT ELEMENTS OF THE SECURITY FORCES ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING BLACK-ON-BLACK VIOLENCE; 
GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ACT AGAINST THESE ELEMENTS OR 
APPOINT A JUDICIAL ENQUIRY AGGRAVATES ANC MISTRUST. 
 
  --  THE ANC IS PREPARED TO EXPLORE CONSTITUTIONAL 
MATTERS WITH THE SAG IN THE APPROPRIATE WORKING GROUP, BUT 
THE SAG HAS STALLED THESE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL VIOLENCE IS 
DOWN AND MORE PROGRESS IS REGISTERED IN THE ARMED-ACTIONS 
WORKING GROUP. 
 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  DCM MCCALLIE AND POLOFF LUCAS CALLED ON ANC 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT CHIEF THABO MBEKI AND 
FELLOW NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (NEC) MEMBER AZIZ 
PAHAD OCTOBER 21 AT THE LATTER\'S TEMPORARY RESIDENCE IN 
MAYFAIR, JOHANNESBURG.  DURING THE TWO-HOUR DISCUSSION, 
THE DCM PRESENTED REF A DEMARCHE (WHICH HE INDICATED HAD 
ALSO BEEN DELIVERED TO BUTHELEZI - REF B) AND COVERED A 
RANGE OF OTHER TOPICS. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
NATAL PEACE:  WORKING FROM THE GROUND UP 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  IN RESPONSE TO OUR POINTS ON ENDING ANC-INKATHA 
CONFLICT, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT THE JOINT ANC-INKATHA 
COMMITTEE ON VIOLENCE HAD REACHED AGREEMENT TO PURSUE 
SERIATIM LOCAL PEACE TREATIES IN THE MOST VOLATILE AREAS 
OF NATAL AS A WAY OF LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A 
MANDELA-BUTHELEZI SUMMIT.  THE SIDES HAD AGREED, MBEKI 
CLAIMED, THAT A FAILED SUMMIT -- ONE WHICH DID NOTHING TO 
HALT THE VIOLENCE -- WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.  THE 
INKATHA DELEGATION, LED BY FRANK MDLALOSE, SEEMED 
GENUINELY COMMITTED TO THE PEACE PROCESS AND APPARENTLY 
HAD BUTHELEZI\'S FULL BLESSING.  FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF 
THE EMPANGENI (OR NORTHERN NATL) ACCORD, LOCAL AGREEMENTS 
WERE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED IN MPUMALANGA, NDWEDWE AND 
ELSEWHERE.  TYPICALLY, ANC AND INKATHA MEMBERS OF THE 
JOINT COMMITTEE WOULD TRAVEL TOGETHER TO THE AFFECTED 
AREAS, CALL TOGETHER LOCAL LEADERS FROM BOTH FACTIONS, AND 
HELP BROKER A PEACE TREATY. 
 
5.  MBEKI HOPED THIS PROCESS WOULD EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN 
HALTING VIOLENCE, BUT WARNED THAT PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND 
INKATHA SHOWED SIGNS OF DIVISION.  SOME ELEMENTS WISHED TO 
DERAIL THE ADMITTEDLY DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS.  INKATHA 
JOINT COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE SOMETIMES RELUCTANT TO DEFY 
THESE ELEMENTS OPENLY.  RUMORS HAD IT IN ONE CASE THAT 
BUTHELEZI HIMSELF INCITED LOCAL CHIEFS TO OPPOSE ANC PEACE 
INITIATIVES.  HARD WORK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE 
PROCESS ON TRACK AND SUSTAIN MOMENTUM, MBEKI SAID; BOTH 
SIDES NEEDED TO DESIGNATE OFFICIALS WHO COULD DEVOTE FULL 
TIME TO IT. 
 
6.  MBEKI SAID THIS PROGRESS ON THE GROUND WOULD HELP 
ENSURE A PRODUCTIVE SUMMIT MEETING.  THE (##) EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE (NEC) AND INKATHA\'S 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE INKATHA LEADERSHIP WAS NO LONGER 
INSISTING EXCLUSIVELY ON A ONE-ON-ONE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN 
MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI, NOR WAS MANDELA REFUSING TO MEET 
BUTHELEZI, MBEKI STATED.  DATES FOR THE AGREED GATHERING 
WOULD BE SET ONCE MANDELA RETURNS FROM ABROAD.  (NOTE: 
REF C REPORTS AN OCTOBER 22 ANC STATEMENT WHICH PROPOSES A 
MEETING OF TOP ANC AND INKATHA OFFICIALS, INCLUDING 
MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI, \"WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE.\"  END 
NOTE.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
REEF VIOLENCE:  SECURITY FORCE ELEMENTS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, MBEKI STOOD BY THE FAMILIAR 
ANC VIEW THAT \"ELEMENTS OF THE SECURITY FORCES\" ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING VIOLENCE IN REEF TOWNSHIPS.  \"WE 
ARE QUITE SURE THE VIOLENCE IS NOT SPONTANEOUS,\" HE SAID, 
BUT INSTIGATED IN ORDER TO \"DISCREDIT THE MOVEMENT AND 
WEAKEN THE ANC.\"  EVIDENCE INCRIMINATING WHITE POLICE 
OFFICERS, FORMER RENAMO AGENTS, AND CCB-STYLE OPERATIVES 
CONTINUES TO MOUNT.  INKATHA ELEMENTS, PROBABLY RECRUITED 
DIRECTLY BY SOUTH AFRICAN SECURITY SERVICES, ARE ALSO 
INVOLVED, MBEKI CLAIMED. 
 
8.  MBEKI ADMITTED THAT MOST LEADS IN ANC\'S POSSESSION 
COULD NOT PASS FOR PROOF IN A COURT OF LAW.  HE ARGUED, 
HOWEVER, THAT THE ANC -- IN ITS CURRENT \"UNDERSTAFFED, 
UNDERFINANCED\" STATE -- CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP SUCH 
INFORMATION.  ONLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO 
SO.  THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (NIS) CONCEDES THIS 
POINT, BUT LAW AND ORDER MINISTER VLOK AND HIS POLICE 
OFFICIALS STILL INSIST THAT THE ANC MUST PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION BEFORE THEY CAN ACT.  THIS ATTITUDE, TOGETHER 
WITH DE KLERK\'S REFUSAL TO LAUNCH A JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE CAUSES OF THE VIOLENCE, CREATES AN IMPRESSION IN 
ANC RANKS THAT PRETORIA HAS A HIDDEN AGENDA TO UNDERMINE 
ANC SUPPORT.  MBEKI WONDERED WHETHER THE SAG MIGHT ALSO 
FEAR REPERCUSSIONS FROM THE SECURITY FORCES IF STRONG 
ACTION IS TAKEN AGAINST ROGUE ELEMENTS.  HE LAMENTED THE 
FACT THAT ANC\'S SHORTAGE OF MANPOWER HAD PREVENTED THE 
ORGANIZATION FROM THOROUGHLY CANVASSING BLACK TOWNSHIP 
POLICEMEN, MANY OF WHOM HAVE INFORMATION ON THE IMPROPER 
ACTIVITIES OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. 
 
---------------------------- 
PROGRESS TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS WORKING GROUP.  ASKED WHEN THE 
ANC-SAG DIALOGUE WOULD BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE OTHER 
POLITICAL ACTORS, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT MUCH WORK STILL 
NEEDED TO BE DONE BILATERALLY.  THE SAG AGREES THAT A 
WORKING GROUP SHOULD CONSIDER CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS, BUT 
VILJOEN HAS DECLINED TO PURSUE THESE MATTERS BEYOND A 
SINGLE MEETING (WITH THABO MBEKI) WHICH DID NO MORE THAN 
SET AN AGENDA FOR ANC-SAG EXPLORATORY TALKS.  ACCORDING TO 
MBEKI, CONSTITUTIONAL PLANNING MINISTER VILJOEN HAS PLACED 
TWO CONDITIONS ON FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS:  A 
DECREASE IN VIOLENCE COUNTRYWIDE AND MORE PROGRESS IN THE 
ARMED-ACTIONS WORKING GROUP. 
 
10.  \"THE SAG HAS STALLED THE PROCESS,\" MBEKI ASSERTED, BY 
LINKING PROGRESS IN VARIOUS WORKING GROUPS.  THE ANC 
ARGUES THT THE DIFFERENT TRACKS SHOULD BE PURSUED 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, NOT SEQUENTIALLY.  THE ANC BELIEVES THE 
WORKING GROUP ON CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY 
TAKE UP CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND NEGOTIATION 
PROCESSES WITH A VIEW TO REPORTING AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND 
DISAGREEMENT TO THE NEXT ANC-SAG SUMMIT, \"GROOTE SCHUUR 
III.\"  THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN 
CONSTITUTIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE 
SELECTED NEEDS TO BE THRASHED OUT BEFORE THE TALKS CAN BE 
BROADENED. 
 
11.  ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP.  IN THIS FORUM, MBEKI 
COMPLAINED, THE SAG WAS ATTEMPTING TO CONVERT THE ANC\'S 
COMMITMENT TO SUSPEND ARMED ACTIONS INTO AN ABANDONMENT OF 
THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  PRETORIA CHOOSES TO INTERPRET \"ARMED 
ACTIONS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES\" (SEE THE PRETORIA MINUTE) 
VERY BROADLY TO INCLUDE RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING OF MK 
SOLDIERS.  FOR THE ANC\'S PART, IT IS WILLING TO END 
VIOLENT ACTS, INFILTRATION OF MEN AND ARMS, AND IN-COUNTRY 
TRAINING, BUT WOULD CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A FIGHTING FORCE 
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  FURTHER, THE ANC FEELS IT HAS NO 
OBLIGATION TO TURN OVER WEAPONS ALREADY STOCKPILED IN 
SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
12.  POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP.  MBEKI SAID 
PROBLEMS IN THE POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP ARE 
MANAGEABLE.  THE GROUP\'S FOLLOW-UP REPORT, DUE FOR RELEASE 
THIS WEEK, WOULD CLARIFY CERTAIN AMBIGUITIES, E.G., HOW TO 
APPLY FOR SUSPENSION OF POLITICAL TRIALS IN PROGRESS, AND 
WHO MUST COMPLETE THE EXILES\' QUESTIONNAIRE.  THERE IS 
ANC-SAG AGREEMENT THAT THE BULK OF SECURITY PRISONERS 
WOULD BE FREE BY YEAR\'S END; \"THERE SHOULD BE NO ONE ON 
ROBBEN ISLAND BY JANUARY 1,\" MBEKI SAID.  COMPLICATED 
SECURITY CASES, AND THOSE INVOLVING PUBLIC VIOLENCE FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS, WOULD BE REVIEWED BY COMMITTEE BEFORE 
THE END OF APRIL, ACCORDING TO THE PRETORIA MINUTE. 
 
13.  ON A PHILOSOPHICAL NOTE, MBEKI IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE 
OF MUCH ANC-SAG DISAGREEMENT AS A DIFFERENCE IN 
MIND-SETS.  THE ANC ASSUMES THAT ACCORDS REACHED BETWEEN 
THE TWO PARTIES SHOULD OVERRIDE EXISTING LAW.  MEANWHILE, 
THE SAG SEEMS INCLINED TO SEEK CHANGES IN ANC-SAG 
AGREEMENTS IF THEY COME INTO CONFLICT WITH STANDING 
LEGISLATION.  THUS, THOUGH THE ARMED-ACTIONS WORKING GROUP 
HAS BEEN MANDATED TO DISCUSS THE DISPOSITION OF ANC 
WEAPONRY, SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE STILL INSIST ON THE 
ILLEGALITY OF ARMS CACHES.  SIMILAR CONFUSION HAS ARISEN 
BECAUSE THE LAW STIPULATES THAT APPLICATIONS FOR INDEMNITY 
MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE PRESIDENT, YET THE 
POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP AGREED TO INDEMNIFY WHOLE 
CLASSES OF EXILES EN MASSE.  FINALLY, THE SAG INSISTS ON 
USHERING IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION THROUGH EXISTING 
GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES, WHILE THE ANC THINKS A GENERAL 
REFERENDUM WOULD SERVE TO LAUNCH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. 
IN ANY CASE, MBEKI SAID, DE KLERK SEEMS CONFIDENT THAT HE 
CAN WIN APPROVAL FOR THE RESULTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
NEGOTIATIONS, AND PREVENT THE RIGHT WING FROM BLOCKING AN 
AGREEMENT. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.  IN STARK CONTRAST TO BUTHELEZI\'S DEFENSIVENESS (REF 
B), MBEKI\'S RESPONSE TO OUR INTEREST IN ANC-INKATHA 
RAPPROCHEMENT WAS A DISPASSIONATE, UPBEAT EXPLANATION OF 
ONGOING EFFORTS, SPRINKLED WITH WARNINGS ABOUT THE 
DELICACY AND VULNERABILITY OF THE PROCESS.  WE AGREE THAT 
PROGRESS TOWARD PEACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL IMPROVE 
PROSPECTS FOR A FRUITFUL SUMMIT AND BELIEVE A CAREFULLY 
TIMED JOINT MEETING OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES, LED BY 
BUTHELEZI AND MANDELA, COULD BE PRODUCTIVE. 
 
15.  MBEKI\'S SUGGESTION THAT THE SAG HAS INTRODUCED 
LINKAGE INTO THE WORKING GROUP EXERCISE MERITS 
INVESTIGATION.  IF TRUE, IT IS IRONIC THAT AS THE ANC 
MOVES AWAY FROM THE RIGID, SEQUENTIAL PROGRAM OUTLINED IN 
THE HARARE DECLARATION, THE SAG MAY HAVE BECOME LESS 
FLEXIBLE IN ITS APPROACH TO THE JOINT WORKING GROUPS. 
 
16.  CONSISTENT WITH ITS SELF-IMAGE AS THE PRIME 
OPPOSITION FORCE, THE ANC PROBABLY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE 
LARGEST POSSIBLE AREA OF AGREEMENT WITH THE SAG ON 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES BEFORE OTHER PARTIES JOIN THE 
DISCUSSION.  THE SAG, ON THE OTHER HAND, MIGHT NOW WISH TO 
LIMIT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DIALOGUE UNTIL OTHER PARTIES 
CLOSER TO PRETORIA\'S THINKING ARE BROUGHT ON BOARD.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  THE SAG-ANC RELATIONSHIP: A YEAR END PERSPECTIVE 
 
1. C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
------------------------ 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
------------------------ 
 
2.  A NEW MOOD OF UNCERTAINTY HAS SETTLED OVER SOUTH 
AFRICA FOLLOWING A YEAR OF UNPRECEDENTED POLITICAL 
CHANGE.  AFTER A PROMISING START, NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN 
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ANC HAVE BOGGED DOWN.  DISTRUST 
HAS DEEPENED, FUELED BY ANC SUSPICIONS THAT THE SAG IS 
TRYING TO PROFIT FROM ESCALATING TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE. 
FOR ITS PART, THE SAG BLAMES THE LACK OF MOVEMENT 
TOWARDS CONSTITUTIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ON THE ANC\'S LACK 
OF ORGANIZATION AND ON DIVISIONS INSIDE THE MOVEMENT. 
 
3.  THESE PROBLEMS ARE MANAGEABLE PROVIDED THE TWO 
SIDES DEVELOP A RENEWED SENSE OF URGENCY AND COMMON 
PURPOSE EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR.  THAT IMPERATIVE IS 
UNDERSTOOD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE ANC AND THE 
SAG, WE BELIEVE.  AT LOWER LEVELS THE PERSPECTIVE IS 
LESS CLEAR.  MANY ANC MILITANTS BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
CONCEDED A GREAT DEAL, ESPECIALLY IN AGREEING TO 
SUSPEND THE ARMED STRUGGLE, AND OBTAINED LITTLE FROM 
GOVERNMENT IN THE TALKS THUS FAR:  E.G., THE PRISONERS 
ARE STILL NOT FREE, THE EXILES NOT YET HOME, AND 
UNPRECEDENTED LARGESCALE VIOLENCE IS CONTINUING. 
THE \"COMRADES\" ARE DEMANDING A MORE AGGRESSIVE ANC 
STANCE IN THE YEAR AHEAD.  IN THE SAG THERE ARE 
ELEMENTS EAGER TO EXPLOIT SUPPOSED SCHISMS IN THE 
ANC-SACP-COSATU ALLIANCE.  OTHERS APPEAR READY TO CAST 
ABOUT FOR DIFFERENT BLACK INTERLOCUTORS AND NEGOTIATE 
A NEW CONSTITUTION WITH THEM REGARDLESS OF THE ANC. 
 
4.  BOTH SIDES CAN TAKE SOME SMALL COMFORT PERHAPS IN 
THAT EXTREMIST CHALLENGES FAILED TO MATERIALIZE IN 
1990.  TO THE RIGHT, THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS LOSING 
GROUND.  THE PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS (PAC) DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO BE PULLING MILITANTS AWAY FROM THE ANC AS 
MANY PREDICTED IT WOULD.  WHILE THERE IS PROMISE FOR 
PROGRESS IN 1991, THE YEAR IS ENDING ON A LESS 
OPTIMISTIC NOTE THAN THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY 1990 MIGHT 
HAVE LED ONE TO EXPECT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------- 
DE KLERK\'S THREE-PRONGED OFFENSIVE 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  THREE DISTINCT PROCESSES WERE EITHER INITIATED OR 
INTENSIFIED BY DE KLERK IN 1990: 
 
-- POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION.  THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC 
AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF 
EMERGENCY, THE REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY, AND THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA AND MANY 
POLITICAL DETAINEES COMPLETELY CHANGED THE NATURE OF 
SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS.  DE KLERK HAS, IN EFFECT, 
GIVEN THE ANC, THE SACP, THE PAC AND OTHERS 
UNPRECEDENTED ROOM TO MANUEVER -- AND TO COMMIT 
MISTAKES -- WHILE REAPING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION 
FOR HIS BOLD REFORMISM.  CONTROL OF THE LIBERALIZATION 
AGENDA, AND THE CONTENT AND TIMING OF REFORMS, HAS 
REMAINED ENTIRELY IN GOVERNMENT\'S HANDS. 
 
-- THE SCRAPPING OF APARTHEID.  HERE TOO DE KLERK HAS 
DICTATED THE PACE OF REFORM.  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT 
BY MID-1991 ALL THE MAIN PILLARS OF APARTHEID, 
POSSIBLY EVEN THE POPULATION REGISTRATION ACT, WILL 
HAVE BEEN LEGISLATED OUT OF EXISTENCE.  WHITES HAVE 
ADJUSTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED (SO FAR, AT LEAST) TO 
THE REMOVAL OF RACIAL BARRIERS, ALTHOUGH 1991 IS 
LIKELY TO SEE EFFORTS TOWARD LOCAL AND INFORMAL FORMS 
OF DISCRIMINATION. 
 
-- NEGOTIATIONS FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION.  AT THE 
PRETORIA SUMMIT AUGUST 6, THE SAG AND ANC DELEGATIONS 
DECLARED THAT THE WAY WAS OPEN FOR THE START OF 
SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
THEREAFTER, THE SAG-ANC DIALOGUE BOGGED DOWN, AND FOR 
THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE SAG HAS VACILLATED BETWEEN 
DIALOGUE WITH THE ANC AND MEASURES TO WEAKEN THE ANC. 
DE KLERK CAN PRESS FORWARD ON REFORM AND LIBERALIZE 
UNILATERALLY IN 1991, BUT HE WILL AT SOME POINT COME 
UNDER PRESSURE TO BEGIN SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS, 
EVEN WITHOUT ANC PARTICIPATION (WHICH IN OUR VIEW 
WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR).  THE ANC WILL CLAIM 
NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL PRE-CONDITIONS AND 
\"STUMBLING BLOCKS\" HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND, IN THIS 
RESPECT, HAS GIVEN THE SAG UNTIL APRIL 30 TO REMOVE 
THEM.  IF THEY ARE NOT REMOVED, THE ANC HAS SAID IT 
WILL RECONSIDER ITS COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATIONS AND THE 
SUSPENSION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE. 
 
------------------------ 
NEGOTIATIONS BOGGED DOWN 
------------------------ 
 
6.  IT IS THE STALLED NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WHICH MOST 
WORRIES OBSERVERS.  BEHIND IT LIES AN EROSION OF TRUST 
BETWEEN SAG AND ANC NEGOTIATORS AND, TO A LESSER 
EXTENT PERHAPS, BETWEEN MANDELA AND DE KLERK 
PERSONALLY.  THIS EROSION BEGAN IN AUGUST AND IS 
CONTINUING.  IT IS LINKED TO THE TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE, 
WHICH MOST ANC LEADERS FIRMLY BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT 
IS EXPLOITING FOR ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS.  MANDELA NOW 
CLAIMS THERE IS A SAG \"DOUBLE AGENDA\" -- NEGOTIATIONS 
TO PLACATE PUBLIC OPINION COUPLED WITH A CONSPIRACY TO 
DIVIDE AND WEAKEN THE ANC.  FROM A SAG PERSPECTIVE, 
THE PROBLEM IS THE ANC\'S DISORGANIZATION, ITS 
INABILITY TO CONTROL ITS FOLLOWERS AND, ULTIMATELY, 
ITS RELUCTANCE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND STICK WITH THEM. 
RESTORING A MEASURE OF COMMON PURPOSE AND INSTILLING A 
NEW SENSE OF URGENCY WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN THE EARLY 
MONTHS OF 1991 IF THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS IS TO BE 
KEPT ON TRACK. 
 
7.  MODERATES ON BOTH SIDES REALIZE THAT THERE IS NO 
LONG-RUN ALTERNATIVE TO NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT 
POWER-SHARING.  THERE IS NO \"RETURN TO THE LAAGER\" 
OPTION FOR WHITE SOUTH AFRICA.  THERE IS NO REAL ARMED 
STRUGGLE OPTION FOR THE ANC.  IN THAT SENSE, POLITICAL 
CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA IS TRULY IRREVERSIBLE. 
 
8.  WHAT HAS BECOME LESS CLEAR IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF 
1990 IS WHETHER THE SOUTH AFRICA\'S TWO MAIN PLAYERS 
WILL RE-ENGAGE PROMPTLY IN EARLY 1991 OR WHETHER THE 
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON HOLD.  FOR 
THE ANC, RIDDLED WITH ORGANIZATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND 
CONSTITUENT PROBLEMS, THERE WILL BE A STRONG EFFORT TO 
REFOCUS ITS RESOURCES ON REBUILDING ITS NEGLECTED TIES 
TO GRASSROOTS SUPPORTERS AND PROMOTING BLACK UNITY, 
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE WEEKEND\'S CONSULTATIVE 
CONFERENCE.  \"MASS ACTION\" PROTEST WILL FIGURE 
PROMINENTLY IN SUCH A STRATEGY.  MANY IN THE ANC, AND 
MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE SACP, APPEAR TO BELIEVE THAT 
SUCH MUSCLE-FLEXING IS ESSENTIAL IF THE ANC IS TO HAVE 
ANY CLOUT AT ALL AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  THE SAG, 
FOR ITS PART, WILL DEMAND THAT THE ANC DISTANCE ITSELF 
FROM BOYCOTTS, STRIKES AND STAYAWAYS WHICH HAVE 
VIOLENT POTENTIAL.  IF A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION CAN BE 
ENGENDERED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANC ACTION COULD BE 
CHANNELED THOUGHTFULLY INTO PEACEFUL MASS 
DEMONSTRATIONS, ALLOWING THE ANC TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE 
AND PLACE PRESSURE ON THE SAG, WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE 
PROCESS.  BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE ENORMOUS RESTRAINT ON 
BOTH SIDES. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
NO REAL CHALLENGE TO THE NATS AND THE ANC 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  DESPITE THESE UNCERTAINTIES, BOTH THE ANC AND SAG 
HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMPORTANT SUCCESS TO CELEBRATE AS 
THE YEAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE.  POLITICAL THREATS FROM 
BOTH THE FAR RIGHT AND FROM THE FAR LEFT PROVED MUCH 
LESS FORMIDABLE THAN ORIGINALLY FEARED.  THIS VICTORY, 
UNFORTUNATELY, IS PARTLY OFFSET BY UNPRECEDENTED 
VIOLENCE. 
 
10.  A SERIOUS CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHALLENGE TO DE 
KLERK HAS YET TO MATERIALIZE.  CP LEADERS HAVE FAILED 
TO COME UP WITH PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO DE KLERK\'S 
REFORMS.  OCTOBER POLLS SHOW THE CP SLIPPING BACK TO 
ONLY 25 PERCENT OF THE WHITE VOTE WHILE THE NATIONAL 
PARTY SUPPORT ROSE TO SLIGHTLY OVER 50 PERCENT.  IN A 
PINCH, DE KLERK COULD PROBABLY COUNT ON THE BACKING OF 
ALMOST ALL THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY VOTES.  HIS 
POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE WHITE ELECTORATE, AND WITHIN 
THE NATIONAL PARTY, IS STRONGER THAN EVER. 
 
11.  SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CLAIMS 
THAT THE ANC IS LOSING SUPPORT TO MORE MILITANT BLACK 
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LEFT SUCH AS THE PAC.  WHILE THE 
ANC HAS DOUBTLESS LOST SOME SUPPORT (RECENT 
INDEPENDENT AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED POLLS BOTH 
INDICATE THAT BLACK SUPPORT FOR THE ANC HAS SOFTENED 
CONSIDERABLY), THESE APPEAR TO BE LOSSES TO APATHY OR 
INDIFFERENCE, NOT DEFECTIONS TO THE PAC.  DESPITE 
THESE SETBACKS, THE ANC\'S PRE-EMINENCE AMONG 
OPPOSITION GROUPS REMAINS UNQUESTIONED.  MOREOVER, ANC 
LOSSES CAN BE MADE UP QUICKLY.  OPTIMAL FROM MANDELA\'S 
POINT OF VIEW WOULD BE A STRATEGY WHICH TRANSFORMS 
PEACEFUL MASS ACTION INTO INCREASED LEVERAGE AT THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
 
---------------------------- 
SAG SCORES IN WORLD CAPITALS 
---------------------------- 
 
12.  IN ONE CRITICAL AREA IN 1990, SAG GAINS WERE ANC 
LOSSES.  FOR MANY YEARS THE DIPLOMATIC QUARANTINE OF 
SOUTH AFRICA BY MOST OF THE THE THIRD WORLD AND 
COMMUNIST BLOC WAS A KEY INGREDIENT IN 
ANC-ORCHESTRATED PRESSURE ON PRETORIA.  IN 1990 THE 
QUARANTINE CRUMBLED.  THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS CLAIMS IT IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MANY 
CONTACT OPPORTUNITIES ON OFFER.  THE LOSS OF ITS VETO 
OVER MANY FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL CONTACT WITH PRETORIA 
IS A BLOW TO THE ANC.  THE LIFTING OF AT LEAST SOME 
SANCTIONS BY WESTERN DEMOCRACIES IS AN INEVITABLE NEXT 
STEP IN 1991, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE WEEKEND\'S EC 
DECISION TO LIFT THE BAN ON INVESTMENT IN SOUTH 
AFRICA.  THE ANC HAS NOT MOVED DECISIVELY TO SET NEW 
TERMS UNDER WHICH IT WOULD APPROVE A LIFTING OF 
SANCTIONS, AN OMISSION WHICH FURTHER REDUCES ITS 
LEVERAGE WITH THE SAG.  (OLIVER TAMBO WAS OBVIOUSLY 
AWARE OF THIS WHEN HE ASKED THE ANC CONSULTATIVE 
CONFERENCE TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE SANCTIONS ISSUE, BUT 
THE MILITANT ASSEMBLY, WEARLY OF TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE AND 
DISTRUSTFUL OF THE SAG, REJECTED ANY SUGGESTION OF 
LIFTING SANCTIONS.) 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  NO ONE EXPECTED THE SAG AND ANC TO BE ON A QUICK 
AND STRAIGHT COURSE TOWARDS POWER-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS 
BY THE END OF 1990.  THE LOSS OF BOTH MOMENTUM AND A 
CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION IS NEVERTHELESS A 
DISAPPOINTMENT.  IF THIS DEADLOCK PERSISTS BEYOND 
MID-1991, THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THAT THIS UNEASY 
PARTNERSHIP WILL TURN OPENLY CONFRONTATIONAL.  THE 
MAIN REASON FOR OPTIMISM IS THAT NEITHER THE SAG NOR 
THE ANC HAS ANY PLAUSIBLE LONG-TERM OPTION OTHER THAN 
NEGOTIATIONS.  WE STILL BELIEVE THEY WILL SEIZE THIS 
OPTION, BUT THE WAY AHEAD WILL BE ROUGH.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: THE ANC\'S THABO MBEKI AND CHRIS HANI 
 
REF:  STATE 67418 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  WE APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS IN 
REFTEL.  WE SHOULD SAY UP FRONT THAT WE DO NOT INTERACT 
MUCH WITH CHRIS HANI, WHO PREFERS TO LEAVE DIPLOMATIC 
CONTACTS TO OTHERS.  NOR DO WE OFTEN SEE MBEKI AND HANI 
TOGETHER, EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL ASSEMBLAGE OF NEC 
MEMBERS ON SOME PUBLIC PLATFORM.  WE HAVE NOT HEARD EITHER 
MAN REFER IN ANY WAY TO THE OTHER, NOR HAVE WE SEEN THE 
TWO FRATERNIZING AT THE HECTIC ANC HEADQUARTERS OR 
ELSEWHERE.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH MEN ARE 
EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG PERSONALITIES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION 
AND AMONG THE TOP FEW \"MOVERS AND SHAKERS\" IN THE 
LEADERSHIP. 
 
3.  IF MBEKI AND HANI (BOTH 48) STILL HAVE A CLOSE 
FRIENDSHIP, WE WOULD BE SURPRISED.  THOUGH CONTEMPORARIES 
FROM TRANSKEI, MANY OTHER FACTORS MILITATE AGAINST A 
SMOOTH RELATIONSHIP, NOT LEAST THEIR DIVERGENT FUNCTIONS 
WITHIN THE ANC.  NOR COULD EITHER OF THEM BE OBLIVIOUS TO 
THE INTENSE PUBLIC SPECULATION -- WHICH IS ALREADY GEARING 
UP AGAIN IN ANTICIPATION OF THE JUNE ANC ELECTIONS -- OVER 
WHICH OF THE TWO WILL ONE DAY MOVE INTO THE PREMIER 
POSITION.  WHILE THE HANI-MBEKI LINK MAY NOT BE WARM, WE 
SUSPECT BOTH MEN REALIZE THE OVERRIDING NEED TO MANAGE THE 
RELATIONSHIP, FOR NOW AT LEAST, FOR THE SAKE OF THE 
ORGANIZATION. 
 
4.  MBEKI IS THE CONSUMMATE DIPLOMAT WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE 
LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOREOGRAPHING THE OVERALL POLICY 
SHIFT AWAY FROM THE ARMED STRUGGLE TO NEGOTIATIONS IN 
RECENT YEARS.  HE IS RUMORED TO BE AMONG THE FIRST AND 
MOST PERSUASIVE NEC MEMBERS TO ARGUE IN FAVOR OF 
SUSPENDING ARMED ACTIONS LAST AUGUST.  IN MAKING HIS 
ARGUMENTS, MBEKI NO DOUBT HAD TO MARSHAL CRITICAL 
ASSESSMENTS OF THE EFFICACY OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  HANI 
WOULD LIKELY HAVE VIEWED SUCH REMARKS AS BORDERING ON 
CRITICISM OF HIS OWN EFFORTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. 
 
5.  WHILE HANI NO DOUBT SUPPORTS OFFICIAL ANC POLICY, HE 
SKIRTS VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ROLE 
OF UMKHONTO WE SIZWE (MK).  MANY OF HIS PUBLIC REMARKS, 
WHICH THE SAG CONSIDERS INFLAMMATORY AND CONTRARY TO THE 
SPIRIT OF ANC-SAG AGREEMENTS, COULD ONLY COMPLICATE 
THABO\'S JOB OF MOVING TALKS FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY.  HANI\'S 
HANDLING OF THE ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP, WHICH HE 
CHAIRED, LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED -- THOUGH, GRANTED, HE 
HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TASK.  HANI FAILED TO SHOW UP FOR 
SOME JOINT WORKING GROUP MEETINGS, EVEN AFTER HIS DISPUTED 
INDEMNITY STATUS WAS RESOLVED.  HIS ANC COLLEAGUES WERE 
SOMETIMES AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN HIS ABSENCE TO US.  MBEKI 
WOULD REGARD SUCH BEHAVIOR AS IRRESPONSIBLE AND DAMAGING 
TO THE OVERALL NEGOTIATIONS STRATEGY. 
 
6.  TWO POLITICAL STYLES COULD HARDLY DIFFER MORE THAN 
MBEKI\'S AND HANI\'S.  MBEKI TAKES A DISPASSIONATE, REASONED 
APPROACH TO ISSUES WHICH HE PRESENTS IN UNDERSTATED 
TERMS.  HIS AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH SAG OFFICIALS, CAPTAINS 
OF INDUSTRY, WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN OPINION LEADERS, FOREIGN 
ENVOYS, ETC. IS SECOND ONLY TO MANDELA\'S.  WHEN THE DEPUTY 
PRESIDENT TRAVELS ABROAD WITHOUT MBEKI, THE LATTER APPEARS 
TO BE IN CHARGE OF ISSUES RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. 
MANDELA WILL OFTEN PHONE MBEKI FROM OVERSEAS TO CHECK ON 
DEVELOPMENTS. 
 
7.  MBEKI DOES NOT DEVOTE MUCH OF HIS TIME TO STUMPING 
AMONG THE BLACK POPULATION.  HE RARELY FEATURES AT MASS 
RALLIES AND DOES NOT, INSOFAR AS WE CAN TELL, ATTEMPT TO 
CULTIVATE A CONSTITUENCY IN HIS HOME AREA (TRANSKEI) OR 
ANYWHERE ELSE.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE MBEKI\'S FAILURE TO 
BUILD GRASSROOTS POLITICAL SUPPORT DAMAGES HIS APPEAL WITH 
THE MASSES AND COULD HURT HIM IN HIS EVENTUAL BID FOR THE 
TOP JOB (BUT WE ARE NOT CONVINCED).  WE HAVE HEARD LOWER 
LEVEL ANC OFFICIALS REMARK THAT MBEKI\'S ASSOCIATION WITH 
EFFORTS TO SOFTEN THE ANC SANCTIONS POSITION AT THE 
DECEMBER CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE HAS HURT HIM WITH THE 
PARTY RANK AND FILE. 
 
8.  HANI IS MORE A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.  HE GENERALLY STAYS 
OUT OF THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS (EXCEPT AS CHAIR OF THE 
ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP WHERE HE REPORTEDLY DOES A 
GOOD JOB WHEN HE PARTICIPATES).  HE ESCHEWS CONTACTS WITH 
DIPLOMATS, JOURNALISTS, BUSINESSMEN ETC., YET APPEARS 
OFTEN ON PUBLIC PLATFORMS IN THE TOWNSHIPS WEARING 
QUASI-COMBAT FATIGUES AND DELIVERING FIERY SPEECHES THAT 
AROUSE AND DELIGHT THE AUDIENCE.  HANI MAY WELL CULTIVATE 
THIS RADICAL IMAGE TO SOME EXTENT, AND WITTINGLY ALLOW 
HIMSELF TO BE USED BY THE ANC AS A FOIL AGAINST THE PAC\'S 
EFFORT TO WIN THE SOUL OF THE TOWNSHIP YOUTH. 
 
9.  HANI SPENDS ALOT OF TIME IN TRANSKEI, HIS BIRTHPLACE, 
WHERE WITH GENERAL HOLOMISA\'S PERMISSION HE RESIDES IN THE 
NOW-VACATED PRIME MINISTER\'S RESIDENCE AND OFTEN ADDRESSES 
CROWDS THERE.  HIS REPEATED REFERENCES TO MK AND ITS ROLE 
IN KEEPING THE SAG HONEST ENDEAR HIM TO THE MORE RADICAL 
ELEMENTS OF THE MOVEMENT.  HANI WAS SELECTED TO DELIVER 
THE HARD-HITTING GENERAL RESOLUTION AT THE DECEMBER 
CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE, WHERE THE RANK AND FILE PRIVATELY 
BLASTED THE LEADERSHIP FOR SUSPENDING THE ARMED STRUGGLE 
WITHOUT GETTING MUCH IN RETURN FROM THE SAG. 
 
10.  HANI\'S UNDERGROUND WORK IN THE COUNTRY, HIS ALLEGED 
PARTICIPATION IN COMBAT ALONGSIDE ZAPU AGAINST SMITH\'S 
RHODESIAN ARMY, AND HIS NARROW ESCAPE FROM MORE THAN ONE 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT HAVE TAKEN ON LEGENDARY PROPORTIONS 
IN THE TOWNSHIPS.  AGAIN, MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT HANI 
WOULD TROUNCE MBEKI IF THERE WERE A POPULAR VOTE AMONG ANC 
SUPPORTERS.  THE MEDIA HERE SOMETIMES SUGGESTS HANI IS 
UNABASHEDLY PROMOTING HIS OWN ASCENT TO ANC LEADERSHIP, 
BUT HOLOMISA -- WHO KNOWS HANI WELL -- SCOFFS AT 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HANI IS POWER-HUNGRY.  HOLOMISA BELIEVES 
HANI\'S APPOINTMENT TO THE SACP\'S INTERNAL LEADERSHIP GROUP 
VIRTUALLY RULES HIM OUT OF CONTENTION FOR THE TOP ANC 
POSITION.  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ANC-SACP ALLIANCE, 
HOLOMISA REASONS, WILL NEVER GO TO AN OFFICIAL FROM THE 
SMALLER PARTY (I.E., THE SACP), AND HANI MUST HAVE 
REALIZED THIS FACT WHEN HE ACCEPTED HIS SACP POSITION LAST 
YEAR. 
 
11.  MBEKI IS SAID TO HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANC 
PRESIDENT OLIVER TAMBO, WHO MADE THABO HIS POLITICAL 
SECRETARY IN 1978.  WE HAVE NOT, HOWEVER, OBSERVED ANY 
PARTICULAR WARMTH IN THE MBEKI-MANDELA RELATIONSHIP, BUT 
CLEARLY MANDELA HAS ENTRUSTED A GREAT DEAL TO THABO.  HANI 
DOES STAY AT THE MANDELA RESIDENCE WHEN HE IS IN THIS 
AREA, BUT WE BELIEVE THIS PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT 
HE IS A FAVORITE OF WINNIE\'S.  HE FREQUENTLY JOINS HER ON 
THE PLATFORM AT MASS RALLIES WHERE BOTH ARE ASKED TO 
SPEAK, AND HE OFTEN ACCOMPANIES HER TO TRIAL IN 
JOHANNESBURG. 
 
12.  BOTH HANI AND MBEKI ARE UNIVERSITY EDUCATED WITH AN 
INTELLECTUAL BENT AND HAVE UNDERGONE MILITARY TRAINING. 
SAG OFFICIALS HAVE REMARKED PARTICULARLY ON HANI\'S ABILITY 
TO DEBATE THE FINE POINTS OF THE CLASSICS.  THE LATEST 
\"WHO\'S WHO\" BY SHELAGH GASTROW NOTES THAT HANI ROSE TO THE 
ANC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN 1974 (AT THE AGE OF 
32), WHILE MBEKI WAS APPOINTED IN 1975. 
 
13.  IN MANY WAYS, HANI AND MBEKI PERSONIFY AND EPITOMIZE 
THE TWO FACES OF THE ANC.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD 
SPECULATION THAT THE TWO ARE AMBITIOUS RIVALS, WE HAVE NO 
CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THIS IS THE CASE.  IF A RIVALRY 
EXISTS, NEITHER MAN GAINS FROM PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF IT. 
FOR NOW, WE WOULD EXPECT HANI AND MBEKI TO CONCENTRATE ON 
THEIR RESPECTIVE PORTFOLIOS WHILE KEEPING ANY LEADERSHIP 
ASPIRATIONS THEY MAY HAVE CAREFULLY UNDER WRAPS.

REFLECTS ON THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON ANC INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
DIRECTOR AND SENIOR NEGOTIATOR THABO MBEKI APRIL 23 TO 
OBTAIN A READOUT ON THE STATE OF PLAY IN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS.  MBEKI WAS CONFIDENT THAT AGREEMENT CAN BE 
REACHED ON A DATE CERTAIN FOR ELECTIONS BY THE END OF 
MAY.  THE SAG\'S PROPOSAL OF EARLY FEBRUARY 1994 WOULD 
GIVE NO HEARTBURN TO THE ANC.  REGARDING THE TRANSITIONAL 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (TEC), HE WAS LESS SANGUINE, NOTING 
THAT VIRTUALLY NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON THE SUBCOUNCILS 
FOR PUBLIC FINANCE, LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT AND 
THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING PROBLEMS ON SECURITY FORCES 
OVERSIGHT.  HE COMPLAINED OF A PERCEPTION, FANNED BY 
ELEMENTS IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT, THAT THE ANC 
LEADERSHIP IS NOT IN CONTROL OF A PRO-INSURRECTION 
FACTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  THAT PERCEPTION, 
COMMUNICATED AS FACT IN ANALYSES REACHING DE KLERK\'S 
DESK, MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CUT A DEAL ON THE TRANSITION 
WITH THE SAG, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PRESSURE IS ON TO DO 
SO. 
 
3.  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT IF THE SAG IS WORRIED 
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE MODERATES TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP 
IN THE ANC, IT CAN DO NO BETTER THAN MAKE THE NEGOTIATING 
PROCESS CREDIBLE TO THE MAJORITY, THUS STRENGTHENING THE 
POSITION OF ANC MODERATES.  MBEKI ALSO WORRIED ABOUT HOW 
TO DEAL WITH THE CONCERNED SOUTH AFRICANS GROUP (COSAG), 
PARTICULARLY THE INKATHA FREEDOM PARTY, WHICH HAS NOT YET 
BOUGHT INTO THE GAMEPLAN OF A CONSTITUTION DRAFTED BY AN 
ELECTED BODY.  AMBASSADOR ADVISED THE ANC TO PROPOSE A 
REASONABLE SETTLEMENT ON REGIONALISM, SHORED UP BY THE 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  SUCH A SOLUTION WOULD WEAKEN ANY 
REASON FOR THEIR WALKING OUT. 
 
4.  WE FOUND MBEKI GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE 
NEGOTIATIONS WOULD ADHERE TO THE ENVISAGED TIME FRAMES, 
BUT CONCERNED THAT THE SAG MAY LOOK FOR WAYS TO BACKTRACK 
ON COMMITMENTS AS THE DEADLINE FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION 
APPROACHES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ELECTION DATE NOT A PROBLEM BUT MAJORITY RULE? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  MBEKI LED OFF BY SHOWING AMBASSADOR A SAG PROPOSAL 
FOR THE SHAPE OF THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT.  MBEKI POINTED 
OUT THAT IT APPEARED REASONABLE AFTER A CURSORY 
EXAMINATION, EXCEPT FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE COUNCIL OF 
LEADERS.  THAT NEW BODY, A SORT OF SUPER CABINET 
CONSISTING OF THE LEADERS OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL 
PARTIES IN THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY (GONU), WOULD 
TAKE DECISIONS ON MAJOR POLICIES BY MAJORITY VOTE, EACH 
LEADER HAVING ONE VOTE.  THE NET EFFECT IS TO LESSEN THE 
POWER OF THE CABINET AND THE VALUE OF THE PROPORTIONAL 
ELECTORAL STRENGTH OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  THE ANC, WHILE 
NOT OPPOSED TO SOME SORT OF COUNCIL, WILL HAVE TO SEEK 
MODIFICATION OF BOTH ITS DEGREE OF AUTHORITY AND 
PROCEDURE. 
 
6.  ON THE ISSUE OF A DATE FOR ELECTIONS, MBEKI FORESEES 
NO PROBLEM.  THE TWO PRESIDENTS, MANDELA AND DE KLERK, 
MET IN MARCH AND AGREED TO USE THE MONTH OF APRIL TO 
PERSUADE THEIR RESPECTIVE ALLIES OF THE NEED TO MOVE ON 
THIS QUESTION.  THE SAG HAS PROPOSED A DATE IN EARLY 
FEBRUARY 1994, TO WHICH THE ANC AND ITS ALLIES CAN AGREE. 
MBEKI IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE IFP, WHICH HAS A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT SCENARIO FOR WHEN ELECTIONS SHOULD TAKE PLACE. 
AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT BOTH SAG AND ANC WORK ON THE 
IFP TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.  HE ADDED THAT, AS BUTHELEZI 
TRAVELS TO LONDON THE FOLLOWING WEEK, THE ANC MIGHT 
SUGGEST THE BRITISH PRESS HIM AS WELL. 
 
---------------------------------- 
TEC: PLENTY OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  \"IT SEEMS PEOPLE FORGOT CODESA\'S DECISIONS,\" MBEKI 
MUSED IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ABOUT THE STATE 
OF AGREEMENT ON THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE TEC. 
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE LAST YEAR ON THE SUBCOUNCIL 
DEALING WITH PUBLIC FINANCE.  CONFUSION REIGNS ON THE 
FUNCTION OF A SUBCOUNCIL FOR REGIONAL AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH THE ANC CONTRIBUTED BY SUGGESTING 
THAT THE NEGOTIATORS GO BACK TO THE USE OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S 
FOUR PROVINCES.  THIS GOES COUNTER TO THE ANC\'S OWN 
POSITION ON USE OF NINE OR TEN REGIONS AND MBEKI SAID THE 
ANC WOULD GO BACK TO THIS IN THE NEXT BILATERAL WITH THE 
SAG.  IT IS UNCLEAR NEVERTHELESS HOW SUCH A SUBCOUNCIL 
WOULD IMPACT ON THE PROCESS OF GOVERNING, REINCORPORATION 
OF THE HOMELANDS OR PREPARATIONS FOR THE ELECTION.  BROAD 
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED WITH THE GOVERNMENT REGARDING 
THE SUBCOUNCIL ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SINCE PIK BOTHA, NOW 
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PLACE IN HISTORY AS LEADER OF THE 
ANTIAPARTHEID FORCES IN THE NATIONAL PARTY, WANTS TO MOVE 
AHEAD QUICKLY. 
 
8.  UMKHONTO WE SIZWE COMMANDER JOE MODISE HAD BEEN SENT 
THAT MORNING TO CAPE TOWN TO MEET WITH HIS MILITARY 
COUNTERPART IN A BID TO UNBLOCK NEGOTIATIONS ON THE 
SUBCOUNCIL PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY FORCES.  MBEKI 
OPINED THAT THE NEGOTIATORS MUST MOVE AWAY FROM THE 
PHRASE \"JOINT CONTROL\" WHICH THE SADF THINKS IS TOO 
LOADED.  THE ANC WANTS THE POLITICAL AUTHORITY TO SAY 
WHAT HAPPENS VIS-A-VIS THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, JOINT 
SUPERVISION MIGHT BE THE MORE APT TERM.  THE ANC DOES NOT 
WANT OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER THE SADF.  MBEKI TOLD 
MODISE TO MAKE THAT POINT VERY CLEAR TO THE SADF. 
 
--------------------------- 
THE INSURRECTIONIST FACTION 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  IN THIS CONNECTION, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT PART OF THE 
PROBLEM ON CLINCHING A DEAL ON THE SECURITY FORCES IS THE 
FACT THAT, IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
SAY THAT THE ANC\'S CURRENT PRAGMATIC LEADERSHIP MAY SOON 
BE REPLACED BY AN INSURRECTIONIST FACTION.  IF THE SAG 
AGREES TO JOINT CONTROL WITH THIS LEADERSHIP, THEN THE 
SUCCESSORS WILL HAVE THE LEGAL INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH TO 
WREAK HAVOC WITH THE SECURITY FORCES.  IT IS A POINT OF 
\"ULTRASENSITIVITY\" IN THE SAG.  SUCH AN ANALYSIS HAS EVEN 
REACHED DE KLERK\'S DESK AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS FACT. 
HOW TO DISPEL SUCH PERCEPTIONS?  THEY HAVE REPERCUSSIONS 
ON ANC POLICY MAKING, GIVING HARDLINERS AMMUNITION AND 
RESONANCE WHEN THEY ARGUE THAT SAG FAILURE TO MOVE AT THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE MEANS IT WANTS TO CLING TO POWER. 
 
10.  CONTINUING, MBEKI VOICED CONCERN OVER EXAGGERATED 
MEDIA FOCUS ON THE \"ANGER\" OF THE ANC RANK AND FILE 
FOLLOWING CHRIS HANI\'S ASSASSINATION.  OLIVER TAMBO AND 
HE WENT TO HANI\'S HOME FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION AND 
DID NOT FIND THE PEOPLE MILLING AROUND TO BE ANGRY.  THE 
RANK AND FILE WERE OUTRAGED AND UPSET, BUT NOT ANGRY IN 
A REVOLUTIONARY OR UNCONTROLLABLE SENSE.  MARCHERS IN 
JOHANNESBURG APRIL 17, HE SAID, IN FACT BEAT LOOTERS AND 
TURNED THEM OVER TO THE POLICE.  AMBASSADOR COMMENTED 
THAT, PUT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE WAS 
MINIMAL IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TURNED 
OUT FOR VARIOUS EVENTS MARKING HANI\'S DEATH.  IF THE SAG 
IS WORRIED ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE ANC LEADERSHIP IT 
IS DEALING WITH, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, THEN THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO REINFORCE THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THAT LEADERSHIP.  THE WAY TO DO SO IS 
THROUGH MAKING THE NEGOTIATIONS CREDIBLE IN TERMS OF REAL 
DEMOCRACY AND THEREBY MAKING THE ANC\'S LEADERSHIP, WHICH 
IS COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATIONS, UNCHALLENGEABLE. 
 
----------------------- 
HOW TO DEAL WITH COSAG? 
----------------------- 
 
11.  \"WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONVINCE COSAG?\" 
MBEKI PONDERED, ONCE THE SAG AND ANC HAVE REACHED 
AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTING THE TRANSITION.  COSAG COULD 
VERY WELL BLOCK THE PROCESS, A FACT THAT MIGHT REQUIRE 
UNSPECIFIED UNILATERAL ACTION BY THE SAG.  BUTHELEZI 
MIGHT WELL WALK OUT.  THE SAG AND ANC HAVE NOT YET 
DECIDED WHETHER THE PROCESS WOULD THEN MOVE FORWARD 
WITHOUT HIM.  AMBASSADOR REMARKED THAT BUTHELEZI IS 
ALREADY UNHAPPY WITH THE SPEED AT WHICH THE PROCESS IS 
MOVING.  IT BEHOOVES THE ANC TO PROPOSE A REASONABLE 
SETTLEMENT ON REGIONALISM, BUTHELEZI\'S MOST LEGITIMATE 
CONCERN.  JOE MATTHEWS, AT THE ASPEN CONFERENCE, HAD 
SUGGESTED THAT THE ANC AND IFP MIGHT NOT BE SO FAR APART 
ON THIS ONE.  IF THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY AND 
BUTHELEZI\'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY SUPPORTERS BEGIN SAYING 
\"WE WANT A SETTLEMENT,\" HIS ARGUMENTS FOR WALKING OUT 
WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED, ALTHOUGH ONE COULD NOT 
RULE OUT A BUTHELEZI WALKOUT EVEN THEN.  MOREOVER, SUCH 
AN APPROACH WOULD AVOID THE NEED TO RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER 
BUTHELEZI.  MBEKI AGREED AND NOTED THAT A CONVENIENT DATE 
HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND TO MEET WITH THE IFP FOR 
CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS. 
 
12.  AMBASSADOR INFORMED MBEKI THAT HE HAD MET WITH 
BOPHUTHATSWANA \"PRESIDENT\" MANGOPE IN DECEMBER AND FOUND 
HIM UNMOVING ON THE QUESTION OF REINCORPORATION.  MBEKI 
REPLIED THAT MANGOPE SEES THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL AND 
WANTS IN PLACE A REGIME WITH WHICH HE IS COMFORTABLE 
BEFORE REINCORPORATING.  THE SAG HAS PRESENTED MANGOPE A 
PAPER ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT REINCORPORATING, AND 
ROELF MEYER URGED BUTHELEZI TO GET HIS ALLIES TO MOVE ON 
IT.  PIK BOTHA HAS GIVEN THE ANC ASSURANCES THAT THE SAG 
WILL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON.  THE ANC, MBEKI SAID, WILL 
MEET MANGOPE AGAIN TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO JOIN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS\' CONSENSUS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  WE FOUND MBEKI GENERALLY UPBEAT ABOUT THE 
APPROACHING ENDGAME.  HE WAS MOST CONCERNED THAT SAG 
JITTERS AS THE FINALITY OF IT SINKS IN MAY CAUSE IT TO 
BACKTRACK ON AGREEMENTS.  HE SAID AS MUCH MERELY BY 
SHOWING US THE SAG\'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SHAPE OF THE 
INTERIM GOVERNMENT. 
 
14.  WE FOUND MUCH TO THINK ABOUT IN MBEKI\'S ASSESSMENT 
THAT UNCHALLENGED, ERRONEOUS PERCEPTIONS HAVE A NOXIOUS 
IMPACT ON THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THERE IS A DANGER 
OF CHALLENGE TO ANC LEADERSHIP FROM THE LEFT, BUT IT IS 
MORE OUTSIDE THAN WITHIN THE ANC.  MOREOVER, WE CONCUR 
THAT THE POPULAR MOOD HERE IS NOT ONE OF DESTRUCTION.  WE 
INTEND TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND 
IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT FIGURES AND THE 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WHILE UNDERSCORING THE NEED FOR 
SPEEDY RESULTS FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE 
THAT SITUATION.  END COMMENT.

PRESIDENT 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE DEPUTY PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI\'S 
IMAGE APPEARS A BIT TARNISHED, THE RESULT OF HIS 
QUESTIONABLE HANDLING OF THE FIRING OF WINNIE MANDELA, 
HIS HASTE TO CAST DOUBT ON ALLAN BOESAK\'S CULPABILITY ON 
CORRUPTION CHARGES, HIS WAFFLING ON THE QUESTION OF 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION AND HIS ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA. 
THOUGH THE MAN WHO WOULD BE PRESIDENT REMAINS UNTOUCHED 
BY PERSONAL SCANDAL AND IS UNCHALLENGED IN HIS SENIOR 
PARTY AND GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, HIS PRINCIPAL WEAKNESS 
SEEMS TO BE THAT HE CANNOT SEE THAT ASSOCIATION WITH 
CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN BE DAMAGING TO HIM.  WHILE NELSON 
MANDELA WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO SEE MBEKI SUCCEED HIM AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE ANC AND SOUTH AFRICA, THE GIFT IS NOT 
ENTIRELY HIS TO GIVE.  MBEKI STILL HAS THE HURDLE OF THE 
ANC\'S 1997 NATIONAL CONFERENCE TO OVERCOME.  A LOT CAN 
HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, AND WE HEAR REPORTS THAT 
FORCES ALREADY ARE QUIETLY WORKING TO UNDERMINE HIM. 
HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THE KINGMAKERS OF 1999 COULD BE THE 
SEVEN ANC PROVINCIAL PREMIERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
THE RUNNER STUMBLES 
------------------- 
 
3.  MBEKI HAS GONE THROUGH A BAD PATCH OF PUBLICITY OF 
LATE.  FIRST, INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT TO FIRE ONE OF 
HIS KEY ALLIES IN THE ANC, WINNIE MANDELA, FROM THE 
CABINET HE TRIED TO TALK HER INTO APOLOGIZING.   MRS. 
MANDELA DID NOT, WRITING INSTEAD A BITTER LETTER THAT 
AMOUNTED TO AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK ON HER ESTRANGED 
HUSBAND.  FINALLY MANDELA FIRED HER HIMSELF, SKIPPING A 
FEW CONSTITUTIONALLY STIPULATED STEPS, APPARENTLY HAVING 
BEEN POORLY ADVISED.  MRS. MANDELA THREATENED TO SUE AND 
WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT SHE HAD SOLID LEGAL GROUNDS, SHE 
WAS REINSTATED, ONLY TO BE FIRED AGAIN.  IT WAS AN 
EMBARRASSING EPISODE DURING WHICH MBEKI (NOT ENTIRELY 
COINCIDENTALLY) MANAGED TO FIND HIMSELF OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY.  THE WHITE PRESS CRITICIZED MBEKI AS INDECISIVE. 
 
4.  NEXT, MBEKI RUSHED TO CLAIM A REPORT PREPARED BY HIS 
LEGAL ADVISOR, MOJANKU GUMBI, EXONERATED DISGRACED ANC 
WESTERN CAPE LEADER ALLAN BOESAK OF CULPABILITY IN 
CORRUPTION CHARGES.  A SENIOR ANC OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT 
BOESAK, WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, VISITED 
PRESIDENT MANDELA AT ANC HEADQUARTERS JUST PRIOR TO THE 
RELEASE OF THE REPORT\'S FINDINGS TO PROCLAIM HIS 
INNOCENCE.  BASED ON MBEKI\'S STATEMENT AND BOESAK\'S 
DRAMATIC APPEAL, MANDELA PUBLICLY VOICED HIS CONFIDENCE 
IN BOESAK, SAYING THE LATTER SHOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER 
AMBASSADORSHIP.  BOESAK CROWED ABOUT HIS \"REHABILITATION\" 
AND DECLARED HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY\'S 
GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE INVESTIGATION BY THE 
OFFICE OF SERIOUS ECONOMIC OFFENSES HAD NOT BEEN 
CONCLUDED, THE PRESIDENT AND DEPUTY PRESIDENT\'S 
STATEMENTS SMACKED OF A WHITEWASH, WHICH THE PRESS HERE 
CRITICIZED MERCILESSLY.  GUMBI SUBSEQUENTLY CLARIFIED 
THAT THE REPORT ONLY STATED THAT SHE HAD SEEN NO EVIDENCE 
IMPLICATING BOESAK OF POCKETING FOREIGN DONOR FUNDS. 
MANDELA BACKPEDALLED ON THE PROMISED APPOINTMENT, AND 
MBEKI ALLEGEDLY TOLD BOESAK TO SHUN THE SPOTLIGHT WHILE 
HE LOOKED FOR A JOB FOR HIM, POSSIBLY AT ANC 
HEADQUARTERS. 
 
5.  ON MAY 5, A WELL-CONNECTED ANC LAWYER TOLD US GUMBI\'S 
SHORT REPORT WAS MEANT ONLY AS AN UPDATE FOR INTERNAL 
USE, NOT A FINAL, PUBLIC REPORT.  HE STRONGLY CRITICIZED 
MBEKI FOR RELEASING THE REPORT, WHILE EXPRESSING 
CONFIDENCE IN GUMBI. 
 
6.  MANDELA HAS ALSO GIVEN MBEKI THE LEAD IN LAYING OUT 
THE ANC\'S EXPLANATIONS FOR FAILING TO ACT ON THE APRIL 
1994 AGREEMENT WITH INKATHA AND THE NP TO SEEK 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.  MBEKI WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH 
NEGOTIATING THE ISSUE WITH THE IFP AND NP.  WHILE 
PRIVATELY REASSURING TO INKATHA LEADER MANGOSUTHU 
BUTHELEZI, IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE ISSUE MBEKI 
HAS TAKEN A PARTICULARLY HARD LINE.  THE ANC HAS IN 
CONSEQUENCE TAKEN A DRUBBING FROM ASSORTED PARTY 
SPOKESPERSONS, JOURNALISTS, AND OTHER OBSERVERS. 
 
7.  FINALLY, ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, MBEKI IN RECENT 
WEEKS HAS BEEN WHIPPING UP ANTI-PRESS SENTIMENT BOTH IN 
THE ANC\'S PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS AND THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE (NEC).  HE BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR HIS RECENT 
TROUBLES, POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS WAS DICTATING ANC 
DECISIONS, AND CULTIVATED A FEAR AMONG ANC ACTIVISTS THAT 
A HOSTILE PRESS WILL KEEP ANTI-ANC NEWS IN THE HEADLINES 
AS MOMENTUM BUILDS UP FOR THE NOVEMBER LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
ELECTIONS.  ONE INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT 
MBEKI\'S SUSPICION OF THE MEDIA LED HIM TO CALL FOR RADIO 
AND TELEVISION TIME SLOTS FOR GOVERNMENT BROADCASTS. 
SOME OBSERVERS HERE INTERPRET MBEKI\'S INTOLERANCE OF 
CRITICISM AS A RESIDUAL CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS DAYS IN 
EXILE, WHEN THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT BROOKED NO DISSENT. 
 
-------------- 
WHEELER DEALER 
-------------- 
 
8.  WHILE MBEKI MAY HAVE BEEN SCORED BY THE PRESS, HIS 
POSITION WITHIN THE ANC AND GOVERNMENT IS SECURE.  SELF- 
ASSURED, ARTICULATE AND CHARISMATIC, HE REMAINS ONE OF 
THE COUNTRY\'S SHREWDEST POLITICIANS.  HE HAS PLACED HIS 
ALLIES IN KEY GOVERNMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND CONTINUES TO 
BUILD UP AND CALL IN FAVORS.  NOT STRAITJACKETED BY 
IDEOLOGY, MBEKI IS IN THE SAME PRAGMATIC CAMP AS CYRIL 
RAMAPHOSA.  IF HE HAS A WEAKNESS IT IS AN INABILITY TO 
FORESEE THE HARM THAT ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN 
CAUSE. 
 
9.  SINCE HIS REELECTION AS ANC SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE 
DEATH OF KEY SUPPORTER JOE SLOVO, CYRIL RAMAPHOSA\'S 
RIVALRY WITH MBEKI HAS SUBSIDED.  MBEKI LIEUTENANTS 
APPEAR CONCERNED THAT DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL CHERYL 
CAROLUS IS A BECOMING A MAGNET FOR MBEKI\'S ADVERSARIES. 
ANC INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR YUSUF SALOOJEE TOLD US 
THAT THE EMPLOYEES IN HIS OFFICE WERE BYPASSED FOR A 
RAISE GRANTED TO ALL ANC HEADQUARTERS EMPLOYEES IN 1994. 
INFORMED OF THE DISPARITY, PRESIDENT MANDELA INSTRUCTED 
CAROLUS, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE ANC\'S DAY-TO-DAY 
OPERATIONS, BEFORE THE NATIONAL WORKING COMMITTE IN APRIL 
1995 TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION IMMEDIATELY.  SALOOJEE 
HIMSELF COLLECTED 68,000 RANDS (APPROXIMATELY USD 18,900) 
IN BACK PAY.  SALOOJEE ALSO TOLD US THAT CAROLUS, WHO IS 
CLOSE TO KEY MBEKI RIVAL MAC MAHARAJ, FAILS TO INFORM HIS 
DEPARTMENT, WHICH ACTS AS MBEKI\'S EYES AND EARS AT 
HEADQUARTERS, OF IMPORTANT MEETINGS. 
 
10.  IN HIS GOVERNMENT OFFICES, ONE IS GREETED BY THE 
SIGHT OF MINISTERS AND PARTY OFFICIALS WAITING FOR MBEKI 
TO RECEIVE THEM AND TO TAKE ACTION ON A HOST OF PERSONAL 
AND POLITICAL MATTERS.  DUE TO POOR STAFFING AND HIS 
PUNISHING TRAVEL SCHEDULE, MUCH BUSINESS FALLS THROUGH 
THE CRACKS.  MBEKI HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR MISSING 
APPOINTMENTS, AND DOCUMENTS LIE IN HIS IN-BASKET FOR 
WEEKS.  HE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY UNABLE TO DELEGATE 
DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY, AND EXHAUSTS HIMSELF BY 
BECOMING EXCESSIVELY INVOLVED IN THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS 
ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. 
 
11.  AFTER A YEAR IN HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICE MBEKI REMAINS 
PERSONALLY UNTAINTED BY SCANDAL.  MBEKI HAS ALWAYS LIVED 
COMFORTABLY, THANKS LARGELY TO HIS WIFE\'S INCOME AS A 
UNITED NATIONS EMPLOYEE AND BANK OFFICIAL, BUT NEVER 
SUMPTUOUSLY.  A RESPECTED FEMALE JOURNALIST AND 
LONGSTANDING EMBASSY CONTACT CONFIDED TO US THAT SHE 
AVOIDS ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS WITH MBEKI BECAUSE HE HAS MADE 
SEXUAL ADVANCES TOWARD HER.  HOWEVER, SUCH STORIES ARE 
RELATIVELY RARE, AND MBEKI HAS NOT GAINED THE REPUTATION 
OF A \"WOMANIZER\". 
 
-------------------- 
MANDELA\'S SUCCESSOR? 
-------------------- 
 
12.  MBEKI\'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSET IS THE TRUST AND 
AFFECTION OF NELSON MANDELA.  MANDELA HAS MADE HIM THE 
MR. FIX-IT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND HANDED HIM INCREASING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
GOVERNMENT.  IF MANDELA COULD, HE WOULD INSTALL HIS HAND- 
PICKED CHOICE FOR SUCCESSOR IN THE PRESIDENCY OF BOTH 
PARTY AND COUNTRY IN 1997 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. 
HOWEVER, THE GIFT IS NOT ENTIRELY MANDELA\'S TO GIVE. 
 
13.  MBEKI STILL HAS THE 1997 ANC NATIONAL CONFERENCE TO 
SURVIVE BEFORE HE CAN CLAIM THE MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP.  AT 
THIS WRITING IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW POLITICAL 
FORCES WITHIN THE PARTY WILL BE RANGED AT THAT TIME.  WE 
FIND IT PLAUSIBLE THAT ANC PROVINCIAL PREMIERS COULD 
BEGIN BUILDING POWER BASES AND MACHINES IN THEIR 
PROVINCES.  ASSUMING THAT NONE OF THESE SATRAPS-IN-THE- 
MAKING CHOOSES OPENLY TO CHALLENGE MBEKI FOR THE ANC 
LEADERSHIP, THEY COULD VERY WELL BECOME KINGMAKERS, WHOM 
MBEKI WILL HAVE TO COURT ASSIDUOUSLY.  INDEED, MBEKI 
SPENDS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME VISITING THE 
PROVINCES AND HANDLING ANC PROBLEMS THERE IN RECOGNITION 
OF THIS FACT. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.  MBEKI\'S PERFORMANCE AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE HAS 
SPARKED SOME REVISIONIST THINKING ABOUT THE MAN.  WHILE 
STILL RESPECTED FOR HIS FORMIDABLE INTELLECT AND 
POLITICAL INFIGHTING SKILLS, WE GET THE SENSE THAT SOME 
PEOPLE HERE ARE BEGINNING TO QUESTION MORE OPENLY WHAT 
MBEKI STANDS FOR.  MANDELA IS LETTING MUCH OF THE BUCK 
STOP AT HIS DEPUTY\'S DESK, AND PROBLEMS AT THAT LEVEL 
HAVE PROVEN IMPERVIOUS EITHER TO HIS DISARMING CHARM OR 
THE TACTICS HE HAS SO OFTEN USED TO DEMOLISH RIVALS.  HIS 
OFFICE IS WOEFULLY STAFFED AND NOT ORGANIZED FOR HANDLING 
THIS TYPE OF RESPONSIBILITY (MANDELA\'S IS NOT BETTER), 
WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE MISSTEPS OF RECENT MONTHS. 
SO FAR HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO RIDE THE TIGER, BUT IN THE 
RUNNING FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENCY MBEKI WILL BE, IN THE 
WORDS OF A RESPECTED JOURNALIST HERE, A FASCINATING 
CHARACTER TO WATCH.  END COMMENT.

OF THESE ISSUES, FOLLOWING ARE GENERAL RESPONSES TO 
QUESTIONS POSED REF A.  SEPTELS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES (LAND, 
HOUSING, TRADITIONAL/CUSTOMARY LAW) AS WELL AS SEPTEL 
ADDRESSING POST\'S ACTIONS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY WILL 
FOLLOW. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS, THE SAG HAS BEEN 
QUITE COMMITTED TO THE RECOGNITION AND AMELIORATION OF 
THE PLIGHT OF SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN.  IT HAS RECENTLY 
SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING OUT SEVERAL OF ITS SPECIFIC POST- 
BEIJING PLANS (SEE REF. B) INCLUDING RATIFICATION OF THE 
UN CEDAW IN JANUARY 1996, PROVISION OF FREE HEALTH CARE 
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THE PASSAGE OF THE COMMISSION ON 
GENDER EQUALITY ACT 39 OF 1996.  NEVERTHELESS, IN MANY 
AREAS, THE SAG, THOUGH PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO REFORM, IS 
SLOW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS/LAW 
------------------------- 
3.  THE NEW CONSTITUTION, ADOPTED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR, 
GUARANTEES EQUALITY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FREEDOM AND 
SECURITY OF PERSON, AND HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, FOOD, WATER 
AND SOCIAL SECURITY.  EQUALITY CLAUSE 9.3 IN THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS IS QUITE EXTENSIVE, PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON 
THE GROUNDS OF GENDER, SEX, PREGNANCY, MARITAL STATUS, 
AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  INEVITABLY 
HOWEVER, DISCREPANCIES STILL EXIST BETWEEN LAW AND 
PRACTICE.  ALTHOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OVERRIDES ANY 
POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY CUSTOMARY LAWS, IT IS 
QUESTIONABLE HOW COGNIZANT WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES 
ARE OF THEIR RIGHTS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
DOCUMENTS WHICH PROVIDE GENDER EQUALITY FRAMEWORK 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
4.  IN GENERAL, SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK 
FROM WHICH THE SAG, NGO\'S, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN 
IMPLEMENT PROMOTION OF GENDER EQUALITY.  THE 
COMMONWEALTH\'S \"INTER-PARLIAMENTARY COUNCIL\'S PLAN OF 
ACTION TO CORRECT PRESENT IMBALANCES IN THE PARTICIPATION 
OF MEN AND WOMEN IN POLITICAL LIFE,\" ADOPTED IN MARCH OF 
1994, IS USED WITHIN PARLIAMENT.  DOCUMENTS INFLUENCING 
EXTERNAL LEGISLATION INCLUDE THE \"CHARTER FOR EFFECTIVE 
EQUALITY,\" PRODUCED BY THE WOMEN\'S NATIONAL COALITION AND 
PRESENTED IN AUGUST OF 1994; THE BEIJING PLATFORM FOR 
ACTION; THE UNCEDAW; AND THE DRAFT POLICY FOR WOMEN\'S 
EMPOWERMENT, FORMULATED BY THE NOW DEFUNCT RECONSTRUCTION 
AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP). 
 
------------------------- 
PARLIAMENT AS INSTITUTION 
------------------------- 
5.  THE MARCH 1996 \"REPORT ON WHAT THE S. AFRICAN 
PARLIAMENT HAS DONE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND 
STATUS OF WOMEN IN S.A.\" COVERS BOTH EXTERNAL LEGISLATION 
AND CHANGES WITHIN PARLIAMENT ITSELF TO PROMOTE GENDER 
EQUALITY SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS.  S. AFRICA RANKS 7TH 
IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN 
PARLIAMENT, WITH 101 WOMEN OUT OF 400 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
MEMBERS, AND 16 OUT OF 90 SENATORS.  15 OUT OF 60 CHAIRS 
OF COMMITTEES ARE WOMEN, AND A WOMEN\'S CAUCUS EXISTS. 
GENERALLY, WOMEN REPRESENT ABOUT 26OF PARLIAMENT (THE 
ANC CALLED FOR 33REPRESENTATION).  HOWEVER, THE REPORT 
NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, WOMEN 
ARE STILL NOT SPEAKING OUT TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, AND 
PARLIAMENT REMAINS A MALE-DOMINATED INSTITUTION.  TO 
RECTIFY THIS, THE WORKING HOURS OF PARLIAMENT ARE BEING 
RE-EXAMINED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE \"MANY WOMEN MP\'S WHO 
HAVE DOMESTIC AND CHILD-CARE RESPONSIBILITIES.\"  THE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR THE SUPPORT STAFF ARE 
ALSO BEING RE-EXAMINED, AS WOMEN IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN 
DISPROPORTIONATELY GIVEN SHORT TERM CONTRACTS WITH NO 
BENEFITS. FINALLY, A CRECHE/NURSERY HAS RECENTLY BEEN 
CREATED IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
-------------------- 
LEGISLATIVE ADVANCES 
-------------------- 
6.  THE UN CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW) WAS RATIFIED IN 
JANUARY 1996, MAKING SOUTH AFRICA THE 131ST NATION TO 
SIGN THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT.  THEN IN MARCH 1996, AN 
OFFICE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 
PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  THESE FOLLOWED PREVIOUS MEASURES TO 
EMPOWER WOMEN INCLUDING THE 1994 ESTABLISHMENT OF AUGUST 
9 AS NATIONAL WOMEN\'S DAY, AND THE 1995 INCOME TAX ACT 
NO. 21, WHICH REPEALS THE DISCRIMINATORY TAX BURDEN ON 
MARRIED WOMEN BY APPLYING A SINGLE INCOME TAX RATE TO ALL 
INIVIDUALS, IRRESPECTIVE OF GENDER OR MARITAL STATUS. 
 
7.  TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN RECENT HOUSING AND LAND 
ACTS WHICH FAIL TO CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS THAT WOMEN 
SPECIFICALLY MAY ENCOUNTER IN ACCESSING LAND OR HOUSING, 
THE INTERIM PROTECTION OF INFORMAL LAND RIGHTS ACT (1996) 
PROTECTS PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN, WHO HAVE 
INSECURE AND INFORMAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN LAND. 
SIMILARLY, THE COMMUNAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATIONS BILL, IF 
PASSED, WOULD PROVIDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH THE 
COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, HOLD AND MANAGE PROPERTY. 
 
8.  THE WATER RATIONALISATION AND AMENDMENT ACT (1994) 
CALLS FOR WOMEN TO COMPRISE ONE-THIRD OF LOCAL WATER 
SUPPLY AND SANITATION COMMITTEES, THUS ENABLING THEM TO 
PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THE PLANNING, DESIGN, AND CONTROL 
OF WATER SCHEMES.  THE SOCIAL ASSISTANCE ACT AND 
AMENDMENT ACTS (1992/94) PROVIDE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, 
MAINTENANCE GRANTS TO PARENTS FOR THE CARE OF THEIR 
CHILDREN.  HOWEVER, THE AGED PERSONS AMENDMENT ACT (1994) 
GENERALLY HURTS WOMEN BY DOING JUST THE OPPOSITE, 
REPEALING AN ATTENDANT\'S ALLOWANCE FOR HOME-CARE. 
 
9.  LABOR ACTS:  THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
LABOUR COUNCIL ACT 35 BROADENED THE DEFINITION OF FARM 
WORKER TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC WORKERS ON FARMS; THIS 
BENEFITTED SOME WOMEN, BUT IT EXCLUDED SEASONAL AND 
CASUAL FARM LABOURERS, OFTEN WOMEN AS WELL.  SIMILARLY, 
THE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT OFFERS JOB SECURITY FOR DOMESTIC 
WORKERS AND PROHIBITS SEXUALLY DISCRIMINATORY CLAUSES IN 
A UNION\'S CONSTITUTION, BUT VIOLATIONS STILL OCCUR, 
ACCORDING TO THE JUNE 17 JOHNNESBURG DAILY \"SOWETAN.\"  IN 
TERMS OF BUSINESS, A RECENTLY PASSED SMALL BUSINESS BILL 
BENEFITS WOMEN BY CREATING AN INSTITUTIONAL AND 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION OF SMALL, MEDIUM 
AND MICRO-ENTERPRISES. 
 
10.  BUDGET:  THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC 
ALTERNATIVE IN SOUTH AFRICA (IDASA) SPONSORED A WOMEN\'S 
BUDGET INITIATIVE IN MARCH 1996 TO IDENTIFY THE BUDGETARY 
CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPACT ON SPECIFIC WOMEN\'S LIVES. 
DURING THE 1996 PARLIAMENTARY DELIBERATIONS ON THE BUDGET 
A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS DID PROVIDE INFORMATION ASSESSING 
GENDER-SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR BUDGETS, AS WELL AS 
THEIR DEPARTMENTS\' EFFORTS TO PROMOTE WOMEN. 
 
------ 
HEALTH 
------ 
11. ABORTION BILL:  ON JULY 3 1996, THE CABINET APPROVED 
A BILL WHICH WOULD LIBERALIZE CURRENT ABORTION LAWS AND 
PROVIDE MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO HELP.  (SEE SEPTEL) 
 
12.  FREE HEALTH CARE:  A PRESIDENTIAL LEAD PROJECT 
SPEARHEADED UNDER THE FORMER RECONSTRUCTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP) IS PROVIDING FREE HEALTH CARE 
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN UNDER SIX. 
 
---------------------- 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
---------------------- 
13.  NEWSPAPERS REPORT THAT EVERY SIX DAYS, A WOMAN IS 
KILLED IN S. AFRICA BY HER HUSBAND OR BOYFRIEND.  THE 
PREVENTION OF FAMILY VIOLENCE ACT OF 1993 MAKES IT EASIER 
FOR WOMEN TO OBTAIN INTERDICTS AGAINST THIER ABUSIVE 
HUSBANDS AND PARTNERS.  THIS LAW ALSO DEFINES MARITAL 
RAPE AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. CHERYL CAROLUS, ACTING ANC 
SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD EMBASSY OFFICIALS THAT ALTHOUGH 
THIS LAW IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE IN THE 
WORLD, TO DATE FEWER THAN TEN WOMEN HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF IT.  GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN S. 
AFRICA, THE SAG HAD COMMITTED SPECIFICALLY TO 
ESTABLISHING MORE CENTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN, YET TO WHAT 
EXTENT THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS UNCLEAR. 
 
--------------------- 
WATCHDOG INSTITUTIONS 
--------------------- 
 
14.   A HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WHICH INVESTIGATES 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
THE GOVERNMENT ON MEASURES NEEDED TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS 
IS UP AND RUNNING. FOLLOWING IN ITS FOOTSTEPS, THE 
COMMISSION ON GENDER EQUALITY ACT OF MID-1996, WILL 
ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY AND TO 
ADVISE/MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PARLIAMENT OR ANY OTHER 
LEGISLATURE AFFECTING WOMEN. 
 
15.  CONFERENCES:  MANY FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES TO BEIJING 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH NGO\'S 
WHICH ILLUSTRATE S. AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM 
BENEFITTING WOMEN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND 
SUPPORT THE SAG\'S INITIATIVES.

POLICY COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION UNIT (CIU) MARCH 18.  THE 
CIU, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, PROVIDES 
POLICY COORDINATION AND OVERSIGHT, AND ENSURES THAT AGREED UPON 
POLICIES ARE FOLLOWED THROUGH TO IMPLEMENTATION (REFTELS).  THE 
CIU ALSO ACTS AS AN INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE TO ENSURE THAT THE 
DEPUTY PRESIDENT IS FULLY INFORMED ON THE WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES 
THAT FALL UNDER HIS RESPONSIBILITIES.  (NOTE: AFTER RESEARCHING 
SIMILAR BODIES IN BOTSWANA, MALAYSIA AND THE U.K., MBEKI 
SPECIFICALLY REJECTED THE ROBUST POLICY-MAKING MODEL FOR THE 
BROADER COORDINATION FUNCTION OF THE CIU).  THE CIU IS DIVIDED 
INTO THREE SECTIONS:  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, POLITICAL AFFAIRS, 
AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS.  THE LATTER TWO OFFICES ARE HEADED BY VUSI 
MAVIMBELA AND MOSS NGOASHENG, RESPECTIVELY.  MAJOLA IS PRESENTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES IN THE CIU, BUT SHE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CIU IS STILL IN ITS INITIAL STAGES AND THAT 
A SEPARATE POTITION MAY BE ESTABLISHED TO HANDLE DEFENSE AND 
SECURITY.  SHE ALSO SAID IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CIU WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE AFTER 1999. 
 
2.  (C) THEMBI MAJOLA IS THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
OFFICE.  AGE 34, SHE COMES FROM WHAT SHE TERMED A \"HIGHLY 
POLITICAL\" FAMILY.  AT AGE 7, SHE ACCOMPANIED HER FAMILY INTO 
SUDDEN EXILE UNDER CLOAK OF DARKNESS ON ORDERS FROM THE ANC; THEY 
CARRIED ONLY A PLASTIC BAG OF POSSESSIONS AND A RUG TIED AROUND 
HER MOTHER\'S WAIST.  THE FAMILY MOVED TO CUBA, WHERE THEMBI 
MAJOLA ENTERED SCHOOL AND LIVED FROM 1970-1990.  FROM 1992-97 SHE 
LIVED IN GENEVA, WHERE SHE WORKED FOR THE WORLD COUNCIL OF 
CHURCHES.  SHE RETURNED TO SOUTH AFRICA LAST YEAR TO TAKE UP A 
POSITION IN THE DEPUTY MINISTER\'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
TRADE AND INDUSTRY.  AFTER A FEW WEEKS, SHE WAS \"REDEPLOYED\" TO 
HER CURRENT POSITION.  A XHOSA, MAJOLA IS FLUENT IN ENGLISH AND 
SPANISH.  SHE IS MARRIED AND HAS YOUNG CHILDREN. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT: DESPITE THE EXTENDED STAY IN CUBA, MAJOLA 
EVINCED NO IDEOLOGICAL BENT, NOR DOES SHE SEEM TO HARBOR ANY 
HOSTILITY TOWARD AMERICA OR U.S. DIPLOMATS.  INDEED, SHE WELCOMED 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY AND 
INTERACT WITH US ON MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  IN A NOVEMBER 23 MEETING WITH DFA DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR FOR SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS HORST BRAMMER, AND DFA DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION COEN BEZUIDENHOUT, THE SAG 
OFFICIALS TOLD POLMIL OFFICER AND POLOFFICER THAT, WHILE SOUTH 
AFRICA SUPPORTED THE STRENGTHENING OF SADC AS AN INSTITUTION, IT 
HAD ADOPTED A LONG-TERM APPROACH TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S REFORM. 
ACCORDING TO BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT, THE RESTRUCTURING OF SADC\'S 
SECTORS HAD BEEN POSTPONED, AS HAD THE RESOLUTION OF THE SPLIT 
BETWEEN THE CHAIR AND THE ORGAN ON POLITICS, SECURITY, AND DEFENSE. 
ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE HOPEFUL THAT SADC AS A WHOLE WOULD GROW STRONGER 
WITH TIME, THEY NOTED THAT CURRENT EVENTS, SUCH AS THE DROC 
CONFLICT AND LESOTHO, COUPLED WITH A RELUCTANCE OF MEMBER STATES TO 
COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A SADC OVERHAUL, HAVE PUT REFORM ON THE 
BACKBURNER UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER THE CHAIRMANSHIP TURNOVER IN 1999, 
FOR WHICH SOUTH AFRICA HAS ALREADY BEGUN QUIETLY PROMOTING 
MOZAMBIQUE, THE CURRENT DEPUTY CHAIR.  BOTH BRAMMER AND 
BEZUIDENHOUT INDICATED THAT THE UPCOMING U.S.-SADC FORUM COULD BE 
A GOOD PLACE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS, AND WE STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN INPUT ON POTENTIAL FORUM AGENDA ITEMS 
(REFTEL).  END SUMMARY. 
 
REFORM AND RESOLUTION SIDELINED...FOR THE MOMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  (C)  STRESSING THAT PROSPECTS FOR SADC SECTORAL REFORM ARE 
CURRENTLY \"NOT GOING ANYWHERE\", BEZUIDENHOUT ADDED THAT THE EU HAD 
ACCORDINGLY BEEN QUITE DISAPPOINTED DURING THE RECENT EU-SADC 
CONSULTATIONS IN VIENNA, AND THAT THERE WERE NO PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD 
ON THE EU-FUNDED REFORM PROPOSAL.  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER AND 
BEZUIDENHOUT, THE SECTORAL REFORM ISSUE HAD MET STRONG RESISTANCE 
MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SMALLER SADC MEMBERS SUCH AS SWAZILAND, 
LESOTHO, AND MALAWI, WHO ARE WORRIED THAT ANY REFORM (AND 
\"SURRENDER\" OF CURRENT SECTORS) WOULD PERMANENTLY SIDELINE THEM 
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.  BRAMMER ALSO INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE 
\"NORTHERN\" SADC MEMBERS, SUCH AS ZAMBIA, TANZANIA, AND ANGOLA, WERE 
ALSO DETERMINED TO HOLD ON TO THEIR PORTFOLIOS.  ON A POSITIVE 
NOTE, HOWEVER, BRAMMER SAID THAT THE ECONOMICALLY STRONGER 
COUNTRIES, SUCH AS BOTSWANA, NAMIBIA, MOZAMBIQUE, AND EVEN TO SOME 
EXTENT ZIMBABWE, WERE MORE OR LESS ALIGNED WITH SOUTH AFRICA ON 
THIS ISSUE AND SAW THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERTAKING SOME SORT OF 
STRUCTURAL REFORM AKIN TO THAT RECOMMENDED IN THE PROPOSAL. 
 
3.  (C)  THAT SAID, BEZUIDENHOUT EMPHASIZED THAT BOTH THE CONFLICT 
IN THE DROC AND LESOTHO HAD DOMINATED THE EU-SADC CONSULTATIONS, AT 
THE EXPENSE OF INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS STRUCTURAL REFORM.  HE 
DID ADD, HOWEVER, THAT AGENDA ITEMS FOR THE NEXT MEETING HAD BEEN 
AGREED UPON, AND THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SMALL ARMS PROLIFERATION 
WOULD BE INCLUDED. 
 
4.  (C)  BOTH BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT APPEARED RESIGNED TO THE 
FACT THAT RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES OVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THE SADC CHAIR (PRESIDENT MANDELA) AND CHAIR OF THE ORGAN ON 
POLITICS, SECURITY, AND DEFENSE (PRESIDENT MUGABE) WOULD SIMPLY 
HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AT LEAST 1999, WHEN MANDELA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP ENDS. 
MANDELA, THEY SAID, HAD DEFINITELY REACHED THIS CONCLUSION. 
BRAMMER SAID THAT THE MULTI-COUNTRY (MALAWI, MOZAMBIQUE, AND 
NAMIBIA) REPORT ON THE ORGAN ISSUE HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMALLY 
PRESENTED TO SADC (THE SAG HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE PRESENTED DURING 
THE MAURITIUS SUMMIT), AND WOULD MOST LIKELY REMAIN SHELVED. 
INDEED, THE DFA OFFICIALS ALMOST APPEARED RELIEVED THAT MANDELA 
WOULD NOT HAVE TO FOCUS FURTHER ON THE ISSUE, AND EXPRESSED HOPE 
THAT HIS SUCCESSOR (THE SAG IS ALREADY QUIETLY PROMOTING THE DEPUTY 
CHAIR, CHISSANO OF MOZAMBIQUE) WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE THE ISSUE 
FORWARD.  HOWEVER, BRAMMER STRESSED THAT WHILE THE CONFLICT 
CONTINUES IN THE DROC, MUGABE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN ANY 
RESOLUTION. 
 
CONTINUITY IN LIGHT OF DROC MISTAKE 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  RATHER SHEEPISHLY ADMITTING THAT SOUTH AFRICA NOW 
REGRETTED HAVING SUPPORTED DROC\'S INCLUSION AS A SADC MEMBER, 
BRAMMER SAID THAT, THE CONFLICT ASIDE, HAVING DROC AS A MEMBER HAD 
UNPLEASANTLY STRETCHED THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES OF SADC.  AS 
BRAMMER EXPLAINED, ONLY SOUTHERN DROC (MAYBE) HAD A CULTURAL OR 
ECONOMIC AFFILIATION WITH THE REST OF SADC, AND BY ADMITTING DROC, 
SADC HAD ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PULLED INTO AN ESSENTIALLY CENTRAL 
AFRICAN CONFLICT.  BRAMMER THEN NOTED THAT TO ALLOW FOR THE DROC\'S 
SPEEDY ENTRY INTO SADC, PROCEDURAL RULES HAD BEEN BENT, WHICH IN 
RETROSPECT, ONLY SERVED TO FURTHER EXACERBATE INTERNAL DIVISIONS. 
IN LIGHT OF THAT DECISION, BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT BOTH STRESSED 
THAT THE SAG WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COMMITTED CHAIR, SUCH AS 
MOZAMBIQUE, SELECTED IN 1999, ONE THAT WOULD PLACE EMPHASIS ON THE 
IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICY DECISIONS. 
THEY ALSO COMPLEMENTED MOZAMBIQUE\'S FOREIGN POLICY APPARATUS FOR 
 
6.  (C)  BOTH OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT THE SAG WAS LOOKING FORWARD 
TO THE UPCOMING U.S.-SADC FORUM AS A POSSIBLE MEANS TO MOVE FORWARD 
ON SOME ISSUES.  BOTH WELCOMED OUR REQUEST FOR INPUT ON POSSIBLE 
AGENDA ITEMS OR AREAS OF CONCERN (REFTEL), BUT NOTED THAT THE DROC 
WAS CONSUMING MUCH OF SADC\'S ATTENTION. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  IT APPEARS THAT THE SAG HAS RESIGNED ITSELF TO THE FACT 
THAT NO SIGNIFICANT SADC INSTITUTIONAL OR STRUCTURAL REFORM WILL 
TAKE PLACE DURING THE REST OF MANDELA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP, WHICH 
INCLUDES THE FEBRUARY MINISTERIAL IN LUSAKA AND THE SEPTEMBER 1999 
SUMMIT IN MAPUTO.  THAT SAID, BOTH BRAMMER AND BEZUIDENHOUT 
INDICATED THAT THE SAG REMAINS COMMITTED TO SADC AS AN INSTITUTION 
IN THE LONG TERM, AND THAT THE SAG WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE 
STRENGTHENING OF SADC AS A REGIONAL BODY, ESPECIALLY ON THE 
ECONOMIC FRONT.  GIVEN THE EVER-STRENGTHENING TIES BETWEEN 
MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH AFRICA, THE SAG CLEARLY HOPES THAT A 
MOZAMBICAN CHAIR WOULD GENERALLY SUPPORT SOUTH AFRICA\'S SADC 
VISION.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG WOULD THEREFORE LIKE TO SEE CHISSANO 
REPLACE MANDELA, IT SEEMS THAT THE ISSUE IS AN OPEN ONE, AND COULD 
TAKE THE NEXT CHAIRMAN AS COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AS MANDELA WAS 
TAKEN IN MASERU IN 1996.  TO THAT END, SOUTH AFRICA CLEARLY 
REALIZES THAT SADC IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT - LITERALLY AND 
FIGURATIVELY.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENSE AND FOREIGN 
MINISTERS WILL TAKE PART IN AN OCTOBER 26 - 27 SPECIAL 
MINISTERIAL SESSION IN SWAZILAND ON REFORM OF THE ORGAN ON 
POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (THE ORGAN).  PARTICIPATION 
OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER SHOULD ADDRESS SAG CONCERN THAT ANY 
DECISIONS MADE ON THE ISSUE HAVE THE BLESSING OF THE SADC 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.  THE MINISTERIAL FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS 
OF A SUCCESSFUL WORKING SESSION IN PRETORIA THE WEEK OF 
SEPTEMBER 27 - OCTOBER 1 ORGANIZED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN, 
ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI MINISTERS OF DEFENSE.  THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT OF THE WORKING SESSION WAS ZIMBABWEAN 
COMPREHENSION (FINALLY) OF THE SAG\'S POSITION THAT THE 
ORGAN MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL SADC STRUCTURE. 
STRESSING THAT SADC MEMBERS SOMETIMES VIEW SWAZILAND AS A 
SOUTH AFRICAN \"SATELLITE,\" THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC 
POLITICAL AFFAIRS TOLD POLOFF ON OCTOBER 7 THAT ANY 
DECISION ON ORGAN REFORM NEEDED TO APPEAR TO BE A WIDER 
INITIATIVE THAN THAT OF SOUTH AFRICA, ZIMBABWE, AND 
SWAZILAND.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG REMAINS WORRIED THAT ZIMBABWE 
WILL IN THE END BALK AT FULL ORGAN-SADC INTEGRATION, SOUTH 
AFRICA IS NONETHELESS GOING TO SWAZILAND WITH THE HOPE THAT 
THE SPECIAL MINISTERIAL WILL RESULT IN SADC ENDORSEMENT FOR 
ORGAN REFORM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND ON SADC AND THE SECURITY ORGAN 
========================================= 
 
2.  (C)  BEFORE SADC CAN ADDRESS REGIONAL SECURITY ISSUES 
IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION, MEMBER STATES MUST FIRST AGREE ON 
SADC\'S ROLE WITH REGARD TO POLITICAL, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY 
ISSUES.  FOR THAT TO TAKE PLACE, THE STATUS OF SADC\'S 
ORGAN, (AS WELL AS THE INTERSTATE DEFENSE AND SECURITY 
COMMITTEE (ISDSC)) MUST BE CLEARLY DEFINED.  ALTHOUGH 
MEMBER STATES ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF THE ORGAN DURING THE 
SADC HEADS OF STATE SUMMIT IN MASERU IN 1996, THE ORGAN IS 
MAINTAINED SEPARATELY AT THE HEADS OF STATE LEVEL.  ITS 
CHAIR, ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT MUGABE, VIEWS THE ORGAN AS A 
PARALLEL AND EQUAL BODY NEITHER DIRECTLY LINKED NOR 
ACCOUNTABLE TO SADC OR THE ISDSC.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE SADC, 
NEITHER THE ORGAN NOR THE ISDSC (WHICH IS CHAIRED BY 
SWAZILAND) POSSESS SECRETARIATS, WHICH HAS LIMITED BOTH 
BODIES\' POTENTIAL SCOPE OF ACTION. 
 
3.  (C)  ALTHOUGH THE ORGAN CHAIRMANSHIP IS ONLY A ONE-YEAR 
TERM, SUCCESSION HAS BEEN HELD UP OVER DIFFERENCES ABOUT 
ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SADC.  PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN SADC\'S PREVIOUS CHAIR, FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN 
PRESIDENT MANDELA AND MUGABE, DISCUSSION ON THE ORGAN\'S 
STRUCTURE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SIDELINED.  ALTHOUGH SADC 
TASKED A WORKING GROUP, COMPRISED OF MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI, 
AND NAMIBIA, IN EARLY 1998 TO STUDY THE ISSUE, NEITHER THE 
ISSUE NOR THE GROUP\'S RECOMMENDATION WERE EVEN ADDRESSED AT 
THE 1998 SADC SUMMIT IN MAURITIUS.  HOWEVER, DURING THE 
1999 SUMMIT IN MAPUTO (WHERE SOUTH AFRICA PASSED ON THE 
SADC CHAIRMANSHIP TO MOZAMBIQUE AND THEREBY REMOVED THE 
PERSONAL TENSION BETWEEN MANDELA AND MUGABE FROM THE 
EQUATION), DISCUSSION WAS RE-OPENED AND A COMMITMENT WAS 
MADE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, RESULTING IN THIS RECENT ROUND 
OF SOUTH AFRICAN, ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI MEETINGS. 
 
FROM MINISTERS TO WORKING GROUP 
=============================== 
 
4.  (C)  IN AN OCTOBER 7 MEETING, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS\' (DFA) DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS 
HORST BRAMMER TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY (HE 
WAS SCHEDULED FOR ANNUAL LEAVE) DRAFTED THE WEEK OF 
SEPTEMBER 27 - OCTOBER 1 TO MEET WITH ZIMBABWEAN AND SWAZI 
COUNTERPARTS ON THE ISSUE OF REFORM OF THE ORGAN FOR 
POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY.  THE WEEK-LONG 
\"BRAINSTORMING\" SESSION CONSISTED OF 2-PERSON DELEGATIONS 
(ONE FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND ONE DEFENSE MINISTRY 
OFFICIAL) FROM EACH OF THE THREE COUNTRIES.  ACCORDING TO 
BRAMMER, THIS UNEXPECTED WORKING SESSION CAME ABOUT AS A 
DIRECT RESULT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN, ZIMBABWEAN, AND SWAZI 
DEFENSE MINISTERS\' MEETINGS IN PRETORIA THE WEEK BEFORE 
(THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 21).  ALTHOUGH BRAMMER WELCOMED THE 
INITIATIVE AND NOTED THAT INITIAL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN 
REACHED ON NEXT STEPS, HE NONETHELESS WORRIED THAT THE 
DEFENSE MINISTERS WERE CIRCUMVENTING THE SADC STRUCTURE IN 
THEIR QUEST FOR RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUE. 
 
5.  (C)  AS BRAMMER EXPLAINED, PERMITTING MINISTERS OF 
DEFENSE TO DECIDE ON SADC ISSUES WITHOUT FIRST COORDINATING 
WITH THE SADC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS CREATED A \"PROBLEM OF 
PRINCIPLES.\"  CITING THE EXAMPLES OF SOUTH AFRICAN 
INTERVENTION IN LESOTHO AND ZIMBABWEAN, ANGOLAN, AND 
NAMIBIAN INTERVENTION IN THE DROC (NOMINALLY IN SADC\'S 
NAME), BRAMMMER STRESSED THAT ALLOWING THE MINISTERS OF 
DEFENSE TO \"SOLVE\" THE ORGAN PROBLEM ADDED TO THE OVERALL 
WEAKENING OF SADC LEGITIMACY.  THEREFORE, BRAMMER 
EMPHASIZED THAT THE SAG WOULD INSIST THAT ANY FOLLOW-ON 
MEETINGS BE INCLUSIVE AND ANY MINISTERIALS ADDRESSING THE 
ISSUE INCLUDE FOREIGN MINISTERS.  (COMMENT.  IN AN OCTOBER 
21 CONVERSATION, BRAMMER APPEARED SATISFIED THAT THE 
OCTOBER 26 - 27 MINISTERIAL WILL MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
 
ZIMBABWE SEES THE LIGHT 
======================= 
 
6.  (C)  WITH GREAT RELIEF, BRAMMER NOTED THAT HARARE HAS 
FINALLY BEGUN TO \"UNDERSTAND\" THE SOUTH AFRICA POSITION ON 
THE ORGAN ISSUE.  LAMENTING THE FACT THAT ZIMBABWE HAD 
PERMITTED THE ORGAN ISSUE TO BECOME A PERSONAL ONE (ON THE 
SIDE OF PRESIDENT MUGABE), BRAMMER STRESSED THAT THE SAG 
HAS FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE AT LEAST THE ZIMBABWEAN 
DEFENSE MINISTER THAT SOUTH AFRICA DID NOT WANT TO TAKE 
OVER THE ORGAN, ONLY ENSURE ITS INTEGRATION INTO THE 
OVERALL SADC STRUCTURE.  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, THE 
ZIMBABWEANS NOW HAVE A CLEARER IDEA AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF 
ORGAN INTEGRATION.  RECALLING THAT THE SAG HAD USED THREE 
KEY POINTS TO CONVINCE THE ZIMBABWEANS OF THIS, BRAMMER 
INDICATED THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS FOUND THE KEY POINT OF 
INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION THE MOST COMPELLING (COMMENT. 
THE SAG HAS STRESSED REPEATEDLY THAT THE ORGAN MUST BE PART 
OF SADC OR ELSE IT WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS AN ACTOR IN 
INTERNATIONAL MANDATES, SUCH AS UN CHAPTER 6 0R 7 ACTION. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
7.  (C)  BRAMMER ADDED THAT ONE OF THE SAG\'S OTHER TWO 
POINTS HAD BEEN THAT SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLITICAL ISSUES ARE 
INTRICATELY TIED TO SADC ECONOMIC ONES (I.E., RESOURCE 
CONFLICT CAUSES POLITICAL INSTABILITY), SO THE ORGAN SHOULD 
BE TIED TO SADC FORMALLY.  LASTLY, THE SAG HAD FOCUSED 
ATTENTION ON ZIMBABWE\'S POCKETS, NOTING THAT THE COST OF 
REPLICATING INSTITUTIONS (I.E., A SECRETARIAT FOR BOTH THE 
ORGAN AND SADC) WOULD BE A WASTE OF ALREADY SCARCE 
MONTETARY RESOURCES.  IN THE END, ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, THE 
ZIMBABWEANS AT THE WEEK-LONG CONFERENCE (AND IMPLICITELY 
THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE) ACCEPTED ALL THREE 
ARGUMENTS, WHICH SOMEWHAT SURPRISED, BUT CERTAINLY PLEASED, 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION. 
 
BUT WILL ZIMBABWE PLAY BALL? 
============================ 
 
8.  (C)  ON THE OTHER HAND, BRAMMER TOLD POLOFF THAT EVEN 
DAYS AFTER THIS SUCCESSFUL WORKING COMMITTEE MEETING, 
REPORTS FROM HARARE INDICATED THAT MUGABE WAS BALKING AT 
LENDING FURTHER SUPPORT TO THE DEFENSE MINISTERS\' SCHEME. 
EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER ZIMBABWE\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM, 
BRAMMER COMPLAINED THAT NOT ONLY ZIMBABWE, BUT INCREASINGLY 
NAMIBIA TOO CONTINUED TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR 
INDEPENDENCE FROM SOUTH AFRICA.  (COMMENT.  BRAMMER 
ACCOUNTED FOR NAMIBIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ZIMBABWE- 
ANGOLA-NAMIBIA DEFENSE PACT AS JUST THAT - WINDHOEK\'S SHOW 
OF INDEPENDENCE.  DFA SENTIMENT IS THAT NAMIBIA HAS THE 
RIGHT IDEA, BUT SEEMS TO ALWAYS DEMONSTRATE IT THE WRONG 
WAY.  END COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO BRAMMER, ZIMBABWE WILL 
CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE ISSUE THROUGH BILATERAL DIALOGUE 
(I.E., LEADER TO LEADER), UNTIL AGREEMENT IS REACHED, AND 
ONLY THEN COMMIT TO LARGER INITIATIVES (I.E., SADC REFORM 
OF THE ORGAN).  BRAMMER STRESSED, HOWEVER, THAT IF THE 
MAJORITY OF SADC STATES SUPPORT THE ORGAN\'S INTEGRATION 
INTO SADC (FOR WHICH THE SAG IS KEENLY LOBBYING), IN THE 
END, ZIMBABWE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO AGREE 
 
COMMENT 
======= 
 
9.  (C)  FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA WILL ARRIVE IN SWAZILAND 
WELL-BRIEFED ON THE ORGAN ISSUE (DFA OFFICIALS BRIEFED HER 
OVER A THREE-DAY PERIOD IN CAPE TOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK). 
THE SAG, AWARE THAT MUCH OF MUGABE\'S APPARENT COOPERATION 
ON THE ISSUE IS DUE TO HIS CURRENT \"RAPPROCHEMENT\" WITH 
MBEKI, WILL TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, 
AND TRY FOR CONCRETE COMMITMENTS AT THE MINISTERIAL.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, THE SAG WILL SEEK TO ENSURE AT THE 
MINISTERIAL THAT ORGAN REFORM BECOMES AN INCLUSIVE PROJECT 
AND NOT A DEAL STRUCK BY A FEW IN THE BACK ROOM FOR MANY. 
END COMMENT.

1.  (C)  ALONG WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE REFORM OF SADC\'S 
ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (REF A), SOUTH 
AFRICA IS A KEY PLAYER IN THE OVERALL REFORM OF SADC AS AN 
INSTITUTION.  AS A MEMBER OF THE \"TROIKA PLUS ONE\" (SOUTH 
AFRICA, NAMIBIA, ZIMBABWE, AND MOZAMBIQUE) REFORM COMMITTEE, 
SOUTH AFRICA HAS CONTINUED TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
RESTRUCTURING OF SADC, IN LINE WITH THE 1999 SUMMIT 
COMMUNIQUE.  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' 
(DFA) DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SADC AFFAIRS AJ BRAMDEO, THE REVIEW 
COMMITTEE, WHICH MET IN MID-MARCH, IS SCHEDULED TO MEET AGAIN 
APRIL 12-14 IN MAPUTO.  IN A MARCH 27 MEETING, BRAMDEO TOLD 
POLOFF THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO BE SENDING A DELEGATION 
IN APRIL TO VISIT VARIOUS REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS 
MERCOSUR, CARICOM, AND ECOWAS IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER 
THEY COULD PROVIDE USEFUL GUIDANCE FOR SADC REFORM (COMMENT. 
ON MARCH 31 BRAMDEO TOLD POLOFF THAT SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT 
MBEKI AND MALI PRESIDENT KONARE DISCUSSED POSSIBLE 
SADC-ECOWAS COOPERATION.  SEE REF B.  END COMMENT.) 
 
2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BRAMDEO, THE REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS 
CREATED A \"CLUSTER\" APPROACH TO SADC, WHEREBY ALL THE 
SECTORAL COORDINATING UNITS AND THE COMMISSIONS ON TRANSPORT 
AND ENERGY WOULD BE COLLAPSED INTO 5 CLUSTERS, OVERSEEN BY 
DIRECTORATES.  THESE DIRECTORATES, BRAMDEO TOLD POLOFF, WOULD 
ALL BE LOCATED WITHIN THE SADC SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. 
ALTHOUGH THE REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS NOT YET FINALIZED DETAILS 
SUCH AS CALENDARIZATION OF THE PROCESS, POSITION DESCRIPTION 
DEVELOPMENT, AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES, BRAMDEO 
AFFIRMED THAT IT ENVISIONS THE DIRECTORATES WOULD HAVE A 
TOTAL STAFF OF APPROXIMATELY 50 PERSONS, ALL OF WHOM WOULD BE 
FROM THE SADC REGION.  BRAMDEO STRESSED THAT THE COMMITTEE 
SUPPORTS TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE COMPETITION FOR THESE 
POSITIONS, WITH THE JOBS GOING TO THE MOST QUALIFIED 
APPLICANTS, REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY.  BRAMEDO DID NOT RULE 
OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING SADC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM 
INTERNATIONAL DONORS TO FINANCE THESE CLUSTERS (AND 
SALARIES).  THE CLUSTERS AND THEIR DIRECTORATES WOULD FOCUS 
ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SADC \"PRIORITIES\" (AS DEFINED BY 
THE COORDINATING UNITS), AND ON ESTABLISHING BENCHMARKS AND 
TIMEFRAMES FOR PHASED-IN APPROACHES TO REGIONAL PROJECTS. 
THIS WAY, SAID BRAMDEO, THE INSTITUTION WOULD BETTER BE ABLE 
TO GAUGE ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND SUCCESSES AND FAILURES. 
 
3.  (C)  RECOGNIZING THE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SENSITIVITIES 
(ESPECIALLY FROM THE SMALLER SADC MEMBERS WHO STAND TO LOSE 
THEIR SECTORAL COORDINATING ROLES), BRAMDEO INDICATED THAT 
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE WAS PREPARED TO \"LOBBY\" FOR ITS REFORM 
PROGRAM.  HE SAID THE ORGAN AND SOCIAL REFORM COMMITTEES 
WOULD \"MERGE\" THEIR PROJECTS IN JUNE AND PRESENT THE COMBINED 
RESTRUCTURE PROPOSAL AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, AFTER WHICH 
LOBBYING EFFORTS WOULD BEGIN IN EARNEST. 
 
4.  (C)  ON AN ASIDE, BRAMDEO ADDED THAT THE REVIEW COMMITTEE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NEXT SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY POSSESS 
WELL-DEFINED MANAGERIAL SKILLS AND MEET SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL 
CRITERIA.  BRAMDEO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SADC 
WOULD CHOOSE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR (SUCH AS A 
RETIRED CEO) RATHER THAN SOMEONE FROM THE POLITICAL ARENA FOR 
THE POSITION.  HE SAID THE HEADS OF STATE WOULD HAVE TO 
ADDRESS THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY ISSUE DURING THE NEXT SADC 
SUMMIT IN AUGUST 2000. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA CONTINUES TO WORK WITHIN THE SADC 
SYSTEM IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO STRENGTHEN REGIONAL COOPERATION. 
ALTHOUGH THE REVIEW COMMITTEE\'S PROPOSALS SOUND AMBITIOUS, 
THE LACK OF DETAIL ON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES SUCH AS 
REMUNERATION AND CALENDARIZATION INDICATES THAT THE FRUITION 
OF ANY REFORM IS STILL A LONG TIME IN COMING.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DELANO LEWIS.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. IN A MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR LEWIS, PRESIDENT 
MBEKI DESCRIBED HIS UPCOMING STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO \"SEIZE THE MOMENT\" TO TACKLE PROBLEMS OF 
POVERTY AND LACK OF DEVELOPMENT THAT PLAGUE SOUTH AFRICA.  HE 
SEEKS INVESTMENT FOR SOUTH AFRICA AS A MEANS TO POVERTY 
ALLEVIATION IN A COUNTRY THAT CANNOT COMPETE FAVORABLY FOR 
INVESTORS WITH AN INDIA, CHINA, OR BRAZIL.  MBEKI WANTS TO 
EXPLORE WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON WAYS TO TACKLE THE NEGATIVE 
IMAGE, FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SOUTH AFRICA PRESENTS TO THE 
WORLD AS A COUNTRY RIDDLED WITH CRIME. MBEKI CONTRADICTS THE 
VIEW THAT CRIME IN SOUTH AFRICA IS WORSE THAN ANY PLACE ELSE.

CONTINUES TO HOLD THE VIEW THAT VARYING OPINIONS MUST BE 
HEARD.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT HIS DESIRE

HIS HELP AND CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE TO ENABLE THE PRESIDENT TO

PRETORIA.  PRESIDENT MBEKI WAS JOINED BY THE REV. FRANK 
CHIKANE, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY, 
AND BY ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER AZIZ PAHAD.  THE AMBASSADOR 
REQUESTED THE MEETING TO DISCUSS GOALS FOR THE MBEKI STATE 
VISIT TO THE U.S. MAY 22-23, THE OPTICS OF MBEKI\'S 
CONTROVERSIAL POSITION ON HIV/AIDS, AND THE SITUATION IN 
ZIMBABWE.  REFTEL ADDRESSED ZIMBABWE.  THIS CABLE REVIEWS THE 
DISCUSSION ON MBEKI\'S U.S. STATE VISIT AND HIS HIV/AIDS 
POSTURE. 
 
------------------------------------- 
SEIZING THE MOMENT WITH A STATE VISIT 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) IN RESPONSE TO AN INQUIRY FROM AMBASSADOR LEWIS, 
PRESIDENT MBEKI GROUNDED HIS OBJECTIVES FOR HIS UPCOMING 
STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. IN REMARKS MADE BY PRESIDENT CLINTON 
IN THREE SPEECHES -- BEFORE THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW 
YORK LAST SEPTEMBER, AT DAVOS, AND AT THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN 
RELATIONS IN NEW YORK IN 1998.  MBEKI REMARKED THAT IN THOSE 
SPEECHES, CLINTON HIGHLIGHTED THE ASTOUNDING HIGH NUMBERS OF 
POOR PEOPLE WORLDWIDE; THE TENDENCY OF PHARMACEUTICALS TO 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOP DRUGS THAT DON\'T HELP CURE DISEASES OF 
THE POOR BECAUSE THE POOR COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THOSE 
DRUGS; AND THE ROLE THE INDONESIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS HAD HAD 
IN THRUSTING ENTIRE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES INTO POVERTY. 
SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE.  CLINTON IS RIGHT TO RAISE THESE 
ISSUES, MBEKI SAID, AND THERE IS A \"PARTICULAR MOMENT\" IN 
HISTORY NOW THAT HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO DEAL WITH THEM. 
 
4. (C)   MBEKI CONTINUED THAT HE DID NOT THINK MANY PEOPLE 
UNDERSTOOD THIS ASPECT OF WHAT CLINTON WAS SAYING.  AT THE 
COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, CLINTON EXPRESSED A NEED TO 
LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE, TO SEEK 
STABLE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS, AND TO ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS 
SHORT-TERM  CAPITAL FLOWS AND STRENGTHENING THE BANKING 
SYSTEM.  YET IN THE END, CLINTON IS SAYING THAT ONE IS STILL 
LEFT WITH BILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE.  EVEN RECENTLY, MBEKI 
ADDED, THE CEO OF CITICORP REMARKED THAT THOSE AT THE TOP END 
OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM SHOULD NOT PRESUME THAT THEIR ISSUES 
ARE THE KINDS OF ISSUES THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE WANT 
ADDRESSED.   THIS STATEMENT, MBEKI SAID, INDICATES \"FURTHER 
CHANGE IN THE AIR.\" 
 
------------------------- 
IN SEARCH OF DEVELOPMENT 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C)   THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED TO MBEKI THAT HE APPEARED 
TO BE SAYING THAT HIS U.S. VISIT WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A 
PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES SUCH AS 
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT PRIVATE INVESTMENT COULD VERY WELL FORM 
A PART OF THAT MOMENT.  MBEKI AGREED.  HE SAID ALL 
DEVELOPMENT HAS FOCUSED ON CAPITAL AND THE NEED TO INVEST 
CAPITAL.  AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, PRESIDENT 
CLINTON WAS SAYING THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO GET DIRECT 
INVESTMENT INTO COUNTRIES, BUT WHAT MUST ONE DO?   IF ONE IS 
A CHINA, MBEKI SAID, IT IS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE MARKET 
IS HUGE AND NO ONE CAN STAY AWAY FROM THAT MARKET. BUT WHAT 
OF SOUTH AFRICA WITH ONLY 40 MILLION PEOPLE?  SOUTH AFRICA 
CANNOT ATTRACT THE INVESTMENT OF AN INIDIA, CHINA, OR BRAZIL. 
IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE SOUTH AFRICA ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTMENT? 
HE SPOKE OF POSSIBILITIES USING INTERNAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH 
AS THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PENSION FUND.  \"IF YOU 
POLITICALLY INTERVENE,\" MBEKI CONTINUED, \"YOU MAY BE ABLE TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\"  MBEKI SAID CLINTON UNDERSTOOD THIS NEED 
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN HE SAID THAT POVERTY IS 
INTOLERABLE.  \"BUT HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE DEVELOPMENT?,\" MBEKI 
ASKED. 
 
-------------------------------- 
THE DESIRE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) AMBASSADOR COMMENTED ON HIS PERSONAL BACKGROUND WHICH 
BRINGS 20 PLUS YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO THE \"TIME AND 
MOMENT\" OF HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH AFRICA.  HE 
TOLD MBEKI HE WAS RIGHT THAT SOME PEOPLE DO NOT SEE THE TIME 
AND MOMENT.  HE INDICATED TO MBEKI HIS DESIRE AND THAT OF HIS 
MISSION TO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIM TO SEE IF TOGETHER THEY 
MIGHT SEEK WAYS TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED HIS 
POSITIVE MEETING EARLIER IN THE DAY WITH MEMBERS OF THE 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WHO WERE EXCITED ABOUT BEING IN 
THE SOUTHERN AFRICA REGION AND EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS 
FOR INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. HE ALSO TOLD MBEKI THAT AT 
THE STATE DINNER PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS PLANNING FOR HIM IN 
WASHINGTON, THERE WOULD BE MANY BUSINESS LEADERS AND CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PRESENT.  SOUTH AFRICA MUST CREATE A 
CLIMATE TO ATTRACT THEIR INVESTMENT HERE BY TACKLING ISSUES 
SUCH AS CRIME. IF THERE IS A PERCEIVED LACK OF STABILITY, 
ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS WOULD PROVE MORE DIFFICULT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
THE NEED TO TACKLE SOUTH AFRICA\'S CRIME-RIDDEN IMAGE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (C) FOLLOWING ON AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS, MBEKI MADE THE 
POINT THAT SOMETHING WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA SEEMS TO CONVEY A 
MESSAGE THAT CRIME IS AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM IN SOUTH AFRICA 
WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NO WORSE THAN THAT OF A COUNTRY SUCH AS 
BRAZIL.   IT IS INCORRECT, IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT, MBEKI 
OPINED, TO ATTRIBUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF CRIME TO SOUTH AFRICA. 
MBEKI EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT SUCH TALK IS DRIVEN BY SOUTH 
AFRICANS WHO HAVE PLACED INTO THEIR OWN HEADS AND INTO THE 
HEADS OF OTHERS THE NOTION THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS NOT SAFE. 
WE IN SOUTH AFRICA, HE SAID, \"BEAT THE DRUMS WHEN ONE BANK 
ROBBERY OCCURS\", WHILE IN FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 80 BANK 
ROBBERIES OCCUR PER MONTH, BUT THEY ARE NOT REPORTED IN THE 
PRESS.  THIS IS DONE BECAUSE FRANCE FEARS SUCH STATISTICS 
WOULD GIVE FRANCE A BAD NAME. \"I  DON\'T KNOW HOW,\" HE SAID, 
\'WE TURN THIS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AROUND.\"   MBEKI SAID HE 
WOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH PRESIDENT CINTON DURING THE STATE 
VISIT.  HE ADDED THAT THE MESSAGE ON CRIME MUST ALSO BE 
CONVEYED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
DEALING WITH THE OPTICS OF A CONTROVERSIAL HIV / AIDS POSITION 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
8.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD MBEKI THAT HE WANTED TO RAISE 
WITH HIM THE SCENARIO HE IS LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER UPON HIS 
ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON FOR HIS STATE VISIT, ESPECIALLY IN 
LIGHT OF THE POSITION HE HAS TAKEN ON HIV/AIDS.  THE 
AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT WANT THAT POSITION, AND 
OTHERS\' REACTION TO IT, TO OVERSHADOW THE VISIT AND THE VERY 
POSITIVE THINGS MBEKI IS DOING IN SOUTH AFRICA TO COMBAT 
AIDS.  HE NOTED THAT THE ISSUE HAD DOGGED VICE PRESIDENT GORE 
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND MANY ACTIVISTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE PRESIDENT\'S VIEWS.  WE STAND READY, THE AMBASSADOR 
CONTINUED, TO HELP YOU THINK THROUGH A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 
TO CONFRONT THIS SCENARIO. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HIS 
STATEMENTS HAD NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD.  IT WOULD BE 
HELPFUL NOW TO STRESS THE POSITIVE THINGS BEING DONE IN SOUTH 
AFRICA TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT 
THIS COULD COMPLEMENT THE VERY POSITIVE STATEMENTS BOTH 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY SUSAN RICE AND PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE 
ABOUT HIS LETTER ON HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT ACTIVISTS MIGHT ATTEMPT TO BOYCOTT THE DURBAN 
CONFERENCE ON AIDS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN JULY. 
 
9. (C)  MBEKI NODDED IN AGREEMENT, SAYING HE AND HIS STAFF 
HAD DISCUSSED APPROACHES TO THE SCENARIO THE AMBASSADOR 
DESCRIBED.  YET HE DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BOYCOTT THE 
DURBAN CONFERENCE.  HE LAMENTED THAT THE ORGANIZERS OF THE 
DURBAN CONFERENCE APPEARED TO WANT TO BAR EXHIBITS THAT DID 
NOT DOVETAIL WITH THEIR VIEWS.  AS SUCH, THEY HAD WITHDRAWN 
PERMISSION FOR AN ACT-UP SAN FRANCISCO EXHIBITION, SAYING 
\"OTHER NGOS\" HAD BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THEIR POINT OF VIEW. 
THIS GROUP SUPPORTED DISSENTING VIEWS.  THE PRESIDENT\'S LEGAL 
ADVOCATE MOJANKU GUMBI HAD DETERMINED THAT THE ACTION OF THE 
ORGANIZERS WAS ILLEGAL.  IN THE END, ACT-UP SAN FRANCISCO WAS 
GRANTED PERMISSION TO PUT UP ITS EXHIBIT, BUT THE PASSING OF 
TIME HAD MEANT THERE WERE NO LONGER SPACES IN THE MAIN 
EXHIBIT HALL.  WHAT IS TROUBLING, MBEKI SAID, IS THAT PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY DIFFER WITH YOUR VIEWS, 
DISCUSSION OF YOUR VIEWS IS NOT PERMITTED.  MBEKI SAID 
DESPITE ACT-UP\'S DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE LOCATION ASSIGNED TO 
THEIR EXHIBIT, HE HAD INSTRUCTED HIS MINISTER OF HEALTH TO 
PUT THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN WRITING TO THE ORGANIZERS, BUT 
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISRUPTION OF CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. 
 
10. (C) FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, REV. 
CHIKANE ASKED IF THE AMBASSADOR MIGHT MEET WITH HIM TO 
DISCUSS FURTHER POSSIBLE COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES THE 
PRESIDENT MIGHT USE IN WASHINGTON TO TACKLE THE NEGATIVE 
PUBLICITY OF MBEKI\'S STANCE ON HIV/AIDS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
AGREED TO DO SO. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
11. (C) PRESIDENT MBEKI WAS VERY UPBEAT ABOUT HIS VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON AND HIS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT 
CLINTON, AS A \"FRIEND OF AFRICA\", PERMEATED HIS REMARKS. WHAT 
MBEKI WANTS MOST TO ACHIEVE IS INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT FOR 
SOUTH AFRICA. THAT REMAINS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF HIS VISIT 
AGENDA. ON HIS CONTROVERSIAL HIV/AIDS POSITION, WE DO NOT 
EXPECT TO SEE CHANGE.  WE DO EXPECT, HOWEVER, THAT MBEKI WILL 
MOVE EARLY ON IN HIS VISIT TO POINT OUT THE POSITIVE ASPECTS 
OF HIS HIV/AIDS PROGRAM.  THE AMBASSADOR WILL FOLLOW THROUGH 
ON A MEETING WITH CHIKANE TO EXPLORE VIABLE OPTIONS FOR MBEKI 
IN THIS AREA.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DELANO E. LEWIS. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:   RECENT ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT 
MBEKI HAVE RAISED CAUTION FLAGS ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO ACCEPT 
CRITICISM AND MANAGE COLLEGIALLY.  THE CHALLENGE FOR U.S. 
OFFICIALS WILL BE TO ACCEPT THIS IMPORTANT, BUT 
HYPERSENSITIVE, AFRICAN FIGURE AS HE IS, AND BUILD A 
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE.  POST STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT HE BE 
INVITED TO WASHINGTON EARLY ON TO BEGIN BUILDING THAT 
DIALOGUE. END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C) THE CONTROVERSIAL INVESTIGATION OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S 
1999 $4 BILLION ARMS PURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS SO FAR REVEALED 
LITTLE ABOUT THE ARMS TRADE, BUT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT PRESIDENT 
MBEKI AND THE MINDSET OF HIS KEY ADVISORY TEAM.   AS DETAILED 
IN REFS A-G, PRESIDENT MBEKI AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE 
VIGOROUSLY, SOMETIMES ANGRILY AND SHRILLY, RESISTED CALLS FOR 
AN INVESTIGATION OF THE TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNIT OF JUSTICE WILLIAM HEATH, 
ESTABLISHED BY MBEKI\'S BELOVED PREDECESSOR NELSON MANDELA. 
THEY ARGUE THAT SUITABLE AND COMPETENT INVESTIGATORY 
INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY EXIST, OBVIATING 
THE NEED FOR ANOTHER INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR. WE ARE 
INCLINED TO AGREE WITH THE SAG ON THE CORE QUESTION THAT THE 
SANDF NEEDED TO PURCHASE SOME NEW EQUIPMENT, AND THE PRICE 
THEY WILL PAY IS REASONABLE.  WE CAN ONLY OBSERVE FROM THE 
SIDELINES THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND 
JUDICIAL BRANCHES, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH ESTATE, ON THE ARMS 
DEAL INVESTIGATION AND HOPE THAT SOUTH AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO 
RULE OF LAW IS ULTIMATELY VINDICATED.  BUT THE LARGER ISSUE 
REMAINS FOR US OF HOW TO JUDGE, AND BUILD A DIALOGUE WITH, 
THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF THIS DEBATE. 
 
3.  (C) THIS LATEST EPISODE IS ONE OF SEVERAL WORRISOME 
SIGNALS FROM MBEKI AND HIS CAMP THAT RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
HIS JUDGMENT.  MBEKI\'S RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT OVERWHELMING 
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON HIV/AIDS HAS BEEN MUCH NOTED AND 
DISCUSSED IN INTERNATIONAL CIRCLES AND WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA. 
HIS FAILURE TO SPEAK OUT ON CLEAR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF 
LAW VIOLATIONS TAKING PLACE IN MUGABE\'S ZIMBABWE HAS ALSO 
BROUGHT HIM MUCH CRITICISM AND HAVE CLEARLY HURT INVESTOR 
CONFIDENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S ECONOMY IN THE PROCESS.  MBEKI\'S 
RELIANCE ON A CORE OF ADVISORS THAT LACK THE EXPERIENCE AND 
DIPLOMATIC SEASONING ALSO UNDERCUTS MBEKI\'S IMAGE EARLY-ON OF 
THE COOLLY RATIONAL MANAGER. THE MINISTER IN THE OFFICE OF 
THE PRESIDENCY ESSOP PAHAD HAS LAUNCHED BLISTERING ATTACKS ON 
THE PRESS WHEN HIS BOSS IS CRITICIZED.  HIS LEGAL ADVISOR 
MOJANKU GUMBI, RUMORED TO BE MBEKI\'S MISTRESS (OR ONE OF 
THEM), OFFERED HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LEGAL ADVICE ON THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF INCLUDING HEATH IN THE ARMS 
INVESTIGATION. HIS FORMER SPOKESPERSON, THE LATE PARKS 
MANKAHLANA HAD LOST ALMOST ALL CREDIBILITY WITH HIS KEY 
AUDIENCE, THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS IN THE MONTHS BEFORE HE 
DIED OF A DISEASE THAT MOST WERE CONVINCED WAS AIDS, BUT HE 
WOULD NEVER ADMIT. MBEKI REMAINS UNBLINKINGLY LOYAL TO 
CABINET MINISTERS, SUCH AS THE OFTEN INSULTING AND 
THOUGHTLESS MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY STEVE TSHWETE, 
WHO OUTRAGED THE PORTUGUESE COMMUNITY HERE BY QUESTIONING 
THEIR PATRIOTISM WHEN THEY CRITICIZED MBEKI\'S HANDLING OF 
CRIME ISSUES, OR THE TRUCULENT AND PETULANT FOREIGN MINISTER 
NKOSAZANA DLAMINI-ZUMA (REF H), OR HIS HEALTH MINISTER WHO 
CIRCULATED TO THE ENTIRE CABINET LARGE SECTIONS OF A BOOK BY 
AN TOTALLY DISCREDITED AIDS DENIER. 
 
4.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA\'S REPORTERS AND EDITORS HAVE BROUGHT 
THESE INADEQUACIES TO THE PUBLIC\'S ATTENTION WITH UNRELENTING 
ZEAL.  EVEN PAPERS HISTORICALLY SYMPATHETIC TO MBEKI AND THE 
ANC, SUCH AS THE SOWETAN HAVE JOINED A CHORUS OF CRITICS 
QUESTIONING MBEKI\'S LEADERSHIP.  SIPHO SEEPE, FOR EXAMPLE, A 
POLITICAL ANALYST SYMPATHETIC TO THE ANC, WRITING IN THE 
SOWETAN ASKED IF MBEKI IS FIT TO GOVERN.   IN RESPONSE, MBEKI 
AND HIS TEAM OF ADVISORS HAVE TAKEN EXACTLY THE WRONG TACK. 
THEY ACCUSE THE PRESS OF RACISM (ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE IT IS PREDOMINANTLY BLACK), OR OF BEING A MOUTHPIECE 
OF OPPOSITION PARTIES, OR OF HAVING A PERSONAL VENDETTA 
AGAINST MBEKI.  MBEKI\'S AND THE ANC\'S SOLUTION TO THIS 
\"PROBLEM\" IS NOT TO ENGAGE THE MEDIA ON AN INTELLECTUAL BASIS 
BUT RATHER TO SET UP ITS OWN \"NEWS\" WEBSITE TO \"INFORM\" SOUTH 
AFRICA\'S PEOPLE (PRESUMABLY THOSE WITH COMPUTERS) WHO HAVE 
BEEN \"MISINFORMED\" ON THE ISSUES. 
 
5.  (C) WHY MBEKI, WHOSE INTELLIGENCE IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED 
AND WHO IS WELL RESPECTED PERSONALLY, SHOULD EXHIBIT A 
TENDENCY TOWARD SHRILLNESS AND DEFENSIVENESS IS HOTLY 
DEBATED.   SOME SPECULATE THAT MBEKI AND THE MAJORITY OF ANC 
LEADERS AND OFFICE HOLDERS ARE STILL HANDICAPPED BY THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST APARTHEID.  THEN, ENEMIES 
WERE EVERYWHERE AND THE WORLD FIT VERY NEATLY INTO SHADES OF 
BLACK AND WHITE.  OTHERS SEE MBEKI AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MUST 
ALWAYS BE RIGHT.  WHEN THE FORCE OF MEDICAL AND PUBLIC 
OPINION ON THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN HIV AND AIDS GREW TOO 
GREAT, MBEKI ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS \"WITHDRAWING\" FROM THE 
DEBATE RATHER THAN ADMIT THAT HE POSSIBLY HAD ERRED.    MBEKI 
HAS POSITED THE VIEW THAT NONE OF THE CRITICISMS HE HAS 
RECEIVED WORRIES HIM BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY AREN\'T TRUE, AS HE 
TOLD THE EDITOR OF DRUM MAGAZINE RECENTLY.   IN THAT SAME 
INTERVIEW, MBEKI SAID THE OPPOSITION WANTS SOMETHING BAD TO 
HAPPEN IN SOUTH AFRICA \"SO THEY CAN THEN SAY \'LOOK HOW BAD 
THIS GOVERNMENT IS.\'\" 
 
6.  (C)  ULTIMATELY, NO ONE KNOWS WHY MBEKI SOMETIMES 
DISPLAYS THIS IRRATIONAL SIDE, OR WHEN IT WILL MANIFEST NEXT. 
CERTAINLY, HE IS MORE FREQUENTLY REASONABLE, INTELLIGENT, 
AND CAPABLE, AS HE DEMONSTRATED AGAIN IN THE FEBRUARY 9 STATE 
OF THE NATION ADDRESS. MBEKI IS AN AVID READER AND IS ACUTELY 
AWARE OF THE CRITICISMS BEING LEVIED AGAINST HIM.  HE MUST 
ALSO BE AWARE OF THE STREAM OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MEDIA 
THAT HE SHOULD SURROUND HIMSELF WITH AN ADVISORY TEAM THAT IS 
INTELLIGENT, WELL VERSED IN CURRENT AFFAIRS, AND ABLE TO MAKE 
RATIONAL DECISIONS. 
 
7.  (C) USG OFFICIALS MEETING WITH MBEKI SHOULD BE PREPARED 
TO RECOGNIZE HIS DEFENSIVENESS AND HIGH SENSITIVITY TO 
CRITICISM. GIVEN HIS CURRENT GRIP ON THE REINS OF THE ANC, WE 
ANTICIPATE THAT HE WILL BE A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE FOR SOME TIME TO COME. IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT HIS CONTROL OF THE ANC COULD WEAKEN OVER THE 
LONGER TERM, AS LACK OF DELIVERY ON SOCIAL ISSUES BEGINS TO 
JEOPARDIZE HIS AND HIS PARTY\'S PREDOMINANCE.  HIS PERCEIVED 
FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE HIV EPIDEMIC, IN 
PARTICULAR, COULD MAKE HIM VULNERABLE TO GRASSROOTS 
OPPOSITION, POSSIBLY FROM WOMEN\'S GROUPS.THE NEXT NATIONAL 
ELECTIONS ARE NOT UNTIL 2004, HOWEVER, AND THE TWO-TERM LIMIT 
IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION COULD ALLOW HIM TO SERVE 
UNTIL 2009. 
 
8.  (C) DIALOGUE WITH THIS ESSENTIAL AFRICAN LEADER SHOULD BE 
COUCHED IN POSITIVE, SUPPORTIVE LANGUAGE, IN THE HOPE OF 
BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CROSS SWORDS 
WITH HIM AT A LATER DATE IF WE HAVE TO. AMBASSADOR LEWIS HAS 
ALREADY BEGUN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
MBEKI THAT ENCOURAGES MBEKI TO ADOPT A MORE MODERATE TONE 
WITH HIS ADVERSARIES AND A LESS CONTROVERSIAL STANCE ON 
CRITICAL ISSUES (SUCH AS HIV/AIDS) THAT AFFECT THE WELL-BEING 
OF SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
9.  (C) WE RECOMMEND INITIATING AN EARLY AND HIGH-LEVEL 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND MBEKI.  HE HAS MADE 
IT KNOWN TO US THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVITED TO WASHINGTON 
BEFORE NELSON MANDELA, WHOSE GLOBAL STATURE HAS SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH MBEKI\'S OCCASIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF A FRAGILE EGO. 
WE SUPPORT HIS REQUEST AND HOPE WASHINGTON WILL BE ABLE TO 
ACCOMMODATE THIS BRILLIANT, PRICKLY LEADER OF AFRICA\'S MOST 
IMPORTANT STATE.

AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI WAS 
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MARCH 9 SADC SUMMIT DID NOT SELECT THE 
SUCCESSOR TO ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AS CHAIR OF THE 
ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY.  SAG OFFICIALS 
INDICATED MARCH 13 THAT MBEKI PREFERRED THIS DECISION BE MADE 
IN WINDHOEK SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THE ORGAN\'S CHAIRMANSHIP DID 
INDEED ROTATE IN AUGUST 2001.  SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS APPEAR 
PLEASED WITH THE SUMMIT\'S APPROVAL OF SADC\'S RESTRUCTURING 
EXERCISE BUT STRESSED THAT MUCH WORK NEEDED TO BE DONE TO 
ACHIEVE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS BY 
THE TWO-YEAR TARGET DATE.  ON ZIMBABWE, SAG OFFICIALS 
MAINTAINED THAT THE ISSUE \"SIMPLY WAS NOT DISCUSSED\" AT 
SUMMIT.  ON THE DROC, SAG OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT MAURITIUS 
OFFERED TO HOST THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ORGAN REFORM - SAG RELIEF BUT DOUBTS REMAIN 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  AT A MARCH 13 BRIEFING TO EUROPEAN UNION DIPLOMATS 
WHICH POLOFF ATTENDED, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\' (DFA) 
CHIEF DIRECTOR FOR SADC AFFAIRS G KUDJOE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR 
SADC POLITICAL AFFAIRS AJ BRAMDEO, AND SADC GENERAL AFFAIRS 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY WENDY RAUCH TOLD THE ASSEMBLED AUDIENCE 
THAT ZIMBABWE\'S REPORT TO THE SUMMIT ON REFORM OF THE ORGAN 
FOR POLITICS, DEFENSE, AND SECURITY (THE ORGAN) CONTAINED NO 
SURPRISES.  THE SADC SUMMIT UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO SUPPORT 
THE YEARLY ROTATION OF THE ORGAN CHAIR BEGINNING IN AUGUST 
2001, WHEN THE SUMMIT WOULD SELECT A NEW CHAIR.  ZIMBABWEAN 
PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE CURRENT ORGAN CHAIR, WOULD RETAIN THIS 
POSITION IN THE INTERIM PERIOD AND WOULD BECOME A MEMBER OF 
THE ORGAN TROIKA (COMPOSED OF CURRENT, PAST, AND FUTURE ORGAN 
CHAIR) IN AUGUST.  KUDJOE INDICATED THAT THE SUMMIT WOULD 
ALSO SELECT THE FUTURE ORGAN CHAIR AT THE BLANTYRE SUMMIT. 
ASIDE FROM STATING THAT THE ORGAN CHAIR COULD NOT 
SIMULTANEOUSLY HOLD THE SADC CHAIRMANSHIP, KUDJOE GAVE NO 
INDICATION AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE NEXT TWO CHAIRS. 
 
3.  (C)  BOTH KUDJOE AND BRAMDEO EXPLAINED HOW SOUTH AFRICAN 
PRESIDENT MBEKI ATTEMPTED TO SECURE THE NAMING OF THE NEXT 
SADC CHAIR AT THE WINDHOEK SUMMIT, ONLY TO MEET WITH NO 
RESPONSE FROM HIS FELLOW SADC HEADS OF STATE.  THE SAG, SAID 
KUDJOE, WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE NAMING OF THE NEXT 
CHAIR IN ORDER TO \"CLOSE THE CHAPTER\" ON ORGAN REFORM. 
BRAMDEO INDICATED THAT THE SAG WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THIS AS 
ADDED ASSURANCE THAT THE CHAIRMANSHIP WOULD INDEED ROTATE IN 
AUGUST.  NEVERTHELESS, SOUTH AFRICA FIRMLY SUPPORTS SADC 
SUMMIT\'S OVERALL DECISION ON ORGAN REFORM, CONCLUDED KUDJOE. 
 
4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, THE ORGAN\'S CHAIR WOULD PROVIDE 
ITS OWN SECRETARIAT WHICH WOULD BE HOUSED WITH THE SADC 
SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. 
 
SUPPORT FOR RAMSAMY AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA FULLY SUPPORTS FORMER ACTING EXECUTIVE 
SECRETARY RAMSAMY AS THE NEW SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, SAID 
BRAMDEO.  GOING TO SOME PAINS TO DESCRIBE RAMSAMY\'S 
APPOINTMENT PROCESS,  NAMIBIAN FIRST SECRETARY SACKY SHIVUTE 
TOLD POLOFF MARCH 14 THAT AFTER A \"LONG AND INTENSIVE\" 
INTERVIEW PROCESS, THE SADC TROIKA PLUS SOUTH AFRICA AND 
ZIMBABWE CHOSE RAMSAMY AS THE \"BEST\" CANDIDATE FOR EXECUTIVE 
SECRETARY.  SHIVUTE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ANGOLA MOUNTED A 
SERIOUS LOBBYING CAMPAIGN ON BEHALF OF ITS CANDIDATE, BUT 
THAT RAMSAMY WAS JUDGED THE BETTER CANDIDATE.  RATHER 
UNCHARITABLY, SHIVUTE ADDED ON AN ASIDE THAT MUCH OF 
RAMSAMY\'S SUCCESS AS ACTING EXECUTIVE SECRETARY WAS PROBABLY 
DUE TO HIS \"PROFESSIONAL\" SUPPORT STAFF. 
 
6.  (C)  ACCORDING TO BRAMDEO, THE SADC SUMMIT REALIZES THAT 
BOTH SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND SECRETARIAT NEEDED TO BE 
STRENGTHENED TO OVERSEE THE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. 
SADC, SAID BRAMDEO, NEEDED TO BETTER DEFINE THE MANDATE OF 
BOTH THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND THE SECRETARIAT.  THE SADC 
TREATY NEEDED TO BE AMENDED, ADDED KUDJOE, TO RESTRUCTURE THE 
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY APPOINTMENT PROCESS FROM AN ELECTION 
FORMAT TO ONE BASED ON \"JOB INTERVIEWS.\" 
 
7.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM AN EU DIPLOMAT, 
BRAMDEO EXPLAINED THAT SADC DECIDED NOT TO UPGRADE THE 
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY POSITION TO A SECRETARY GENERAL POSITION 
BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD ENTAIL REDEFINING HIS RELATIONSHIP 
VIS-A-VIS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE OAU\'S 
SECRETARY GENERAL.  FURTHER, SAID BRAMDEO, WITH REGARD TO 
FUTURE APPOINTMENTS, SADC IS ANTICIPATING INTEREST FROM 
APPLICANTS SUCH AS REGIONAL MINISTERS OR CEO\'S OF LARGE 
COMPANIES.  IF THE POSITION WERE UPGRADED TO THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL LEVEL, APPROPRIATE APPLICANTS WOULD HAVE TO BE AT THE 
HEADS OF STATE LEVEL. 
 
SECTOR COORDINATING UNIT REFORM 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  THE SAG OFFICIALS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE APPROVED 
PROPOSAL FOR CONSOLIDATING THE SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS 
(SCUS) INTO FOUR DIRECTORATES:  TRADE, INDUSTRY, FINANCE, AND 
INVESTMENT; FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES; 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES; AND SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 
AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS (REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORM PROCESS WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY 
AND THE TRADE DIRECTORATE SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL BY AUGUST 
2001.  ALL FOUR DIRECTORATES WILL BE BASED IN GABORONE. 
 
9.  (C)  COST IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REFORMED SADC REMAIN 
SKETCHY, SAID KUDJOE.  SHE REVIEWED THE POSSIBLE FORMULAS: 
ASSESSMENT RATES BASED ON GDP, POPULATION SIZE, A COMBINATION 
OF THE TWO, OR RETAINING THE CURRENT STRUCTURE.  KUDJOE 
OPINED THAT PLACING TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMBER STATES\' 
POPULATION COULD PREJUDICE THE DROC AND TANZANIA, TWO OF THE 
REGION\'S MOST POPULATED STATES ASIDE FROM SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
10.  (C)  ALSO UNCLEAR, CONTINUED BRAMDEO, IS THE REFORMED 
SADC STAFFING PATTERNS.  SOME SCUS WITH LARGE STAFFS WOULD 
PROBABLY END UP RETRENCHING NUMEROUS OFFICIALS WHILE OTHERS 
MIGHT RETAIN MORE.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOUTH AFRICA CURRENTLY PLANS 
TO SEND ABOUT TWO OF ITS EIGHT-PERSON FINANCE SCU TO 
GABORONE.  KUDJOE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE 
SECRETARIAT\'S GABORONE STAFF WOULD INCREASE, WITH AN 
ENVISIONED MINIMUM OF 129. 
 
11.  (C)  SOUTH AFRICA WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE INITIAL 
IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD OF TWO YEARS ACCELERATED, WITH THE 
PHASING OUT OF THE SCUS TAKING PLACE IN LESS TIME THAN THIS. 
THE MORE RAPIDLY THE UNITS CAN BE DISMANTLED, THE SOONER THE 
FOUR NEW DIRECTORATES CAN BE ESTABLISHED, STRESSED KUDJOE. 
 
12.  (C)  AN INTEGRATED COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS (SEPARATE FROM 
THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS) WILL OVERSEE THE DIRECTORATES\' 
PROGRAMS AND WILL ASSIST THE SCUS IN DISMANTLING AND 
TRANSFERRING TO GABORONE.  BY THE END OF DECEMBER, SAID 
BRAMDEO, THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE ORGANIZED A REGIONAL 
INDICATIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 
 
TREATY AMENDMENT 
---------------- 
 
13.  (C)  KUDJOE MAINTAINED THAT SADC WOULD EMBARK ON THE 
SADC TREATY AMENDMENT PROCESS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE TARGET OF 
PRESENTING THE AMENDMENT PROPOSALS TO THE BLANTYRE SUMMIT IN 
AUGUST 2001 FOR APPROVAL. 
 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
-------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  THE SADC SUMMIT AGREED THAT THE COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS SHOULD MEET FOUR TIMES A YEAR INSTEAD OF THE 
CURRENT TWICE A YEAR PROGRAM. 
 
DROC 
---- 
 
15.  (C)  KUDJOE COMMENTED THAT DROC PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA 
SPOKE \"WELL\" AT WINDHOEK.  MAURITIUS, AS A CURRENT UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER, OFFERED TO HOST THE DROC\'S NATIONAL 
DIALOGUE. 
 
COMESA 
------ 
 
16.  (C)  SADC SUMMIT DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE INCREASED TIES 
WITH COMESA AT THIS TIME, REPORTED KUDJOE, BUT SUPPORTED 
\"COLLABORATING\" WITH COMESA ON SELECT ISSUES. 
 
ZIMBABWE 
-------- 
 
17.  (C)  ACCORDING TO KUDJOE, ZIMBABWE \"SIMPLY DID NOT COME 
UP\" AT WINDHOEK.  SHE ADDED THAT IT WAS UNFAIR TO BE ASKED 
(AS ONE EU DIPLOMAT DID) WHY SOUTH AFRICA DID NOT RAISE THIS 
SUBJECT AT THE SUMMIT.  \"WHY NOT ASK MALAWI,\" DIRECTED 
KUDJOE.  SHE CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT THE SUMMIT WAS NOT THE 
PROPER FORA FOR DISCUSSING EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (C)  AFTER EXPENDING COUNTLESS MAN-HOURS TO THE ORGAN 
REVIEW PROCESS, SOUTH AFRICA CAN BARELY WAIT FOR THE REFORM 
TO BE COMPLETED ONCE AND FOR ALL.  THE SAG WILL NOT REST EASY 
UNTIL A NEW ORGAN CHAIR IS FINALLY NAMED.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NEXT STEPS IN THE \"NEW AFRICAN INITIATIVE\": THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW 
 
CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER/COUNSELOR ROBERT F. GODEC FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) THE AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT LAST JULY MERGED THE MAP AND 
OMEGA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO CREATE THE \"NEW AFRICAN 
INITIATIVE.\"  SAG DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MAP/NAI 
ISSUES COORDINATOR DAVID MALCOMSON BRIEFED EMBOFFS ON NEXT 
STEPS IN THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PROCESS.  INITIALLY A 15 
NATION HEADS OF STATE GROUP WILL DEFINE THE TERMS OF 
ADMISSION FOR OTHER COUNTRIES, REQUISITE CODES OF POLITICAL 
AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND PRIORITY SECTORS AND PROJECTS. 
 
2. (C) CHOOSING THE 15 \"FOUNDER\" STATES WILL BE AN EARLY 
DETERMINANT OF THE NASCENT INITIATIVE\'S INTERNATIONAL 
CREDIBILITY.  THE NORTH AFRICAN GROUP WILL CHOOSE EITHER 
TUNISIA OR LIBYA.  LIBYA\'S AU CLOUT IS CONSIDERABLE, BUT 
MALCOMSON SAID \"THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA.\" 
 
3. (C) THE \"PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT\" SECTION OF THE 
\"PROGRAMME OF ACTION,\" WHICH MALCOMSON SAID IS KEY TO THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THE DOCUMENT, COMMITS THE LEADERSHIP TO 
CONSIDER DETAILED AND COSTED MEASURES FOCUSED ON SUCH KEY 
AREAS AS CONFLICT PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION, PEACEMAKING AND 
ARMS PROLIFERATION.  SIMILARLY, THE \"ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE\" REQUIRES PARTICIPATING STATES TO PUSH 
FOR A SET OF TIMEBOUND AND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ENHANCING THE 
QUALITY OF ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. 
MALCOMSON NOTED THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY 
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO FRUSTRATE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING 
THESE GOALS. 
 
4. (C) MEMBERS OF THE MAP/NAI STEERING COMMITTEE WILL TRAVEL TO 
WASHINGTON, NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA IN COMING WEEKS TO 
PROMOTE AND BUILD SUPPORT FOR THIS INITIATIVE.  A FINANCING 
SUMMIT IS SLATED FOR JANUARY 2002, A DATE WHICH MAY BE PUSHED 
BACK TO ALLOW THE MAP/NAI SECRETARIAT TO COMPLETE WORK ON 
DEFINING GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
THE \"NEW AFRICAN INITIATIVE\" IS BORN 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) THE JULY AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT IN LUSAKA ADOPTED A \"NEW 
AFRICAN INITIATIVE\" MERGING THE RIVAL MAP AND OMEGA 
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.  SOUTH AFRICAN DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS COORDINATOR FOR MAP/NAI ISSUES DAVID MALCOMSON 
BRIEFED ECONOFF FREUND AND POLOFF MCNAMARA AUGUST 22 ON NEXT 
STEPS ON THIS CENTRAL LEGACY INITIATIVE OF THE MBEKI 
PRESIDENCY.  IN THE NAI (WHICH SOUTH AFRICA HOPES TO RENAME 
MAP, IF ONLY BECAUSE \"NAI\" IS AN AFRIKAANS OBSCENITY) AN 
INITIAL 15 NATION HEADS OF STATE GROUP WILL DEFINE THE TERMS 
OF TERMS OF ADMISSION OF OTHER AFRICAN STATES, THEIR CODE OF 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND THE PRIORITY SECTORS AND 
PROJECTS FOR FUNDING FROM BOTH INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
SOURCES. 
 
6. (C) THE FIFTEEN ORIGINAL STATES WILL BE DRAWN THREE EACH 
FROM THE FIVE AFRICAN SUB-REGIONS, AND WILL INCLUDE THE 
ORIGINAL MAP/OMEGA DRAFTERS SOUTH AFRICA, NIGERIA, ALGERIA, 
SENEGAL, AND EGYPT. SADC HAS ALREADY AGREED THAT THE OTHER 
TWO SOUTHERN AFRICAN STATES WILL BE MOZAMBIQUE AND BOTSWANA. 
THE OTHER REGIONS WILL PROBABLY SELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES 
THROUGH CONSULTATIONS IN ADDIS ABABA, MALCOMSON EXPLAINED. 
 
7. (C) A KEY EARLY TEST FOR THE PROCESS WILL BE NORTH AFRICA\'S 
CHOICE.  WITH EGYPT AND ALGERIA ALREADY IN, AND MOROCCO NOT 
AN AU MEMBER, THE CHOICE COMES DOWN TO TUNISIA AND LIBYA. 
\"THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA\", MALCOMSON CONFIDED 
CONFIDENTIALLY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LIBYA HAS CONSIDERABLE 
CLOUT WITHIN THE AU, (AND IS GENERALLY CREDITED WITH 
TRANSFORMING THE OAU INTO THE AU), BUT LIBYAN MEMBERSHIP 
WOULD SEVERELY DAMAGE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NASCENT 
INITIATIVE, MALCOMSON BELIEVED. 
 
---------------------------- 
PEACE AND GOVERNANCE ARE KEY 
---------------------------- 
 
8. (C) MALCOMSON UNDERLINED THE SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW THAT THE 
\"PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT\" SECTION OF THE MAP \"PROGRAMME 
OF ACTION\" WAS KEY TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT. 
(FULL TEXT AT WWW.MAPSTRATEGY.COM OR WWW.DFA.GOV.ZA)  IN 
SPITE OF OPPOSITION BY SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING 
SENEGAL\'S WADE, THE SAG INSISTED ON LANGUAGE MEMORIALIZING 
THE \"PEACE, SECURITY AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES\" 
AND THE \"ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE.\"  THE 
FIRST COMMITS THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP TO CONSIDER, 
WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT, DETAILED AND COSTED 
MEASURES IN EACH OF FOUR KEY AREAS: 
 
A)    PREVENTION, MANAGEMENT AND RESOLUTION OF CONFLICT; 
 
B)    PEACEMAKING, PEACEKEEPING AND PEACE ENFORCEMENT; 
 
C)    POST-CONFLICT RECONCILIATION, REHABILITATION AND 
RECONSTRUCTION; AND 
 
D)    COMBATING THE ILLICIT PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS, 
LIGHT WEAPONS AND LANDMINES. 
 
9. (C) THE MAP DOCUMENT SPECIFIES THAT THIS EXERCISE WILL 
INCLUDE THE ACTIONS REQUIRED OF PARTNERS AND THE NATURE AND 
SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES. 
 
10.(C) SIMILARLY, THE \"ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
INITIATIVE\" CALLS UPON THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP TO 
\"PROMOTE THROUGHOUT THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES A SET OF 
CONCRETE AND TIMEBOUND PROGRAMMES AIMED AT ENHANCING THE 
QUALITY OF ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AS WELL 
AS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.\"  BY WAY OF IMPLEMENTATION, A TASK 
TEAM FROM MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND CENTRAL BANKS \"WILL BE 
COMMISSIONED TO REVIEW ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
PRACTICES IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, AND MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON APPROPRIATE STANDARDS AND CODES OF GOOD 
PRACTICE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE HEADS OF STATE 
IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE WITHIN SIX MONTHS.\" 
 
11. (C) MALCOMSON NOTED THAT THESE COMMITMENTS PLACE SECURELY 
UPON AFRICAN COUNTRIES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ESTABLISHING 
AND PRESERVING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT. 
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN PARTICIPATING 
COUNTRIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY BY OTHER MAP STATES AND 
ALL WILL HAVE A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP BRING 
NONCONFORMING GOVERNMENTS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH MUTUALLY 
AGREED MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CODES OF GOOD PRACTICE. 
MALCOMSON EMPHASIZED THAT, UNLIKE IN THE PAST, CONSIDERATIONS 
OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO FRUSTRATE THE 
PROCESS.  THERE WILL BE STRONG PRESSURE TO CONFORM TO AGREED 
UPON STANDARDS AND THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP WILL NOT 
HESITATE TO ENGAGE MEMBER STATES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 
CONSIDERED TOO INTRUSIVE IN THE PAST. 
 
12. (C) THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WILL WORK THROUGH A \"YELLOW 
CARD/RED CARD\" MECHANISM DRAWN FROM THE WORLD OF SOCCER. THIS 
MECHANISM WAS FIRST ADOPTED BY THE OAU IN 1999, AT SOUTH 
AFRICA\'S URGING, WITH REGARDS TO NON-CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES 
OF GOVERNMENT.  A NON-CONFORMING COUNTRY IS FIRST WARNED 
(YELLOW CARD) AND GIVEN ONE YEAR TO RECTIFY ITS BEHAVIOR. 
FAILING THAT, IT IS TEMPORARILY EXPELLED FROM THE 
ORGANIZATION (RED CARD). 
 
-------------------------------------- 
IMPLEMENTATION AND SECTORAL PRIORITIES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) MALCOMSON RECALLED THAT DURING THE G8 MEETING IN GENOA 
THE FOLLOWING SECTORAL PRIORITIES HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED: 
 
A)    INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT); 
B)    MARKET ACCESS; 
C)    DEBT RELIEF; AND 
D)    COMMUNICABLE DISEASES - (HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND 
TUBERCULOSIS). 
 
14. (C) IT IS NOT CLEAR NOW WHETHER INITIATIVE LEADERS WILL OPT 
TO FOCUS ON THESE PRIORITIES ON A SPECIFIC PROJECT BASIS OR 
TO APPROACH THEM IN TERMS OF A BROADER,  \"MACRO\" STRATEGY. 
HE INDICATED THAT A DECISION ON THIS WOULD LIKELY EMERGE FROM 
THE UPCOMING MEETING IN ADDIS ABABA SEPTEMBER 13- 14, 2001. 
ESTABLISHMENT OF TASK TEAMS TO BEGIN SECTORAL NEEDS 
ASSESSMENTS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL LEVELS ARE 
SLATED TO TAKE PLACE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE ADDIS ABABA 
MEETING.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SPECIAL TASK TEAMS TO FOCUS ON 
THE HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAMS (INFECTIOUS DISEASES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ICT) WOULD BEGIN WORK AFTER THE UN GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY MEETING IN NEW YORK SEPTEMBER 20-24. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
MAP GOES TO WASHINGTON (AND PHILLY AND NEW YORK) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
15. (C) MALCOMSON SAID \"MEMBERS\" OF THE MAP STEERING COMMITTEE 
WILL TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOLLOWING THE ADDIS ABABA MEETINGS 
TO MEET WITH THE IMF, WORLD BANK, AND \"STATE DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIALS\" (NFI) FROM SEPTEMBER 16 -18.  ON SEPTEMBER 19 THE 
PRESIDENTS OF NIGERIA, ALGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN A MEETING OF THE CORPORATE COUNCIL FOR AFRICA 
IN PHILADELPHIA, POSSIBLY JOINED BY PRESIDENT WADE OF 
SENEGAL.   THE TRAVELLING ROAD SHOW WOULD THEN MOVE ON TO NEW 
YORK SEPTEMBER 20 -24 TO PRESENT ITS WORK ON THE MARGINS OF 
EITHER THE UNGA OR THE UN CHILDREN\'S SUMMIT. 
 
-------------------------------- 
DONORS ON THE LINE IN EARLY 2002 
-------------------------------- 
 
16. (C) THE SHOW AND TELL EXERCISE WOULD CULMINATE IN A PLANNED 
FINANCING SUMMIT OF WORLD LEADERS IN SENEGAL EARLY IN 2002. 
THIS SUMMIT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER 2001, WHICH 
WOULD HAVE CONFLICTED WITH SENEGALESE ELECTIONS, MALCOMSON 
EXPLAINED.  A NEW TENTATIVE DATE OF JANUARY 2002 WAS SET. 
POLOFF NOTED THAT THE MAP SECRETARIAT\'S OWN WORK ON DEFINING 
GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND NEEDS WAS NOT SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE 
UNTIL MARCH, SO A JANUARY SUMMIT TO APPEAL TO WORLD LEADERS 
FOR FINANCING SOUNDED PREMATURE.  MALCOMSON TOOK THE POINT 
AND SAID HE WOULD RAISE IT WITH MAP SECRETARIAT HEAD (AND 
PRESIDENTIAL ECONOMIC ADVISER) WISEMAN NKUHLU TO SEE IF THE 
SUMMIT COULD BE PUSHED BACK. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
17. (C) THE SAG IS WELL AWARE THAT MAP/NAI WILL FACE AN EARLY 
AND CRITICAL TEST IN CHOOSING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE 15 NATION 
HEADS OF STATE GROUP.  MALCOMSON WAS QUITE BLUNT IN TELLING 
US THAT THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA, NOT LIBYA.  OTHERWISE THE 
INITIATIVE\'S CREDIBILITY (AND PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S PRESTIGE) 
COULD SUFFER A BLOW.  SOUTH AFRICA DOES NOT WANT MAP/NAI TO 
END UP ON THE PILE OF FAILED AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES 
AND WE EXPECT THAT THEY WILL DO ALL THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT 
LIBYA DOES NOT MAKE IT INTO THE INNER CIRCLE.  THE SOUTH 
AFRICANS ALSO HOPE THAT THE USG WILL NAME A MAP/NAI 
COORDINATOR BEFORE THE MAP STEERING COMMITTEE TRAVELS TO 
WASHINGTON IN MID-SEPTEMBER.

(NEPAD):  MOVING FORWARD 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC M/C ROBERT F. GODEC, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ECONOFF MET JANUARY 24 WITH DAVID 
MALCOLMSON, DFA NEPAD COORDINATOR, TO REVIEW RECENT 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEPAD PROGRAM.  AT THE 
JANUARY 24-27 CONFERENCE IN BENONI, SOUTH AFRICA AIMED TO 
MOVE BEYOND SLOGANS TO FORGE AGREEMENT ON CONCRETE PLANS AND 
NATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO PUSH NEPAD FORWARD.  THE FIVE 
PRIORITY AREAS APPROVED BY THE NEPAD HEADS OF STATE 
IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE LAST OCTOBER WILL BE THE CONTEXT IN 
WHICH THIS EFFORT WILL PROCEED.  THE GOAL IS TO REACH 
AGREEMENT ON A PROGRAM THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO THE G8 SUMMIT 
IN CANADA NEXT JUNE AND TO THE INITIAL AFRICAN UNION (AU) 
SUMMIT NEXT JULY IN DURBAN.  SOUTH AFRICA HAS EMBARKED ON A 
PROGRAM TO ENLIST SUPPORT FOR NEPAD FROM BUSINESS AND OTHER 
ELEMENTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY.  PRESIDENT MBEKI ADDRESSED THE 
BENONI CONFERENCE AND ENCOURAGED AFRICANS TO BECOME 
\"PROACTIVE IMPLEMENTERS OF OUR OWN SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT.\" 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) ECONOFF MET JANUARY 24 WITH DAVID MALCOLMSON, DFA 
NEPAD COORDINATOR, TO REVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NEPAD 
PROCESS, INCLUDING GOALS FOR THE WORK-IN-PROGRESS REVIEW 
WORKSHOP HELD JANUARY 24-27 IN BENONI, SOUTH AFRICA.  HE 
DESCRIBED THE BENONI CONFERENCE AS THE BEGINNING OF THE 
\"SECOND PHASE\" OF THE NEPAD DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.  MALCOLMSON 
UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO MOVE AHEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
MECHANISMS AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRANSLATE NOW \"THEORETICAL\" 
ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND SELF-RELIANCE 
INTO CONCRETE PLANS AND COMMITMENTS.  ONLY AGREEMENT BY 
PARTICIPATING AFRICAN COUNTRIES ON A CREDIBLE PROGRAM OF 
ACTION WILL DEFLECT CRITICISM THAT THE NEPAD PROCESS HAS BEEN 
OVERLY AMBITIOUS IN ITS AIMS. 
 
3.  (U) THE HEADS OF STATE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE MEETING 
LAST OCTOBER 23 APPROVED A MANDATE FOCUSING ON FIVE PRIORITY 
AREAS FOR NEPAD: 1) PEACE AND SECURITY, 2) ECONOMIC AND 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, 3) BANKING AND FINANCIAL STANDARDS, 4) 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND 5) MARKET ACCESS AND AGRICULTURE.  IN 
ADDITION, HEADS OF STATE APPROVED THE CREATION OF A CONFLICT 
PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION SUBCOMMITTEE, TO BE CHAIRED BY 
PRESIDENT MBEKI.  THE GOAL OF THE BENONI WORKSHOP IS TO 
ARTICULATE AN OUTLINE AND DETAILED CONTENT FOR A NEPAD 
PROGRAM OF ACTION THAT CAN BE PRESENTED TO THE G8 SUMMIT IN 
CANADA NEXT JUNE AND TO THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) SUMMIT IN 
DURBAN NEXT JULY.  THE WORKSHOP WILL ALSO DISCUSS HOW NEPAD, 
AS THE AGREED-UPON OVERALL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK FOR AFRICA, 
CAN ENHANCE AFRICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE FINANCING FOR 
DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE IN MEXICO AND AT THE WORLD SUMMIT ON 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN JOHANNESBURG. 
 
4.  (C) MALCOLMSON SAID THE CURRENT NEPAD MANAGEMENT 
STRUCTURES (THE IMPLEMENTATION AND STEERING COMMITTEES AS 
WELL AS THE SECRETARIAT) ARE LIKELY TO ENDURE FOR SOME TIME 
AFTER THE AFRICAN UNION COMES INTO BEING AT THE JULY SUMMIT. 
HE AGREED THAT THE AU WILL LIKELY BE CONSUMED, AT LEAST OVER 
THE SHORT-TERM, WITH THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS OWN 
POLITICAL ARCHITECTURE.  THE SUBSTANCE OF COORDINATING, 
MONITORING AND DRIVING THE NEPAD PROCESS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN 
IN THE HANDS OF THE CURRENT DEDICATED MECHANISMS.  HE NOTED 
AS WELL THAT THE OLD OAU TRADITION OF CONSENSUS SEEKING WOULD 
DO LITTLE TO PROVIDE THE FORCEFUL IMPETUS THAT NEPAD NEEDS. 
HE ALSO CONCEDED THAT THERE ARE SOME OAU (AND FUTURE AU) 
MEMBERS THAT THE CURRENT NEPAD GOVERNMENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
REMAIN ON THE SIDELINES.  HE CITED THE PEER REVIEW MECHANISM 
IN NEPAD AS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE WAY THE OAU HAS 
DONE BUSINESS IN THE PAST, I.E. TAKING PAINS TO AVOID EVEN 
THE APPEARANCE OF INFRINGING UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MEMBER 
STATES.  NEPAD, FOR THOSE STATES WHO DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE, 
WILL BE MUCH MORE INTERVENTIONIST IN CHARACTER. 
 
5.  (C) MALCOLMSON TOOK NOTE OF CRITICISM THAT THE CREATION 
OF NEPAD HAS BEEN A TOP-DOWN, TECHNOCRATIC PROCESS WITHOUT 
MUCH INPUT FROM CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE EARLY DEBATES ON THE 
PROGRAM\'S STRUCTURE.  THIS IN SPITE OF THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, 
WHICH NOTES THAT \"THE AGENDA IS BASED ON NATIONAL AND 
REGIONAL PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT MUST BE 
PREPARED THROUGH PARTICIPATIVE PROCESSES INVOLVING THE 
PEOPLE.\"  SOME CRITICS HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT THE DEBATE 
AROUND GOVERNANCE STANDARDS WILL HAVE TO BE WIDENED WITH MORE 
\"BUY IN\" BY AFFECTED GROUPS, LEST THE ENTIRE PROJECT \"START 
AND END AND FAIL WITH LEADERSHIP.\"  MALCOLMSON AGREED THAT 
THIS HAS BEEN A \"POLITICALLY DRIVEN PROCESS\" FROM THE OUTSET 
(MOSTLY OUT OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO GET IT STARTED), BUT 
ADDED THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS INSTITUTED A MARKETING AND 
COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY AIMED AT BRINGING BUSINESS, CIVIL 
SOCIETY AND OTHERS INTO THE PICTURE.  THIS OUTREACH EFFORT 
INCLUDES THE BENONI CONFERENCE, TO WHICH A VARIETY OF 
NON-GOVERNMENT GROUPS WERE INVITED. 
 
6.  (U) IN HIS REMARKS TO THE BENONI MEETING, PRESIDENT MBEKI 
ENCOURAGED AFRICANS TO BE \"AGENTS FOR CHANGE\" AND TO \"TAKE 
OWNERSHIP\" OF THEIR FUTURES.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE WORK 
CARRIED OUT BY AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE IN PROMOTING THE NEPAD 
AGENDA \"HAS SUCCEEDED IN GENERATING HOPE AND CONFIDENCE IN 
THE FUTURE OF OUR CONTINENT AND IN ATTAINING ACCEPTANCE OF 
NEPAD AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK INFORMING THE WAY THEY VIEW 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT.\"  HE WELCOMED THE PARTICIPATION IN THE 
CONFERENCE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 
BANK, THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE ECONOMIC 
COMMISSION FOR AFRICA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL.  HE 
ENCOURAGED THE CONFEREES TO WORK OUT \"CONCRETE IMPLEMENTABLE 
PLANS\" THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT AFRICANS ARE BEING 
\"PROACTIVE IMPLEMENTERS OF OUR OWN SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT.\" 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT: MALCOLMSON WAS CANDID ABOUT SOME OF THE 
DIFFICULTIES THAT SOUTH AFRICA, AS ONE OF NEPAD\'S \"FOUNDING 
STATES,\" HAS HAD IN BRINGING THIS PROGRAM TO ITS PRESENT 
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.  OUTSIZED EGOS AND OBSTRUCTIONIST 
BEHAVIOR FROM SOME COUNTRIES HAVE REQUIRED A SUSTAINED AND 
DETERMINED POLITICAL-LEVEL PUSH IN ORDER TO KEEP NEPAD ON 
TRACK.  HE CONCEDED THAT NEPAD\'S CREDIBILITY (AND VIABILITY) 
WILL DEPEND ON PRESENTING A SOLID AND DOABLE PROGRAM TO G8 
COUNTRIES.  THE CAPE TOWN MEETING OF G8 PERSONAL 
REPRESENTATIVES IN FEBRUARY WILL BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF 
WHETHER THE BENONI CONFERENCE SUCCEEDED IN MOVING THE NEPAD 
PROCESS BEYOND PLATITUDES TO A PROGRAM THAT WILL ATTRACT 
SUPPORT FROM WESTERN GOVERNMENTS.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, ECON, SF 
SUBJECT: FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN SADC. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   THESE TWO REVIEWS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT PRESENT SOME NEW OR 
DIFFERENT INFORMATION ON THE PICTURE. THE STUDY ON EUROPEAN 
INVESTMENT INTO SOUTHERN AFRICA EMPHASIZED THAT ALL THE FIRMS SELL 
LOCALLY, BUT ONLY 14% OF THE FOREIGN OWNED FIRMS EXPORT FROM THE 
REGION. THEIR MAIN REASON FOR BEING IN SADC IS TO SELL TO SADC, 
NOT TO EXPORT AND NOT BECAUSE SADC IS AN INEXPENSIVE PLACE TO 
PRODUCE. AGOA IS CHANGING THIS, BUT MAINLY FOR TEXTILES AND 
CLOTHING (WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAVE SADC ONCE PREFERENTIAL ACCESS 
IS WITHDRAWN). PRIVATIZATION (INCLUDING PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS) IS A GOOD WAY TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, BEING 
THE REASON GIVEN FOR 19% OF THE FIRMS BEING HERE. 
 
2.   FDI IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO CREATE JOBS. WHILE A QUARTER 
EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT, A THIRD CONTRACTED EMPLOYMENT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE FOREIGN FIRMS EMPLOY EXPERTS; IN 1/3 OF THE 
CASES THERE WAS LOCALIZATION OF FOREIGN POSITIONS, THUS DECREASING 
THE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS AND INCREASING TECH TRANSFER. 
 
3.   HALF THE FOREIGN FIRMS EXPECT TO EXPAND IN THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS COMPARED TO 10% OF THE FIRMS (ALMOST ALL IN ZIMBABWE) WHO EXPECT 
TO CONTRACT. 
 
4.   INCENTIVES WILL NOT WORK IN ATTRACTING FIRMS TO SOUTHERN 
AFRICA AS THEY COME DUE TO FACTORS NOT INFLUENCED BY INCENTIVES 
(SIZE OF THE MARKET, PRIVATIZATION, AND PERSONAL REASONS) BUT WILL 
5. WORK IN DECIDING LOCATION ONCE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO COME TO 
THE REGION. THIS MAKES INCENTIVES ESSENTIALLY A ZERO-SUM GAME FOR 
THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. 
 
6.   THE REVIEW OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AFRICA NOTED THAT TOTAL 
RESOURCE FLOWS TO NON-SOUTH AFRICA SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  HAVE FALLEN 
SLIGHTLY SINCE THE EARLY 90S BUT THIS IS BECAUSE OF REDUCED 
FOREIGN DONOR LOANS (REDUCED WORLD BANK ACTIVITY). THERE HAS BEEN 
AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT AND FOREIGN DONOR 
GRANTS HAVE BEEN ROUGHLY CONSTANT. THE PICTURE IS DIFFERENT FROM 
OTHER REGIONS WHICH HAD A LARGE EXPANSION IN FOREIGN DIRECT AND 
FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN THE MID-90S BUT WHICH HAVE HAD 
REDUCTIONS SINCE THEN. 
 
7.   ALSO INTERESTING IS THAT FDI IN ALL OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAD 
ACCOUNTED FOR 3.6% OF TOTAL INVESTMENT IN THESE COUNTRIES IN THE 
EARLY 90S, BUT ACCOUNTS FOR OVER 11% NOW. WITH FDI INCREASING IN 
ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS, THE PICTURE EMERGES THAT IT IS NOT FDI THAT IS 
ABANDONING SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, IT IS AFRICAN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, 
AND FOREIGNERS ARE NOT INVESTING ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THIS 
DECREASE. 
 
8.   US DATA SHOWS THAT THE RATE OF RETURN ON AFRICAN INVESTMENTS 
IS THE HIGHEST OF ANY REGION, 21% NOW COMPARED TO 30% IN THE EARLY 
90S. WHILE SOME ARGUE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE OF GREATER VOLATILITY 
IN RETURNS IN AFRICA THE DATA DOES NOT BEAR THEM OUT. AFRICA\'S 
VARIABILITY IN RETURNS IS CLOSE TO THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
LOWER THAN THE VARIABILITY IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THE AVERAGE 
RETURNS ARE LESS. PERCEPTIONS OF RISK ARE HIGHER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
9.   THIS SUMMARIZES PAPERS PRESENTED AT A WORKSHOP ORGANIZED BY 
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY ON 9 APRIL 2003.  THE FIRST DEALS 
WITH EUROPEAN INVESTMENT IN SADC AND THE SECOND WITH FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE PRESENTATION WAS PART OF AN 
EFFORT BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY TO PRESENT NEW RESEARCH ON 
TOPICS OF CRUCIAL INTEREST TO SA. 
 
JENKINS AND THOMAS: FDI IN SOUTHERN AFRICA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10.  THE JENKINS/THOMAS PAPER IS A RESULT OF INTERVIEWS WITH 81 
UK, SWISS AND GERMAN FIRMS ON THEIR INVESTMENTS IN SADC. 
 
 
WHY INVEST IN SADC? 
------------------- 
 
?    84% - SIZE OF THE LOCAL MARKET, 
?    40% - LOCAL RAW MATERIALS 
?    26% - PERSONAL REASONS 
?    21% - STRATEGIC REASONS (NEAR PARTNERS) 
?    19% - PRIVATIZATION OR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. 
 
11.  FIRMS ARE IN SADC TO SELL TO SADC, NOT  FOR EXPORT (EXCEPT 
FOR THE MINERAL COMPANIES) AND NOT BECAUSE THE AREA IS A CHEAP 
PLACE TO PRODUCE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE REGION FOR THE LOCAL 
ORE FOREIGN FIRMS WILL INVEST, BUT THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO INVEST 
IN SA. 
 
12.  MORE INTERESTING IS THEIR RESULTS ON THE DESTINATION OF THE 
OUTPUT FROM THEIR INVESTMENT. ALL SUPPLIED THE LOCAL MARKET, WITH 
45% SUPPLIED THE REGIONAL MARKET AND 14% EXPORTED OUTSIDE THE 
REGION. FOR ALMOST ALL FIRMS THE REASON FOR INVESTING IS LOCAL, 
NOT TO USE SADC AS A BASE FOR EXPORTS (TEXTILES AND GARMENT 
MANUFACTURERS ESTABLISHED DUE TO AGOA ARE A RECENT NON-EUROPEAN 
EXCEPTION). 
 
13.  ALL OF THE NON-PRIMARY SECTOR FIRMS EXPORTING GLOBALLY ARE IN 
SA AND THEIR ORIGINAL REASON FOR COMING TO THE REGION WAS TO 
SUPPLY THE LOCAL MARKET. ELSEWHERE IN SADC FIRMS SELLING LOCALLY 
ARE NOT DEVELOPING AN EXPORT CAPACITY. 
 
14.  IMPLICATION SADC: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST BOTH THE IMPORTANCE 
OF EXPANDING THE REGIONAL MARKET TO INCLUDE SADC AS THE LARGER MARKET 
WILL ATTRACT ADDITIONAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND THE NEED TO MAKE 
CROSS-BORDER MOVEMENTS EASY. AT PRESENT SA WILL ATTRACT NEW 
INVESTMENT TO SELL INTO SADC BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE SA MARKET. 
TO OVERCOME THIS ADVANTAGE, SADC MUST MAKE THE REGION APPEAR AS 
ONE. UNLESS THAT OCCURS, THE BENEFITS OF FDI IN TERMS OF INCOME 
AND JOBS WILL FLOW OVERWHELMINGLY TO SA. 
 
JOB IMPACT 
---------- 
 
15.  FDI IS USUALLY PRESENTED AS CRITICAL TO JOB AND INCOME 
GROWTH. UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A QUARTER OF THE FIRMS EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT 
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS (AND MOST OF THESE WERE NEW INVESTMENTS) WITH 
OVER A THIRD CONTRACTING. ONLY HALF OF THE FIRMS THAT EXPANDED 
PRODUCTION RECENTLY ALSO EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT WITH A NUMBER 
EXPANDING PRODUCTION AND DECREASING EMPLOYMENT. 
 
16.  THERE ARE FREQUENTLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF 
FOREIGNERS EMPLOYED, AND 2/3 OF THE FIRMS HAD EXPERTS BUT 1/3 HAD 
LOCALIZED PREVIOUSLY FOREIGN POSITIONS. 
 
FUTURE PLANS 
------------ 
 
17.  ALMOST 2/3 OF THE FIRMS HAVE EXPANDED (OR STARTED) IN THE 
LAST FIVE YEARS AND JUST OVER HALF PLAN TO EXPAND IN THE COMING YEARS. 
ONLY 8% HAVE CONTRACTED OF LATE AND 10% EXPECT TO CONTRACT IN THE 
COMING YEARS. MOST OF THE CONTRACTIONS ARE CONCENTRATED IN 
ZIMBABWE. THE PICTURE FOR THE REST OF THE REGION IS THUS MUCH MORE 
OPTIMISTIC PICTURE. 
 
TYPE OF INVESTMENT 
------------------- 
 
18.  HALF THE NEW INVESTMENTS WERE GREENFIELD (NEW ENTITY) AND 
MOST OF THESE ARE IN SERVICES AND USUALLY ARE WHOLLY CONTROLLED BY 
THE FOREIGN OWNER. ACQUISITIONS, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IN 
PRIMARY PRODUCTION, ARE USUALLY WITH A LOCAL PARTNER. THESE 
ACCOUNT FOR JUST OVER 1/3 OF THE TOTAL BUT ARE OF INCREASING 
IMPORTANCE. 
 
LEAPE: FDI IN AFRICA 
-------------------- 

19.  LEAPE\'S PAPER IS A REVIEW OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DATA ON FDI. 
 
20.  IN THE 90\'S RESOURCE FLOWS TO NON-SA SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
DROPPED SLIGHTLY. BUT THE DROP WAS ALMOST SOLELY DUE TO THE 
REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM OFFICIAL LOANS (ESSENTIALLY THE WORLD BANK) 
WITH FOREIGN GRANTS REASONABLY STEADY AND PRIVATE FDI INCREASING. 
PRIVATE FDI TO NON-OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES GREW SLIGHTLY FASTER 
THAN FDI TO OIL PRODUCERS AND THE TWO ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL NOW. 
COMMERCIAL BANK LENDING, NEVER VERY HIGH, BECAME ESSENTIALLY 
NEGATIVE AS REPAYMENTS BECAME GREATER THAN NEW LOANS. 
 
21.  THE SITUATION WITH ALL LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES IS DIFFERENT. FDI 
(AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT) OUTSIDE AFRICA BOOMED IN THE MID-90S 
AND THUS THE COLLAPSE IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT AND THE REDUCTION IN 
FDI HAD A MUCH GREATER IMPACT IN THE LATE 90S AND EARLY IN THE NEW 
CENTURY. COMMERCIAL BANK LENDING WAS MORE IMPORTANT EARLY IN THE 
90S BUT, AS IN AFRICA, HAS TURNED NEGATIVE. 
 
22.  ALL OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\'S SHARE OF FDI HAS FALLEN SINCE THE 
80S, BUT HAS BEEN ROUGHLY CONSTANT AT 3.4% SINCE THE MID-90S. THE 
SAME PATTERN EMERGES EVEN IF WE EXCLUDE OIL-PRODUCING AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES. 
 
THE 80S FDI IN NON-OIL EXPORTERS IN 
 
AFRICA WAS 3.6% OF THE REGION\'S TOTAL INVESTMENT WHILE IT IS OVER 
11% NOW. FOR LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES GENERALLY THE INCREASE WAS ONLY 
FROM 3.3% TO 7.9%. THIS APPEARS TO CHANGE THE CONCLUSION FROM 
FOREIGN INVESTORS ABANDONING AFRICA TO ONE OF DOMESTIC AFRICAN 
INVESTORS ABANDONING AFRICA. THE INCREASE IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS 
INSUFFICIENT TO MAKE UP THE FALL IN DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.  IN ANY 
CASE, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS FOR 89% OF TOTAL INVESTMENT, 
ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID ON INCREASING IT, FINDING WHY ITS 
IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMY HAS FALLEN, WHY RESIDENTS ARE NOT 
INVESTING. 
 
24.  US DATA SHOWS THAT CURRENTLY THERE IS A 21% RETURN ON 
INVESTMENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; IT HAD BEEN 30% IN THE EARLY 
90S. THE AVERAGE RETURN IS MUCH HIGHER THAN FOR ANY OTHER REGION. 
FOR EXAMPLE THE AVERAGE RETURN IS 9.5% IN SOUTH AMERICA AND 14.8% 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHILE THE VARIANCE IN INVESTMENT IN SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA IS HIGHER, THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION IS 
APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BETTER THAN IN 
SOUTH AMERICA. THE VARIABILITY IS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN IN ANY 
OF THE RICHER COUNTRIES.

IN TALKS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF HAMAS, 
ISLAMIC JIHAD AND HIZBULLAH AT THE DIRECT REQUEST OF 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) LEADERS SUCH AS ABU MAZEN AND ABU 
ALLAH, ACCORDING TO SAG FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT LEVANT 
DIRECTOR ISAAC MOGOTSI.  MOGOTSI TOLD POLOFF SEPTEMBER 26 
THAT THE PA ASKED THE SAG ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO TO WORK 
WITH THE TERRORIST GROUPS AND CONVINCE THEM THAT VIOLENCE WAS 
LEADING THE PALESTINIANS DOWN THE WRONG PATH.  THE PA WAS 
HOPING, MOGOTSI SAID, THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN EXPERIENCE IN 
NEGOTIATING AN END TO APARTHEID WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO THE 
TERROR GROUPS THAT POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS COULD BE 
SUCCESSFUL.  THE SAG HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PERSUADING

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Alex Burkart, Deputy Director in the Office of Nuclear 
Energy at the Department of State, and Ron Cherry, Director, 
Office of International Safeguards at the Department of 
Energy (DOE), visited South Africa May 17 to 21 to discuss 
advancing bilateral relations in the field of nuclear energy. 
 Burkart and Cherry participated in extensive meetings with 
key officials at the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and 
Minerals and Energy (DME), and with the management teams of 
the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR), the Nuclear Energy 
Corporation of South Africa (NECSA), PBMR Ltd. (developers of 
the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR)), and ESKOM\'s nuclear 
power station at Koeberg.  There was firm agreement on both 
sides to establish a Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear 
Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC) and to finalize R&D agreements on 
nuclear energy cooperation and nuclear materials safeguard 
technologies.  The two sides are now considering December 1-3 
in Pretoria for the first JSCNEC meeting.  South African 
officials expressed strong interest in possible collaboration 
in a number of areas, including new technology to use low 
enriched uranium (LEU) targets instead of highly enriched 
uranium to produce Molybdenum-99, a medical radioisotope.  In 
general, the South Africans were more interested in 
collaborating on the energy than on the safeguards side, but 
clearly saw the need to collaborate on PBMR safeguards and on 
technical activities that would facilitate PBMR licensing in 
the United States.  A constant theme throughout the week was 
South Africa\'s need for skills development and capacity 
building.  Reftel provides an overview of visit and reports 
key policy developments.  This cable provides details of 
meetings for technical officials.   End Summary. 
 
OFFICIAL DISCUSSIONS 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following a courtesy call with DME Deputy Director 
General Nelisiwe Magubane, who expressed full support for 
greater bilateral cooperation, Burkart and Cherry met with 
the entire staff of the Office of Nuclear Affairs in DME, 
including Chief Director Tseliso Maqubela, Director for 
Nuclear Energy Haresh Haricharun, Director for Safety Schalk 
de Waal, and Acting Director for Non-Proliferation Elsie 
Monale.  DFA Chief Director for Peace and Security Peter 
Goosen joined the second session in the afternoon.  The South 
Africans made it clear that they were interested in pursuing 
closer bilateral relations at the working or technical level. 
 Maqubela explained that the government had recently affirmed 
its decision to support the development of a Pebble Bed 
Modular Reactor (PBMR) as part of an overall strategy to 
provide a diverse and secure supply of inexpensive energy to 
the country.  Both he and Goosen stressed that such a 
strategy included making maximum use of the country\'s uranium 
resources. 
 
PBMR: A NATIONAL STRATEGIC PROJECT 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) PBMR, NECSA, and ESKOM (the national electric utility) 
each told Burkart and Cherry that the government had recently 
declared PBMR a national strategic project and was in the 
midst of restructuring its shareholding in PBMR Ltd.  The 
plan was that \"South Africa, Inc.\" would hold at least a 51 
percent share, with other investors taking the rest.  The 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) was about to assume 
the lead role for the government, with the Industrial 
Development Corporation (a government parastatal reporting to 
DTI) assuming the lion\'s share of equity.  ESKOM Enterprises 
has led with a 30 percent share of PBMR Ltd., but would 
transfer some of these holdings to the IDC, NECSA, and 
perhaps the rest to ESKOM Holdings, its parent company.  In 
the end, the government would pump another USD 100 million 
into PBMR Ltd. and DTI Director General Allister Ruiters 
would become the Chairman of the Board.  This structure would 
still allow for significant foreign investor participation, 
though the only current foreign shareholder is British 
Nuclear Fuels (BNFL).  Negotiations with AREVA continue, as 
do discussions with the Chinese on possible technological 
collaboration. 
 
ENRICHMENT AND NONPROLIFERATION 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Maqubela made a point of saying that while fuel for 
PBMR would be imported in the short term, South Africa might 
want to establish an enrichment plant in the long term. 
Goosen made the specific point that South Africa already 
possessed enrichment technology and would oppose any idea in 
international circles that it be denied the opportunity to 
acquire technology needed in the future to enrich locally 
mined uranium ore for PBMR fuel.  Goosen was quite concerned 
that a ban or moratorium on enrichment technology might one 
day preclude South Africa from developing it\'s own technology 
to support PBMR.  On May 18, Burkart and Cherry met with 
Goosen for more than two hours to discuss this and other 
issues in greater detail.  Goosen clearly wanted to send a 
message to the United States that South Africa did not 
believe that a ban on the transfer of enrichment technology 
would solve enforcement problems surrounding 
nonproliferation, and that South Africa was willing to work 
with the United States on an alternative solution. 
 
5. (C) NECSA officials were a bit surprised at Goosen\'s 
position when asked about it the following day.  They 
informed Burkart and Cherry that NECSA no longer possessed 
working enrichment technology and that an enrichment plant to 
produce low enriched uranium was quite a ways off.  NECSA had 
no plans to get back into the uranium enrichment business 
since it was simply not cost effective to supply only a few 
nuclear power plants.  In fact, NECSA was awaiting a design 
license from NNR to build a smelter to destroy old equipment 
from its pre-1990\'s enrichment program.  Furthermore, NECSA 
ceased work on Molecular Laser Isotope Separation (MLIS) in 
1997 when COGEMA withdrew from cooperation; this work had 
been shelved for the next 20 years. 
 
6. (C) Director to the Nonproliferation Secretariat Daan van 
Beek joined the discussion with Goosen on May 18 to outline 
the structure and function of the Nonproliferation Council, 
and explain South African export and import controls on 
nuclear, chemical, and biological technology.  After giving 
some examples of South African enforcement in this area, 
Goosen made the point that South Africa greatly appreciated 
U.S. intelligence when it came to the enforcement of 
nonproliferation laws.  \"We are not threatened or pressured 
by U.S. intelligence.\" he said, \"Rather, we see it part of 
our enforcement system, as an asset.\"  He then emphasized 
that South Africa viewed nonproliferation as just one side of 
a two edged sword -- the other being disarmament, and 
ventured a short lecture on whether the United States could 
do more on both the nonproliferation and the disarmament 
sides.  He commented that the U.S. effort to avoid all 
reference to the conclusions of the 2000 Nonproliferation 
Treaty Review Conference (which he characterized as the 
\"disarmament review conference\") in documents from the recent 
Prepcom had, in effect, overwhelmed the U.S. message on 
Article VI. 
 
NATIONAL NUCLEAR REGULATOR (NNR) 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Also on May 18, Burkart and Cherry visited the 
National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) in Centurion, where CEO 
Louisa Zondo led her management team in a presentation of 
NNR.  Zondo explained that the NNR was a relatively new 
agency, having been created by the National Nuclear 
Regulation Act of 1999 and established in 2000.  She stressed 
that two key areas for NNR were compliance monitoring and 
emergency planning.  In addition, NNR was currently 
preoccupied with putting into place a waste management policy 
and strategy that would govern NECSA\'s Vaalputs repository. 
While NNR had overall responsibility to regulate all things 
nuclear, the control of medical sources of radiological 
material rested with the Department of Health. 
 
8. (C) Zondo stressed that while NNR was able to access 
technical support from security agencies, from a management 
perspective it was important for NNR to develop its own 
in-house capacity.  This would take time.  NNR was exploring 
training programs with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) and sister regulatory bodies.  To meet current needs, 
NNR was looking at bringing experienced South Africans out of 
retirement. 
 
9. (C) Zondo characterized the February emergency 
preparedness drill at ESKOM\'s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station 
as a success.  She said that the NRC observers who attended 
had written a favorable report on the exercise, and extended 
an open invitation to NNR officials to visit the NRC in the 
future. 
 
10. (C) Senior Manager for Nuclear Technology and Nuclear 
Suppliers C. Orion Philips then outlined his areas of 
responsibility, including the licensing process and risk 
control, determining compliance with best practices, the 
control of scrap materials, surface and underground mines, 
and radon measurement.  This included regulatory oversight of 
NECSA\'s Safari reactor safety and safeguards, the production 
of Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), and the licensing change request to 
use LEU to produce Mo-99.  He was also responsible for waste 
management at NECSA\'s Vaalputs site. 
11. (C) Dr. Simnanye Alex Tsela outlined his responsibilities 
in the regulatory strategy division, which included the 
review of regulatory philosophy, best practices, legislation, 
and international collaboration. 
 
12. (C) Mr. G. Clappison outlined his responsibilities as 
head of the Power Reactor Division, which included Koeberg 
Nuclear Power Station and PBMR compliance with the conditions 
of their operating licenses, safety indicators, inspection 
programs, and outage inspections.  Clappison said that NNR 
conducted periodic safety reviews at Koeberg, as well as 
physical security reviews at Koeberg, Vaalputs, and PBMR.  He 
was in the process of reviewing safety and quality assurance 
aspects of PBMR designs, and assuring public participation in 
the licensing process.  In response to Burkart\'s inquiry 
about the absence of a high-pressure containment for the 
PBMR, Clappison said that this would be a key licensing 
issue.  However, NNR did not want to blindly apply light 
water reactor regulations to gas-cooled reactors, as the two 
technologies were markedly different.  Clappison explained 
that risk evaluation must be based on assessing phenomenon 
that might cause the release of nuclear or other hazardous 
materials.  Licensing would depend on assessing the risk to a 
person of 10xE-8 per year of reactor operation (specific risk 
was unspecified). 
 
13. (C) Dr. D. Kgwadi explained that he was in charge of a 
group of 18 engineers and scientists that provided support to 
the rest of the organization. 
 
NUCLEAR ENERGY CORPORATION OF SOUTH AFRICA (NECSA) 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
14. (C) On May 19, CEO Senti Thobejani presented an overview 
of NECSA and how it had changed as an organization since it 
was known as the Atomic Energy Corporation.  NECSA still 
operated the Safari research reactor, but had now assumed a 
commercial focus, with commercial sales of medical 
radioisotopes, chemicals, and other products and services 
generating 80 percent of its income -- four-fifths of which 
from exports.  NECSA\'s six divisions included one that 
produces radioisotopes for medical applications, one that 
produces fluorine based chemicals, one that provides nuclear 
commercial services (such as pebble bed fuel manufacture), 
one that undertakes scientific research and provides waste 
management services, one that manages the 120 buildings at 
the Pelindaba complex, and one that provides corporate 
services (human resources, financial, and legal).  Nuclear 
technology products and services included 
radiopharmaceuticals, irradiation services, radiochemicals, 
radioactive sources, and radiation services.  In the medium 
term, NECSA hoped to increase its sales of Molybdenum-99, for 
which it was currently the world\'s fourth leading producer, 
by a factor of eight.  Thobejane thought that the South 
African Government would remain NECSA\'s sole shareholder in 
the foreseeable future, but admitted that this could change 
someday.  He explained that members of NECSA\'s Board of 
Directors were appointed by the Minister of Minerals and 
Energy for three-year terms, including the CEO.  Thobejane 
took office in September 2001. 
 
15. (C) Thobejani said that the government had been 
contemplating the creation of a new nuclear waste management 
agency (to be born out of NECSA), but decided against it 
because the size of South Africa\'s nuclear industry did not 
justify the additional investment.  For this reason, NECSA 
would continue to fulfill this service for the government. 
In return, NECSA would receive approximately $20 million per 
year, or 20 percent of its income.  This amount would also 
cover other services provided to government, such as the 
fulfillment of international nuclear safeguards agreements 
and limited scientific research.  Thobejane explained that 
these days most research and development at NECSA was very 
much product or service driven and, therefore, closer to 
development engineering than to pure research.  However, the 
Department of Science and Technology and the University of 
the Northwest (formerly Potchefstroom University) master\'s 
program conducted limited pure research at the Safari 
reactor.  Thobejane added that a draft waste management 
strategy had been released for public comment, but the 
comment period had been extended through June because of the 
technical nature of the document. 
 
16. (C) Thobejane commented that NECSA was looking at ways to 
rejuvenate its workforce and to develop young nuclear 
physicists and engineers.  To this end, NECSA had formed 
exchange and training partnerships with AREVA and BNFL, had 
created sister university partnership with Pennsylvania State 
University, and was considering a collaborative program with 
Argonne National Laboratory.  NECSA\'s workforce currently 
numbered about 1500, down from 6000 in the 1990\'s. 
 
NECSA\'s INVOLVEMENT IN PBMR 
--------------------------- 
 
17. (C) Thobejane informed Burkart and Cherry that NECSA was 
about to intensify its involvement with PBMR Ltd.  Until now, 
NECSA\'s goal had been to become the primary manufacturer of 
pebble bed fuel.  While this goal still held, PBMR Ltd. was 
about to become even more important to NECSA because the 
South African Government had decided to transfer at least 10 
percent of its shareholdings from ESKOM Enterprises to NECSA. 
 Division Manager Fanie Venter then provided a tour of pebble 
bed fuel fabrication under development at a NECSA lab.  The 
lab\'s short-term objective was to replicate as much as 
possible proven German production methods of TRISO fuel. 
This would serve as a measure of technology acquisition, as 
well as reduce the risk to PBMR Ltd.  Burkart and Cherry 
witnessed the production of a handball sized fuel sphere made 
of graphite and other layered materials.  At this time, no 
uranium loading of the spheres was taking place.  NECSA 
needed a license for working with enriched uranium before it 
could proceed with plans to implant 9.6 percent enriched 
uranium particles into the core of the graphite fuel spheres. 
 The current objective was to build the production capacity 
to manufacture 270,000 spheres per year, enough to fuel the 
demonstration reactor planned for Koeberg.  NECSA General 
Manager Karel Fouche\' said that PBMR already had contracts in 
place with the Russians for the provision of 28 kg of 10 
percent LEU for the demonstration plant.  In the future, 
however, tons of such fuel would be needed.  Burkart advised 
NECSA officials that the USEC license application for its new 
enrichment plant in the United States would allow enrichment 
up to 10 percent, but that the new URENCO plant would be 
limited to 5 percent. 
 
OTHER TOURS AT NECSA 
-------------------- 
 
19. (C) Burkart and Cherry toured the Safari reactor and also 
saw the IQ3 Drum Scanner in operation at the site of NECSA\'s 
decommissioned Semi-Commercial Enrichment Plant.  At the 
reactor, Fouche\' stated that NECSA was fabricating two lead 
test assemblies in a glove box to test reactor operation on 
19.9 percent enriched uranium, vice the existing 90 percent 
enriched uranium reactor fuel.  At the IQ3 Drum Scanning 
Project, funded out of Director Cherry\'s office at DOE, Bert 
Rollen of Oak Ridge National Laboratories was on hand to 
provide an overview of the project along with NECSA 
supervisors.  Currently, the contents of 1074 drums out of 
1104 drums with HEU contaminated waste have been scanned to 
determine the amount of U-235.  The IAEA has verified 782 
drums containing 21 kg of U-235 while 292 drums containing 
5.9 kg of U-235 remain to be verified.  As many as 40,000 
drums containing LEU contaminated waste still needed to be 
scanned. 
 
NECSA MANAGERS SUGGEST AREAS FOR COOPERATION 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
20. (C) General Manager Karel Fouche\' expressed NECSA\'s 
desire to continue its involvement in the Reduced Enrichment 
for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program.  Fouche\' was 
very interested in Argentina\'s test using LEU targets to 
produce of Molybdenum 99.  He welcomed the opportunity to 
host an August visit from Argonne National Laboratory 
officials, who were assisting the Argentineans.  Fouche\' also 
expressed NECSA\'s interest in attending the U.S. sponsored 
workshop for radioisotope producing countries, now scheduled 
for October in Vienna, Austria. 
 
21. (C) NECSA Divisional Manager Pieter Bredell, whose charge 
was management of the Vaalputs waste site, expressed interest 
in sharing information with the United States on waste site 
management and disposal, and was open to possible U.S. 
assistance on the transportation of nuclear waste.  In 
return, he thought that the United States might be interested 
in NECSA\'s pioneering bore hole concept for the disposal of 
spent radioactive sources 50-100 meters underground -- a 
technique that allowed fellow African countries with less 
sophisticated technology to store medical waste at sites 
within their own borders. 
 
22. (C) Senior Manager Deitleib Tillwick thought that there 
was room for technical cooperation in the area of safeguards. 
 Specifically, Manager Joseph Shayi was looking for a 
solution to a problem he had on meeting safeguards 
requirements, which impacted NECSA\'s PBMR fuel fabrication 
operations. 
23. (C) CEO Thobejani summarized the major categories for 
potential bilateral collaboration as including waste 
management, safeguards, licensing and regulatory issues, LEU 
production technology for Molybdenum 99, and skills 
development. 
 
PBMR LTD. 
--------- 
 
24. (C) PBMR Ltd. CEO Nic Terblanche told Burkart and Cherry 
that the South African Government had recently decided to 
make PBMR a strategic national project, virtually assuring 
government financing for PBMR Ltd. through the development 
phase and allowing the construction of a demonstration 
reactor at Koeberg.  Almost 500 engineers and scientists were 
now engaged in the project, including 50-60 at NECSA, 50 at 
South African supplier IST Nuclear, and 30 at ESKOM.  If the 
PBMR dream came true, said Terblanche, the company would be 
the first to build a nuclear power plant that was inherently 
safe. 
 
25. (C) Terblanche argued that PBMR, as a very high 
temperature reactor (VTHR), was ideally suited for the 
nuclear cogeneration component of DOE\'s Hydrogen Energy 
Initiative at the Idaho National Engineering and 
Environmental Laboratories (INEEL).  PBMR Ltd. models already 
predicted temperatures near desired levels for Generation IV 
VHTR\'s.  Compared to competing technologies, PBMR was safer, 
more cost efficient, more environmentally safe, and more 
flexible.  Moreover, Terblanche thought that PBMR Ltd. was 
probably four years ahead of its nearest competitor.  U.S. 
based Westinghouse Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
shareholder BNFL, would lead PBMR Ltd.\'s consortium of U.S 
companies that included Air Products (the world\'s largest 
producer of hydrogen) and Sargent and Lundy (an experienced 
engineering and construction firm in the power industry) in 
its INEEL bid.  For those who felt that PBMR was too advanced 
to qualify for INEEL, Chief Technology Officer Dieter Matzner 
argued that there was still plenty room for further research 
and development oriented towards achieving even higher 
temperatures. 
 
26. (C) If PBMR were not selected for the cogeneration 
project at INEEL, Terblanche said, PMBR Ltd. \"would revert to 
Plan A,\" which was to roll out its product in major markets, 
especially the United States.  In fact, success, as measured 
by PBMR Ltd.\'s business plan, would be achieved if the 
company captured just 4 percent of new sales worldwide.  With 
or without INEEL, PBMR Ltd. planned to seek an NRC license, 
and had already sent NRC a letter of intent.  PBMR Ltd. hoped 
to initiate discussions with the NRC this summer, partly to 
engage the NRC so that PBMR would not be overlooked in the 
wake of the NRC\'s licensing process for Westinghouse\' AP1000. 
 To help with the licensing process, PBMR Ltd. was assembling 
an advisory group of U.S. utilities that would include former 
shareholder Exelon and First Energy, among other U.S. 
utilities and potential customers.  When asked how long it 
would take for PBMR Ltd. to reach its targeted capital cost 
of around USD 1000 per installed kilowatt electric, the 
response was that it was important to first have sufficient 
orders in the pipeline to justify PBMR suppliers setting up 
dedicated manufacturing facilities.  If this were achieved, 
then 70 percent of the learning would take place during the 
production of the first three \"8-packs.\"  By the seventh 
\"8-pack,\" 98 percent of the learning would be achieved. 
Therefore, depending upon the starting point for cost, the 
targeted cost of around USD 1000 per kilowatt electric would 
likely be achieved between the 3rd and 7th \"8-pack\", or 
between the 24th and 56th reactor built. 
 
27. (C) Senior Scientist Dr. Johan Slabber then walked 
Burkart and Cherry through PBMR technology.  Slabber 
explained how safety was primarily controlled by heat 
production within the reactor vessel.  The design also 
incorporated 23 control rods in addition to spheres 
containing boron carbide that could be activated to rapidly 
shut down the reactor to cold conditions.  Slabber also 
explained why PBMR Ltd. felt that pebble fuel was better than 
prismatic block.  First, fuel temperatures were lower. 
Second, there was no need for a shielded facility or down 
time to replace fuel blocks, since the pebbles would cycle 
out of the system once spent.  And third, no burnable poisons 
were required to stretch out the fuel cycle.  Slabber also 
explained the Brayton Cycle (the heat transfer system based 
on using the helium coolant to directly drive the gas turbine 
rather than to generate steam) and other aspects of the PBMR 
technology.  A copy of Slabber\'s briefing is available from 
DOS/NP/NE Deputy Director Burkart. 
 
28. (C) Slabber thought that PBMR development would benefit 
greatly from the bilateral R&D agreements now under 
discussion.  The agreements would facilitate the exchange of 
information and allow INEEL scientists to test PBMR models. 
PBMR would be able to collaborate with the U.S. on the MELCOR 
code that modeled meltdown and chemical reactions, and on the 
Gas Reactor Severe Accident Code for air ingress events. 
Slabber added that PBMR Ltd. had already shared its computer 
codes on core neutronics with INEEL scientists so that they 
could conduct independent analyses. 
 
29. (C) PBMR Project Manager Abrie Botma then outlined where 
the development and testing program stood.  The University of 
the Northwest (previously Potchefstroom University) had built 
a 15-meter long, 37-ton PBMR micro model with a traditional 
heat source to test the Brayton Cycle.  PBMR Ltd. next 
planned to build a helium test loop at NECSA.  This loop 
would be three times the size of a similar one in the United 
States.  Comment: PBMR Ltd.\'s current development strategy is 
in sharp contrast to that pursued under former PBMR Ltd. CEO 
Dave Nicholls, which could best be characterized as \"just 
build it.\"  While not compromising any of the innovative 
aspects of the system, PBMR Ltd. is engaging in more 
extensive testing of subsystems and has stretched out the 
development/deployment schedule substantially.  End Comment. 
 
30. (C) Botma also explained that PBMR Ltd. had decided to 
create a number of \"Centers of Excellence\" around knowledge 
areas that were central to PBMR, including: turbine 
technology, Brayton Cycle technology, stochastic analysis, 
measurement technology, materials programs, thermo 
hydraulics, hydrogen generation, fuel advancements, and 
coolant chemistries.  These centers would be managed as 
international resource institutions. 
 
KOEBERG NUCLEAR POWER STATION 
----------------------------- 
 
31. (C) Burkart and Cherry ended their trip with a visit to 
ESKOM\'s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, which this year was 
celebrating 20 years of incident free operation.  Koeberg was 
one of a series of French built plants with proven, 
standardized reactor technology based on a Westinghouse 
design.  In fact, the French company Framatome still posted 
6-8 employees at the site.  Power Station Manager Peter 
Prozesky reviewed Koeberg\'s various safety and training 
programs, and ESKOM\'s decision, because of its relative 
isolation, to reach out to other countries like France and 
the United States to keep itself apprised of best practices 
and changing international standards.  Prozesky said that 
because the South African Government considered Koeberg a 
\"national key point\" (a critical asset), Koeberg was under 
constant threat review.  Prozesky also showed Burkart and 
Cherry the unique foundation supporting Koeberg\'s two 
reactors -- hundreds of pillars with rubber bearings to allow 
for sway in case of earthquake. 
 
CAPACITY BUILDING 
----------------- 
 
32. (C) A recurring theme throughout Burkart and Cherry\'s 
visit was South Africa\'s need to build technical capacity 
through skills development and training.  Specifically, DME 
and DFA talked about the need to train their staff.  Goosen 
said that DFA was developing its own nonproliferation 
seminar, and invited U.S. participation.  NECSA talked about 
university exchanges and rejuvenating its workforce.  NNR 
talked about the need for skills development and capacity 
building.  These discussions reinforced what Magubane and 
Maqubela told officials in Washington during their visit last 
October.  Clearly, capacity building and technical exchanges 
could be a very important part of our JSCNEC agenda. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
33. (C) Both sides felt that they were close to concluding 
R&D agreements on nuclear energy cooperation and nuclear 
materials safeguards technologies.  The South Africans still 
had some issues associated with how the agreements should be 
framed, i.e., between governments or departments, and 
indicated that they might have some questions related to the 
annex on intellectual property.  Recently, DFA told us that 
it planned to call the relevant parties together to discuss 
the R&D agreements and the possibility of holding the first 
JSCNEC December 1-3, 2004 in Pretoria.  Both DME and NECSA 
have reconfirmed their desire to participate in the proposed 
Workshop for Medical Radioisotope Producing Countries planned 
for October, but need to know the new dates.  NECSA has 
welcomed the opportunity to host an August visit from Argonne 
National Laboratory officials to discuss using LEU for 
targets to produce Molybdenum-99; Embassy/Pretoria stands 
ready to facilitate this visit.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Representatives of U.S. multi-national 
corporations (MNCs) and the Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) Charter Working Group continue to negotiate 
proposed equity ownership requirements.  The MNCs have 
presented a list of barriers to transferring equity and 
suggested various equity models.  MNCs still hope for a 
balanced scorecard, but some are beginning to question the 
commercial viability of implementing black economic 
empowerment (BEE).  Several multi-national firms are 
considering exit strategies such as setting up 
distributorships in South Africa or relocating to neighboring 
countries.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Representatives of U.S. MNCs operating in South 
Africa and the American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa 
(AmCham) continue to meet with the Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) Charter Working Group to 
negotiate how the terms of equity ownership requirements in 
the ICT Empowerment Charter will be implemented.  MNC 
representatives told Econoff that following the first meeting 
on June 5, 2004 (Reftel A), a \"Group of 10\" has met five more 
times.  The Group of 10 consists of AmCham and MNC 
representatives on one side and the ICT Working Group and 
black ICT businesses and associations on the other side. 
There are no government officials at the table. 
 
3.  (C) MNC representatives met internally June 14, 15 and 17 
and compiled the following list of obstacles that they argue, 
at a minimum, serve as a disincentive to transferring equity. 
 
COST 
-     Sales of equity involve higher costs to multinational 
companies than alternative non-equity approaches to Broad 
Based BEE, and hence are generally not approved by corporate 
headquarters. 
-     According to international accounting rules, any 
discount to fair market value on sales of equity must be 
recorded in the income statement and hence may impact the 
cost of capital. 
-     Vendor finance can distort the holding company balance 
sheet debt/equity ratio. 
-     U.S. companies are disadvantaged by U.S. tax rules on 
sub-part F income when subsidiaries are not wholly owned. 
-     Equity sales by foreign holding companies may be 
subject to capital taxes in foreign jurisdictions, which 
result in immediate cash outflows. 
-     Multinational companies will be disadvantaged by 
massive recourse to South African financial markets for loan 
finance and forex transfers for the sale of 25-35 percent of 
all foreign-owned IT companies in South Africa. 
 
LEGAL 
-     Multinational companies organized as South African 
registered branches of foreign companies have no South 
African equity to sell. 
-     The Companies Act section 38 prohibits a company from 
financially assisting the sale of its own shares, thus 
preventing the South African subsidiary from providing vendor 
finance. 
-     Foreign Exchange regulations provide barriers to equity 
solutions involving holding company stock. 
 
GOVERNANCE 
-     Minority stakes in South African subsidiaries create 
barriers to the free flow of capital and intellectual 
property across a wholly owned group of companies.  They 
force loan funding (as opposed to equity funding) for 
expansion plans (since equity funding would dilute the 
minority stake) and create barriers to inward foreign direct 
investment.  They increase the time to market of new 
innovations and technologies. 
-     South Africa does not have a broad range of black 
investors and therefore the potential for conflicts of 
interest between companies involving connected minority 
parties is higher. 
-     Minority shareholders add to the complexity of 
decision-making where decisions are taken at a global rather 
than a country level. 
-     Additional management time is required in 
non-operational statutory structures, when normal management 
decisions are taken in cross-border operational structures. 
 
OTHER RISKS 
-     There is a litigation risk that sales of equity will be 
challenged by holding company shareholders. 
-     There is litigation risk that minority shareholders in 
South Africa may proceed against the majority when a decision 
is taken in favor of the global group but against the 
interest of the local company (e.g.: treasury investments, 
top South African employee assignments elsewhere in the 
group, global sourcing, hedging of foreign exchange 
exposures, etc.). 
-     Holding companies believe themselves open to risk of 
prosecution under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or 
similar regulations) due to the actions of minority 
shareholders acting under normal business practice in South 
Africa, which may be illegal in the foreign country of 
incorporation. 
-     Strict observance of USA export restrictions (or 
similar foreign regulations) may cause contention with 
minority shareholders who may claim unfair treatment under 
South African laws. 
-     Forced disclosure to minority shareholders under South 
African law may be illegal disclosure under SEC regulations 
for a USA listed company (or similar regulations in other 
jurisdictions). 
 
 
4.  (C) During these internal meetings, it became apparent 
that some MNCs are prepared to comply with equity ownership 
requirements while others are not.  Those who are willing to 
comply have proposed four specific models they could 
implement in their corporate environment:  joint venture, 
employee trust, holding company, or a branch.  Those who do 
not support equity requirements said that either a corporate 
global policy prevents them from selling equity or the risks 
are too high. 
 
5.  (C) The MNCs presented the ICT Working Group with the 
above list of concerns about equity ownership in a Group of 
10 meeting on July 5.  According to IBM Country Manager Mark 
Harris, who is leading the MNC side of the negotiations, the 
ICT Working Group did not object to any of the four equity 
models presented by the multi-nationals at the most recent 
Group of 10 meeting held on July 7.  With regard to those 
MNCs claiming to have a corporate global policy preventing 
the transfer of equity, the Working Group is demanding the 
following stipulations: 
a)    the policy must be global; 
b)    the policy must not have been created to avoid Black 
Economic Empowerment (BEE); 
c)    there is no precedent in any other country of the 
company transferring equity; and 
d)    the policy existed prior to BEE policy. 
 
6.  (C) Once the ICT Working Group reviews the barriers and 
equity models, MNC negotiators plan to press for a \"balanced 
scorecard.\"  In terms of BEE policy, a \"scorecard\" is a 
generic measurement of five different types of empowerment 
activity.  A \"balanced scorecard\" would allow companies to 
achieve empowerment status (i.e., an acceptable overall 
score) by scoring enough points in the other areas to 
compensate for few or no points in the equity ownership 
category.  MNCs are prepared to ask senior South African 
government officials to intervene in the process if 
negotiations fail to produce an acceptable solution. 
 
7.  (C) Several U.S. multi-nationals question whether the 
implementation of BEE will be commercially viable.  These 
companies are privately considering exit strategies such as 
setting up distributorships in South Africa or relocating 
their operations to neighboring countries, e.g., Botswana, if 
BEE policy proves to be too costly for the continued 
operation of their companies in South Africa.

/// SUMMARY /// 
 
1. (C)  The ANC\'s approach to land reform is based on respect 
for private property, reliance on market mechanisms, and 
tightly controlled public spending.  Gains have been made in 
land redistribution and restitution; however, SAG goals are 
unlikely to be met without more funding.  Land tenure reform 
has seen the least progress and the SAG is revisiting tenure 
legislation.  Some critics claim that the South African 
government\'s (SAG) land reform policy is too conservative and 
should be completely transformed.  Others endorse the 
objectives but find fault with the process.  Grassroots 
pressure for the SAG to do more on the land front is weak. 
Land does not rank highly as a critical issue to most South 
Africans.  Demand for land is often really a demand for 
employment, housing, and income.  End Summary. 
 
/// STRUCTURED POLICY; TIGHT BUDGET /// 
 
2. (C) The ANC\'s approach to land reform is based on respect 
for private property, reliance on market mechanisms, and 
tightly controlled public spending.  The budget allocation 
for land reform has consistently equated to less than one 
percent of South Africa\'s total budget.  South Africa\'s land 
reform policy aims to address the inequity in land ownership 
caused by colonialism and apartheid and to secure tenure 
rights for vulnerable groups.  The ANC instituted in 1994 a 
land reform policy that seeks to achieve these goals through 
a process of restitution, redistribution, and tenure reform. 
Land restitution is designed to restore land or provide 
alternative compensation to those dispossessed as a result of 
racially discriminatory laws since 1913.  Land redistribution 
aims to broaden access to land for previously disadvantaged 
communities.  Tenure reform is designed to secure the rights 
of people living under insecure arrangements on land owned by 
others, including the state and private owners. 
 
/// RESTITUTION UNLIKELY TO MEET 2005 TARGET /// 
 
3. (C) South Africa\'s Department of Land Affairs (DLA) has 
made notable gains in land restitution but is unlikely to 
meet goals set by the government.  The SAG said it would 
settle all land claims by the end of 2005.  Since 1994, DLA 
has settled about 46,000 of 70,000 total urban and rural 
claims.  The outstanding claims, however, are predominantly 
rural claims, which are more complicated to verify and 
resolve than the urban claims.  Urban claims, in most cases, 
are settled with monetary compensation.  The DLA expects to 
settle all of the urban claims by the 2005 deadline but it is 
unlikely that rural claims will be completed.  The budget for 
the fiscal year of approximately R1 billion falls well below 
the R13 billion the DLA estimates it needs to settle all of 
the remaining claims.  The DLA contends that the Minister\'s 
recently expanded authority to expropriate (with 
compensation) will only be used in extreme cases and not as a 
tool to \"finish up\" the task of resolving the remaining rural 
restitution cases (Ref A). 
 
/// REDISTRIBUTION STRAIGHT FORWARD, NEEDS MORE FUNDING /// 
 
4. (C) The SAG, has committed to transferring thirty percent 
(approximately 30 million hectares) of commercial 
agricultural land to Black South Africans by 2015.  South 
Africa\'s land redistribution program operates on a 
free-market basis.  Aspiring landowners apply for land 
through \"Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development 
(LRAD)\" grants from the government.  DLA acquires land for 
redistribution through a willing-buyer, willing-seller 
method.  By mid-2003, the DLA had distributed 1.5 million 
hectares of land.  Despite its slow start (only 280,000 
hectares were transferred between 1994 and 1997), DLA 
officials are confident that they can achieve the 2015 
redistribution goal, but also express concern about 
inadequate resources.  Some analysts believe that the 
government will \"inflate\" data on land transferred by 
including government-owned land that will be turned over to 
land administration councils in communal areas. 
 
/// TENURE REFORM LAGS BEHIND /// 
 
5. (C) Land tenure reform has seen the least progress.  The 
SAG has been slow to develop, pass, and implement tenure 
reform legislation.  The recently passed Communal Land Rights 
Bill (Ref B) took several years to develop and is still 
awaiting approval from President Mbeki.  Implementation of 
the new legislation promises to be costly and difficult as 
all of South Africa\'s \"communal\" areas are affected (a total 
of 12-15 million rural people). 
 
6. (C) Legislation aimed at providing security for farm 
laborers has had very limited success.  The DLA has failed to 
implement the Extension of Security of Tenure Act and Labor 
Tenants Act and these two pieces of legislation have had 
minimal impact on increasing security for farm dwellers.  The 
DLA, recognizing its failure in this area, has decided to 
revisit these laws with the view of strengthening them and 
consolidating them into one Act.  The process has been in 
effect since early 2002 with no clear progress. 
 
/// CRITICISMS OF SAG\'S POLICY /// 
 
7. (C) Groups who are highly critical of land reform policy 
carry little weight in political circles and include a few 
NGOs and the South African Communist Party.  They claim that 
the SAG\'s land reform policy is too conservative and should 
be completely transformed.  Groups such as the Landless 
People\'s Movement (LPM) would like to see extensive 
government intervention in land acquisition through 
expropriation and widespread redistribution to the landless 
poor. 
 
8. (C) Some land organizations including the National Land 
Committee (NLC) and the Program for Land and Agrarian Studies 
(PLAAS) also find fault with the entire land reform process. 
Their major criticism is that land reform is too slow and 
will not result in meaningful economic gains for the 
country\'s poor.  They would like to see the SAG take a more 
aggressive approach to transferring land and develop an 
integrated approach to land reform that incorporates 
government support mechanisms to help new landowners build 
houses, develop infrastructure, and farm the land. 
 
/// WEAK GRASSROOTS PRESSURE TO DO MORE /// 
 
9. (C) Other criticisms range from the relatively small 
number of restitution claims submitted before the deadline to 
the lack of necessary funds to accomplish reform objectives. 
While many of these concerns are legitimate, the SAG has not 
indicated any significant shift in policy as a result.  The 
media is perhaps the SAG\'s biggest critic.  Grassroots 
pressure to do more is weak.  Those most affected by inequity 
of land distribution are spread out across geographical and 
cultural communities and therefore lack a cohesive voice. 
Even the LPM has had minimal impact on land policy.  The LPM 
gained some notoriety for organizing a march on the 2002 
World Summit for Sustainable Development.  However, the LPM 
is loosely organized and is often portrayed by media and 
others as a radical element that encourages criminal activity 
(including land invasions).  Support for the group and its 
tactics is limited.  As a result, the SAG does not feel an 
overwhelming push to do more on the land front.  Calls for 
employment and poverty alleviation take precedence. 
 
/// MISPERCEPTION THAT LAND EQUALS INCOME /// 
 
10. (C) The SAG is aware that demand for land is often 
actually a demand for income, employment, and housing. 
Studies show that rural poor prefer jobs to land but often 
turn to land as a last resort when they give up on formal 
employment.  The SAG is committed to meeting its land reform 
goals, but its real focus is on creating economic development 
for South Africa\'s poor.  The ANC recognizes the importance 
of integrating Black South Africans into the agricultural 
sector but does not view land reform as a viable means to 
improve the livelihoods of the majority of the country\'s 
poor.  The SAG knows that it must find the right balance of 
restoring land to dispossessed Africans while remaining 
focused on its major challenge: increasing growth and 
creating jobs. 
 
/// SAG COMMITTED TO LAND REFORM POLICY /// 
 
11. (C) Recent surveys (Markinor and Afrobarometer) of the 
general South African population indicate that land does not 
rank highly as a critical issue.  In the surveys, employment, 
crime, poverty, health, and education topped the lists.  Land 
was cited as an important issue by less than 10% of those 
polled.  Even if economic development takes longer than the 
ANC expects, a strategy to placate South Africans through a 
radical change in land policy is highly unlikely.  The SAG 
values long-term sustainable growth for South Africa over 
short-term ploys to win favor from its constituents. 
 
12. (C) The SAG has demonstrated its commitment to a legally 
protected land reform policy that recognizes the need to 
change land ownership patterns while upholding the rights of 
all property holders.  Based on the magnitude of the 
undertaking and the problem of limited resources, one should 
not overemphasize the SAG\'s slow progress in reforming land 
ownership.  Significant gains have been made in recent years. 
 There is still a substantial amount of work to be done, and 
plenty of criticism of the slow progress to date, but there 
is no indication that the SAG intends to stray from its 
approach or abandon its objectives.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin 
recently refuted union assertions that the government had 
abandoned its plans to sell-off state assets and restructure 
state-owned enterprises.  While senior government officials 
concede that partial privatizations of Eskom, Transnet or 
Denel would not take place this year, they expect the sale of 
core and non-core businesses in those parastatals to proceed 
as planned (Reftel A).  A senior Transnet official provided 
details on Transnet\'s plans for restructuring its diverse 
operations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) Over the past several months, the Congress of South 
African Trade Unions (COSATU) has declared victory in its 
fight against the government\'s privatization efforts.  COSATU 
General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi cited the absence of a 
privatization budget in the last two national budgets, the 
introduction of an extended public works program, and the 
commitment by the ANC in its manifesto that government would 
play a leading role in creating jobs as evidence that 
government had abandoned its privatization policy.  The 
public perception created by these statements was that 
government was abandoning any sell-off of state assets and 
backing away from its commitment to restructure state-owned 
enterprises. 
 
3.  (U) Minister of Public Enterprises Alec Erwin denied that 
this was the case in a June 14 statement to Parliament. 
Erwin said that the government had not deviated from its 
policy on restructuring for the last ten years and added, \"it 
is not our intention to do so now.\"  Erwin further elaborated 
that \"in the case of Eskom, Transnet and Denel we will move 
to implement concessions, joint ventures and PPPs\" over the 
next five years.  Erwin did indicate, however, that this 
administration\'s top priority was to create jobs for the 
nearly 40 percent of South African\'s who were unemployed. 
Erwin said that enhancing the efficiency and profitability of 
state-owned enterprises would be key to generating economic 
growth and employment opportunities. 
 
4.  (SBU) A senior Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) 
official told Econoff that Erwin\'s statement that \"Eskom, 
Transnet and Denel will remain as SOEs\" (state-owned 
enterprises) did not contradict previous commitments to 
partially privatize portions of those parastatals. He said 
that Erwin\'s statements only meant that the state-owned 
enterprises would not be wholly privatized.  The official 
said that DPE still planned to privatize 30 percent of 
Eskom\'s generating capacity, identify an equity share partner 
for Denel (South Africa\'s defense manufacturer), and 
streamline Transnet, but conceded that these deals would not 
take place this year.  The DPE official also said that the 
sale of non-core businesses held by Eskom and Transnet would 
take place as originally scheduled (Reftel A). 
 
5.  (C) A senior Transnet official reporting directly to 
Minister Erwin on the streamlining of the parastatal told 
Econoff that all Transnet businesses would be sold except 
Spoornet, National Port Authority (NPA), B2b Africa, 
Transwerk and the logistics resources of Viamax.  In 
addition, he said that Transnet\'s management workforce would 
be trimmed from 700 employees to 50. 
 
6. (C) The same official described the fate of other Transnet 
businesses as follows: 
 
-         South African Port Operations (SAPO): Runs 
container terminals and handles cargo at South Africa\'s six 
ports.  Transnet will keep SAPO. 
 
-         National Port Authority (NPA): South Africa\'s port 
authority.  The NPA will be corporatized by March 2005 and 
held as a subsidiary until Transnet has a reliable revenue 
source independent of the NPA.  The Public Enterprises 
Minister will appoint independent directors.  In addition, 
Durban Port\'s container terminal will be concessioned this 
year. NOTE: The official requested logistical assistance for 
an Oct. 7-8, 2004 visit to CSX Intermodal\'s facilities in 
Charlotte.  Trade Development Agency officials are acting to 
facilitate the request.  END NOTE.  The Cape Town Port 
Manager separately told Econ M/C that the Cape Town Container 
Terminal would be concessioned at some future date. 
 
-         SAA: South Africa\'s state-owned airline.  Transnet 
will sell SAA. 
-         Metrorail: Inter-city rail transport of passengers. 
 Metrorail was reassigned in June to the Department of 
Transport. The Transnet official said that Transnet would get 
out of all passenger services. 
 
-         Petronet: Petronet owns, operates, and maintains 
3000km of oil pipelines.  The official said that the 
Department of Minerals & Energy is interested in acquiring 
this business.  It will not be sold to the private industry. 
 
-         Propnet: Propnet is the largest landowner in South 
Africa.  Transnet will keep the warehouses, but sell off the 
rest of the company\'s property assets. 
 
-         Transtel: Transnet will sell or incorporate 
Transtel for its 15 percent equity share in the Second 
National Operator (fixed-line telecommunications company). 
 
-         Freight Dynamics: Freight Dynamics is a trucking 
company that offers road transport solutions.  Transnet will 
sell the company. 
 
-         Transwerk: Transwerk provides rolling stock and 
rail-related products.  Transnet will align Transwerk under 
Spoornet. 
 
-         Transwerk Foundaries: A Traswerk subsidiary. 
Transnet will sell the company. 
 
-         Transwerk Perway: A Traswerk subsidiary.  Transnet 
will sell the company. 
 
-         MTN: Africa\'s most profitable cellular telephone 
company.  In April, Transnet sold its remaining 5 percent 
stake for R2.5 billion ($417 million). 
 
-         Autopax: This bus company transports passengers 
throughout South Africa.  Transnet will sell the company. 
 
-         B2b Africa: An eBusiness supply chain management 
company.  Transnet will keep use this company to build a 
future unified logistics product. 
 
-         Viamax: Transet will keep the logistics resources 
of this fleet maintenance and management business, but sell 
the rest of its assets. 
 
-         V&A Waterfront: Transnet Pension Fund will keep its 
72 percent share in the Waterfront, but Transnet will sell 
its 28 percent to a public agency such as the Public 
Investmet Commission (PIC). 
 
-         Transure: Transnet will liquidate this company. 
 
-         Apron Services: A ramp handling company operating 
at the major South African airports.  Transnet will look to 
sell its remaining 49 percent share. 
 
-         Marine Data Systems: The company specialized in 
remote tracking systems, but was closed.  Some aspects of the 
firm will be relocated to the NPA. 
 
-         Protekon: Transnet will this engineering company to 
a BEE firm. 
 
-         Air Chefs: This wholly owned subsidiary of SAA 
provides in-flight catering services.  It will be sold 
together with SAA. 
 
-         Fleetcall: Fleetcall offers nationwide coverage for 
voice and data calls between a dispatcher and vehicles on the 
move.  This company will be sold to a BEE firm. 
 
-         Arivia.com: Transnet will sell this information 
technology company. 
 
7.  (SBU) Erwin also indicated in his statement to Parliament 
that future initial public offerings (IPOs) of state-owned 
enterprises were not out of the question.  While details of 
another Telkom IPO and privatization deals involving South 
African Airways (SAA) and Airports Company South Africa 
(ACSA) are currently unavailable, the Transnet official said 
they might be revealed in September when DPE releases its 
investment strategies for the state-owned enterprises under 
its jurisdiction.

Summary 
------- 
 
 1. (U) Users of South African employment data should 
 be aware of certain statistical anomalies.  Poor 
 statistical design in 2000 and 2001 caused formal 
 employment to be grossly underestimated in those 
 years.  In 2002, these design flaws were corrected 
 and formal employment was estimated to be 1.5 million 
 higher than the previous year.  Nonetheless, a South 
 African Reserve Bank (SARB) publication in June 2004 
 included a labor market study showing that formal 
 employment actually declined from 5.1 million in 1980 
 to 4.7 million in 2001.  \"The Economist\" picked up on 
 this faulty statistic and included it in an article 
 entitled \"South Africa\'s Economy, Tack to the Left\" 
 in the July 3rd-9th 2004 issue.  This cable is meant 
 to correct any confusion that this may have caused. 
 End Summary. 
 
 2. (U) In \"South Africa\'s Economy, Tack to the Left\" 
 in the July 3rd-9th 2004 issue of \"The Economist\", 
 the author cited a SARB study on South African 
 employment over the past 20 years showing more formal 
 sector jobs in 1980 than in 2001.  In short, drawing 
 this conclusion on faulty data was a mistake.  The 
 Economist should have noted that the author of the 
 labor market study had pointed out problems with the 
 data, explaining that his purpose was to analyze 
 employment trends by industry, rather than increases 
 or decreases over time.  The labor market study 
 indicated formal nonagricultural employment declining 
 from 5.1 million in 1980 to 4.7 million in 2001 -- a 
 drop of 400,000 jobs while GDP growth averaged 1.7 
 percent. 
 
 3. (U) The author of the \"The Economist\" article also 
 did not know that immediately following the release 
 of the SARB collection of labor market studies, 
 Statistics SA published a rebuttal challenging the 
 use of the 1980 and 2001 data to analyze overall 
 changes in formal employment.  The rebuttal explained 
 that the figures from the 2000 and 2001 surveys were 
 released as discussion documents rather than official 
 surveys because of poor statistical design.  When the 
 employment series resumed in 2002, about 1.5 million 
 more individuals were counted as employed in the 
 formal non-agricultural sector.  Moreover, 1980 data 
 used for comparison purposes excluded employment in 
 the homeland areas.  Users of South African 
 employment data should be aware of these statistical 
 anomalies.

SUBJECT:  NEW INCENTIVES FUEL ADDITIONAL HOPES FOR ROBUST 
FILM INDUSTRY GROWTH IN SOUTH AFRICA 
 
-------------------------- 
Introduction & Summary 
-------------------------- 
 
1. The feature and commercial film industry in South Africa 
continues to grow vigorously.  An industry that in 1995 
generated 4,000 jobs now employs an estimated 20,000 
workers.  Film production ranging from commercials and 
shorts to full-length movies produced in South Africa has 
grown substantially.  The total value of the South African 
entertainment industry is estimated to be about 7.7 billion 
Rand (USD 1.25 billion).  South Africa, especially Cape 
Town, is capitalizing on a number of advantages that include 
good weather, a diversity of locations, English-speaking and 
experienced film crews and technicians, and good 
infrastructure to market its filmmaking capacity.  On July 
1, the South African government finalized a rebate/incentive 
scheme designed to bolster South Africa\'s claim to being a 
\"high-quality production site for international and local 
film-making.\"   The incentive plan will provide as much as 
10 million Rand in rebates for film productions of more than 
25 million Rand.  The incentives will help to bring South 
Africa into line with incentives schemes offered in 
Australia, Canada and New Zealand.   A recent upsurge in 
quality productions and filming with named stars - Samuel L. 
Jackson, Colin Farrell, Nicholas Cage, Selma Hayek, and Sean 
Penn - as well as the start of development of a substantial 
Hollywood-style film studio in Cape Town are providing 
additional impetus to South Africa\'s film industry.  Other 
incentives and help for the film industry include support 
from the Industrial Development Corporation, the National 
Film & Video Foundation, municipal governments and regional 
film Commissions.  While the future appears rosy for feature 
films, bumps in the road may appear.  The high costs of the 
Rand and loss of commercial advertisements place constraints 
on the generally optimistic scenario for the future. End 
introduction and Summary. 
 
-------------- 
Rebate Program 
-------------- 
 
2. The Film and Television Production Rebate, established by 
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on July 1, 
targets the production of foreign and local large budget 
films made in South Africa or under co-production 
agreements. (A downloadable brochure on the rebate scheme 
can be found on the DTI\'s web site at www.dti.org.za.) 
Eligible companies must either be a South African resident 
company or a non-South African company with a South African 
business registration.  Eligible applicants will qualify for 
a 15 per cent rebate on production expenditures for foreign 
productions (and up to 25 per cent on production expenses 
for South African companies.)  Film projects must have begun 
after April 1, 2004 and must reach a threshold of 25 million 
Rand in order to qualify for the rebates.  Other 
requirements include 50 per cent completion of the principal 
photography in South Africa and a minimum of four weeks 
photography time.  Eligible productions include feature 
movies, tele-movies, television series, and documentaries. 
The maximum rebate for any project will be 10 million Rand 
(USD 1.5 million).  One attractive feature of the rebate 
system is that it allows for a company to bundle more than 
one production in order to achieve the 25 million Rand 
threshold. 
 
3. The DTI worked with the Department of Arts and Culture 
(DAC) and the Department of Communication (DOC) in 
formulating the strategy to develop the \"content industries\" 
because all three Departments share competency in this 
subject.  Content constitutes cultural artifact (DAC), is a 
tradable commodity (DTI), and relates to television 
programs, cinema, animation, video, electronic games and any 
other audio-visual mode of packaging (DOC).  In establishing 
this new incentive, the government recognizes the 
contribution of film productions to South Africa\'s economic 
development by providing valuable economic, employment and 
skill development opportunities.  The rebate is exempt from 
income tax. 
 
4. According to Martin Cuff of the Cape Film Commission, 
there are other incentives available to filmmakers.  One of 
these is flexible agreements with co-production partners. 
These allow for the modest use of foreign government 
supports for projects partially realized in South Africa. 
Currently South Africa has co-production agreements with 
Canada, Italy, and soon with Germany.  They allow monies 
from these countries to be spent in South Africa.  Section 
24F of the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 allows a tax 
deferral of up to two years in order for film producers to 
realize box office revenue and gives tax relief for 
individual investors in film production.  Overall, Cuff 
believes the various incentives are an important 
psychological carrot and more modest financial inducement 
that are enhancing South Africa\'s ability to compete 
internationally. 
 
------------------------ 
Cape Town & Johannesburg 
------------------------ 
 
5. The South African film industry is clustered primarily in 
two locations, Cape Town and Johannesburg.  There are 
approximately 150 registered producers currently active in 
South Africa.  For reasons of consolidation and economies of 
scale, 15 of these companies command over 90 per cent of 
feature films and television production.  South Africans 
aggressively market themselves internationally and seek 
projects that include filming not only in South Africa, but 
also throughout Africa.  Martin Cuff pointed to a recent 
remake of the classic Flight of the Phoenix.  A South 
African company filming mainly in Namibia did much of the 
location work.  In 2002-2003, 35 feature films and 
television series were shot in Cape Town. 
 
6.  Cape Town is ahead in the race to develop a major film 
studio.  South African film producer Anant Singh (I Capture 
the Castle, Comrades), ironically a native of Durban, is 
spearheading the project. Singh has pushed for the 
construction of Dreamworld Film City, a Hollywood-standard, 
big production studio complex in Cape Town.  Land clearing 
for the studio, situated along the N-2 between the Cape 
International Airport and Somerset West, is already 
underway.  Construction is set to begin next year, with 
completion of the first phase set for 2006.  When completed, 
Dreamworld Film City could generate employment for as many 
as 8,000 individuals. The estimated cost of the studio is 
400 million Rand with the studio slated to receive 
approximately 60 million Rand from the Cape Town 
municipality. 
 
7.  The advantage of Johannesburg resides in the fact that 
more than two-thirds of the television production capacity 
of South Africa is in Gauteng and the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation has been reluctant to farm out work 
to Cape Town and elsewhere.   Other investments in post- 
production such as a film lab in Cape Town and Johannesburg- 
based sound studios have substantially augmented film 
production capabilities. 
 
----------------- 
Recent Successes 
----------------- 
 
8.  Recent South African feature film credits includes a 
number of potentially attention-grabbing productions. 
\"Country of My Skull,\" a $15 million dollar production 
staring Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche, was filmed 
substantially in Cape Town and looks at the end of the 
apartheid regime.  The official release of the movie is 
scheduled for Cape Town later this year.  Two feature films 
with international stars are currently underway in Cape 
Town.  Colin Farrell, Selma Hayek, and Donald Sutherland 
star in \"Ask the Dust\" set in 1930\'s Los Angeles.  \"Ask the 
Dust\" is considered a labor of love with the salaries paid 
to the cast being comparatively low and overall budgeting 
for Cape Town set at about USD 7 million.  The project 
involves the construction of elaborate period sets.  \"The 
Lord of War\", an action movie about an international arms 
dealer, features Nicholas Cage and Ethan Hawke. 
Conversations with production crew indicate that Cape Town 
and the Western Cape were chosen less for reasons of cost 
and more because the Western Cape offered \"a microcosm of 
diverse locations\".  For \"The Lord of War,\" a total of 39 
locations have been selected to simulate locales as diverse 
as Afghanistan, Cuba, and Sierra Leone, yet all within a 
short drive of Cape Town.  Sean Penn is set to appear in 
\"Last Face,\" a movie about two humanitarian doctors in war- 
torn Africa nation.  Finally, also on the radar screen is a 
remake of the 1970\'s \"Poseidon Adventure,\" with Film Afrika 
to take the lead in Cape Town.  According to Martin Cuff of 
the Cape Film Commission, one of the reasons for the 
selection of Cape Town was the ability of the producer to 
draw from the yacht construction industry to build the 
Poseidon set.  The Cape Town film industry hopes these 
projects will encourage others to follow suit in 2005 and 
beyond. 
 
------------------------------ 
Other Incentives and Supports 
------------------------------ 
 
9. --- The government\'s Industrial Development Corporation 
(IDC) considers the film industry one of its critical 
sectors.  The Media & Motion Pictures division serves as a 
financing vehicle and will provide as much of 50 per cent of 
production costs.  Minimum equity loans are one million 
Rand.  \"Stander,\" a full length movie centering around 
policeman turned robber released only in South Africa is 
viewed as one of the more successful products that has 
returned money to the IDC.  Overall, the IDC reportedly has 
250 million Rand to finance film projects. 
 
--- National Film & Video Foundation (NFVF) in Johannesburg 
was created to in order to increase local content quotas for 
television.  According to DTI, the IDC and the NFVF invested 
in 16 of the 24 films produced in South Africa in 2003.  Its 
capital stock for feature films is reportedly 35 million 
Rand.   NFVF plays an important role in funding, training, 
developing, and promoting the South African film industry. 
 
--- City of Cape Town has adopted as part of its mission 
statement the creation of a \"film-friendly environment.\" 
The city has worked actively with the Cape Film Commission 
to hold down prices for filming permits, provided traffic 
control and off-duty police services, and other supports for 
the film industry throughout the extensive metropolitan 
area.  Cape Town has also committed to underwrite part of 
the costs of the Dreamworld Studio complex. 
 
--- Regional Film Commissions - There are formal film 
commissions for Cape Town, Johannesburg, KZN (Durban) and 
the Eastern Cape (Port Elizabeth).  The Cape Film Commission 
claims pride of place, seeking to serve as a one-stop 
information shop for local and international filmmakers.  It 
seeks to pare down costs for filming, especially charges for 
locations on private properties, and provide public 
relations support for the film industry.  It clearly seeks 
to increase participation by Africans and advance Black 
Economic Empowerment, mainly through learning opportunities 
in the film industry.  Budgets and staff support, however, 
are small.  Cape Town has an advisory council and 
approximately 10 permanent staff, most responsible for 
processing filming permits. 
 
--- DTI indicated that the launch of the new rebate scheme 
was just the first of a set of support measures to develop 
the film industry in South Africa.  Eventually, the full 
package will cover production cost, training and an 
internship program, and export marketing support. 
 
------------------ 
Conclusion 
------------------ 
 
10. Overall, the South African film industry appears to be 
on the rise, particularly in the feature film arena.  Even 
with the strong Rand, South Africans believe they can 
compete internationally.  New incentives and successful film 
projects may lure additional work to South Africa. Another 
critical factor are relative low costs for skilled labor. 
Cuff and others are upbeat about feature film production 
with long lead times and negotiated pay structures that help 
soften the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.  Cuff 
maintains that even with a strong Rand overall film 
production costs are still 50 percent less than for a 
comparable product in the U.S.  Cuff was less upbeat about 
advertising and television commercial production.  He felt 
Cape Town was increasingly pricey and in recent years 
overexposed.  Some in the industry worry the South African 
film might be poised to slip from the present boom cycle. 
Trying to catch up with an Australia or a Canada, the South 
African industry must also look over its shoulder at new 
rivals such as Argentina and Chile, who are making gains, 
especially for commercials and television spots.

Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Mintek, the South African state-owned 
minerals processing research institution, has entered into 
an agreement with the National Iranian Copper Industries 
Company (NICICO) to construct a USD 3-4 million heap bio- 
leaching pilot plant in Sarcheshmeh, Iran.  Construction 
should begin before the end of the year.  If the pilot 
plant proves successful, it could lead to the use of Mintek 
heap bio-leaching technology to produce copper from low- 
grade ore elsewhere in the world.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Mintek\'s Biotechnology Division manager Dr. Tony 
Pinches told us that Mintek had been working with the 
NICICO for three years to determine whether its copper ores 
were amenable to Mintek\'s heap bio-leaching technology. 
Pinches explained that while Mintek\'s technology offered a 
general solution to processing low-grade copper ore, it was 
especially suited for chalcopyrite (a sulfide), for which 
there was currently no economic treatment.  With its many 
low-grade chalcopyrite deposits, Iran seemed the natural 
choice for a pilot-plant.  Sarcheshmeh is the site of one 
of the world\'s largest low-grade copper mines, with a total 
ore reserve of 1.2 billion tons at an average grade of 0.7 
percent copper. 
 
3. (SBU) NICICO and Mintek will construct and operate two 
or three heap-leach pads at Sarcheshmeh, each capable of 
handling approximately 20 kilotons of low-grade copper ore. 
The copper-bearing solution derived from the leached ore 
will be treated by solvent extraction before being fed to 
the existing electro-winning facility to produce pure 
copper metal.  Test results so far have been promising. 
Construction of the USD 3-4 million plant should begin 
before the end of the year.  Pinches told us that the pilot 
plant would take two years to build, after which NICICO 
would have to decide whether to build a commercial plant. 
 
4. (SBU) According to Mintek\'s agreement with NICICO, 
NICICO will acquire the exclusive right to Mintek heap bio- 
leaching technology in Iran as well as for any project 
where it holds at least a 10 percent stake.  Mintek retains 
all other technology rights.  If successful, Mintek\'s heap 
bio-leaching technology could find broad application in the 
international copper-mining industry, making the mining of 
many more copper deposits commercially viable and adding to 
world supply and reserves during a period of rising demand.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: REVIEW OF DR. ROBERT FINKELMAN\'S 
THREE-MONTH TOUR AS EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOW 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: On June 28, Dr. Finkelman, a coal scientist 
with the U.S. Geological Survey, completed a highly 
successful three-month tour-of-duty as Embassy Science 
Fellow.  Dr. Finkelman met with more than 500 South 
Africans in over forty formal meetings, presentations, and 
seminars to officials in government, industry, academia, 
and public health to introduce the field of medical 
geology.  His conclusion was that there was more than 
sufficient support in South Africa to pursue medical 
geology as a science and as a public health concern.  Dr. 
Finkelman will be returning to South Africa in 2005 and 
2006 to teach courses in medical geology and coal science, 
and to consult with both government and industry on the 
establishment of a medical geology research center to serve 
both the country and the region.  End summary. 
 
--------------- 
Medical Geology 
--------------- 
 
2. (U) Earth disturbances caused by mining, farming, 
construction, and natural events such as earthquakes and 
volcanic activity, together with the burning of 
hydrocarbons may release gases and particulate matter into 
the environment that harm human and animal health.  Medical 
geology is the science of determining the impact on health 
of such geological activities, and proposing solutions. 
South Africa is a natural place to foster medical geology, 
since the country has one of the world\'s largest mining 
industries, generates more than 60 percent of the 
continent\'s electricity from high ash coal, and is home to 
the most advanced commercial agriculture on the continent. 
Moreover, health problems that might have been addressed by 
medical geology still have not been tackled in a 
coordinated way. 
 
------------------------------- 
Medical Geology Research Center 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Dr. Finkelman used his Embassy Science Fellowship to 
introduce the concept of medical geology to a wide-ranging 
audience in South Africa.  His presentations generated 
considerable interest among government, industry, and 
academic officials.  There was particular interest in 
establishing a medical geology research center that could 
facilitate the analysis of trace elements, the 
identification of toxic substances, the development of 
preventative measures and medical treatment, teaching, and 
domestic and international research in the field of medical 
geology.  Before Dr. Finkelman departed, Pretoria, 
Johannesburg, and Witwatersrand Universities as well as the 
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (a 
government research institution) expressed the desire to 
participate in the establishment of such a center. 
 
----------------- 
Other Initiatives 
----------------- 
 
4. (U) Other initiatives set in motion by Dr. Finkelman 
include the following: 
 
-- Johannesburg University [recently created through the 
merger of Rand Afrikaans University and Witwatersrand 
Technikon] will develop a coal quality database as an 
integral part of its planned Center of Excellence for Coal, 
Hydrocarbon, Energy and Environmental Education.  The 
database will also be part of South Africa\'s Coaltech 2020 
research program to determine the quantity and quality of 
South African coal reserves. 
 
 
-- University of Pretoria is creating an informal Medical 
Geology Working Group to plot the way forward on animal 
health issues; 
 
-- University of Kwazulu/Natal Medical School (Durban) 
plans to include medical geology as part of its course on 
Environmental Toxicology; 
 
-- Onderstepoort Veterinary School (Pretoria) will research 
medical geology as it pertains to animals.  At Dr. 
Finkelman\'s suggestion, the school will host a first-ever 
workshop on \'Veterinary Geology\' in 2006, to be sponsored 
by the United Nations. 
 
5. (U) Dr. Finkelman\'s presence also stimulated the 
following: 
 
-- universities and research organizations are developing a 
regional network to share information on medical geology 
already there has been an exchange of information on 
veterinary matters between Namibia and South Africa; 
 
-- Anglo Coal has initiated research on the impact of 
spontaneous coal combustion on human health; 
 
-- National Institute for Occupational Health is 
contemplating developing a predictive model for Coal 
Workers Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung Disease); 
 
-- visiting professors from Pennsylvania State University 
and Eastern Georgia College helped teach courses at 
Witwatersrand University, and consulted with SASOL and 
other coal producers.

The Foreseeable Future 
---------------------- 
 
6. (U) Given South Africa\'s world-class mining industry and 
sophisticated medical community, Dr. Finkelman believes 
that the country is uniquely situated to benefit from the 
science of medical geology.  On his return to the United 
States, he has promised to seek financial support for the 
creation of a medical geology research center in South 
Africa, similar to the one that he is establishing in 
China.  In addition, Dr. Finkelman has agreed to return to 
South Africa in 2005 and 2006 to lecture at the 
universities of Pretoria, Johannesburg and Witwatersrand in 
medical and veterinary geology, to consult to Sasol and 
Anglo Coal and to supervise South Africa\'s first master\'s 
degree student studying medical geology.  As requested, Dr. 
Finkelman will analyze and report to Anglo American Coal on 
trace elements emitted from its burning coal dumps and 
abandoned underground mines in Witbank (in Mpumalanga 
Province).  The burning coal presents a significant health 
and safety hazard to local inhabitants.

1.  (C)  Summary/Conclusion.  Recent policy statements by 
senior government officials and moves to intervene in the 
economy send the wrong signals to the business community and 
undermine investor confidence.  Still, despite the 
counterproductive rhetoric and ill-conceived policy 
interventions, the economy remains fundamentally sound. 
Government\'s key economic policy makers are unlikely to make 
any substantial shift to the left in policy that would roll 
back the success of the last decade.  The price of pandering 
to the left, however, is that the recent rhetoric and policy 
initiatives limit South Africa\'s ability to achieve sustained 
higher growth, necessary to create jobs and reduce poverty. 
In the short term, South Africa will muddle through with 
moderate but positive growth and little progress on its most 
pressing economic issues.  End Summary/Conclusion. 
 
Policy Fundamentally Sound 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  South Africa\'s economic fundamentals are sound.  The 
economy grew 3 percent in first quarter of 2004, its 
eighteenth consecutive quarter of positive growth. 
Forecasters expect the economy to grow at 3 percent 
throughout the year.  Based on higher than forecast revenue 
growth, the budget deficit for fiscal 2004/5 is likely to be 
smaller than the Finance Minister\'s estimate of 3.1 percent 
of GDP.  Inflation (CPI minus mortgage costs) remains stable 
and low at 4.4 percent, in the mid-range of the Reserve 
Bank\'s 3-6 percent target.  While export volumes declined 
slightly in the first quarter, export values grew, supported 
by high commodity prices.  The current account deficit, 1.8 
percent and 1.6 percent of GDP over the last two quarters 
respectively, is easily financed by strong capital inflows. 
Jobs creation, however, remains the weak point: unemployment 
is 30-plus percent and the economy lost 113,000 formal sector 
jobs in the first quarter. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The first quarter\'s performance is characteristic 
of the economy\'s performance over the last decade: steady, 
moderate growth based on sound fiscal and monetary policy 
management.  The country\'s economic performance has, however, 
been insufficient to address the fundamental problem in the 
economy: poverty and unemployment.  Addressing this issue is 
key economic challenge of President Mbeki\'s second term. 
 
But Sending the Wrong Signals 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Since early this year, and particularly since 
April\'s election, government economic policy statements and 
initiatives have become more interventionist, reflecting a 
sense of urgency and frustration with the economy\'s failure 
to create formal sector jobs.  In a June 23 address to 
Parliament, Mbeki cited leftist British author Will Hutton in 
justifying an important role for the state in establishing a 
just society (reftel A).  The President\'s remarks, and 
similar ones by leading ministers, plus several ill-handled 
policy initiatives, outlined below, have sparked a lively 
debate on the direction of economic policy.  Parliamentary 
opposition and Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Tony Leon has 
accused Mbeki of moving \"economic policy from the free market 
and towards state control.\"  SAG spokespersons countered that 
the DA favors \"unbridled market dominance\" while ignoring the 
role of government in any economy.  The press has reported 
the debate in detail, and \"Business Day,\" the leading 
business daily, has 
published numerous opinion pieces by prominent commentators 
in its series \"Towards an Economy of Our Own.\" 
 
Control Drug Prices 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Early this year, the government announced draft 
regulations that would have required pharmaceutical companies 
to set ex-factory prices for regulated drugs at no more than 
50 percent of their current listed price to help reduce the 
cost of medical care.  Following months of negotiations 
between the government and the pharmaceutical industry, the 
two sides agreed on a pricing method that should lower 
consumer costs without jeopardizing the industry\'s 
operations.  While the multinational pharmaceutical companies 
reached an acceptable agreement, the fight dampened 
companies\' inclination to expand operations in South Africa. 
For example, a major U.S. pharmaceutical firm dropped plans 
to introduce five new products in the market due to 
uncertainty about the regulatory environment. 
 
Slow Down Restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  (C)  Newly appointed Minister of Public Enterprises Alex 
Erwin told Parliament June 14 that while the SAG had not 
abandoned its policy on restructuring state-owned enterprises 
(SOE\'s), \"it is not our intention to do so now\" (reftel B). 
In addition, the minister said that no state-owned 
enterprises would be sold this year.  Instead the government 
would focus on improving the efficiency and capital structure 
of SOE\'s to support higher economic growth rates.  Erwin 
elaborated that \"in the case of Eskom, Transnet and Denel we 
will move to implement concessions, joint ventures and PPPs\" 
over the next five years.  The minister indicated, however, 
that this administration\'s top priority was to create jobs. 
Although Erwin\'s statement refuted trade union assertions 
that restructuring was dead, the announcement was also a move 
in the trade unions\' direction: maintaining jobs will take 
priority over efficiency in the parastatal sector. 
 
Discourage FDI with BEE Equity Requirements 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  For foreign investors, the lack of flexibility in 
Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) equity requirements is a 
growing disincentive.  In the financial services charter 
negotiations, foreign banks won a last minute exemption from 
prescribed equity requirements in return for a commitment to 
finance local business development.  In the ongoing ICT 
charter negotiations, BEE equity requirements for 
multinational corporations are the central issue (reftel C). 
So far, representatives of local ICT businesses have refused 
to offer foreign ICT companies any flexibility on equity, 
such as higher performance standards in human resource 
development.  While a compromise may be reached, as in the 
financial sector charter negotiations, U.S. ICT companies are 
not confident: several are already preparing contingency 
plans to divest.  As a U.S. business advisor in the ICT 
sector noted, the damage to investor perceptions is already 
done.  The controversy over the ICT charter is also creating 
nervousness in other sectors. 
Foreign banks express concern that the financial services 
charter will be reopened and their equity exemption lost.  In 
addition, several U.S. firms in the pharmaceutical and 
freight sectors are in discussion with their headquarters 
about their continued presence in the South African market. 
 
 
Stifle Minerals Exploration 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  As part of its drive to push ahead BEE in the mining 
sector, the SAG tried to implement in June a requirement that 
firms must be 51 percent Black South African-owned to obtain 
a minerals exploration license on state-owned land. 
Following objections from the mining sector, led by foreign 
investors, the SAG agreed to review the requirement in light 
of the fact that the BEE Mining Charter calls for 15 percent 
and 26 percent Black equity ownership in five and tens years, 
respectively.  Industry is concerned that the 51-percent 
requirement could bring minerals exploration to a halt and 
seriously hinder the development of new mines and employment. 
 In July, the government backed down, stating that the 51 
percent BEE requirement would only apply during a one-year 
transition period and then fall away. 
 
Keep Telecom Monopoly 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  In telecommunications, the SAG is publicly committed 
to bringing competition to the sector; yet after two years of 
delay, the Communications Minister refuses to authorize the 
ownership structure for the Second National Operator, despite 
a recommendation by the independent regulator (reftel D).  As 
a result, telecom charges in South Africa remain among the 
highest in the world. 
 
Restrict Land Ownership 
----------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  The SAG\'s June announcement that it would open a 
dialogue on restricting foreign ownership of land was poorly 
handled (reftel E).  The SAG presented no evidence to support 
its claim that foreign demand was driving up land values.  In 
fact, the limited research publicly available indicates that 
from 0.5 percent to eight percent of property transactions 
involved foreigners. 
 
Not Serious About Investment 
---------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  Among other things (e.g., more flexible labor 
markets), South Africa needs higher levels of investment if 
it is to reach the growth rates needed to reduce poverty and 
increase employment.  The government\'s recent policy 
statements and its poorly managed interventions in the 
economy, however, underscore that the SAG is not serious 
about promoting private sector investment, and particularly 
attracting foreign direct investment.  Private sector 
investment last year was 12.6 percent of GDP, markedly below 
the 20 percent of GDP of high-growth emerging markets.  South 
Africa has also failed to attract significant levels of FDI: 
it receives about one third the level of FDI as similar 
emerging markets.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA INAUGURATES RECEIVING STATION FOR 
EARTH OBSERVING SATELLITES 
 
1. Summary.  The recent launch of earth observing 
satellite reception capability at South Africa\'s 
Satellite Applications Center (SAC) extends and enhances 
ongoing efforts to apply satellite-based information to 
support agriculture, food security, and disaster 
management and mitigation efforts.  The SAC has, and 
continues to expand good working relationships with USG 
agencies and academic institutions. End summary. 
 
2. On Tuesday, July 20, Deputy Minister for Agriculture 
and Land Affairs Dirk du Toit presided over the launch 
of reception capability of two earth observing satellite 
systems, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro 
radiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery, at South 
Africa\'s Satellite Application Center (SAC) in 
Hartebeeshoek, outside Pretoria.  The MODIS system is a 
new generation of satellite sensors developed by NASA to 
monitor land, ocean and atmospheric processes. 
According to the Council on Scientific and Industrial 
Research, this is the first MODIS direct broadcast 
receiving station in Africa. 
 
3. Since 2000, the National Department of Agriculture 
(NDA) has underwritten the R 12 million (currently USD 2 
million) procurement of a MODIS receiving and processing 
system, based on useful MODIS applications for the 
agricultural sector, namely information on food 
security, crop yield monitoring, grazing capacity, and 
land degradation.  MODIS also provides information on 
global change, disaster management and disaster 
mitigation.  The South African government plans to make 
satellite imagery data freely available to SADC 
governments, research organizations and non-governmental 
organizations. 
 
4. The SAC has developed specialized applications based 
on MODIS images, in particular, a fire warning service 
that is expected to benefit the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) region.  Phillip Frost, the 
SAC remote sensing specialist most involved in MODIS and 
related applications and activities, told EST Officer 
that the SAC has worked with the U.S. Geological Survey 
and NASA to install required software for a rapid 
response system for \"near real-time\" fire detection in 
SADC.  SAC then developed a system of real-time alerts 
through e-mail and cellular phone text messages when 
fires break out near any installation of Eskom, the 
national electricity supplier.  SAC hopes to market this 
innovative system at an upcoming international 
conference of electric power companies. 
 
5. According to Frost, SAC also has an excellent working 
relationship with the University of Maryland and NASA on 
the Southern African Fire Network (SAFNET) and Global 
Observation of Forest Cover Fire.  SAC was recently 
chosen as a fourth partner for algorithm development for 
NASA\'s Direct Broadcast Bidirectional Reflection 
Distribution Function (BRDF) Proposal, joining 
Australia, China and Utah Forestry Services.  SAC will 
work closely with Boston University\'s Dr. Crystal Schaaf 
on this project.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES CHARTER FOR 
BLACK EMPOWERMENT IN AGRICULTURE 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The South African Department of Agriculture 
released its proposal for black economic empowerment (BEE) in 
the agricultural sector this week.  The draft charter calls 
for major changes in the racial demography of the sector 
within ten years. The vastly white agricultural community 
criticized the proposal, with one group claiming it would 
lead to the collapse of the sector.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  The South African Government released a draft 
agricultural charter for black economic empowerment (BEE) 
July 26. The charter, known as AgriBEE, sets out targets for 
the country\'s agricultural sector including 35% black 
ownership of agricultural enterprises by 2008.  The draft 
charter also stated that 50% of agricultural land (a 20 
percentage point increase over the original 30% proposal), 
including that owned by the state, should be available to 
black farmers by 2014.  One provision calls for farmers to 
allocate 10% of their land to farmworkers for their own 
activities.  Farmers will also be expected to procure 70% of 
their inputs from BEE companies by 2015. The transfer of 
farms envisaged by the charter will cost the government no 
less than 50 billion Rand.  The charter applies to \"all 
economic activities relating to the provision of agricultural 
inputs, services, farming, processing, distribution, 
logistics, and allied activities that add value to 
agricultural products.\"  Agricultural Minister Thoko Didiza 
said, \"Given the history of injustices in our country, this 
is a means to redress such imbalances.\" 
 
 
3.  The response of South Africa\'s predominantly white 
agricultural community to the charter has been overwhelmingly 
negative.  Mr. Bully Botma, Grain South Africa\'s chairman, 
said that many of the key elements of the document agreed 
upon by by the stakeholders and role-players had been omitted 
whilst many others had been unilaterally introduced, making 
\"a mockery of the whole negotiation process.\"  Pieter Mulder, 
leader of the Freedom Front Plus (a conservative political 
party representing mainly Afrikaner interests), issued a 
statement denouncing the document for \"unrealistic 
timeframes, too little emphasis on productivity, and the 
creation of unachievable expectations,\" and focusing \"only on 
quotas.\"  The Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU) stated that 
the AgriBEE framework would lead to the collapse of 
agriculture in South Africa, placing the country on the same 
route as Zimbabwe.  They also stated, \"Our initial opinion is 
that the proposed framework will destroy the principle of 
property rights and the free market system.\"  Agricultural 
Business Chamber CEO Tobias Doyer said that the government 
was creating a \"very difficult challenge,\" especially in 
terms of finding the financial capital to reach the targets. 
To put things in perspective, only about 3% of farmland has 
been transferred to black ownership since 1994. 
 
4.  The charter is open to negotiation until November, when a 
final draft will be prepared for ratification by the cabinet. 
 Motsepe Matlala, the president of the National African 
Farmers Union (NAFU), which represents black farmers\' 
interests, said he did not think the targets were especially 
tough, \"provided that the government worked together with the 
private sector.\"  However, he was \"sure that discussions over 
the next few months may shift the views of the government.\" 
AgriSA executive director Hans van der Merwe said that the 
first draft is \"a point of departure for robust discussion,\" 
especially as there is no indication in the charter of how 
emerging farmers will receive crucial support.  Democratic 
Alliance agricultural spokesman Kraai van Niekerk suggests 
the charter should follow the example set by the information, 
communication, and technology (ICT) and financial sectors, in 
which private industry was invited to work on the drafts. 
Minister Didiza will appoint a steering committee which will 
\"adequately reflect the agricultural sector and the 
government\" to undertake consultations regarding the charter.

fifth annual USITC study on AGOA. 
 
A.  Major developments in host country economic, trade and/or 
investment policies, or U.S. policies directly affecting host country 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------------- 
 
South Africa welcomed the visit of the U.S. Trade Representative, 
Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick, in February 2004, who met with then 
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin to discuss the way forward on 
the Doha Agenda.  The Minister publicly welcomed Ambassador 
Zoellick\'s initiative to move the negotiations forward so that 2004 
would not be a lost year.  The private sector worked with the 
government to produce a new charter for the financial services sector 
that promotes Black Economic Empowerment (BEE).  Representatives of 
U.S. companies in the information, communications and technology 
(ICT) sector continue to meet with their South African private sector 
counterparts to develop and ICT Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
charter.  The government indicated there would be more BEE charters 
developed for other sectors, including agriculture.  The government 
announced a new program in the film industry that would allow foreign 
investors to a rebate of up to 15% of their costs for qualifying 
productions. 
 
B.  Developments in major regional groupings (COMESA, EC, ECOWAS, 
IGAD, SACU, SADC, WAEMU, IOC, and CEMAC) (where applicable) 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
 
SACU continued to negotiate with the United States for a Free Trade 
Agreement with six rounds of talks from June 2003 to June 2004. The 
first two rounds were held in South Africa.  The FTA negotiation 
marks the first time that SACU is acting as a single body in trade 
talks. 
 
C.  Updated Information on privatization efforts 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
Privatization efforts have been slow. In the telecommunications 
sector, there has been little progress in resolving concerns over 
operational control of the Second National Operator (SNO). 
The government has said it will continue to implement 
concessions, joint ventures, and public private 
partnerships (PPPs) in the case of Eskom, Transnet and 
Denel over the next five years.  The Congress of South 
African Trade Unions (COSATU), however, claimed that the 
government has backed away from its commitment to 
restructure state-owned enterprises. (See reftel C.) 
 
D.  Status of and developments in the host country\'s relationship 
with the United States and AGOA, especially examples of AGOA-related 
investment, non-traditional export developments, government reform 
efforts, or regional cooperation (where applicable) 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------------- 
 
President Bush visited South Africa in July 2003 and 
advanced our bilateral economic relationship.  South Africa 
continues to take advantage of the duty-free preferences of AGOA by 
exporting in all sectors.  A major U.S. clothing manufacturer, Levi 
Strauss SA, began exporting its 501 jeans to the United States under 
AGOA in mid-2003 using fabric imported from the Levi\'s textile plant 
in Greensboro, North Carolina.  South African clothing exporters 
appreciated AGOA for enabling them to continue to export to the 
United States, which the stronger rand has made more difficult.  The 
recently declining exports of AGOA clothing is largely due to the 
strong rand. 
 
E.  Examples of U.S. trade capacity-building efforts in the host 
country, and associated effects (where applicable) 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------- 
 
Septel to follow. 
 
2.  In the Economic Update section (chapter 6, page 95) of the 
USITC\'s Fourth Annual Report on U.S. Trade and Investment with Sub- 
Saharan Africa country profile for South Africa, post suggests 
replacing the first two sentences in the third paragraph (the one 
beginning \"The manufacturing sector, which is heavily capital- 
intensive.) with the following:  \"The manufacturing sector, which is 
heavily capital-intensive in such areas as automobile manufacturing, 
heavy chemicals, and textiles, also includes the labor-intensive 
apparel sub-sector, and represented approximately 20 percent of GDP. 
A shortage of skilled labor continued to constrain the sector. 
Although the 28% appreciation of the rand in 2003 has put pressure on 
both the mining and manufacturing sectors, strong global and domestic 
growth in early 2004 has ameliorated negative impacts from the 
strengthening of the rand.  Lower inflation and interest rates 
contributed to strong consumer demand.\" 
 
3. Post suggests the following paragraph to replace the fifth 
paragraph in the Trade Update section (page 97):  \"In November 
2002, the United Nations Convention on International Trade 
on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) 
approved proposals from Botswana, Namibia and South Africa 
for a one-time sale of ivory from national stockpiles, 
sourced from culling of elephants or death by natural 
causes.  CITES attached conditions to the sales, which were 
not to take place before May 2004.  The CITES Standing 
Committee met in March 2004 and determined that the 
conditions had not yet been met, so the sales have not 
taken place.  The issue will be revisited at the October 
2004 CITES Conference of Parties in Malaysia.\"

SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA\'S CREDIT RATINGS 
 
 SUMMARY 
 ------- 
 
 1.  (U) From the end of June through mid-July 2004, 
 several research and credit agencies (Fitch, Moody\'s 
 Ratings, Standard & Poor\'s, and the Economist 
 Intelligence Unit) presented to Johannesburg 
 audiences their outlook and ratings for Sub-Saharan 
 Africa and South Africa in particular.  The 
 conclusions of all four agencies were similar.  All 
 agreed that prudent fiscal and monetary policies 
 fueled expectations of higher economic growth in 
 2004 and 2005; however, medium term challenges serve 
 as constraints to long-term growth.  If this growth 
 materializes and the rand stays strong, South 
 Africa\'s credit rating may improve.  In addition, 
 the November 2004 revision of gross domestic product 
 may show actual growth to be substantially higher 
 than previously thought as a result of improved 
 manufacturing and services data being incorporated 
 into GDP.  All agencies noted longer-term structural 
 problems that might inhibit improved credit ratings. 
 Currently South Africa is rated on a par with other 
 middle income countries but their peers do not face 
 the same unemployment, income inequality, poverty 
 and health problems that South Africa does. End 
 Summary. 
 
 Similar Views on South African Perspectives 
 ------------------------------------------- 
 
 2.   (U) Ratings agencies and research firms rate 
 South African strengths and weaknesses similarly. 
 Fiscal and monetary policies are deemed prudent as 
 the budget deficit is low, foreign debt is low, 
 inflation is under control, and the current account 
 balance is affordable.  All agencies commend the 
 higher economic growth, with GDP growing 2.8 percent 
 between 1994 and 2003 compared to 1.5 percent growth 
 in the 1980s.  All cite the same constraints facing 
 South Africa in the medium term, mainly structural 
 economic weakness against a background of 
 inequality.  These include the economic impact of 
 HIV/AIDS, low levels of savings and investment, 
 rigidities in the labor market.  Ratings agencies 
 cite the low levels of reserves as an impediment to 
 an upgrade in credit ratings.  However, Moody\'s 
 Credit Ratings Officer thought that a ratings review 
 of South Africa might be in order if revised GDP 
 growth turns out to be significantly higher when the 
 November 2004 GDP revision is due. 
 
 Fitch Ratings 
 ------------- 
 
 3.   (U) Fitch Ratings emphasized improved growth 
 prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa, for 2004 and 2005, 
 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, compared 
 to 2.7 percent in 2003.  In March 2004, Fitch again 
 rated South Africa\'s long-term foreign currency 
 \"BBB\", and its long-term local currency at \"A minus\" 
 with a stable outlook, unchanged from its May 2003 
 ratings.  Other peer countries in this category 
 include Thailand and Tunisia.  Countries rated one- 
 notch above at BBB plus include Latvia, Lithuania, 
 Malaysia, Poland and Slovakia. Countries one notch 
 below include Croatia and Mexico. 
 
 4.   (U) Fitch cited improvement in the public and 
 external debt ratios, falling inflation, and the 
 elimination of the net open foreign position leading 
 to an improvement in South Africa\'s liquidity 
 indicators as positive developments.  Low 
 investment, social and economic inequities, and 
 lower growth than peer countries were factors on the 
 negative side.  Fitch analysts noted that South 
 Africa and Nigeria were the engines for growth in 
 Sub-Saharan Africa and that South African firms had 
 been rapidly increasing their investment in the rest 
 of Africa.  One issue raised is whether the rapid 
 increase of South African investment in 2003 is 
 sustainable, given the relatively small domestic 
 markets in other African countries. 
 
 Moody\'s Ratings 
 --------------- 
 
 5.  (U) Moody\'s feels that its optimistic 
 perspective in 1994 was vindicated.  Since 1994, 
 Moody\'s has raised its \"Baa3\" country rating to Baa2 
 in 2001, and in February 2003 assigned a positive 
 outlook to its Baa2 long-term foreign currency 
 ratings.  Credit Ratings Officer Kristin Lindow 
 suggested that South Africa might warrant another 
 review if it turns out that past growth was 
 seriously underestimated because incomplete coverage 
 of both the manufacturing and service sectors in the 
 national income accounts.  Faster actualized growth 
 may improve investor perceptions towards viewing 
 South Africa as a fast growing market with high 
 investment potential. 
 
 6.  (U) The reasons for the most recent credit 
 outlook upgrade to positive are the similar for 
 Moody\'s as other ratings agencies.  Falling 
 inflation, low domestic and foreign debt, lower 
 interest rates, and improving external liquidity 
 made South Africa a better credit risk.  On the 
 negative side, Moody\'s May 2004 Analysis also lists 
 the serious economic and social challenges ahead, 
 namely managing HIV/AIDS pandemic, reducing income 
 disparities, making inroads on unacceptably high 
 levels of unemployment, and increasing investment in 
 a climate compounded by low domestic savings and low 
 foreign direct investment, and exchange rate 
 volatility.  One distinguishing characteristic of 
 Moody\'s analysis is the emphasis it placed on 
 political developments, including mentioning the 
 uncertainty clouding the next five years over the 
 succession question in the African National 
 Congress.  Since foreign direct investment is low, 
 Kristin Lindow\'s views are that the source of higher 
 South African growth has to be domestic investment. 
 Because foreign portfolio investment far exceeds 
 foreign direct investment, its capital flows are 
 more volatile and short-term oriented.  Moody\'s does 
 not foresee a change in the distribution of South 
 African foreign investment. 
 
 7.  (U) Lindow also believes that the South African 
 Reserve Bank should increase its foreign reserves. 
 She points out that South Africa\'s $10 billion in 
 reserves is well behind the $20 billion in reserves 
 in its peer group.  On the bright side, commercial 
 bank foreign assets have grown from $7.7 billion at 
 the end of 2002 to $16.3 billion by the end of 
 April.  Moody\'s counts Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, 
 Bahrain, Mexico and India as peer countries. 
 
 Standard & Poor\'s Ratings 
 ------------------------- 
 
 8.   (U) In June 2004, Standard and Poor\'s rated 11 
 African countries at the request of United Nations 
 Development Program, including South Africa.  Of the 
 11 countries, Tunisia and South Africa received the 
 highest long-term foreign currency rating at \"BBB\". 
 South Africa received the most improved rating since 
 its initial 1994 rating of \"BB\", reflecting progress 
 in fiscal and monetary reforms.  Standard & Poor\'s 
 includes Mexico, Tunisia, Thailand, Oman, China and 
 the Slovak Republic as South Africa\'s country peers. 
 South Africa\'s socioeconomic problems of high 
 unemployment, income and land distribution 
 inequalities, skills shortage, high crime rates, 
 HIV/AIDS pandemic, and low economic growth are more 
 severe than those faced by its peers.  These 
 challenges are counterbalanced by better fiscal and 
 monetary policies and transparency in budgeting and 
 planning compared to peer practices. 
 
 Economist Intelligence Unit\'s Analysis 
 -------------------------------------- 
 
 9.  (U) The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) 
 produced a South African country report in June 2004 
 primarily expecting an increase in growth over the 
 next two years compared to 2003\'s 1.9 percent due to 
 robust foreign growth, further strength in domestic 
 demand and growth in tourism.  Increasing foreign 
 demand will help boost exports, but rising imports 
 will lead to a gradual reduction of the trade 
 surplus and a modest deterioration of the current 
 account deficit to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2 
 percent in 2005.  EIU\'s forecast is for a weaker 
 rand in 2005 as interest rate differentials begin to 
 subside with the global trend towards higher 
 interest rates.  The EIU offers economic analysis 
 but does not rate countries. 
 
 10.  (U) The EIU\'s country report provides more 
 detailed coverage of both the political, industrial 
 and financial sectors than the ratings agencies; 
 however, the focus is short-term, with 2005 as the 
 latest forecast year.  EIU considers rigid labor 
 legislation and regulations concerning employment as 
 a major obstacle to more rapid job creation in the 
 private sector and doubts that GDP growth rates will 
 reach 5 to 6 percent.  It cites a recent study by a 
 research group chaired by Roger Baxter of the 
 Chamber of Mines concluding that the low level of 
 domestic investment is the major reason for 
 lackluster growth rates.  The study argues that 
 local business fails to invest because the cost of 
 capital is 8.5 percent when the average real rate of 
 return from listed companies is 8.6 percent.  The 
 high cost of capital was the result of high real 
 interest rates, volatile inflation and exchange 
 rates, high corporate tax rates, and the perceived 
 risk of doing business in Africa. 
 
 Comment 
 ------- 
 
 11.  (U) All analyses point to the same past fiscal 
 and monetary successes combined with serious mid to 
 long-term challenges that South Africa must overcome 
 before it qualifies for higher ratings.  The private 
 sector will be the source of new jobs; however, 
 skills, labor flexibility, and investment would have 
 to be seriously improved before South Africa 
 experiences high enough growth to reduce poverty and 
 unemployment.  Nevertheless, South Africa remains 
 the engine for Africa\'s growth; the IMF estimates 
 that every 1 percent increase in South Africa\'s 
 growth, sustained over five years, will add between 
 0.4 and 0.7 percent to African growth.  South Africa 
 will have to increase domestic investment, upgrade 
 skills, attract more foreign investment, and provide 
 a more flexible labor environment to change the 
 views of these ratings agencies in a favorable way.

SUBJECT:  NEW SOUTH AFRICAN AIDS STATISTICS 
 
1)On 27 July, 2004, Statistics South Africa, a government 
statistics agency, issued a report estimating HIV prevalence in 
South Africa to be 15.2% in 2004 compared with 14.79% in 2003, 
13.05% in 2000 and only 3.82% in 1994. According to the report, 
AIDS has claimed the lives of an estimated 1.7 million South Africans 
 
2)The same report estimates the population of South Africa 
to be 46 586 607 in the middle of 2004.  Without the AIDS epidemic 
c 
South Africa\'s population would have been 48.3 million. 
 
3)The percentage of AIDS deaths increased from 6.8% in 1995 
to 34.4% in 2000 and is projected to be 50.8% in 2005. HIV prevalence 
among antenatal clinic attendees has risen from only 0.7% 
in 1990 to 4.0% in 1993, 17.0% in 1997 and 26.5% in 2002. 
 
4)The 2002 provincial prevalence varied from a low of 12.4% in 
the Western Cape to a high of 36.5% in KwaZulu-Natal. The 
prevalence rates for the other provinces were 15.1% for Northern 
Cape, 15.16% for Limpopo, 23.6% in the Eastern Cape, 26.2% 
for North West, 28.6% in Mpumalanga, 28.8% in the Free State 
and 31.6% in Gauteng. 
 
5)The statistics SA report estimates that 3.83 million South 
Africans are HIV positive, compared with 5.3 million estimated by 
UNAIDS.  The Estimated death toll of 1.7 million is 
considerably less then the 3 million estimated by the U.S. Census 
Bureau. 
 
6)Comment:  Differences in assumptions and methodology underlie 
lie 
the variance in HIV/AIDS statistics.  We expect the Statistics South 
Africa report to be used as evidence by those who claim that the 
epidemic in South Africa has been exaggerated.  Post tends to favor 
the methedology used by UNAIDS and the U.S. Census Bureau because 
these organisations use various basic data sources.  By any measure, 
the HIV prevalence in South Africa is staggering and continues to 
grow at an alarming rate.  End Comment.

B. - Developments in major regional groupings (COMESA, EC, ECOWAS, 
IGAD, SACU, SADC, WAEMU, IOC, and CEMAC) (where applicable) 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
 
Mozambique has initiated discussions about joining SACU and Zambia is 
also considering such a step. However, SACU is deferring discussions 
until after the US-SACU FTA is completed. 
 
C.  Updated Information on privatization efforts 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
The new Minister of Public Enterprises, Alec Erwin, has 
publicly indicated that the government will proceed with 
concessioning the Durban Container Port and greater use of 
the public-private partnership model (outsourcing) as a 
method of restructuring state-owned enterprises. 
 
E.  Examples of U.S. trade capacity-building efforts in the host 
country, and associated effects (where applicable) 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------- 
 
USAID/South Africa has initiated programs leading to an MSc in 
economics with a specialization in trade at the Universities of Cape 
Town, Stellenbosch and KwaZulu Natal. Thirty-four of the forty-eight 
South Africans given full scholarships are in trade. 
 
The Mandela Economic Scholars program has sent 70 historically 
disadvantaged South Africans to the United States for advanced 
degrees in economics. Twelve of the 59 who have returned are in trade 
and related areas and are working in that field in government now. 
Two of the eleven still completing their studies in the United States 
are in trade and related areas. 
 
USAID, through an agreement with the U.S. Department of 
Justice/Federal Trade Commission is providing assistance to the SA 
Competition Commission on limiting anti-competitive behavior. The 
DoJ/FTC provide advisors for 6 weeks to 6 months at a time. The 
advisors also arrange courses for all the staff at the Competition 
Commission on investigating anti-competitive behavior. The most 
recent course, completed in July 2004, was on ensuring that anti- 
competitive behavior does not distort government tendering. 
 
In collaboration with DFID (UK foreign assistance), USAID is 
supporting trade research and capacity building at the South African 
Institute for International Affairs (SAIIA). This assistance 
emphasizes the creation of linkages between negotiators and the South 
African business community to expand their understanding of current 
trade issues and how they might impact on SA business. 
 
Complementing the work with SAIIA is a similar initiative with South 
African labor unions through ACILS (the American Center for 
International Labor Solidarity) to improve the knowledge of SA labor 
on trade issues through workshops involving a total of 50 labor union 
leaders. 
 
USAID has provided assistance to small and black-owned SA businesses 
to take advantage of the opportunities offered under AGOA. This 
initiative has recently been expanded to include small businesses 
throughout southern Africa. 
 
USAID was the lead donor in assisting the SA Department of Public 
Enterprises in restructuring (privatization) of selected state 
enterprises. USAID also helped the SA National Treasury in developing 
the public-private partnership model to the provision of government 
services. This approach is now being extended from national to 
provincial and municipal governments, and the Office of the 
Presidency has requested it also expand its work to assist similar 
institutions throughout sub-Saharan Africa. 
 
SATI (the Southern African Tax Institute), funded by USAID and DFID, 
has 8 mid-year courses on tax issues for tax officials from 
throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This has resulted in the harmonization 
of taxes and especially customs procedures. Four separate courses are 
offered each September on harmonization of municipal taxation. 
 
USAID\'s assistance to the SA Parliamentary finance and budget 
committees has been extended to similar committees in many SADC 
countries. The emphasis on each mid-year two-week course has been on 
globalization (macro-issues) and regulation (micro-issues). USAID\'s 
regional center for southern Africa has funded some of the non-SA 
participants.

1. (U) Over the past few days the local media has been 
inundated with reports detailing a massive terror plot aimed 
at key landmarks in Pretoria, Johannesburg and Cape Town. 
The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria was also listed as a specific 
target for attack.  The \"massive al-Qaeda terror blitz\" as 
described by the press, was uncovered when two South 
Africans, under interrogation in Pakistan allegedly revealed 
to Pakistani police their plans to destroy several financial, 
administrative, sporting and tourism installations in the 
above mentioned cities. 
 
2. (S/NF) As these media reports began to surface, RSO 
Pretoria immediately met with ORCA,  contacted local 
police/Intel sources and conferred with DS/ITA to determine 
the validity of the alleged threat to the mission.  At this 
time all sources contacted had no information which would 
corroborate such threats to the Embassy.  ORCA stated that 
the two South Africans have been questioned and no such 
threat information has been forthcoming. 
 
3. (S/NF) South African media reports mentioning the U.S. 
Embassy as a specific target for attack cannot be 
corroborated and appear to be speculation and/or out-right 
fabrication on the part of the media.  If information does 
surface indicating a possible threat linked to this case (and 
with any threat directed at our Mission, personnel or 
facilities), ORCA will immediately reveal such threat 
information to the RSO. 
 
4. (U) U.S. Embassy Pretoria remains vigilant and realizes

AND \"KIMBERLEY II\" 
 
 
Classified By: ECON M/C JHARTLEY, REASON: E.O. 12958 1.5 (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On July 28, Econoff and EconFSN sat down to 
an hour-long conversation with Jonathan Oppenheimer, Director 
of E. Oppenheimer and Sons and Managing Director of De Beers 
Consolidated Mines, Ltd., to review the landscape for De 
Beers in the wake of its July 13 settlement with the U.S. 
Department of Justice on a 1994 price fixing charge.  In line 
with the company\'s commitment \"to be legally compliant 
throughout the world,\" De Beers pled guilty to having fixed 
industrial diamond prices and agreed to pay a fine of USD 10 
million.  The settlement means that De Beers executives can 
freely travel to the United States and expand the company\'s 
business in the world\'s most lucrative consumer market. 
Oppenheimer talked about how De Beers had already started to 
leverage its well-known name in international retail markets. 
 However, the pace of entry into the United States retail 
market would be determined by the company\'s ability to 
\"extinguish its liabilities\" stemming from U.S. civil law 
suits (now three in number).  Oppenheimer lobbied for U.S. 
support of a scheme using \"smart cards\" to register the 
activities of small-scale diamond miners and traders in 
Africa under what he termed \"Kimberley Process II.\"  End 
Summary. 
 
Next in Line 
------------ 
2. (SBU) At 34 years old, Jonathan Oppenheimer is the 
youngest heir to Ernest Oppenheimer\'s original fortune made 
from the mining and sale of South African rough diamonds and 
gold.  Over the past several years, Jonathan Oppenheimer has 
assumed a higher political profile in De Beers, particularly 
with respect to South African mining legislation and company 
operations in Africa.  As Managing Director of Consolidated 
Mines, Ltd., he is responsible for South African operations. 
As a Director of E. Oppenheimer and Sons, he is also 
responsible for African producer relations.  Jonathan\'s 
father, Nikki, succeeded Jonathan\'s grandfather, Harry, as 
Chairman of De Beers in 1998.  Jonathan now works along side 
Nikki in the Johannesburg offices of E. Oppenheimer and Sons. 
 The Oppenhiemer family owns 45 percent of De Beers outright, 
and controls another 5 percent or so through direct and 
indirect shareholdings in Anglo American (which owns 45 
percent of De Beers) and Debswana, a 50/50 joint venture 
between De Beers and the Government of Botswana.  Though 
young, Jonathan Oppenheimer occupies a privileged position 
from which to represent De Beers\' interests. 
 
De Beers Still the Dominant Force 
--------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Despite growing competition, De Beers is still the 
dominant force in diamond mining and marketing in the world 
today.  In 2003, the De Beers Group mined 43.9 million 
carats, or about 31 percent of world production, mostly from 
Botswana (30 million carats) and South Africa (11.9 million 
carats), but also from Namibia (1.5 million carats) and 
Tanzania.  In a race with a growing number of diamond mining 
companies, De Beers is actively exploring in Canada, Russia, 
Brazil, India, and participating in early stage joint 
ventures in Australia and several other African countries. 
 
4. (C) De Beers\' Diamond Trading Company (DTC), successor to 
the Central Selling Organization (CSO), still controls about 
two-thirds of the rough diamond market.  Most supply is 
guaranteed by De Beers Group mines (41 percent by value). 
The rest comes from direct purchases, especially from Alrosa, 
Russia\'s diamond mining company.  In 2003, the DTC logged a 
record USD 5.5 billion in sales, partly because of higher 
diamond prices and the decision to sell off excess inventory. 
 In addition, the DTC has embarked on a marketing strategy to 
generate consumer demand for diamonds, which De Beers feels 
lags behind other luxury goods.  Increased demand, lower DTC 
inventory levels, fewer purchases from Alrosa, and equipment 
failures reducing production at De Beers Group mines in 
Botswana lead some analysts to believe that the industry may 
be heading toward a supply crunch and higher prices in the 
near future.  Oppenheimer said that De Beers was concerned 
that the level prices stay relatively stable to encourage 
consumer demand, and to discourage accusations that once 
again De Beers may be manipulating the market. 
Kimberley Process II 
-------------------- 
5. (C) Oppenheimer took the opportunity of this meeting with 
U.S. officials to lobby for De Beers\' idea of using smart 
cards and reading devices to register small-scale miners and 
traders in Africa who currently fall outside the Kimberley 
Process Certification Scheme.  Oppenheimer believes that the 
system could connect miners to national ministries, help 
track regional diamond trade, and even provide a vehicle for 
payment.  He estimated that some USD 700 million in 
small-scale diamond production were falling outside the 
Kimberley Process, but believed that most of this was the 
result of legitimate small scale mining.  Oppenheimer thought 
that smart cards could form the basis of a \"Kimberley II.\" 
Kimberley certification would mean that De Beers could enter 
these local rough diamond markets and pay up to six times 
more than local traders were paying the small-scale miners 
now.  De Beers wanted to garner U.S. and other Kimberley 
Process country support to push this idea toward a U.N. 
Security Council resolution. 
 
6.  (C) Ever wary of competition and the possibility of 
unsavory characters tarnishing the diamond trade, Jonathan 
Oppenheimer took the opportunity of the meeting to raise 
ethical questions about the Lev Leviev Group, De Beers\' 
Namibian competitor.  He went out of his way to say that De 
Beers was concerned about Leviev\'s shady past as an Israeli 
arms dealer, but admitted that De Beers had no hard evidence 
of his trade in conflict diamonds or use of diamonds as a 
means to launder money. 
 
Marketing 
--------- 
7. (C) Oppenheimer spoke about the shift in De Beers\' 
strategy from one that controlled the supply (and price) of 
diamonds to one that focused on demand.  Under its \"Supplier 
of Choice\" initiative, De Beers was joining with leading 
diamantaires (DTC sightholders) to stimulate consumer demand. 
 Research showed that consumer demand for diamond jewelry 
consistently trailed other luxury goods.  De Beers wanted to 
change this by advertising more and branding diamonds to tap 
into the different segments of the retail market.  Central to 
this approach was \"leveraging\" the De Beers name with 
consumers and accessing the U.S. market, which accounted for 
50 percent of the world\'s retail market for diamonds. 
 
8. (C) Oppenheimer said that market research had revealed 
that consumers viewed the name \"De Beers\" as being synonymous 
with quality diamonds, even though De Beers did not even 
participate in the retail market.  To capitalize on this 
phenomenon, De Beers had decided to leap frog the cutting and 
polishing industry and move directly into retail, where the 
markups were especially high.  In fact, De Beers had already 
joined with experienced retailer Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy 
(LVMH) to open high end diamond jewelry stores in London and 
Tokyo.  Under an agreement with the EU\'s Competition 
Commission, De Beers promised to not source diamonds solely 
from itself to supply its retail outlets.  Oppenheimer 
thought that about 20 percent would likely come from non-DTC 
sources.  Oppenheimer confirmed that De Beers/LVMH planned to 
open a store in New York City, but said that De Beers was in 
\"no rush\" to enter the U.S. market.  Referring to three civil 
law suits pending U.S. courts (involving potential commercial 
damages from past CSO selling practices), Oppenheimer said 
that De Beers intended to \"extinguish its liabilities\" before 
moving rapidly into the U.S. retail market. 
 
South Africa Mining Legislation 
------------------------------- 
9. (C) Oppenheimer decried recent confusion in South Africa 
over Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) ownership requirements 
for mining and exploration licenses on state owned land. 
Despite the government\'s clarification that its 51 percent 
BEE ownership requirement would be limited in duration, it 
was entirely unclear to him as to how the requirement would 
revert after one year to the 26 percent set forth in the 
mining industry\'s BEE charter.  He further commented that 
applying BEE ownership requirements to exploration was 
especially problematic, since there were no black owned 
companies operating in this area and few black investors with 
deep pockets to fund exploration.  Oppenheimer also decried 
the deleterious effect that the debate over mining royalty 
levels was having on the South African investment climate for 
mining.  No matter the level, he thought that the government 
would be advised to resolve the issue soon, as the 
uncertainty was freezing many investment decisions.

1.  The South African government hailed the August 1 deal 
reached in Geneva on a new framework for the negotiations of 
the Doha Development Agenda as an important milestone and 
victory for developing countries.  Xavier Carim, South 
Africa\'s chief trade negotiator, said that the group of 20 
developing countries had a significant influence on the 
outcome.  He asserted that the group was now a stronger 
alliance than ever before and would become a permanent 
feature of WTO talks.  He cautioned, however, that the most 
hotly contested issues had yet to be resolved. 
 
2.  South African economists and the media were also very 
positive about the agreement.  Dr. Iraq Abedian, chief 
executive of the Pan African Avisory Service, felt that the 
fact that multilateralism in international trade is back on 
track was clearly good for the world economy and could 
provide a way out of the poverty trap for many emerging 
economies.  Ron Derby of the \"Citizen\" said that the 
breakthrough in WTO talks held out promise for developing 
economies that wanted to get into agricultural markets in the 
EU and the United States.  The \"Sowetan\" newspaper was 
particularly pleased with the timing of the agreement, 
arguing that no progress would have been registered between 
now and the U.S. presidential election if this deadline had

1. (SBU) Summary: The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has 
begun to evaluate potential partner countries for an 
initiative to develop science academies in Africa.  The 
Gates Foundation-funded initiative seeks to build science 
academies\' capacity to provide independent scientific 
analysis and advice to governments, particularly on human 
health issues.  A U.S. mission team advised members of a 
recent NAS delegation to South Africa that some resistance 
to the initiative was likely, and encouraged NAS to obtain 
as much political support from government, academic and 
private sector institutions as possible.  The involvement of 
prominent South African Dr. Mamphela Rampele in the NAS 
effort should facilitate broad acceptance of the academy 
strengthening initiative.  End summary. 
 
//Background and introduction// 
 
2. (U) Health Attache, Econ Minister-Counselor, USAID Health 
Adviser, CDC Deputy Director and ES&T Officer met on August 
4 with three members of a visiting National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS) delegation to discuss South Africa\'s 
potential to participate in \"The African Science Academy 
Development Initiative,\" funded by the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation.  The initiative will receive USD 20 
million over ten years. 
 
3. (U) NAS was tapped by the Gates Foundation to implement 
the initiative, which seeks to build the capacity of 
Africa\'s science academies to provide independent, evidence- 
based advice to their governments on science, particularly 
health-related matters.  NAS has identified seven countries 
for engagement: Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, 
Ghana and South Africa.  NAS will select three countries for 
\"intense\" partnering, and plans to hold annual meetings with 
all seven countries during the life of the initiative.  NAS 
expects to make a preliminary decision on the three partner 
countries by November.  Early next year, NAS will support an 
initial workshop in selected countries, after which it will 
make a final decision on partners.  Next steps will include 
holding a forum on evidence-based policy-making to 
\"illuminate\" issues in a non-threatening way, followed by 
joint policy studies carried out by host country scientists 
in conjunction with training and support by the NAS, after 
which studies are to be carried out entirely by the local 
academies.  These activities will be largely funded by the 
Gates Foundation initiative, but NAS will also increasingly 
require the local academies to raise supplemental funding. 
The three partner countries will also receive funding for 
physical infrastructure, communications equipment and 
staffing. 
 
4. (SBU) Director of the Board on African Science Academy 
Development Dr. Patrick Kelley led the discussion and 
provided a summary of the initiative.  He was accompanied by 
Board members Dr. Michael Clegg, a UC-Irvine professor who 
serves as Foreign Secretary to the NAS, and South African 
Dr. Mamphela Ramphele, Senior Advisor to the President of 
the World Bank and member of the Institute of Medicine.  The 
visiting delegation also included Barney Cohen from the NAS 
and Dr. Narciso Matos of the Carnegie Corporation.  The 
group arrived on August 1 and the Academy of Science of 
South Africa (ASSAf) organized a full schedule of meetings 
with numerous government departments, parastatal research 
councils, a science advisory body, a national association of 
university Vice Chancellors, and the Academy of Engineering. 
Kelley, Clegg and Ramphele reported that they had had 
excellent meetings and received a very positive reception 
almost everywhere.  They requested Embassy Officers\' 
perspectives, based on local engagement and experience. 
 
//Academy Weak, Political Acceptance Critical// 
 
5. (SBU) ESTOff told the delegation that the relatively new 
academy of science was not well engaged with the government, 
or influential in policymaking in South Africa.  The visit 
of the NAS delegation had in fact prompted unprecedented 
communication and collaboration among ASSAf and government 
authorities and research councils, a welcome development. 
6. (SBU) The Health Attache noted that while establishment 
of an independent, credible academy of science was 
desirable, many obstacles -- such as underlying racial 
tensions linked to the past, challenges posed by the 
Department of Health including a desire for control over 
research findings, and even past perceptions of 
mismanagement at some science institutions -- could impede 
acceptance of the initiative.  Health Attache encouraged NAS 
to engage with and seek support from the influential South 
African Cabinet, the National Treasury, as well as 
Parliament, private sector companies and academic 
institutions.  He and USAID Health Adviser noted that 
several research institutions, the parastatal Human Science 
Research Council (HSRC) and Medical Research Council, along 
with the non-governmental Health Systems Trust, would likely 
feel threatened by the initiative.  Kelley conceded that one 
\"reluctant\" interlocutor was Mark Orkin, President of the 
HSRC.  Health Attache noted that none of the research 
organizations had the capacity to play an \"umbrella\" role, 
as ASSAf could.  Using the initiative to enable ASSAf to 
generate research and advice could provide scientists with 
additional political protection to release reports that 
might not be well-received by some parts of the government. 
Ramphele noted that SAG Department of Science and Technology 
officials had acknowledged the value of independent analyses 
that the initiative would promote. 
 
7. (U) Embassy officers pointed out that the NAS initiative 
complemented Mission initiatives to promote evidence-based 
policy decisions in the science area and linkages between 
U.S. and South African science institutions.  NAS and 
EmbOffs also discussed human resource challenges facing all 
of Africa, in science, health and other sectors.  Kelley 
noted that South Africa proposed the theme of \"How to 
address the human resource shortage in health?\" for its 
first workshop under the initiative. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: With sufficient buy-in and support from 
government, research councils and academic institutions, the 
Gates/NAS project has the potential to build the ASSAf into 
an influential and independent institution that critically 
informs government decision-making, a very desirable 
outcome.  The involvement of the highly-respected and 
influential Dr. Ramphele will likely play a key role in 
assuring support from South African stakeholders.  Officials 
at the Department of Science and Technology are solidly in 
support of the initiative.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Tito Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve 
Bank (SARB), announced a 0.5 percent decrease in the bank\'s 
repurchase rate on August 12.  The decision, taken by the 
Monetary Policy Committee, served to lower the repurchase 
rate to 7.5 percent, the lowest since the inception of a 
fixed repurchase rate in September 2001.  The decision caught 
most economic analysts by surprise, but may have been 
influenced by widespread opinion that the rand is too strong 
and a union march on the SARB the previous day.  The 
repurchase rate is the rate at which the SARB lends to local 
banks.  End Summary. 
 
Unions and Industry Wanted the Cut 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The decision by the Monetary Policy Committee came a 
day after union workers marched on the SARB to protest the 
effect of a strong rand on industry, particularly on gold 
mining, which has experienced thousands of layoffs in recent 
months.  In his statement, Mboweni acknowledged that the 
strong rand was seriously hurting mining and manufacturing in 
South Africa and distorting business planning.  He noted that 
South Africa\'s international trade balance had fallen from a 
R30 billion surplus in the second quarter of 2003 to a 
deficit of R5.5 billion in second quarter of 2004. 
 
Markets React to Interest Rate Movements 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Just two days earlier, the Federal Reserve had raised 
U.S. interest rates a quarter point for the second time in 45 
days.  The two actions served to close the interest rate 
differential between the two economies and reduce the 
incentive to portfolio investors to invest in rand based 
assets.  Foreign exchange markets reacted immediately, as the 
rand fell 3 percent in value to 6.5/dollar in next day 
trading.  Capital markets also saw a burst of activity 
surrounding South African gold mining stocks, many of which 
jumped several percentage points. 
 
Mboweni Focuses on Positive Outlook for Inflation 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (U) In his public statement, Mboweni chose to focus mostly 
on the positive outlook for inflation.  He noted that 
producer price inflation remained low, though no longer in 
the negative category, and that import price inflation had 
remained negative due to the strengthening rand.  While 
consumer prices were picking up, led by the cost of vehicles, 
healthcare, alcohol, tobacco, fuel, and certain administered 
prices, food prices were recovering from last year\'s drought 
and the government was likely to exercise greater restraint 
on administered prices (e.g., electricity and water) in 
future.  Continued fiscal prudence, low capacity utilization, 
and the declining trend in inflation expectations translated 
into an overall positive outlook for inflation.  In the 
second quarter of 2004, annualized CPIX (consumer inflation 
less mortgage costs) was 5.2 percent. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) Mboweni was reappointed by President Mbeki to 
another five-year term as SARB Governor on July 23, after 
consultations with Finance Minister Trevor Manuel who was 
rumored to favor a cut in interest rates.  With the unions 
marching the previous day and widespread public opinion in 
support of lower interest rates, one wonders what role 
political pressure played this time around in the decision of 
the Monetary Policy Committee.  Indeed, Mboweni could have 
just as easily focused on threats to inflation, including 
rising wage costs and record oil prices, in his statement to 
support leaving the repurchase rate unchanged.  The Federal 
Reserve had finally begun to raise U.S. interest rates, and 
this would slowly impact the dollar value of the rand. 
Moreover, CPIX in the first quarter of 2004 was 7.2 percent, 
above the SARB\'s annual target range of 3-6 percent. 
 
6. (SBU) If political pressure did play a role, then union 
pressure may have been the deciding factor.  On August 11, 
the day before the Monetary Policy Committee\'s decision, 
Mboweni met with members of the National Union of Mineworkers 
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) after 
thousands marched on the SARB to protest the strong value of 
the rand.  Chamber of Mines representatives dotted the march. 
 Despite this protest, most economic analysts believed that 
the Mboweni and his Monetary Policy Committee would stay true 
to their inflation fighting policies and leave the repurchase 
rate unchanged.  This seemed affirmed by Mboweni\'s promise to 
give the unions a detailed response in fourteen days, well 
after the Monetary Policy Committee\'s decision the following 
day.  If actions speak louder than words, then the decision 
to lower interest rates may obviate the need for Mboweni to 
provide much detail in his promised response.  The unions got 
what they wanted.  We note that prior to his appointment as 
SARB Governor in 1998, Mboweni served as Minister of Labor in 
Nelson Mandela\'s Cabinet.

SUBJECT: LOCAL REPS FOR U.S. ICT COMPANIES ENDORSE NEW 
CHARTER TEXT ON EQUITY REQUIREMENTS 
 
REF: A. PRETORIA 2651 
 
     B. PRETORIA 2164 
     C. PRETORIA 2092 
 
Classified By: Econ MC Jeff Hartley. Reasons 1.5 (b,d). 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Representatives for U.S. information and 
communication technology (ICT) companies operating in South 
Africa endorsed new charter language on equity in an August 
11 meeting.  The new language outlines conditions that must 
be met before companies may implement alternative equity 
models or be exempted from the ICT Charter requirement to 
sell equity to Black South African firms.  Their endorsement 
contradicts a two-month negotiating strategy and previous 
mandate not to support the proposed language.  The officials 
are quick to point out that they have endorsed only the 
equity language and did so in the spirit of moving the 
negotiations forward.  They say that only corporate 
principals can give final approval to the 4th Draft ICT 
Charter to be released on August 23.  Legal experts 
consulting with the American Chamber of Commerce in South 
Africa (AmCham) fear U.S. companies may have undermined their 
position and forfeited significant leverage in their requests 
for greater clarity in the ICT Empowerment Charter.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) In an unexpected move, a handful of local 
representatives for U.S. businesses operating in South Africa 
informed their negotiating spokesperson, AmCham Director 
Luanne Grant, that they would endorse new ICT charter 
language about the sale of equity to Black South African 
firms.  The development occurred August 11 during a 
late-night meeting between AmCham, the ICT Charter Working 
Group and officials from South African and U.S. ICT 
businesses.  This development comes after eight weeks of 
negotiations between the Group of 10 ended in a stalemate. 
The Group of 10 consists of AmCham and representatives from 
U.S. ICT companies on one side and the ICT Working Group and 
Black South African ICT businesses and associations on the 
other side. 
 
3.  (SBU) The announcement came as a surprise to many U.S. 
business reps who, for months, had been asking the Working 
Group to provide greater clarity in the ICT Charter on key 
issues.  In particular, U.S. ICT companies sought 
clarification on alternative models to selling equity, what 
constitutes fronting, how would the ICT BEE Council be formed 
and what would its mandate be, and the implementation of a 
balanced scorecard approach versus required minimum scoring. 
By the end of July, the Group of 10 was no closer to an 
accommodation than when negotiations began in early June.  On 
July 29, ICT Working Group Chairperson Dali Mpofu emailed the 
new charter language on equity to AmCham Executive Director 
Luanne Grant for distribution to American ICT companies in 
South Africa.  Mpofu asserted that sufficient time had been 
spent discussing the equity issue and that August 2 would be 
the last meeting of the Group of 10. 
 
4.  (C) Mpofu proposed that ten paragraphs be added to the 
ICT Charter outlining how companies that are unable to sell 
equity to meet black economic empowerment (BEE) objectives 
could propose alternative equity models.  If the legal, 
technological or policy barriers of a firm do not allow for 
any type of alternative equity model, companies can be issued 
a Certificate of Permitted Non-Compliance exempting the firm 
from the equity ownership requirement.  Companies receiving a 
Certificate of Non-Compliance would score zero in the equity 
component and add up remaining points from their empowerment 
criteria to achieve either a bronze, silver or gold 
empowerment rating.  Upon review, U.S. business officials 
agreed that the language still failed to address the balanced 
scorecard concept where overscoring in one component would 
compensate for underscoring in another.  They also said that 
the language did not provide sufficient clarity on what 
barriers would be considered legitimate and which of the 
proposed alternative equity models might be accepted. 
Lastly, the officials were concerned that the proposed 
process would be left to a yet-to-be-created ICT BEE Council 
without clarifying how the ICT BEE Council would be created, 
who would serve on it and how it would review equity cases. 
As a result, U.S. ICT business reps agreed not to endorse the 
proposed text on equity at the August 2 meeting. 
 
5.  (C) Mpofu then contacted IBM Country GM Mark Harris, 
spokesperson for the U.S. ICT companies, on August 6 and 
again on August 9.  According to Harris, Mpofu offered to 
draft a \"Letter of Comfort\" to provide greater clarity on 
overscoring and the scorecard.  Mpofu also said that he would 
facilitate the creation of an independent legal entity to 
evaluate the legitimacy of barriers identified by the 
American companies and whether proposed alternative equity 
models would be acceptable.  On the issue of the Council, 
Mpofu said that it was beyond his mandate and, as such, he 
was unable to answer questions on the composition and scope 
of the ICT BEE Council. 
 
6.  (C) In a meeting attended by Econoff on August 11, 
multinationals discussed the Working Group\'s proposed text on 
equity.  In consultation with ICT attorneys, AmCham concluded 
that a Letter of Comfort would not be legally binding and, 
therefore, would not provide the assurances that AmCham and 
U.S. businesses sought from the ICT Charter.  U.S. business 
officials joined AmCham at a 6 p.m. meeting with the Working 
Group.  AmCham presented the view that a Letter of Comfort 
did not provide sufficient legal assurances and, furthermore, 
only after corporate legal departments had reviewed the 
complete Charter would the principals be prepared to 
determine whether or not to sign the Charter.  After hours of 
fruitless discussion, Microsoft Country GM Gordon Frazer 
broke ranks with the American companies and said that, in his 
opinion, local general managers of U.S. ICT companies had the 
authority to decide whether or not to endorse the proposed 
Charter language on equity.  Frazer continued that \"in the 
spirit of moving the process forward\" he would endorse the 
language.  According to Grant, all but one of the remaining 
nine multinational representatives appeared satisfied with 
Frazer\'s suggestion, calling on Grant to endorse the proposed 
language on behalf of the multinationals.  Despite a previous 
survey where 22 of 25 multinationals voted not to accept the 
proposed language, Grant yielded to the majority at hand and 
agreed to a signing ceremony at a Press Conference scheduled 
for the following day. 
 
7.  (C) Representatives from the U.S. companies are quick to 
point out that they have endorsed only the specific text on 
equity and did so in the spirit of moving the negotiations 
forward.  They say that only corporate principals can give 
final approval to the 4th Draft ICT Charter to be released to 
the public on August 23.  They say that without clarity on 
the key issues, corporate principals are not likely to sign 
the Charter. 
 
8.  (C) Legal experts consulting with AmCham fear that the 
American companies may have undermined their position and 
forfeited significant leverage in the run up t a meeting of 
President Mbeki\'s International IT Advisory Council.  Harris, 
however, said that despite strong pressure to prevent the 
inclusion of equity and the ICT Charter on the agenda, they 
would be discussed at the meeting.  In addition, AmCham is 
following up on an offer made by Minister of Communications 
Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri at the August 12 press conference to 
meet with the U.S. businesses to resolve their remaining 
concerns. 
 
9.  (U) The full text of the language on equity endorsed by 
AmCham on behalf of the American ICT companies was released 
to journalists at the August 12 press conference and the text 
will be faxed to AF/S.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY. Several industry charters are non- 
compliant with Black Economic Empowerment guidelines, 
according to Teddy Daka, one of the original drafters of the 
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Bill.  He also 
explained that sector charters would be issued as Codes of 
Good Practice, once approved by the Department of Trade and 
Industry (DTI), and that scorecards are just one way of 
measuring compliance with BEE targets.  Daka said that a 
list of names for the National BEE Advisory Council is 
before President Mbeki and should be approved soon.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Teddy Daka, one of the original drafters of the 
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Bill and a 
consultant to the DTI on the creation of 
the National BEE Advisory Council, met with several U.S. 
multinational firms on August 23 at the American Chamber of 
Commerce (AmCham). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
ARE SOME SECTOR CHARTERS NON-COMPLIANT? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Daka explained that a number of the existing BEE 
charters were drafted before the Broad Based BEE 
Bill became law and do not take into consideration its 
guidance for creating a document that truly transforms a 
sector through empowerment.  Consequently, some of the early 
charters, such as Liquid Fuels, Mining and to a lesser 
extent Financial Services, will need to be redrafted.  For 
instance, Daka pointed out that the Liquid Fuels charter 
does not even contain a scorecard, while in the Mining 
Charter, many of the scorecard criteria do not have targets 
but are simply yes or no questions such as, \"Do you have a 
human resources development program in place?\"  According to 
Daka, this type of ambiguity in a charter perpetuates an 
environment where a concerted, specific industry target is 
difficult to achieve.  Consequently, the Liquid Fuels 
charter will need a scorecard and the Mining Charter 
scorecard will need to be adjusted to include targets for 
all seven empowerment criteria. 
 
------------------------------------ 
WHAT ARE THE CODES OF GOOD PRACTICE? 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Daka said that the private sector charters would 
become Codes of Good Practice for their respective 
industries.  Once drafted and signed by industry 
stakeholders, a charter is submitted to its host government 
department for approval (e.g., Mining Charter submitted to 
Department of Minerals & Energy, ICT Charter submitted to 
Department of Communications) and then on to the DTI for 
approval and publication in the government gazette as a Code 
of Good Practice for that industry.  If either the host 
department or the DTI do not feel the charter meets the 
goals set out in the BEE Act, then they can send it back to 
industry for additional work. 
 
5.  (SBU) In addition to the charters, the DTI has nearly 
completed Codes of Good Practice governing the accreditation 
process for companies who will rate and accredit other 
businesses.  Rating and accrediting companies will measure 
the performance of a firm against the BEE targets of its 
respective scorecard.  DTI Chief Director for Black Economic 
Empowerment Philisiwe Buthelezi said that these Codes have 
been completed and are awaiting approval from the minister 
and the cabinet before they are published. 
 
----------------------------- 
WHAT IS A BALANCED SCORECARD? 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) According to Daka, there is no official government 
policy on the balanced scorecard.  He said the scorecard in 
the DTI\'s Strategy for Black Economic Empowerment document 
is a suggestion on how a balanced scorecard might look. 
Daka explained that the term \"balanced scorecard\" is simply 
a scorecard that measures performance in seven empowerment 
areas and is not by definition a scorecard that allows 
overscoring in one area to compensate for underscoring in 
another.  Daka also said that a scorecard is not required, 
but is a suggested tool for measuring a company\'s 
performance against black economic empowerment targets.  He 
explained that if industries can devise other ways to 
measure compliance with BEE targets that they are free to 
use them in place of a scorecard. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
WILL THERE BE A NATIONAL BEE ADVISORY COUNCIL? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7.  (SBU) The National BEE Advisory Council will advise 
government as well as the private sector on black economic 
empowerment.  According to Daka, a DTI Task Team submitted a 
list of names for the Advisory Council to DTI Minister 
Mpahlwa nearly three months ago.  The list is now before 
President Mbeki, who chairs the Advisory Council.  Daka said 
that Mbeki reportedly was unhappy with some of the names on 
the list because it looked like a \"who\'s who of black 
bourgeoisie.\"  Daka expects that Mbeki will make some 
changes to the list because he wants people on the Council 
who have contributed to empowerment rather than those who 
have become enriched through BEE.  Until the Council becomes 
official, nobody is providing this Advisory service.  While 
DTI officials are the day-to-day functionaries responsible 
for communicating black economic empowerment policy to the 
public, Daka criticized many at DTI for insufficiently 
understanding the policy.

Strong consumer confidence is driving the current high sales 
environment.  The stronger rand is also increasing demand 
for U.S. goods as U.S. exports of the broad category of 
motor vehicles to South Africa increased 8.6% in the first 
half of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. End 
summary. 
 
2. The National Association of Automobiles South Africa 
announced that total motor vehicle sales in July grew by 15% 
y/y compared to July 2003. In the first seven months of 
2004, total sales were 19% stronger compared with the same 
period last year. They expect a phenomenal year in local 
sales under the current circumstances of a competitive car 
market and robust consumer confidence. 
 
3. July sales of new passenger cars reached a 23-year high 
as sales rose to 26,631 units from 25,902 units in the 
previous month and compared with 22,986 units in the same 
period last year. Strong consumer confidence is driving the 
current high sales environment. Consumers, who have 
benefited from a number of tax cuts by government over the 
last few years, now have the disposable income to invest in 
durable items. The 5.5 percentage point cut in interest 
rates, attractive incentives and new product offerings 
heavily supports this consumer boom. 
 
4. The sale of commercial vehicles rose by 25.8% over the 
first seven months of 2004. The buoyancy in the commercial 
market reflects the rise in business activity, particularly 
fixed investment activity, as well as positive business 
sentiment. 
 
5. Economists expect motor vehicle sales to remain strong in 
the remainder of 2004 as low interest rates and good 
personal income growth stimulate demand. However, year-on- 
year comparisons should be more modest in the months ahead 
because of the high base established in the second half of 
2003. 
 
6.  According to the United States International Trade 
Commission statistics, total U.S. exports motor vehicles 
(Chapter 87 of the HTS) to South Africa grew by 8.6%, from 
$176.9 million to $192.2 million in the first half of 2004. 
From January to June 2004, 5,627 units were exported 
compared to 5,373 in the same period the previous year. 
 
7. The stronger rand has been good for U.S. auto exports but 
has hurt SA auto exports to the United States.  U.S. 
automobile imports from South Africa decreased from $353.8 
million to $321.9 million in the first half of 2004 compared 
to 2003.  Of this total, imports of passenger vehicles 
declined from $281 million to $228 million.  U.S. imports of 
motor vehicles for the transport of goods, however, 
increased from $19.7 million to  $35.6 million, as did 
imports of SA auto parts, from $42 million to $49 million.

1. (SBU) Summary.  Econoff met with Sheldon Moulton, head of 
the Directorate on Global Economic Organizations, to get 
South African reactions to reftel demarche.  Moulton 
explained that South Africa firmly supported the concept of 
an International Finance Facility (IFF) and would continue to 
do so.  He lauded increases in U.S. and other developed 
country official development assistance, but said that it was 
still not enough because the need was so great.  In general, 
he lamented the \"sad state of honoring Monterrey pledges on 
aid and debt relief\" by developed countries.  He specifically 
mentioned Professor Jeffery Sachs\' calculation that the 
United States channeled only 0.14% of its GDP to development 
aid, far short of the 0.7% of GDP target embodied in the 
Monterrey Consensus.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Moulton said that South Africa supported the IFF 
concept in writing and would continue to do so.  He said that 
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel had signed a joint letter in 
support of IFF with British Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Gordon Brown.  On the concept of a global tax to fund 
development, Moulton commented that the idea had been around 
for a long time and would likely be around for a long time. 
He was not sure whether the recent dialogue on the subject 
\"would bring us any closer.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Moulton said that President Mbeki would be attending 
President Lula\'s World Leaders Meeting on Financing Hunger 
and Poverty Eradication in New York in September \"to try and 
find a way to advance the dialogue and to give impetus to 
meeting the goals of the Monterrey Consensus.\"  He thought 
that the Blair Commission (of which Manuel was a member), 
Britain\'s upcoming G-8 chairmanship and EU presidency, and 
the OECD\'s study into official development assistance would 
place increasing pressure on developed countries to increase 
their foreign assistance in the coming year.  He thought that 
other European countries would continue to support the IFF 
concept along with Britain. 
 
4. (SBU) Moulton argued that no matter how additional 
development funds were raised, developing countries would 
still have to meet the same criteria for development 
assistance that they do now.  He thought that good governance 
and accountability would remain important, and that the 
debate would continue as to how developing countries should 
strengthen themselves in these and other areas.

 1.  (C) Ambassador Frazer delivered reftel demarche and 
passed reftel nonpaper September 2 to Abdul Minty, South 
Africa\'s Governor on the IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) and 
Deputy Director General at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA).  The ambassador emphasized that the USG believes the 
September 13-17 BOG meeting should adopt a strong resolution 
that reports Iran\'s noncompliance with IAEA resolutions, 
urges full Iranian cooperation with the IAEA, and refers the 
matter to the UNSC.  She said that it\'s time to ratchet up 
the pressure on Iran, which has had almost two years to 
cooperate with the IAEA but has failed to do so. 
 
2.  (C) Minty said the South African government (SAG) wanted 
to cooperate with the USG on Iran but would not support UNSC 
referral.  In Minty\'s view, pressing for referral would split 
the BOG and ensure no consensus.  Minty also noted that the 
SAG disagreed with the USG on enrichment.  Minty explained 
that South Africa wanted to preserve the enrichment option 
for itself, associated with the SAG\'s new pebble bed reactor. 
 Minty noted, however, that he was prepared to engage with 
the USG, either in Vienna (his tentative arrival date is 
September 11) or in Washington (he attends a NEPAD event 
October 2-6). 
 
3.  Minty told the ambassador that the Iranians will send a 
delegation to Pretoria \"at the end of September.\"  The 
Iranians would meet with President Mbeki.  More generally, 
Minty said that President Mbeki was concerned that the 2005 
NPT Review Conference would be unsuccessful, and that \"people 
will then walk away.\" 
 
4.  (C) Minty repeated several times that the SAG shared USG 
goals with regard to Iran and would continue to press Iran to 
comply fully with IAEA resolutions.  He said he believes that 
there continue to be divisions within the Iranian government 
on the matter, with the Foreign Ministry the most 
internationally aware and forward-leaning.  According to 
Minty, the new Iranian parliament \"almost impeached\" the 
Iranian Foreign Minister because the representatives saw him 
as overly ready to compromise with the West on IAEA matters.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Transnet\'s Annual Report revealed a 
bloated, inefficient and undisciplined state-owned 
enterprise (SOE) that suffered a R6.3 billion loss last 
year.  CEO Maria Ramos plans to divest all non-core 
businesses and focus on providing integrated, seamless 
transport and logistics services.  Spoornet, National 
Ports Authority (NPA), South Africa Port Operations 
(SAPO) and Petronet will remain in the Transnet fold. 
All other operations, including SAA, will be housed in an 
investment portfolio for potential future sale or 
disinvestment.  This indicates that, despite perceptions 
to the contrary, and in the face of stiff opposition from 
labor, government has not backtracked on divestiture of 
non-core or non-strategic assets. In addition, Public 
Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin replaced the entire Board 
of Directors at Transnet and most of the Board at SAA. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
RAMOS - A BUREAUCRATIC SUPERHERO 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Just eight months after taking over as CEO of 
Transnet, Maria Ramos has proposed major changes to 
improve the efficiency and profitability of the behemoth 
state-owned enterprise that manages the country\'s 
transport services.  As the former Director General for 
National Treasury, Ramos established a reputation for her 
business-like, no-nonsense approach to government.  She 
was instrumental in creating and implementing South 
Africa\'s sound fiscal policy resulting in lower inflation 
and interest rates and less government debt.  In 
Transnet\'s 2003-2004 Annual Report, released August 27, 
Ramos paints a picture of a bloated, inefficient state- 
owned enterprise (SOE).  Ramos said that \"Transnet has 
shown an increasing inability to respond to the demands 
of its business environment\" and she made it clear that a 
significant restructuring of Transnet resources is about 
to occur. 
 
------------------------- 
FORLORN FINANCIAL FIGURES 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Transnet reported a net loss of R6.3 billion for 
the year ended March 30, 2004 from a R421 million loss in 
the same period a year ago.  The loss was due mainly to a 
R4.2 billion impairment charge, which includes a R3.5 
billion write-down of aircraft and a R526 million write- 
down of Transnet\'s investment in the Second National 
Operator (SNO).  The Transnet Group delivered revenue 
growth of only 5.7 percent (from R41.3 billion to R43.6 
billion), well below the average annual growth of 14 
percent achieved over the previous three years, and also 
below the 2003 inflation figure (CPIX) of 6.8 percent. 
Operating profit declined from R5.1 billion last year to 
R187 million this year.  A major factor in Trasnet\'s 
dismal financial results was South African Airways (SAA) 
hedging loss of R8.7 billion last year.  Over the past 
two years, SAA has reported losses totaling R15 billion. 
The losses result from hedges SAA made on the dollar-to- 
rand exchange rate after it purchased 38 new Airbus 
aircraft in 2002.  The deal was based in U.S. dollars. 
 
----------------------- 
A NEW TRANSNET STRATEGY 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U) To reverse Transnet\'s slide into financial 
oblivion, Ramos unveiled a new strategy.  She said that 
Transnet\'s core mission is \"to provide an integrated, 
seamless transport and logistics solution.\"  To 
accomplish this, Ramos announced that she would keep 
Spoornet, the NPA, SAPO, and Petronet at Transnet.  All 
other operations, including SAA, will be housed in an 
investment portfolio for potential future sale or 
disinvestment (Reftel A).  Ramos also said that 
Transnet\'s corporate office would be drastically trimmed. 
The corporate office employs nearly 700 staff and 
incurred costs of more than R600 million last year. 
Transnet sources say that the corporate office staff will 
be reduced to about seventy people. 
5.  (U) Ramos revealed that Transnet\'s strategy going 
forward is based on the following 4-point plan:  a) 
\"redirect the business\" to focus on core operations; b) 
\"restructure the balance sheet\" by eliminating 
outstanding debt and non-core businesses; c) \"implement 
and adopt strict corporate governance principles\" to 
overcome existing gaps in Trasnet\'s financial management 
processes; and 4) \"adhere to a vigilant risk management 
process\" to avoid risk-laden ventures such as SAA\'s hedge 
book.  To assist in the implementation of this strategy, 
Ramos has earmarked R30 billion for capital investment 
over the next five years. 
 
------------------------- 
TRANSNET\'S TOP PERFORMERS 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Among the few bright spots in the report were the 
NPA, with an 18 percent improvement in operating profit, 
SAPO, which exceeded its planned operating profit by 9 
percent, and Petronet, which doubled its profit before 
tax to R240 million over last year.  Ramos pointed out 
that these companies \"collectively generate acceptable 
profitability levels,\" further underscoring Ramos\' 
strategy to hold on to these operations. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPLACED AT TRANSNET, SAA 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Minister of Public Enterprises Alec Erwin also 
announced the replacement of the entire Board of 
Directors for Transnet and most of the Board at SAA. 
Frederik Phaswana, formerly Chairman and CEO of BP 
Southern Africa, takes over as Chairman of the Transnet 
Board.  Khaya Ngqula leaves his position as President and 
CEO at the Industrial Development Corporation of South 
Africa to become the new CEO at SAA. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The annual report shows government supports 
Ramos in her plans to reshape Transnet.  It also 
indicates that, despite perceptions to the contrary, and 
in the face of stiff opposition from labor, government 
has not backtracked on divestiture of non-core or non- 
strategic assets.  Public Private Partnerships, including 
concessions, will be a vital element of the new business 
model.

SUBJECT:  MINISTER UNLEASHES MASSIVE TELECOMS LIBERALIZATION 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY.  In a surprise announcement, Minister of 
Communications Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri announced sweeping 
policy decisions to liberalize South Africa\'s 
telecommunications sector by February 2005.  Her 
announcement benefits Value-Added Network Service (VANS) 
providers who will be allowed to carry voice using any 
protocol.  The Minister said further announcements 
liberalizing the industry would be made in October.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Over three years ago, Minister of Communications Ivy 
Matsepe-Casaburri said that a big bang approach to telecoms 
liberalization would not take place in South Africa.  On 
September 2, however, Casaburri reversed herself as she 
revealed a decision to liberalize South Africa\'s telecoms 
sector on a massive scale.  Casaburri\'s announcement had 
been in the works since May when President Mbeki emphasized 
the need to lower the cost of doing business in South 
Africa. 
 
3.  (U) Casaburri said that a market study completed in 
December 2003 recommended that government address the 
following three areas: a) further liberalization of the 
telecoms sector; b) amendment of the various existing laws; 
and c) determination of a date by the Minister from which 
various provisions of the Act could be activated so as to 
stimulate sector growth. 
 
4.  (U) Casaburri\'s announcement detailed the following 
policy decisions and February 1, 2005 as the date from which 
the decisions would come into effect: 
 
- Mobile operators may utilize any fixed lines that may be 
required for the provision of the service including fixed 
lines made available by Telkom or any other person providing 
a public switched telecommunication service; 
 
- Persons may apply for a license to provide public pay 
phone services in any area of the Republic; 
 
- Value-added network services may carry voice using any 
protocol; 
 
- Value-added network services may also be provided by means 
of telecommunications facilities other than those provided 
by Telkom and the Second National Operator or any of them; 
 
- A person who provides a value added network service shall 
be entitled to cede or assign the right to use, or to sublet 
or part with control or otherwise dispose of the 
telecommunications facilities used for the provision of the 
value added network service; and 
 
- Private telecommunications network operators shall be 
entitled to resell spare capacity and facilities or to cede 
or assign his or her rights to use such facilities or to 
sublet or otherwise part with control thereof. 
 
- Effective January 18, 2005 public schools and public 
further education training institutions will be entitled to 
a 50% discount on all telecommunications calls to an 
Internet service provider and any fees levied by an Internet 
service provider for accessing the internet or transmitting 
and receiving any signals via the internet. 
 
5.  (U) Casaburri said that further policy announcements 
would be made in October of this year. Those announcements 
will address the issue of service-based licenses to be 
operational by May 2005, the remaining Under-Serviced Area 
Licenses (USALs), the Second National Operator (SNO), the 
Convergence Bill and the ICT BEE Charter. 
 
 
6.  (U) Industry analysts were broadly supportive of the 
announcement.  Ant Brooks of the Internet Service Providers 
Association said, \"This is a very positive and very 
necessary step and the increased competition is going to be 
great for consumers.\"

SUBJECT: STRATEGY ON THE WAY FORWARD FOR THE FTA 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  In order to reinvigorate the Free Trade 
Agreement talks between the United States and the Southern 
African Customs Union (SACU), post proposes the following way 
forward:   (A) clarifying senior political buy-in, including 
possibly raising the level of the negotiators; (B) changing 
the negotiating environment to gain greater leverage; and (C) 
reinforcing the need for a definite deadline to energize and 
push the talks to conclusion.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) What can the United States do to make progress on 
the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the Southern 
African Customs Union?  So far, there has been little 
movement.  The media reported recently that as a result of 
the Paris talks in July between senior U.S. and SACU 
officials both sides \"had agreed to focus on a number of 
issues that could be dealt with quickly -- market access, 
industrial tariffs, agriculture and services.\"  There needs 
to be more than \"focus.\"  We have focused on these issues for 
over a year.  We need to negotiate based on clear guidance 
from senior leadership that SACU wants an FTA with the United 
States.  With a renewed SACU political commitment, we think 
both sides can negotiate a clear win-win agreement.  In order 
to get there, the United States will have to push by: 
 
-- Clarifying senior political buy-in, including possibly 
raising the level of the negotiators; 
 
-- Changing the negotiating environment to gain greater 
leverage; and 
 
-- Reinforcing the need for a definite deadline to energize 
and push the talks to conclusion. 
 
In this cable, post presents (a) the problems/obstacles to 
the negotiations, (b) an approach to gain leverage, and (c) 
suggested next steps. 
 
Problems/obstacles 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) There are many reasons for lack of progress on the 
FTA talks.  SACU has less expertise and experience in 
negotiating.  There are capacity and logistical constraints. 
SACU is also negotiating as SACU for the first time.  In 
spite of these limitations, most of the working groups have 
managed to examine in detail the issues that need to be 
negotiated.  After six rounds of negotiations it is not a 
question of understanding the issues.  After the last round 
in June, SACU negotiators asserted they had gone as far as 
their negotiating mandate allows.  To get over this obstacle, 
we need to take the negotiations to a higher level.  SACU 
leaders need to recommit to the FTA and to direct their 
negotiators accordingly, or to negotiate at a higher level. 
 
Key analytical assumptions 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Differences in the respective goals and posture by 
the United States and SACU have to be considered in 
determining the way forward.  The main issue blocking 
progress is a fundamentally different point of view about the 
goals of the FTA.  The United States is ambitious and wants 
total liberalization in as many sectors as possible.  SACU, 
on the other hand, is very much lacking in ambition.  It 
wants to give as little as possible and protect as many 
sectors and products as it can.  As a result, the U.S. 
posture is offensive and the SACU posture is defensive. 
 
5.  (SBU) SACU\'s defensiveness comes through on virtually 
every single issue.  While the United States is trying to 
find a way forward, SACU is continually telling us why it 
cannot do certain things.  The SACU refrain is asymmetry, 
special and differential treatment, partial liberalization, 
exclusions, and balance.  The major area where SACU has been 
offensive is in making the unrealistic demand that the United 
States amend its trade remedy laws on dumping and 
countervailing duties. 
 
Stick to goals 
-------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The United States should stick to all of its 
original goals as announced at the outset of the 
negotiations.  An FTA with SACU should meet the same 
standards as the FTAs that we have negotiated with other 
developed countries.  There is no compelling reason why the 
first comprehensive U.S. FTA in sub-Saharan Africa should 
come with an asterisk (*FTA-lite).  This could set a bad 
precedent for other FTA negotiations. 
 
Reinforce a deadline 
-------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) It is vital that the United States maintain and 
reinforce the tool of the deadline.  If the U.S. team opts to 
play defense against a SACU team that is also playing 
defense, we are never going to move the ball forward. 
Moreover, without a clock ticking, there is no incentive to 
end the game.  The agreed upon December 2004 deadline for the 
negotiations has been a key factor driving the talks.  The 
deadline underscores the need to conclude the talks.  If at 
the eleventh hour we are convinced there is a way to get an 
acceptable agreement and the only obstacle is time, then we 
can agree to an extension of the deadline.  Alternatively, at 
that time we could assess that we tried our best but simply 
were not able to conclude a decent agreement; we terminate 
the negotiations and move on. 
 
8. (SBU) What has happened to relax the pressure on SACU? 
The passage of AGOA III extending AGOA benefits to 2015 has 
given SACU a longer comfort period for preferential access to 
the U.S. market.  As a result, SACU feels it can afford to 
allow the FTA talks to meander along indefinitely.  The 
record of the missed deadlines of the Doha Development Agenda 
(notwithstanding the progress in Geneva) has also created 
complacency about deadlines:  If the WTO can miss deadlines, 
so can SACU.  Lastly, both U.S. and SACU negotiators have 
been suggesting publicly that the December 2004 deadline will 
not be met. 
 
Play offense 
------------ 
 
9. (SBU) Unless Washington is prepared for endless rounds of 
FTA talks, we think the United States has to go on the 
offensive.  SACU will not give us anything unless they have 
to.  If we cannot get what we want, then we should divert our 
resources to do FTAs with countries that truly are 
\"like-minded\" trading partners.  Others in sub-Saharan Africa 
would welcome the opportunity to negotiate a gold standard 
FTA with the United States.  Other developing countries have 
managed to negotiate an FTA in less than a year.  The simple 
reason is they wanted it.  SACU\'s tactics raise doubts about 
whether SACU will agree to the FTA we envision, unless there 
is senior SACU political direction to do so.  Remarks by 
various SACU negotiators suggest they think the United States 
wants and needs this more than SACU does.  We need to 
disabuse everybody of this attitude.  We need to be prepared 
to walk away from these negotiations. 
 
Meet longer, if necessary 
------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) We have worked to accommodate SACU, but there 
should be limits to our flexibility.  If SACU cannot 
negotiate with us because of other commitments, then the FTA 
is not a SACU priority.  Ministers need to redirect their 
negotiators on the end goal.  If there is to be a Round 7, it 
has to be more than a rehash of the exchange of views as in 
the previous six rounds.  There should be an agreement 
beforehand on the modalities for the negotiations in market 
access in goods, non-agricultural goods, textiles and 
apparel, and services.  The negotiators should also move 
forward on negotiating the Phase 2 issues (labor, 
environment, e-commerce, financial services, intellectual 
property rights, government procurement, legal framework); to 
do otherwise suggests these issues are less important to the 
United States.  If we need to meet longer than previous 
rounds, let us do so. 
 
Political level exchanges 
------------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) There has to be a frank exchange at the political 
level on the need to negotiate and to conclude by a deadline. 
  We would propose that Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Josette Shiner visit southern Africa soon to meet with SACU 
trade ministers to discuss the way forward.  We would also 
recommend that senior U.S. officials raise the FTA in their 
bilateral meetings with their SACU counterparts from now 
until December.  The upcoming UNGA meetings in New York 
provide opportunities for Secretary Powell to push the FTA 
with the SACU heads of state and foreign ministers. 
 
12.  (SBU) In the AGOA Acceleration Act signed by President 
Bush in July, Section 3 (9) on the Statement of Policy states 
that Congress supports \"a comprehensive and ambitious trade 
agreement with the Southern African Customs Union, covering 
all products and sectors, in order to mature the economic 
relationship between sub-Saharan Africa and the United 
States.\"  Our suggested approach aims for a successful 
agreement that will carry out the full ambition of AGOA.

1.  (U) Summary: South Africans and selected foreign guests 
(from the UN system, Africa, Brazil, and international labor 
and civil society organizations) participated in a national 
conference on sustainable development held September 1-3 in 
Johannesburg, in commemoration of the second anniversary of 
the World Summit on Sustainable Development.  Participants 
highlighted progress attained by South Africa in meeting 
sustainable development targets and continued constraints 
and challenges faced by South Africa and the rest of the 
developing world.  Representatives of local civil society, 
NGOs, business, academia, provincial and local governments 
participated in the government-organized conference, but the 
program\'s structure did not allow for extensive dialogue. 
NGO protestors at the event focused on renewable energy and 
affordable access to energy by the poor.  End summary. 
 
//Introduction// 
 
2.  (U) On September 1-3, the Sandton Convention Center was 
busy with discussion and dialogue on sustainable 
development, two years after World Summit on Sustainable 
Development (WSSD) meetings at the same site.  This time, 
the discussion, organized by the Department of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) centered on South Africa and its 
responses to commitments made at the Johannesburg summit in 
2002.  Many of the planning documents can be found at 
http://www.environment.gov.za/jhb2/index.html , and 
additional speeches and summaries of sessions will 
eventually be posted to this website, according to DEAT 
sources. 
 
//Speakers address progress, resource constraints// 
 
3.  (U) Minister for Environmental Affairs and Tourism 
Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Foreign Affairs Minister 
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma spoke at the opening events on 
September 1. 
 
4.  (U) In his welcoming remarks, Minister van Schalkwyk 
noted that South Africa\'s implementation of WSSD goals was 
largely ahead of schedule in areas such as water, sanitation 
and housing.  He praised positive developments in 
identifying alterative, renewable energy sources to 
diversify from coal-based energy dependence, and in 
\"mainstreaming\" environmental issues and beefing up 
enforcement.  Minister Van Schalkwyk issued a warning to 
industries in South Africa, singling out refineries, to 
\"clean up their act\" in anticipation of new Air Quality 
legislation.  He also announced the imminent appointments of 
members to a National Environmental Advisory Forum, to 
strengthen partnerships between government and civil 
society.  The Minister encouraged establishment of a 
national framework for sustainable development to address 
the tensions and numerous \"contradictions\"--including 
between industrial development and health and environmental 
quality; between providing affordable energy and addressing 
climate change; between the need for investment, jobs and 
development and the benefits of conserving biodiversity; and 
between food security, biotechnology and concerns about the 
impact of Genetically Modified Organisms on the environment. 
 
5.  (U) Minister Dlamini Zuma noted that political will 
exists to address numerous sustainable development 
challenges, but the \"missing element\" is resources to 
implement the Johannesburg Program of Implementation.  She 
noted that resources exist globally, but they \"need to be 
distributed from areas of great abundance to areas of 
scarcity.\" 
 
6.  (U) International speakers at opening sessions included 
WSSD Secretary General Nitin Desai, Chair of the 13th 
Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD), John Ashe, and 
the head of the Labor Foundation for Sustainable 
Development, Marga Ferre.  Desai spoke without prepared 
remarks and noted that the war on terrorism had diverted 
attention and resources away from efforts to attain 
sustainable development targets.  He cited the U.S. invasion 
of Iraq in contravention of the UN and the breakdown of 
Cancun World Trade Organization negotiations as contributing 
to the erosion of the \"unity of purpose\" generated by WSSD, 
and of multilateralism.  Desai also noted the donor 
community\'s failure to meet development assistance target 
levels, which negatively impacted implementation of projects 
on sustainable development. 
 
//Sector-specific roundtables engage line departments// 
7.  (U) Many Ministers, Deputy Ministers and Directors- 
General of government departments participated in sector- 
specific roundtables that their departments organized. 
Roundtables explored developments in important areas such as 
water, housing, energy, agriculture and science & 
technology, as well as governance of sustainable development 
and the role of business.  Notably missing was a roundtable 
on health issues, which figured prominently in WSSD.  Health 
was addressed briefly within the Energy roundtable, with a 
discussion of the program to remove lead from gasoline and 
the implementation of low-smoke fuel techniques. 
 
//NGO protestors demand more from SAG on energy// 
 
8.  (U) Several NGOs, including Earthlife Africa, the 
Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF) and the Anti- 
Privatization Forum, protested outside the venue.  Earthlife 
and EJNF were seeking broader, more affordable access to 
energy for South African citizens, particularly the poor, as 
well as stronger government targets for developing and using 
renewable energy sources.  An EJNF representative told ES&T 
FSN that the NGOs want the government to invest much more in 
renewables such as wind and solar power, to increase 
utilization of energy to rates of 20 percent, compared to 
the current target of 0.5 percent. 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  Although the event did not come together 
until mid-to-late August, it was well organized, fairly well 
attended, and focused on the positive developments in South 
Africa on sustainable development.  Representatives from 
provincial and local governments, civil society and NGOs 
participated, but most sessions were heavy on presentations 
and left little if any time for discussion and genuine 
dialogue with participants.

----------------------- 
Summary and Recommendation 
----------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) South Africa has continued to make progress in 
establishing a market-based economy, respecting the rule of 
law, implementing policies to reduce poverty, and combating 
corruption. There is a strong case to be made that South 
Africa is meeting the eligibility requirements of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).  South Africa 
hosted two of the six rounds of free trade agreement 
negotiations between the Southern African Customs Union and 
the United States aimed at eliminating barriers to trade and 
investment.  SACU\'s seeming low level of ambition, however, 
has made it difficult to move forward on the negotiations. 
While we do have concerns about how the FTA negotiations are 
proceeding, at this point Post concludes that South Africa 
continues to comply with the eligibility requirements of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and recommends its 
selection for continuing eligibility. 
 
2. (SBU) In deliberating on whether or not to recommend 
South Africa for continued eligibility, we considered the 
course of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with 
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).  We concluded 
that, despite the slow progress and some concerns about 
negotiating tactics, South Africa\'s active participation in 
the FTA talks are a sign of making continual progress in 
establishing the elimination of barriers to U.S. trade and 
investment.  Being difficult at the negotiating table is 
nothing new in trade negotiations.  Moreover, given that the 
WTO talks took nearly three years to achieve a framework for 
negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda, it is not 
surprising that the FTA talks have also taken time.  There 
are many legitimate reasons for the slow pace of the U.S.- 
SACU FTA talks, including the learning curve for SACU 
negotiators, logistics, and the competing demands for 
participation in other negotiations (e.g., WTO, SADC, EFTA, 
EU, Mercosur).  One could even argue that given the strains 
on SACU\'s negotiating capacity (four developing countries 
and one Least Developed Country), we have actually 
accomplished a lot in one year.  Moving the FTA talks 
forward is now a question of renewed commitment and vigor. 
South Africa\'s continuing engagement with the United States, 
as exemplified by the July talks in Paris, as well as 
various telephone conversations by our senior trade 
officials, demonstrates South Africa\'s continued good faith 
in this bilateral effort to remove trade barriers.  Finally, 
concluding an FTA is not a condition for AGOA eligibility. 
 
---------------------- 
 
A Market-Based Economy 
---------------------- 
 
3. (U) South Africa is making continual progress in 
establishing a market-based economy. One example of its 
commitment to an open rules-based trading system was the 
government\'s publication of proposed new countervailing duty 
and safeguards rules in 2004.  While the government 
continues to own significant stakes in various sectors of 
the economy and progress towards privatization has been 
slow, the government has made renewed pledges to move 
forward with restructuring.  Due to elections in April 2004, 
all work on privatizations came to a halt.  Since then, the 
new Minister of Public Enterprises, Alec Erwin has received 
clear direction from the President to pursue restructuring 
rapidly and promised major new policy initiatives by 
December 2004 including a plan to concession Durban\'s 
container port and move toward concessioning other ports. 
Transnet (the state transportation firm) has recently 
decided to focus only on ports, freight rail lines and its 
petrol pipeline, divesting all passenger rail traffic, road 
freight, and its other businesses. The new CEO has 
emphasized that she is considering the possibility of public- 
private partnerships even in its core business (she had been 
Director General at National Treasury and was a strong 
supporter of National Treasury\'s work on public-private 
partnerships). Government is expected to sell off additional 
shares in Telkom, plus the US/Malaysian partners are 
expected to reduce their shares by selling to a SA black 
empowerment partner. The new Minister of Trade and Industry, 
Mandisi Mpahlwa, initiated a Forum on trade so the views of 
labor and business can have a direct impact on negotiations. 
 
4. (SBU) The U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Zoellick, 
met with South Africa\'s Trade Minister in Cape Town in 
February 2004 to discuss the way forward after the Doha 
Development Agenda had stalled in Cancun.  South Africa 
commended Ambassador Zoellick\'s initiative to reinvigorate 
the talks and worked constructively to advance the process, 
culminating in the successful July/August 2004 multilateral 
WTO meeting in Geneva on a framework for negotiations. 
South Africa, like other AGOA eligible countries, will 
likely continue to champion the interests of developing 
countries in the global trade talks and criticize U.S. 
agricultural policies, particularly farm subsidies. 
 
5. (U) In the past year, South Africa continued to succeed 
in achieving sound macroeconomic objectives.  Thus far in 
2004 growth has accelerated to 3.9% and is broad-based. This 
is the best that SA has done in the last five years. 
However, researchers estimate the country needs a minimum of 
4.0% growth rate for a decade to halve unemployment (that 
is, reach the 15% target). Inflation has come down steadily. 
In March 2003, the CPIX inflation rate was 9.3% but 
decreased to 6.3% in September 2003, which is just over the 
central bank\'s target range of 3-6%.  In 2004 headline 
inflation (CPI) has hovered between 0-1%, with CPIX being 
around 4.5%.  The rand continued to strengthen in 2004 from 
a rate of R10.57/$1 in September 2002 to R7/$1 in September 
2003, and to approximately R6.5/$1 in August 2004. The 
stronger rand has helped to reduce the inflation rate. 
Central Bank action to cut the domestic interest rate 
contributed to the depreciation of the rand from its peak of 
R5.85 during the year to R6.60 in September 2004. The prime 
interest rate has also come down.  Years of fiscal 
discipline by the SAG are making it possible for the 
government to reduce the interest costs of national debt, 
lower marginal tax rates and increase government 
expenditures on social programs and capital expenditures. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Rule of Law, Political Pluralism, and Due Process 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (U) South Africa respects the rule of law but inadequate 
resources and training results in uneven implementation. 
Violent crime is high and there are strains on the judicial 
system.  South Africa held free and fair elections in April 
2004 in which the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 
nearly 70% of the vote.  The Cabinet includes 26 ministers 
from the ANC, one from the Azanaian People\'s Organization 
(AZAPO), and one from the New National Party (NPP).  Seats 
in the Parliament\'s National Assembly are allocated based on 
the percentage of votes each party receives.  In the 2004 
elections, the ANC won 279 of the 400 seats in the Assembly. 
The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, won 
50 seats, the Inkatha Freedom Party 28, the NNP 7, and the 
United Democratic Movement 9.  Several small parties won the 
remaining 27 seats. 
 
7. (U) The constitution\'s bill of rights provides for due 
process including the right to a fair, public trial within a 
reasonable time of being charged and the right to appeal to 
a higher court.  All branches of government generally 
respect the right to due process. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Elimination of Barriers to U.S. Trade 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) As a member of the Southern African Customs Union 
(SACU), South Africa participated in six rounds of 
negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the 
United States from June 2003 to June 2004, hosting the first 
two rounds in South Africa.  The first year of the talks 
informed both sides of their respective positions on issues 
but did not lead to any breakthroughs.  The seventh round of 
negotiations scheduled for August 2004 was postponed at 
SACU\'s request.  The talks have served to clarify to U.S. 
negotiators where there are barriers and where there are not 
barriers.  A successful FTA provides the best prospect of 
eliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Economic Policies To Reduce Poverty 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) Finance Minister Trevor Manual announced the new 
budget on February 18, 2004, which will increase spending on 
social programs such as HIV/AIDS programs, education, and 
\"pro-poor social services spending.\"  The 2004 budget 
provides for a marked acceleration in spending on basic 
social services, education, pension and disability grants, 
child support grants, HIV/AIDS, investment in 
infrastructure, and support for local development. 
 
10.  (U) President Mbeki has made the reduction in poverty 
and unemployment cornerstones to his second term program. 
Government has introduced programs for free basic water and 
electricity for all, and is expanding its housing program. 
Government has expanded its social welfare grants program to 
increase the number of children eligible for the child 
grant, and also increased the amount going to Support Old 
Age Pensioners (SOAP) and disability grants. Further, the 
Department of Social Development has loosened the 
eligibility requirements for the disability grants, which 
make it easier for unemployed people to access the funds. 
The major new jobs initiative has been the Expanded Public 
Works Program, which is not all that dissimilar to the U.S. 
depression era Works Progress Administration. The target is 
one million new jobs. All provinces have to have their 
programs up and running by the end of September. Government 
has also initiated a number of analytical pieces to better 
understand the dimensions of poverty, the poverty gap, and 
to establish a poverty line so as to be able to monitor 
success. 
 
----------------------------- 
A system to combat corruption 
----------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Despite being rocked by a Parliamentary travel 
scandal and the resignation of the Director of Public 
Prosecutions, who was widely perceived as having been forced 
out due to his investigation of the Deputy President for 
corrupt activities, the government actually made significant 
progress in the fight against graft in 2004.  Most 
significantly, Parliament in April passed the Prevention and 
Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, a law that for the 
first time clearly defines the scope of corrupt activities 
and otherwise complements several other existing 
anticorruption laws.  Government anticorruption entities 
also made headway in 2004 in expanding their operations and 
working toward greater interagency cooperation. 
 
12. (U) Nonetheless, there is still a widespread view that 
corruption is prevalent within government, particularly in 
the police, the Department of Home Affairs, and the 
Department of Transport.  Although South Africa\'s 
anticorruption regulatory framework is excellent, the 
enforcement of anticorruption laws and the creation of a 
corruption-free corporate culture within government must 
occur to overcome this perception. 
 
--------------------------- 
Protection of worker rights 
--------------------------- 
 
13. (U) The South African Department of Labor (SADOL) 
completed work on its Child Labor Action Program (CLAP). 
SADOL is now in the process of both costing out the various 
action items, after which the program will be presented to 
the Cabinet, and of putting together the priority 
recommendations for immediate implementation.  Due to the 
growing number of AIDS orphans, the problem of child labor 
has increased, particularly in the areas of commercial 
agriculture and street vending.   Sexual exploitation of 
children is also increasing.  The text in last year\'s report 
regarding labor, child labor and human rights remains 
accurate. 
 
14.  In light of the above developments, Post recommends 
South Africa\'s continued eligibility for AGOA.

E.O.   12958: N/A 
TAGS: EMIN, EINV, EIND, ECON, SF 
SUBJECT: South African Gold Industry in Crisis 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The South African gold mining industry is in 
trouble.  End of June 2004 company results showed profits sharply 
down.  In response, companies have laid off workers, closed 
shafts, and recalculated ore reserves as they move operations to 
higher-grade ore.  Companies blame these problems on the strong 
rand, which since 2002 has strengthened faster than the dollar 
price of gold.  Since 1998, however, the average rand price of 
gold has actually increased by more than 50%, while the rand has 
weakened by 18%.  This suggests that the problem is not entirely 
due to the strong rand, and raises questions about management\'s 
ability to deal with a steady rise in costs.  End summary. 
 
Profits Down 
------------ 
2. (U) Annual and quarterly reports, to the end of June 2004, 
show severely eroded profits for the country\'s gold mining 
companies, with many reporting operating losses.  AngloGold, the 
country\'s largest gold mining company and second largest in the 
world, showed profit declines of 126% and 82% for the quarter and 
six-month periods, respectively.  Gold Fields, South Africa\'s 
second largest gold producer and the fourth largest producer in 
the world, recorded a 60% drop for the year.  Harmony Gold, South 
Africa\'s third largest gold producer, showed an $80 million loss 
for the year.  Durban Roodepoort Deep (DRD), the country\'s fourth 
largest producer, showed a net loss of $45 million for the June 
quarter.  These top four companies account for more than 90% of 
South Africa\'s gold production.  In August, the Chamber of Mines 
declared that more than 50% of the country\'s gold mines were 
operating at a loss, and that the industry had not experienced 
such hard times since the liberalization of gold in the 1970\'s. 
 
The Rand/Dollar Exchange Rate Compounds High Rand Costs 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
3. (U) Gold mining companies argue that the reason for their 
trouble is that they have been caught between strong rand costs 
and weak dollar prices.  They do have a point.  Compared with 
2002, South African gold companies earned 20% fewer rands per 
ounce of gold despite a dollar price of gold that has increased 
by 29%.  This is partly because the South African Reserve Bank 
inflation fighting policy has kept interest rates high, causing 
the rand to strengthen 38% against the dollar the past two years. 
The result is that, despite $400/oz prices, the rand price of 
gold has actually decreased 32% over the past two years. 
 
4. (U) The strong rand is certainly a major explanatory factor as 
to why times are so tough for the South African gold industry 
today.  However, there may be a page 2 to the story.  The fact is 
that in 2002 the rand was exceptionally weak, averaging R10.5 to 
the dollar.  Using 1998 as a base year, when the rand/dollar 
exchange rate was more stable, one finds that the average price 
per ounce of gold has actually increased by 36% in dollar terms 
and a hefty 48% in rand terms.  This has led some industry 
analysts to ask why are South African gold companies having such 
a hard time now when they were making money in 1998? 
 
5. (U) The answer is that costs are much less flexible today than 
they were in 1998, and company managers, buoyed by low rand costs 
and rising gold prices in 2002, may not have properly considered 
this fact when investing in marginal operations.  In 2002, when 
the rand was exceptionally weak and the rand gold price doubled 
to between R3200 and R3800 per ounce, managers aggressively took 
on higher cost projects on the assumption that the rand would 
stay weak, ignoring the fact that their rand costs had risen and 
would be harder to reduce if the rand strengthened.  When the 
rand did strengthen, mine managers had little choice but to begin 
closing down high cost and least profitable operations. 
 
6. (U) The fact is that costs per ounce were on the rise in South 
Africa when a weakened rand appeared on the scene to save the 
day.  Part of this is because most South African gold mines are 
now mature, i.e., the high-grade (and lower cost) ore has been 
mined and reserves are in decline.  Keeping these mature mines 
open means mining lower grade (and thus higher cost) ore.  New, 
high-grade ore reserves in South Africa are located deep 
underground and thus much more expensive to mine.  Deep and ultra 
deep mines require sophisticated cooling and transportation 
systems, specialized roof support, and extensive health and 
safety measures.  Moreover, mineworkers spend 2-3 hours of the 
workday simply getting to their underground locations. 
 
7. (U) Other costs in South Africa have also been rising.  Labor 
costs over the past decade increased by more than 8% per year 
while productivity increased by only 3%.  As many as 30% of 
mineworkers may be HIV positive, shortening job tenure and 
requiring additional training, medical, and pension costs. 
Spoornet, the state-owned railroad, raised general freight 
tariffs by 35% in 2003 and another 16.5% in 2004.  Rand Water, 
the state-owned water utility, raised tariffs by 18% in each of 
the last two years.  Eskom, the state owned electric utility, 
wanted desperately to raise electricity rates, but the government 
insisted on keeping any increase to below inflation.  Domestic 
steel prices escalated by about 40% along with U.S. Section 201 
safeguard action in 2002, benefiting former South African 
parastatal and still dominant steel producer Iscor. 
 
Triage 
------ 
8.  (U) The situation has left the gold mining industry reeling 
over government administered prices and the South African Reserve 
Bank\'s high interest rate policy.  Ever more vocal and combative, 
several large mining houses have been lobbying the government and 
unions for a change, but nothing has seemed to work.  Through 
petitions to the Competition Commission, several large gold 
mining companies unsuccessfully tried to force Iscor to lower its 
steel prices.  Finally, with quiet industry support, the 
mineworker\'s union marched on the South African Reserve Bank in 
August, protesting high interest rates and the strong rand.  The 
following day, the Reserve Bank lowered its repurchase rate 50 
basis points.  (The Reserve Bank denies a cause-effect 
relationship, but analysts are divided.)  The result was that the 
dollar value of the rand weakened about 5%.  In addition, unions 
have begun to soften their stance on bread and butter issues, 
such as working Sundays, every second Saturday, plus selected 
public holidays, which would add about 80 additional production 
days to the year and require a 12% increase in the work force. 
These changes have helped, but shaft closures and layoffs 
continue. 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (U) Industry analysts project the rand to slowly weaken 
against the dollar (about 2-5% per year) and gold prices to trade 
in the $400 to $450 range in the medium term.  Under these 
relatively stable conditions, many marginal mines may stay open, 
but at lower production as closures of unprofitable shafts and 
working sections will still take place.  The larger mines will 
continue to produce at current levels, and new production, in 
particular from Placer-Dome\'s South Deep mine and Harmony\'s 
(previously Anglovaal) Target mine, could add about 32 tons net 
to annual output.  Notwithstanding, the Chamber of Mines 
estimates that total South African gold production will continue 
its slow decline in the long term, as it has since the 1970\'s, 
until stabilizing at 300 to 350 tons per year by about 2010.  In 
2003, South Africa produced 375 tons, 14.5% of world production. 
The Chamber believes that industry should mechanize its new mines 
and better train its work force.  [Established infrastructure in 
old mines does not allow for much mechanization.]  The result 
will be that the number of mineworkers will fall even further at 
a time when unemployment in South Africa is running at 42% (broad 
definition).  In the last ten years, the gold mining industry in 
South Africa has shed 125,000 jobs.

          B) PRETORIA 4028 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  South Africa Minister of Communications 
Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri has approved four under-serviced area 
licenses (USALs) three years after the government first 
announced its strategy to promote telecommunication services 
in rural areas and include black entrepreneurs in a 
traditionally high-cost industry.  USAL bidders complain 
that the Independent Communications Authority of South 
Africa (ICASA) remains their biggest obstacle.  Nonetheless, 
there is reason to expect that ICASA will issue the rest of 
the USAL licenses shortly.  Industry observers expect 
Casaburri to provide further clarification on the next phase 
of USALs in October.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) In June, South Africa Minister of Communications Ivy 
Matsepe-Casaburri approved several under-serviced area 
licenses (USALs) to promote telecommunications services in 
areas where less than 5 percent of the population has access 
to a fixed-line telephone.  The USAL operators will be 
confined to limited geographical regions, but will be 
allowed to offer an unrestricted range of voice and data 
services.  The announcement comes nearly three years after 
government first introduced the concept of USALs as part of 
a broad policy to bridge the digital divide among South 
Africa\'s poor. 
 
----------------- 
USALs PROMOTE BEE 
----------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) The Minister is awarding the USALs to black-owned 
consortiums in line with Government\'s black economic 
empowerment (BEE) policy.  BEE seeks to transform South 
Africa\'s economy by providing increased economic 
opportunities for historically disadvantaged individuals 
(HDI).  During the first round of the USAL process, fifteen 
applicants competed for ten licenses.  Casaburri approved 
licenses for Bokone Telecomms (Limpopo, Capricorn District); 
Thinta Thinta Telecoms (KwaZulu-Natal, Ugu District); 
Kingdom Communications (KZN, Zululand District; and Ilizwe 
Telecoms (Eastern Cape, OR Tambo Municipality.  She referred 
another three back to the Independent Communications 
Authority of South Africa (ICASA) for resolution of 
shareholder issues.  ICASA must now issue the licenses that 
were awarded by the Minister.  ICASA Manager for 
Telecommunications Licensing Phineas Moleele told Econoff 
that he hopes to finish negotiations with the operators in 
time to issue the licenses by the end of September.  A total 
of 27 USAL licenses will eventually be awarded. 
 
--------------------------- 
CHALLENGES FOR USAL BIDDERS 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) In separate conversations, Kingdom CEO Sifiso 
Mbatha and Thinta Thinta CEO Bule Mhlongo shared their 
concerns and business strategies with Econoff.  Both CEOs of 
these BEE companies said that ICASA has been their biggest 
obstacle.  Mbatha said that the regulator\'s lack of capacity 
and preoccupation with the Second National Operator caused 
delays that have sapped Kingdom\'s limited financial 
resources and facilitated increased market-share for 
incumbent operators.  Mhlongo also said that the delays are 
making it increasingly more difficult to secure additional 
financing for her efforts.  She said that investor reticence 
to provide open-ended financing and lender stipulations 
requiring Kingdom to supplement loans with a portion of its 
own money are threatening Kingdom\'s financial viability. 
The CEOs also cite the difficulty in negotiating favorable 
interconnection fees with South Africa\'s national cellular 
operators as a critical factor affecting their 
profitability. 
 
-------------------- 
REASONS FOR OPTIMISM 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Nevertheless, Mbatha and Mhlongo remain 
optimistic.  They expressed confidence that their business 
models focusing on mobile and data services would pay off in 
the rural areas.  They say that local communities are 
rallying behind them.  Mbatha says locals have purchased 
over 600,000 shares in Kingdom, generating nearly R400,000 
(about $62,000).  In addition, each USAL licensee will 
receive R15 million over the next three years from the 
government\'s Universal Service Area (USA) fund.  Mhlongo and 
Mbatha also said that the Industrial Development Corporation 
(IDC) of South Africa may provide financing without the 
strings required by other lenders.  Mhlongo also pointed out 
that the national carriers are not yet meeting universal 
service obligations required by their current licenses.  She 
said national carriers see contracts with USALs to service 
their existing customers and lines as a way to fulfill 
universal service obligations.  Mhlongo sees this as a way 
to generate both revenue and leverage in her interconnection 
negotiations with the existing phone companies.  For their 
part, phone companies see opportunities to increase profits 
through roaming fees charged to USAL subscribers. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Recent announcements at Transnet and the 
Department of Communications regarding restructuring and 
telecom liberalization, respectively, suggest Cabinet level 
officials are increasing pressure to bring about change more 
quickly (Refs A, B).  This bodes well for companies awaiting 
USAL licenses from ICASA.  Industry observers expect the 
Minister of Communications Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri to provide 
clarification on the next phase of the USAL process in 
October.

SUBJECT: DURBAN PORT - IMPROVEMENTS, CONCESSION, SECURITY 
 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
Not for Internet distribution. 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Infrastructure and process improvements 
as well as new equipment are increasing efficiency at Durban 
Port according to Mervyn Chetty, Executive Manager of 
Corporate Strategy and Continuous Improvement at South 
African Port Operations (SAPO).  New cranes are expected to 
double capacity and new scanners are on their way.  The 
Container Terminal is expected to be concessioned by the end 
of the year with SAPO as part of a joint partnership 
operating and managing the Terminal.  Although, Security at 
the Container Terminal appears adequate, security lapses at 
Maydon Wharf are still evident.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) A multi-billion rand project titled \"Development 
2005\" is addressing the current capacity constraints at the 
Port of Durban.  SAPO Executive Manager of Corporate 
Strategy and Continuous Improvement Mervyn Chetty told 
Econoff that the project addresses his top three priorities 
to improve the port\'s people, processes and equipment. 
 
----------------- 
PEOPLE IMROVEMENT 
----------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Chetty acknowledged Durban\'s dismal delays in 
recent history.  However, he said that much of this could be 
attributed to the fact that the people on the ground lacked 
the proper tools for the job.  For instance, Chetty points 
out that in 2002, just 10 percent of all container traffic 
was unloaded and stacked at a rate of more than 16 
containers per hour.  Two years later, after increasing its 
straddle carrier fleet to move and stack containers, 84 
percent of container traffic is now being moved at a rate of 
more than 16 containers per hour. 
 
4.  (U) Chetty also pointed out that while global container 
traffic is increasing by 6 percent each year, Durban is 
experiencing 8 percent growth.  To handle the container 
growth, shipping lines are using larger ships. 
Unfortunately, Chetty says that Durban has an insufficient 
number of qualified open-license pilots to steer larger 
ships into port.  This creates delays despite improvements 
in capacity within the port.  Chetty is working closely with 
the National Ports Authority (NPA), which is responsible for 
training harbor pilots. 
 
------------------- 
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 
------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Chetty also said that improvements could be 
immediately realized with slight modifications in processes. 
For example, the zig-zag configuration of the Durban 
Container Terminal\'s (DCT) quay wall accommodates only one 
crane for adjacent berth numbers 202 and 203.  This prevents 
ships docked concurrently at the two berths from unloading 
simultaneously.  While one ship is unloaded, the other ship 
waits, inefficiently occupying limited berth space.  In 
addition, the stacking configuration at these berths only 
allowed a maximum of 10,000 containers.  After some 
analysis, Chetty staggered the arrival and departure times 
of ships assigned to 202 and 203 so that while one ship was 
docking and securing moorings, the other was being unloaded. 
This allows the DCT to turn ships around much more quickly. 
In addition, Chetty\'s modifications of the stacking 
configuration for containers - taking them higher and 
storing them further down the quay wall- increased the 
storage capacity to 15,000 containers. 
 
6.  (SBU) Chetty is also working with U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection inspectors assigned to Durban as part of 
the Container Security Initiative (CSI) to improve the 
process of scanning containers at Durban\'s lone scanner. 
Members of the CSI Team at Durban Port told Econoff that the 
disjointed process for identifying and delivering a 
container from the Terminal to the scanner is causing delays 
resulting in many containers being short-shipped (missing 
their assigned ship).  They said that when CSI identifies a 
container, DCT employees retrieve it from the stack and 
deliver it to the Terminal gate.  The shipping agent must 
then send a truck from one side of the harbor to the 
Terminal to transport the container 100 meters to the 
scanner.  After being scanned, the truck returns the 
container back to the Terminal.  DCT employees must then 
retrieve it from the gate and return it to the stack.  In 
addition to the transportation inefficiencies, the process 
of moving the container to and from the secure terminal 
requires additional documentation, which can add to the 
delays.  The CSI team has suggested to Chetty that DCT 
workers convey the container from its stack directly to the 
scanner and back to the stack. 
 
--------------------- 
EQUIPMENT IMPROVEMENT 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Durban has recently added three ship-to-shore gantry 
cranes, increasing its total to 16 and bringing the port 
more in line with international best practices that call for 
one crane per 100 meters of quay wall.  Chetty said these 
new cranes will allow the port to accommodate an expected 
increase in container traffic from the current 1.2 million 
TEU (twenty foot equivalent units) per year to 2.4 million 
TEU per year. 
 
8.  (SBU) In addition, Chetty said that the South African 
Revenue Service (SARS), which oversees Customs issues, has 
purchased seven new security scanners.  Three of these will 
be allocated to the Durban Port and the other four will be 
placed at border crossing posts.  Currently, Durban has just 
one scanner, which is located outside the Container 
Terminal.  This creates huge bottlenecks as the South 
African Police Service (SAPS), the NPA, and the U.S. CSI 
team send containers to be scanned for illegal contraband. 
By late morning, the single lane Bayhead Road is backed up 
by over a mile, creating gridlock at the Terminal.  The 
addition of extra scanners will allow a dedicated scanner to 
be located inside of the DCT.  Chetty could not provide 
Econoff with a definitive delivery date. 
 
------------------- 
OTHER PORT PROJECTS 
------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Durban has just completed a major expansion of the 
quay wall at the port\'s Point area on the city side of the 
harbor.  The new expansion will accommodate three more 
berths which will be used for multi-purpose cargo, 
relocating from Pier 1 (adjacent to the Durban Container 
Terminal)   This addition will allow the DCT to expand into 
Pier 1 and increase its capacity by facilitating more 
container space at the Terminal.  Chetty said the berths 
should be operational by early 2007 after the new area has 
settled and the surface been paved.  Chetty said that the 
NPA is also considering annexing Salisbury Island (adjacent 
to Pier 1) into the DCT expansion.  In addition, the 
Passenger Terminal will be relocated to the new Point quay 
wall where tourists will have access to the oceanfront and 
the new uShaka Marine World theme park.  Port authorities 
also speculate that the Port may expand into the space 
currently occupied by Durban International Airport if the 
airport is moved north to the Dube Trade Port. 
 
10.  (U) The widening of the Durban harbor entrance is also 
scheduled to begin early next year.  The project will widen 
the channel into Durban Bay from about 130 meters to 220 
meters by relocating the breakwater (North Pier).  At the 
same time, the entrance channel and subsequent channels 
within the Port will be deepened from about 12.8 meters to 
as much as 18 meters to allow access for larger container 
ships capable of carrying 6,500 TEUs. 
 
11.  (U) Chetty also recognized that congestion is a problem 
on Maydon Wharf Road and Bayhead Road into the Durban 
Container Terminal.  He said that the city is scheduled to 
begin construction on an interchange from Bayhead Road to 
the freeway, allowing port authorities to close public 
access to the Maydon Wharf Road.  In addition, plans are in 
the works to widen Bayhead Road into the Terminal and to 
create parking along the side of the road. 
 
------------------------------------ 
DURBAN CONTAINER TERMINAL CONCESSION 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.  (SBU) The SAG would like to have its tender for a 
concession of the Durban Container Terminal in place by the 
end of 2004.  Chetty believes that SAPO\'s improved 
performance over the past 18 months is proof that it can 
effectively operate the port.  What SAPO lacks, according to 
Chetty, is management experience.  A senior Public 
Enterprise official confirmed to Econoff that the concession 
of the DCT will be a joint partnership with SAPO.  (NOTE: US 
company CSX is expected to be a major contender for the 
terminal concession. END NOTE) 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
13.  (SBU) The NPA has recently installed a high fence 
around much of the port.  A second checkpoint at the Point 
has improved access control to those berths.  However, Rob 
Gardner, an agent from ISS-Voight Shipping and former- 
President of the Shipping Lines Association, told Econoff 
that in his opinion, fencing is an inadequate security 
measure.  He said that closed-circuit television (CCTV), 
human security, and restricted access protocols are needed 
to create a more secure port. 
 
14.  (SBU) Private vehicles can easily access the Maydon 
Wharf area.  Econoff observed shipping lines unloading 
containers on the street along Maydon Wharf, which could be 
accessed by unauthorized persons.  Although the NPA has 
required shipping lines to hire security to prevent access 
to ships and cargo, Econoff observed instances where the 
security was lax, inattentive, and sometimes not present. 
Gardner explained that the NPA does not have much leverage 
in enforcing the security plans.  If shipping lines fail to 
provide adequate security then the NPA is responsible to do 
so.  Gardner said he did not think the NPA has the capacity 
to provide security.  In addition, it is difficult for Port 
authorities to restrict access to the area because private 
companies are located there. 
 
15.  (SBU) Durban\'s Container Terminal has much tighter 
security than the rest of the port.  Bongi Nzuza, Protection 
Services Manager at the Terminal, told Econoff that in his 
four years at the Terminal is has removed dishonest 
employees and placed cameras at the entrance to photograph 
drivers and containers entering and exiting the Terminal. 
Nzuza said he has also increased training for his security 
staff and that, as of mid-July 2004, only credentialed 
individuals may enter the Terminal.  Nzuza is also looking 
into implementing CCTV cameras throughout the Terminal.  He 
said that there have been no thefts of containers in the 
last five years, something that was previously commonplace. 
Nzuza also noted an increased police presence since the 
Container Security Initiative was implemented in December 
2003.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Treasury U/S Taylor and DAS 
Fratto sought support from South African Finance 
Minister Manuel to a U.S. proposal to move from loans 
to grants for HIPC countries in the multilateral 
development banks.  The Minister agreed that the HIPC 
program had lowered debt levels for participating 
countries but raised numerous questions about the 
proposal, including possible institutional affects 
and the long-term sustainability of donor flows to 
IDA and the AfDF.  U/S Taylor told Manuel that the 
U.S. could not support the IFF and that global taxes 
for development were politically unacceptable.  In a 
separate meeting, U/S Taylor and Reserve Bank 
Governor Mboweni discussed an IMF staff proposal to 
provide technical assistance to HIPC countries 
without requiring that a Fund program be in place.

those benefiting from the USG/s African Mortgage 
Markets Initiative.  Public diplomacy aspects of U/S 
Taylor\'s visit are reported in reftel.  End Summary. 
 
U.S. Proposal for IDA Grants 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  In a September 8 Cape Town dinner meeting, 
Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs 
John Taylor and DAS Tony Fratto discussed with 
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and senior National 
Treasury officials a U.S. proposal to move from loans 
to grants for HIPC countries in the multilateral 
development banks (MDBs).  U/S Taylor explained that 
the HIPC initiative had not succeeded in reducing the 
debt burden.  HIPC countries found themselves in an 
absurd situation.  They must borrow to repay debt. 
U/S Taylor said the donor community needed to find a 
way to stand down on debt while keeping resources 
flowing for developing countries.  If donors did not 
find a way to stop the build up of debt, MDB resource 
flows would be wasted. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Finance Minister Manuel said he agreed 
with the diagnosis, but he was not sure of the 
treatment.  He was worried about the unintended 
consequences of the idea.  He said the proposal to 
shift to grants could imply fundamental change in the 
World Bank as an institution.  For the Minister, the 
AfDB/F was the key question.  Changing the funding 
structure might destroy the institution.  AfDB/F 
issue needs a separate look in his view.  The 
Minister also expressed concern about the long-term 
sustainability of donor flows.  He stated that the 
IDA pool of funds is currently not large enough to 
meet Millennium Development Goals.  He asked what is 
the security of income to IDA?  Will the U.S. 
Congress continue to support resources for IDA? 
 
5.  (SBU)  U/S Taylor explained that the U.S. idea 
did not represent institutional change.  IBRD loans 
would not be affected.  The focus was strictly HIPC. 
Taylor agreed that sustaining flows was the key 
question and explained that the U.S. proposal would 
not reduce resources.  In fact, IDA and other soft 
loan institutions, such as the AfDF, would actually 
get more funds.  Taylor pointed out that IDA would 
always depend on donor funding.  It will never be 
self-sustaining.  He added that there was also a 
moral question of using reflows from countries like 
Ethiopia to pay for development in Niger.  U/S Taylor 
said he had a higher degree of confidence in donor 
countries funding IDA than developing countries 
repaying IDA loans.  In fact, IDA 14 contributions 
would be higher.  U/S Taylor said he was optimistic 
that the U.S. Congress would support grant funding, 
 
6.  (SBU)  Ambassador Frazer added that HIPC simply 
was not working.  We needed to change our approach to 
get HIPC countries to a sustainable level of 
development.  The Ambassador said the international 
community had a window of opportunity to move ahead; 
we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the 
good.  She emphasized that there is no political gain 
for U.S. in its proposal. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Manuel noted that there are two other 
proposals on the table that would increase ODA to 
developing countries: the International Financing 
Facility (IFF) and some form of a global tax.  While 
acknowledging that the U.S. had problems with the 
IFF, the minister said the international community 
needed to understand and explore the issues with the 
IFF and global taxation proposals.  He noted that the 
U.S. proposal to move to grants in the MDB\'s and the 
other initiatives should not be seen as mutually 
exclusive. 
 
8.  (SBU)  U/S Taylor replied that the IFF was fine 
if the Europeans wanted to pursue it, but the U.S. 
simply could not do it based on our own laws.  The 
international tax was a non-starter: it would not fly 
domestically in the U.S. 
 
9.  (SBU)  U/S Taylor said he believed the U.S. idea 
would be popular with African countries, as they 
would benefit most.  He said the U.S. would like 
South African and international support and asked for 
Manuel\'s advice on how to approach others to discuss 
the proposal.  The Minister suggested that the U.S. 
would need to address the systemic issues for the 
IBRD and regional institutions; answer questions of 
resource adequacy and flexibility; include ideas on 
the re-financing of existing loans; and think through 
the long term effects to create buy-in.  Manuel also 
opined that the proposal was too easy for donor 
countries.  The real need was for more multilateral 
funds. 
 
FTA Negotiations 
---------------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  U/S Taylor also discussed briefly with 
Minister Manuel, a former trade minister, the U.S.- 
SACU FTA negotiations.  He noted that an FTA was the 
logical next step to build on the success of AGOA. 
He hoped the U.S. and SACU would move expeditiously 
to conclude the agreement by the end of the year. 
Manuel noted that he was \"a bit of a purist\" on trade 
issues, favoring an emphasis on multilateral 
negotiations.  The Under Secretary commented that the 
U.S. was determined to move ahead on all trade 
fronts: multilateral, regional and bilateral. 
 
AGOA Helps the Apparel Industry 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U)  Following a September 9 breakfast briefing 
with South African journalists (reftel), U/S Taylor 
and DAS Fratto visited the House of Monatic, a 
clothing manufacturer producing for the South African 
and international market.  Among those participating 
in the boardroom session were Fred Robertson, chief 
executive officer for Brimstone Investment Holdings, 
a Black Economic Empowerment company that owns House 
of Monatic; Brian Buckingham, manager for Monatic; 
and Jack Kipling, executive officer of the Clothing 
Export Council.  House of Monatic employs over 1,000 
workers and produces on the export side for 
Nordstrom, J.C. Penny, Dillards, and others in the 
U.S. 
 
12.  (U)  Jack Kipling reported that AGOA was 
responsible for the creation of 12,000 new jobs in 
South Africa.  He argued that it has been largely 
South African factors that have inhibited greater 
growth, including the high rand and the inability of 
local textile producers to provide sufficient fabric 
in a timely manner.  Wage differentials are also 
hurting South African competitiveness with an average 
of about USD 2.05 paid per hour in Cape Town, placing 
it on par with Turkey.  The South Africans, Kipling 
reported, were feeling especially keen competition 
from Madagascar and Mozambique, where labor cost per 
hour were well below 75 US cents per hour.  Other 
factors cited by participants as responsible for 
dampening growth were the absence of direct U.S. 
foreign investment in clothing and a lack of interest 
in South African production on the part of U.S. 
textile suppliers.  Robertson noted the importance of 
the clothing industry in job creation.  He reported 
on Brimstone\'s recent acquisition of a jean 
production plant, formerly owned by a Chinese company 
in Atlantis, a depressed community north of Cape 
Town, as a means of creating new jobs. 
 
13.  (U)  On the negotiations for the FTA with SACU, 
Jack Kipling laid out the industry\'s position saying 
it fully supports an FTA, seeks to build a vibrant, 
sustainable clothing industry with as many as 500,000 
jobs, and wants a regime that will allow greater 
South African access to third country fibers, even if 
it was only for a specified transition period of 
perhaps 15 years.  Without substantial growth, 
Kipling feared the South African clothing industry 
would wither.  A tour of House of Monatic operations 
followed the boardroom session. 
 
Wine Exports, Too 
----------------- 
 
14.  (U)  In conjunction with the Wines of South 
Africa, (South Africa\'s wine industry export 
council), Charles Back, owner of Fairview Estates in 
Paarl, hosted a small lunch for the U/S Taylor and 
DAS Fratto.  Owner of a third generation-farm, Back 
has employed clever marketing strategies and catchy 
titles to attract attention in the U.S. and Europe. 
His Goats do Roam blend of red wine have made 
considerable headway in the U.S., reportedly selling 
over 1.2 million bottles in 2003.  Back attributed 
his success to his ability to establish good and 
often personal working relations with American 
importers.  Overall, individual makers like Back and 
marketing strategists at WOSA aim at cutting into the 
share of the market they believe overly dominated by 
Australia with good products at the lower end of the 
price spectrum. 
 
Economy Finally Creating Jobs 
----------------------------- 
 
15.  (SBU)  At the Governor\'s request, U/S Taylor and 
DAS Fratto met over breakfast September 10 in 
Pretoria with South African Reserve Bank Governor 
Tito Mboweni.  Gov. Mboweni noted that, although the 
numbers were small, the South African economy was 
finally beginning to create jobs, particularly in the 
mining, manufacturing and construction sectors.  He 
expressed concern about the continued growth of the 
services sector as a percentage of GDP.  This sector 
would not absorb many of South Africa\'s poorly 
skilled unemployed.  The Governor concurred with U/S 
Taylor\'s comment on the value of AGOA to Africa; 
however, he suggested that the U.S. try to do more to 
reduce non-tariff barriers.  Econ M/C pointed out 
that the U.S. was already helping in this area, for 
example through USDA\'s APHIS, which worked closely 
with SA exporters.  Mboweni felt that South Africa 
would see the benefits of more open trade over the 
coming 4-5 years with improved productivity. 
 
Assisting African Central Banks 
------------------------------- 
 
16.  (SBU)  U/S Taylor raised with Governor Mboweni a 
recent IMF staff proposal to provide technical 
assistance to HIPC countries without requiring that a 
Fund program be in place.  U/S Taylor pointed out the 
program would be strictly voluntary.  He noted that 
initial reaction from HIPC countries was positive and 
that some emerging market economies were also 
interested. 
 
17.  (SBU)  Mboweni noted that many African countries 
want this type of assistance but are reluctant to 
call on the IMF due to its reputation: they prefer 
bilateral programs.  He stated that South Africa had 
central bank technical assistance programs with all 
13 other SADC members, plus Rwanda, Gambia and other 
African countries.  He said that fortunately he had 
recently retired Reserve Bank staff that could 
provide the assistance but that it was \"costing me 
money.\"  He noted that he recently told Egyptian 
officials that the first thing to do was give the 
central bank independence.  He noted that this was a 
hard message for many African governments to accept. 
 
Housing Finance 
--------------- 
 
18.  (U)  Prior to departure, U/S Taylor and DAS 
Fratto toured Alexandra, a former township adjoining 
Johannesburg\'s Sandton suburb.  U/S Taylor saw a 
range of low-income urban housing, from squatter 
camps to government-provided single rooms houses to 
modest single-family homes typical of houses that 
will be insured through USAID-guaranteed mortgage 
insurance programs, in conjunction with South 
Africa\'s Home Loan Guarantee Company.  U/S Taylor 
also received a briefing on innovative OPIC-supported 
program that will support HIV/AIDs treatment for 
those who purchase the insurance product, enabling 
them to continue working and earning an income, 
maximizing their ability to provide support to their 
families.  U/S Taylor noted the benefits of both

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY. Minister of Communications Ivy Matsepe- 
Casaburri conditionally approved a license for the Second 
National Operator (SNO) on September 17.  The Independent 
Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) must now 
oversee negotiations to issue the license despite the lack of 
a shareholding agreement, business plan, and shareholders and 
subscription agreements.  While some SNO shareholders are 
optimistic about the announcement, Nexus (the SNO\'s 
empowerment shareholder) argues that nothing has really 
changed and is proceeding with its call for a judicial review 
of the SNO process.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) As promised in her August 27 press conference, the 
Minister of Communication Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri approved a 
license for the Second National Operator (SNO) on September 
17.  Casaburri said the approval was subject to the following 
conditions:  a) acceptance of the shareholding and control 
structure of the SNO; b) finalization of and agreement on the 
Business Plan; and c) finalization of the Shareholders and 
Subscription Agreements.  The Minister has asked the 
Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) 
to undertake the role of approving the applicants\' 
submissions, including the shareholders agreement, business 
plan, and then the licensing of the SNO entity.  (NOTE: While 
South African law allows the Minister to approve a license, 
only the regulator can issue the license.  END NOTE). 
 
3.  (U) The Minister\'s August 27 announcement detailed 
changes to the shareholding structure and was also subject to 
the same conditions outlined in paragraph 2.  Although all 
the SNO shareholders have yet to accept the Minister\'s 
proposed shareholding structure, she approved the license 
anyway.  Industry stakeholders said that the Minister\'s 
approval of a license effectively places the burden of the 
SNO squarely on the shoulders of the regulator without 
actually resolving anything. 
 
4.  (SBU) A Nexus (the empowerment partner in the SNO) 
official told Econoff that since the Minister has yet to find 
a 26 percent shareholder for the strategic equity partner 
(SepCo) stake, nothing has really changed.  According to the 
official, ComuniTel and TwoConsortium, the two failed bidders 
from the tender process who were awarded a combined 25 
percent stake in SepCo, still remain in a position to control 
the SNO.  As a result, Nexus has renewed its call for a 
judicial review of the SNO process.  This process could 
derail the SNO for months. 
 
5.  (U) Nevertheless, some SNO stakeholders remain 
optimistic.  Karl Socikwa Transtel CEO and SNO official 
spokesperson said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the the 
Minister\'s announcement would make the SNO network available 
by early next year, in time to capitalize on the opening of 
the services market in February.  Deputy Minister of 
Communications Roy Padayachee also claims to have 
confirmation that Nexus will drop its legal action and that 
the SNO parties are moving forward.  To date there has been 
no public comment on the Minister\'s proposed shareholding 
structure or her approval of the SNO license. 
 
6.  (U) Meanwhile, industry stakeholders are anxiously 
awaiting the Minister\'s October press conference where she 
has said she will elaborate on the telecom liberalizations to 
take place February 1, 2005.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The American Chamber of Commerce in South 
Africa (AmCham) submitted comments on the fourth draft of the 
Information Communication and Technology (ICT) empowerment 
charter September 15 to the ICT Charter Working Group. 
American businesses described the fourth draft as impractical 
and unworkable.  Amcham, acting on behalf of U.S. businesses 
in South Africa, requested a meeting with Deputy Minister of 
Communications Roy Padayachee.  A fifth draft of the Charter 
will be submitted for governmental review by the end of 
September.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) The American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa 
(Amcham) submitted comments on the fourth draft of the 
Information Communication and Technology (ICT) empowerment 
charter September 15 to the ICT Charter Working Group.  The 
document outlines concerns held by U.S. businesses operating 
in South Africa.  AmCham\'s document was also sent to the 
attention of the Deputy Minister of Communications Roy 
Padayachee.  AmCham expects to meet independently with 
Padayachee to discuss what it perceives to be major flaws in 
the fourth draft. 
 
3.  (SBU) In private, several executives of U.S. businesses 
in South Africa describe the fourth draft as \"rubbish\", 
\"disappointing\", and \"completely unworkable.\"  One official 
said the document, was a \"giant leap of impracticality\" from 
the third draft.  In public, the companies have identified 
the following items as the significant issues of the fourth 
draft: 
 
- The scorecard definition of accreditation is incomplete 
with major omissions, which make impossible any attempt to 
apply the scorecard to real businesses. 
 
- Some targets are punitive and fail to account for special 
circumstances. 
 
- The excessive number of indicators creates unwarranted 
complexity and inflexibility. 
 
- The Charter lacks clarity on issues, which have major 
industry implications. 
 
- The Charter proposes interference in issues, which are of 
no significance to BEE and may actively prejudice 
multinational companies. 
 
- The appointment and governance of the BEE Council, its 
rules and procedures, its powers and methods of appeal of its 
decisions are undefined. 
 
- The Charter scorecard contains rigidity and inflexibility, 
which do not allow for different business models in a widely 
diverse ICT industry. 
 
4.  (U) AmCham and several representatives of American firms 
in South Africa met with Dali Mpofu, Chairman of the ICT 
Working Group and members of the scorecard drafting team. 
According to IBM Country Manager, Mpofu acknowledged several 
of AmCham\'s points pertaining to the draft\'s ambiguity 
regarding scoring and bonus points and said the Working Group 
would take those into consideration. 
 
5.  (SBU) Mpofu also indicated that he plans to submit a 
fifth draft of the ICT Charter to the Minister of 
Communications by the end of September.  The fifth draft 
would not be available for public comment at that time. 
Mpofu expects to receive government\'s feedback by the end of 
October.  He said the BEE Council would be formed between 
December 2004 and February 2005.  According to Mpofu the 
Council must represent the sector, but should also include 
labor and include representation from the provinces.  (NOTE: 
The composition of sectoral councils has been a major 
sticking point in the financial services sector and promises 
to be a contentious issue in the ICT sector as well.  END 
NOTE). 
 
6.  (U) Complete text of AmCham\'s submission to the ICT 
Working Group will be faxed to the South Africa desk.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: DE BEERS DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY FINDS 
MEDICAL USE 
 
1.  (U) Summary: De Beers, the world\'s largest producer of 
diamonds, has developed a fast x-ray scanner for diamond 
detection and analysis that also has useful application in 
the medical field.  The Digital X-ray machine, called the 
Statscan, costs about $500,000 and can perform a full-body x- 
ray in about 13 seconds -- compared to 45 minutes for a 
series of conventional x-rays.  Moreover, the Statscan 
delivers a 75% less x-ray dosage than conventional x-ray 
machines.  Quick scanning and low dosage help to allay 
patient fears and makes x-raying safer.  It is particularly 
useful in trauma situations.  End Summary 
 
2.  (U) De Beers\' developed the original version of the 
Statscan to detect stolen diamonds hidden on mineworkers and 
other employees.  De Beers needed a machine that was fast 
and safe for everyday use and came up with the Statscan. 
Soon it was apparent that the Statscan also had applications 
in the medical field.  The Industrial Development 
Corporation (the IDC, a government financing agency) agreed 
to co-fund development of the first medical version. 
Together, DeBeers and the IDC created Lodox Systems to 
develop and market the Statscan. 
 
3.  (U) The first Statscan systems were installed in South 
Africa at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and the 
Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg.  Subsequently, one of the 
world\'s busiest trauma centers, the R. Adams Cowley Shock 
Trauma Center in Baltimore, installed a system.  Lodox has 
now established a full subsidiary in the United States and 
has sold seven systems to new prototype emergency rooms 
designed after the September 11th terrorist attacks.

REF:  (A) PRETORIA 3158, (B) PRETORIA 1437, (C) STATE 160178 
 
1.  Summary.  The Intellectual Property Action Group 
(IPACT), which includes representatives of U.S. companies, 
organized two useful workshops on the enforcement of 
intellectual property rights in South Africa in August and 
September.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office funded the 
first workshop that featured the participation of over 60 
officials from the South African government and private 
sector.  The second event was a seminar for South African 
prosecutors that focused on the Counterfeit Goods Act, 
copyright, trademarks, and criminal cases.  Both events 
advanced U.S. economic interests in enforcing intellectual 
property rights.  End summary. 
 
2.  Less than a year ago, the Intellectual Property Action 
Group (IPACT) of South Africa formed a training subcommittee 
to help advance the enforcement of intellectual property 
rights (IPR) in South Africa.  The members of the 
subcommittee include the Recording Industry of South Africa 
(RISA), the South African Federation Against Copyright Theft 
(SAFACT), Microsoft, Embassy economic officer, and lawyers 
from major SA firms specializing in IPR law, including the 
firm that represents the Business Software Alliance (BSA). 
After several months of planning, the subcommittee succeeded 
in organizing two IPR events that took place on August 23 
and September 21 in Johannesburg.  Both events aimed to 
sensitize South African government officials about the 
importance of IPR and the need for more effective 
enforcement.  The South African government cooperated by 
providing speakers for the first event and nearly a hundred 
prosecutors from the Gauteng province for the second event. 
Both events advanced U.S. policy to promote the protection 
of intellectual property rights, an important goal of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). 
 
Workshop on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
3.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), IPACT and 
the U.S. Embassy organized the Workshop on Enforcement of 
Intellectual Property Rights on August 23 in Johannesburg. 
The USPTO funded the event (Reftel C).  Over sixty South 
African government officials participated, including 
representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry 
(DTI), DTI\'s Companies and Intellectual Property 
Registration Office (CIPRO), the Department of Health, the 
South African Police Service (SAPS), the South African 
Revenue Service (SARS), the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA) and the Registrar of Trade Marks and Patents. 
Managers from leading U.S. pharmaceutical companies also 
attended and discussed solutions to their problems with SAG 
officials.  The media also covered the event. 
 
4.  Welcoming the South African participants, U.S. Consul 
General discussed the importance of IPR to virtually all 
modern economic activity.  The Chairman of IPACT recommended 
that the workshop become an annual feature.  He discussed 
the relationship between \"creativity\" and IPR, saying: 
 
\"Creative genius in music and movies can entertain. Creative 
genius in medicine can heal and save lives. Although it has 
been argued, unsuccessfully I might add, that counterfeit 
products facilitate the free flow of information, they in 
fact merely feed off someone else\'s creativity. It is not a 
victimless crime when unscrupulous operators want to turn a 
profit on someone else\'s intellectual property.  The 
combined economic loss for the South African economy is 
huge. Intellectual Property theft is sometimes perceived as 
being a problem that only affects the bottom line of huge 
companies. Last week I had a meeting with the South African 
Trade Union of Musicians called MUSA. I can assure you that 
individual musicians in the rural areas of our country are 
as concerned about the effect that piracy has on their 
livelihood as any of the affected multi-national companies.\" 
 
5.  USPTO Attorney Advisor Michael Adlin delivered well- 
received presentations on counterfeit medicines and 
effective enforcement tools against optical disc and digital 
piracy.  A representative of the SA Department of Health 
discussed enforcement using the Medicines Control Act.  A 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) official discussed 
optical disc and digital piracy.  (Note:  She will attend 
the USPTO Enforcement Academy program in October 2004.)  The 
Chairman of the Business Software Alliance (BSA) discussed 
software piracy issues.  The group marketing director of 
Johnnic Communications spoke on the importance of IPR 
enforcement for the film industry.   The Superintendent of 
the Computer Unit of the South African Police Force 
discussed investigative techniques along with two 
representatives of the South African Revenue Service. 
 
Seminar for Prosecutors 
----------------------- 
 
6.  On September 21 IPACT hosted a seminar for South African 
prosecutors.  IPACT invited nearly 100 prosecutors and 
nearly all of them attended the one-day event held at 
Microsoft\'s new offices.  Private sector attorneys 
specializing in IPR law focused on South Africa\'s 
Counterfeit Goods Act, discussed copyright and trademark 
enforcement issues, and described the economic harm of 
pirated goods.  There were also sections on expert evidence 
preparation, criminal case examples, and case study 
workshops.  IPACT described the event as a public private 
partnership.

2004 QUARTERLY BULLETIN 
 
 SUMMARY 
 ------- 
 
 1. Summary.  The September 2004 South African Reserve 
 Bank\'s (SARB) quarterly bulletin reported mostly 
 positive developments in South Africa\'s macroeconomic 
 indicators for the second quarter of 2004.  Real 
 gross domestic product (GDP) growth continued its 
 over 3 percent growth, reaching 3.9 percent compared 
 to 3.6 percent in the first quarter 2004.  South 
 Africa\'s real GDP has now expanded for 23 consecutive 
 quarters.  Real household consumption increased by 
 4.3 percent.  Fixed capital formation grew by 10.4 
 percent, led by a 53.8 percent increase in public 
 corporation investment that accounted for 59 percent 
 of the quarterly change.  Private sector investment 
 also showed strong growth, increasing by 5.4 percent, 
 led by mining (especially platinum), agricultural and 
 manufacturing sectors.  After 22 years of consecutive 
 quarterly trade surpluses, South Africa\'s trade 
 balance reached a R5.5 billion deficit.  As global 
 growth recovered in the first half of 2004, the 
 export sector grew 42.3 percent (q/q) after two 
 consecutive quarters of over 9 percent declines; a 
 95.3 percent quarterly growth in imports, however, 
 restrained overall GDP growth.  End Summary 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 ------------ 
 
 2.  The September 2004 SARB\'s quarterly bulletin 
 includes data and commentary about the South African 
 economy up to the end of the second quarter 2004. 
 This cable summarizes bulletin highlights.  The full 
 quarterly bulletin is available at www.resbank.co.za 
 
 GDP GROWTH RECOVERS - DOMESTIC EXPENDITURES GROWTH 
 REMAINS HIGH 
 --------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 3.    Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
 continued its over 3 percent growth in the second 
 quarter 2004, reaching 3.9 percent compared to 3.6 
 percent in the first quarter 2004.  South Africa\'s 
 real GDP has now expanded for 23 consecutive 
 quarters, fueled mainly by a 13 percent increase in 
 gross domestic expenditures (GDE) and significantly 
 higher than the 2004 Q1\'s increase of 2.9 percent.  A 
 13.6 percent increase in inventories, compared to 
 first quarter\'s rise of 3.1 percent, explains the 
 much higher increase in GDE during the second 
 quarter.   Domestic demand (excluding inventories) 
 remained strong, increasing 5.3 percent, as interest 
 rates continued their downward trend.  Real household 
 consumption continues to grow higher than GDP, at 4.3 
 percent compared to last quarter\'s 4.9 percent.  Real 
 capital formation increased 10.4 percent after first 
 quarter\'s growth of 14.6 percent.  Capital formation 
 by public corporations contributed 59 percent of the 
 second quarter\'s change, while private investment 
 accounted for 39 percent. Increased global growth 
 countered the trade-weighted rand strength resulting 
 in a 42.3 percent quarterly export growth; however, a 
 95.5 percent import growth caused the current account 
 deficit to reach 3.8 percent of GDP. 
 
 4.  Real household consumption increased by 4.3 
 percent in the second quarter, slightly lower than 
 4.9 percent in Q1.  Growth in household spending on 
 durable goods reflected a slowdown in Q2 growth of 9 
 percent compared to Q1 growth of 12 percent. 
 Furniture and household appliances experienced the 
 sharpest slowdown in Q2 growth.  Growth in real 
 disposable income slowed to 3.8 percent growth in the 
 second quarter, compared to the first quarter\'s 5 
 percent growth.  Household debt as a percent of 
 disposable income rose slightly to 54.8 percent 
 (compared to 54 percent last quarter), as consumer 
 spending on durable goods was financed by less 
 expensive credit.   Government consumption rose by 
 3.8 percent in the second quarter, lower than first 
 quarter\'s 4.6 percent growth. 
 
 5.  During Q2, fixed capital formation grew by 10.4 
 percent, led by a 53.8 percent increase in public 
 corporation investment that accounted for 59 percent 
 of the quarterly change.  Private sector investment 
 also showed strong growth, increasing by 5.4 percent, 
 led by mining (especially platinum), agricultural and 
 manufacturing sectors.  Inventories showed especially 
 strong growth in the second quarter rising to 13.6 
 percent compared to first quarter\'s 3.1 percent 
 growth, with most of the inventory growth occurring 
 in the manufacturing sector. 
 
 SECOND QUARTER TRADE BALANCE TURNS NEGATIVE 
 ------------------------------------------- 
 
 6.  After 22 years of consecutive quarterly trade 
 surpluses, South Africa\'s trade balance reached a 
 R5.5 billion deficit.  (Note: trade balance defined 
 as merchandise exports plus net gold exports minus 
 merchandise imports Endnote)  The current account 
 deficit (trade balance adjusted for net service, 
 income, and current transfer payments) widened to 
 R49.3 billion, reaching 3.8 percent of GDP.  However, 
 if imports of oil, aircraft and naval ships were 
 excluded, then the current account deficit would be 
 closer to 1 percent of GDP.  The net inward flow of 
 capital continued in the second quarter with R25.9 
 billion, primarily due to large increases in 
 portfolio investment.  Inflows of foreign direct 
 investment, which had been small but positive since 
 last year, declined in the second quarter to a 
 deficit of R1.8 billion compared to first quarter\'s 
 surplus of R7.8 billion.  The drop in foreign direct 
 investment was due to the sale of half of its Telkom 
 shares by foreign equity partner Thintana in June. 
 
 EXPORTS IMPROVE BUT IMPORTS OVERWHELM 
 ------------------------------------- 
 
 7.  As global growth recovered in the first half of 
 2004, the export sector grew 42.3 percent (q/q) after 
 two consecutive quarters of over 9 percent declines. 
 However a 95.3 percent quarterly growth in imports 
 restrained overall GDP growth.  Second quarter real 
 merchandise exports increased 12.6 percent compared 
 to a 3.6 percent decline during the first quarter. 
 However a 20.5 percent increase in real merchandise 
 imports, due to sharp increases in oil and military 
 equipment, explains the turnaround in the current 
 account trade balance.  Between March 31 and June 20 
 2004, the weighted average rand exchange rate, 
 calculated with reference to a basket of 13 
 currencies, appreciated 2.4 percent, compared to 5.7 
 appreciation between December 31 2003 and March 31 
 2004, and 11 percent appreciation over the first 
 quarter of 2003. The South African Reserve Bank 
 continues to build foreign reserves, hoping to reduce 
 volatility in the rand exchange rate.  The country\'s 
 net international reserves rose by R12.1 billion 
 during Q2, following an increase of R13.4 billion in 
 Q1.  The SARB\'s foreign reserves increased from USD 
 9.8 billion at the end of March to USD 11.9 at the 
 end of August. 
 
 INFLATION AND MONEY SUPPLY ON COURSE 
 ------------------------------------ 
 
 8.  During the second quarter, money supply (M3) 
 increased by 13.3 percent, with overall consumer 
 prices increasing by 2.3 percent.  Consumer price 
 inflation, excluding mortgage costs (CPIX), increased 
 by 5.4 percent, within the Reserve Bank\'s target 
 range of 3 to 6 percent.  Falling import prices 
 caused by the strong rand was the main reason for 
 consumer prices tracking downwards. Unit labor costs 
 increased 5.9 percent (q/q) just within the inflation 
 target.  Both average nominal and real wages 
 increased (9.4 percent and 5.1 percent respectively). 
 Labor productivity increased 3.3 percent. 
 
 COMMENT 
 ------- 
 
 9.  Strong growth in both domestic investment and 
 consumption has improved short-term South African 
 growth.  Rising global demand is fueling growth in 
 manufacturing and mining but the expansion of those 
 sectors will have to rely on continued global growth 
 in order to overcome the negative impact of a strong 
 rand.  The latest government forecast for growth is 
 2.9 percent in 2004 and rising to 3.6 percent in 2005 
 (note: Budget Review 2004).  The 2004 Medium Term 
 Policy Statement to be presented to Parliament at the 
 end of October will probably revise government 
 economic growth forecasts.  While most private 
 economic forecasters expect 2004 growth at 3 percent, 
 the recent Quarterly Bulletin may point to some 
 problems in achieving future growth over 3 percent 
 during the next two quarters.  Both investment and 
 consumption show over 4 percent growth in the second 
 quarter, though their growth has stabilized.  In 
 order to sustain higher GDP growth, South African 
 exports should increase in the face of higher world 
 global demand growth.  South Africa has to rely on 
 strong commodity prices and global demand so that 
 exports can be the future engine of growth.  Recent 
 improvements in labor productivity can be attributed 
 to a 1.7 percent decline in employment, not the best 
 way to increase domestic demand.  Second quarter 
 foreign direct investment outflows will not help in 
 attaining the government\'s stated foreign direct 
 investment inflows of 2 percent of GDP. 
 Deteriorating current account deficits may put 
 pressure on the rand to depreciate; combined with 
 higher oil prices this may lead to higher inflation 
 and possibly interest rate increases.  Inflation 
 prospects for 2004 will depend on food prices, wage 
 negotiations, oil prices and the rand.  The impact on 
 targeted inflation will steer the South African 
 Reserve Bank\'s actions in setting interest rates. 
 End comment.

airplanes are parked can be accessed from several locations: 
 
- One, the Charlie Gate is located near the terminals.  This 
gate controls airport access for airport and airline staff 
reporting to work. 
 
- Two, the North Gate is used as an entrance and exit point 
for normal commercial cargo. 
 
- Three, the \"Super\" South Gate is a multi-lane entrance and 
exit point used to convey valuable cargo.  At this gate a 
variety of additional security resources are used including 
x-ray machines, upright metal detectors, handheld metal 
detectors, and police.  This gate also handles traffic that 
previously traveled via the freight and construction gates 
mentioned below. 
 
- Four, the ATNS gate used by Air Traffic and Navigation 
Services employees. 
 
- Five, an unused freight gate with airside access.  This 
was previously padlocked shut, but has now been welded shut. 
 
- Six, an unused construction gate with airside access. 
This gate was previously padlocked shut, but has now been 
welded shut. 
 
- Seven, private airline hangars.  A controlled access point 
separates these hangars from the airport\'s airside.  An 
unpatrolled fence separates this area from public roads. 
 
- Eight, SAA Technical, a subsidiary of South African 
Airways, maintains, repairs, and tests airplanes.  It has a 
controlled access point separating them from the runways. 
 
- Nine, terminals can be used to access airport runways and 
airplanes.

RECENT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AT JIA 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) official told 
Econoff that on September 5, armed robbers by-passed 
security at the domestic terminal and stole cash from an 
airport restaurant.  The event went unpublicized for a week 
until a local journalist learned of the robbery.  The heist 
is disconcerting because it reveals that armed thieves were 
able to enter the terminal, pass a police post, go up to the 
second level, rob the restaurant, return and drive the one- 
kilometer road off the airport premises without being 
challenged by security. 
 
4.  (SBU) The week of September 18, criminals broke into the 
airport ticket offices of British Airways (BA) and stole a 
safe from the offices of its handling company, Swissport. 
 
5.  (SBU) A senior airline executive told Econoff that on 
September 15, police confronted a suspicious individual 
attempting to enter \"Charlie\" gate using bogus credentials. 
As they questioned the suspect, five of his associates 
opened fire from a nearby vehicle, wounding a police 
officer. 
 
6.  (SBU) On September 16, thieves accessed the runway and 
opened fire on police officers escorting valuable cargo to a 
KLM flight bound for Amsterdam.  Police returned fire, but 
the robbers escaped.  Airport contacts told Post\'s 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officer that there was 
reason to believe the robbers received help from the inside. 
Security officials from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
and the airlines confirmed this with Econoff.  They said 
that a chain securing the unused, airside construction gate 
was left unlocked and was used by the bandits during their 
get-away.  The officials were unsure whether the robbers 
entered the restricted area through the construction gate, 
although one official speculates that they may have gained 
airside access much earlier from a different location.  It 
is unknown whether this incident is connected to the 
September 15 shooting. 
 
7.  (SBU) The same day, a journalist from The Star newspaper 
reported that he was able to pass through a non-functional 
electric fence protecting the airside perimeter. A security 
official at the airport told Econoff that this fence only 
leads to the private hangar area adjacent to airside.  He 
said that the reporter would have had to pass through a 
control point before actually accessing the tarmac. 
 
8.  (U) The journalist also reported that he observed a 
number of other security breaches around the airport.  For 
instance, he saw unattended vehicles parked at the terminal; 
he observed people bypassing X-ray machines and metal 
detectors and accessing the airport\'s \"sterile area\" by 
passing through a door marked \"Goods Only - No Person to 
Pass Here\" despite the presence of a security guard; he 
walked unchallenged through the basement of the terminal 
where he could have potentially accessed the airport\'s power 
supply; he watched a person dressed in an airline uniform 
and carrying a package slip through the automatic exit door 
of the domestic arrivals \"sterile\" area as passengers exited 
despite the presence of security; he noted that the 
automatic exit door from the International Arrivals customs 
was apparently malfunctioning and remained in an open 
position; he drove unchallenged into the \"Perishable Goods 
Cargo\" area, simply waving at the security guard posted 
there; and he reported that he parked outside the airside 
perimeter fence at several prohibited locations without ever 
seeing a security patrol. 
 
--------------------------- 
WHAT\'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT? 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) South African Police Services (SAPS) is leading 
the investigation into these incidents.  An ACSA security 
executive told Econoff that SAPS is close to arresting 
several suspects believed to have been helping from the 
inside.  Director Zuma, the SAPS Commander at JIA, also told 
Post\'s Regional Security Office that SAPS is planning to 
brief diplomatic officials in a meeting being organized by 
the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A date for the meeting 
has not yet been set. 
 
10.  (SBU) Ironically, the incidents come just weeks after 
the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA), South Africa\'s 
airport management firm, announced that it had installed 
1,200 surveillance cameras and spent nearly R53 million 
(about $8 million) on upgrading and replacing fences, 
barriers and access control gates throughout the airport. 
An ACSA official told Econoff that another R60 million will 
be spent by April 2005 to improve intrusion detection of 
JIA\'s 36 km fence, baggage-management systems, biometric and 
control room systems as well as the installation of a 
vehicle number plate recognitions system.  He said that 
during his November 2004 trip to Transportation Security 
Administration facilities in the United States he will be 
looking to purchase proven, off-the-shelf systems in use at 
U.S. airports for immediate implementation at JIA. 
 
11. (SBU) The ACSA official also said that the following 
precautions have been put in place since the KLM incident: 
 
- Increased security staff to 150 guards 24/7. 
 
- The National Intervention Unit (NIU), responsible for all 
medium to high-risk policing, and the Crime Combating Unit 
are escorting valuable cargo to and from aircraft in armored 
police vehicles. 
- NIU and Combating Unit patrolling outer perimeter while 
visible policing guards inside the airport buildings. 
 
- Rapid Response teams have been deployed throughout the 
airport premises. 
 
- Armored vehicles are on the airport premises. 
 
- Increased infrared surveillance. 
 
- The old freight and construction gates have been welded 
shut. 
- Marked and unmarked vehicles are patrolling all entry and 
exit points to the airport. 
 
12.  (SBU) In addition, the official said that 600 new 
police fresh from the academy will be assigned to JIA 
beginning in January 2005.  They are currently being trained 
on aviation security.  Over the next eighteen months a total 
of 1,700 new police officers will replace the three sub- 
contracted security firms currently patrolling the car park, 
the perimeter fence, and at the terminals. 
 
13.  (SBU) The official also told Econoff that he believes 
an \"insider\" is cooperating with journalists to point out 
weaknesses in airport security.  He warned of more negative 
reports on airport security in the short-term, but said they 
represent a minimal threat.

E.O.   12958: N/A 
TAGS: EMIN, EINV, ELAB, EIND, ECON, SF 
SUBJECT: Labor Strikes hit top Platinum Producers 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Strike action by members of the National 
Union of Mineworkers (NUM) began slowly for the top two 
platinum producers in the world as talks with management 
broke down on October 1.  By October 4, NUM had launched a 
full-blown strike against Anglo Platinum (Angloplats) and 
Impala Platinum (Implats), though the firms and union are 
less than two percent apart on their wage demands.  While 
12,000 of 45,000 mineworkers refused to punch in at 
Angloplats, almost all of Implats\' 27,000 mineworkers 
refused to punch in on October 4.  According to press 
reports police injured 22 miners when they fired rubber 
bullets into a crowd of miners at an Implats roadblock on 
October 5.  Angloplats says that only 38% of its workforce 
belongs to NUM and one-third of NUM members actually showed 
up for work on October 4.  Implats maintains that the strike 
will not affect production for ten days, after which, the 
company stands to lose more than $4 million a day in 
operating profits.  Lonmin Platinum (Lonplats), the third 
largest producer of platinum in the world, has not been 
affected.  Still at issue is money.  The unions see high 
company profits and want more.  Other issues, such as an 
increase in the housing allowance, seem to have been largely 
resolved.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Since wage talks began at the beginning of August, 
NUM has moved from its initial demand for a 16% wage 
increase to 9% for Anglo and 8.5% for Impala.  In turn, 
Implats has moved from 6.3% to 7.5%, Angloplats from 4.4% to 
7.25%.  In its previous two-year wage agreement with NUM for 
the years 2002 and 2003, Angloplats agreed to a 9% wage 
increase for each of the two years, something it was 
unprepared to replicate now that inflation is around 5%. 
Implats was surprised by the NUM strike, since it had just 
entering the second year of a two-year wage agreement.  That 
agreement calls for a wage increase of 1.4% over inflation, 
which would give workers an automatic 6.3% increase this 
year.  NUM has rejected both the Angloplats and Implats 
offers as inadequate, pointing to high platinum prices and 
industry profits as justification for a greater share of the 
spoils.  Five other unions have members working at Implats 
and Angloplats, but they have not yet thrown in their lot 
with NUM.  NUM claims that 47,000 workers are on strike, 
while management at Angloplats and Implats claim that fewer 
than 40,000 are on strike. 
 
3. (U) According to \"Platinum 2004,\" a Johnson Matthey 
publication (British-based Johnson Matthey is the world\'s 
leading trader of platinum group metals, and the sole trader 
for Angloplats), South Africa produced 75% of world platinum 
in 2003.  Of that, Angloplats (2.3 million ounces), Impala 
(1 million ounces), and Lonplats (900,000 ounces) accounted 
for two thirds - or more than half of world production. 
Each has invested in major expansion programs.  In addition, 
exports from these three companies accounted for 9% of all 
South African merchandise exports in 2003. 
 
4. (U) South African platinum group metal resources in the 
ground represent more than 85% of the known global resource. 
In addition to platinum, South African mines produce 35% and 
75%, respectively, of global palladium and rhodium.  Other 
group metals, such as iridium, ruthenium, and osmium, are 
less common.  Any disruption in South African production 
should have an immediate effect on world PGM prices. 
Interestingly, during the week of wage negotiations, 
platinum prices actually fell, reflecting a move out of the 
market by some Japanese investors, lower than expected 
Chinese orders, existing inventories, and the price having 
already climbed as investors anticipated the strike.  Prices 
have returned to pre-strike levels.

SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON BEE CHARTER ISSUES

Internet distribution. 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel helped to 
resolve the deadlock over the composition of the Financial 
Services Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Council in a 
September 20 meeting with industry stakeholders.  Banks are 
concerned, however, that community and labor groups, 
excluded from charter negotiations over the past two years, 
will leverage their seats on the BEE Council to review 
scorecard targets and introduce issues of importance to 
them.  The Council will consider whether to approve R122.5 
billion (approximately $18 billion) empowerment financing 
targets in its first meeting to be held the second week of 
October.  A DTI official said that companies will not be 
required to comply with multiple charters.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
FINANCIAL SERVICES BEE COUNCIL SEATS ALLOCATED 
--------------------------------------------- - 
2.  (U) Banks, black business, labor unions and community 
groups failed to reach agreement on how to allocate seats on 
the Financial Services BEE Council after months of 
negotiations.  The primary obstacle preventing an agreement 
was charter language stipulating, \"There will be equality 
between industry association representatives and all others 
on the Charter Council.  The Charter Council must fairly 
reflect the interests of the financial institutions.\"  Banks 
interpreted this to mean that they should hold 50 percent of 
the seats on the Council and were promoting a 16-seat 
council of which 8 would be allocated to financial 
associations. 
 
3.  (SBU) At the request of several banking CEOs, Finance 
Minister Trevor Manuel called a September 20 meeting with 
all industry stakeholders to resolve the deadlock. 
According to a U.S. banking official in South Africa, 
stakeholders were caught off-guard when Manuel presented his 
own plan for distributing 21 seats among the stakeholders. 
After little debate, Manuel\'s plan was accepted.  Of the 21 
seats, four will go to government, four to labor, four to 
community groups, six to the industry, and three to the 
black business body, the Association for Black Securities 
and Investment Professionals (ABSIP).  The government seats 
will include two officials from the National Treasury, one 
from the Department of Trade and Industry, and one from the 
Presidency. 
 
------------------------ 
COUNCIL CONCERNS PERSIST 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Banking Council representative Derek Muller, a 
Nedcor bank executive, said publicly the 21-seat deal was 
not ideal, but a workable model.  He also stated that 
business wants the empowerment financing targets approved in 
the next few weeks.  However, a foreign banking executive 
told Econoff the council was unworkable and the industry has 
been left to fight among itself for its allocated six seats. 
The executive said that each bank is waiting for the others 
to step back and allow the remaining banks to fill the 
seats.  The members of the council should be decided prior 
to the October meeting. 
 
5.  (SBU) Banks are also concerned that community and labor 
groups, excluded from charter negotiations over the past two 
years, will now leverage their seats on the BEE Council to 
review scorecard targets and introduce issues of importance 
to them.  Community representative and South African 
Communist Party General Secretary Blade Nzimande said his 
organization was not happy with some of the proposed 
scorecard targets.  He said that their Council 
representatives would raise these concerns at the Council\'s 
October meeting.  This could lead to further delays in 
rolling out financial services to historically disadvantaged 
individuals (HDI). 
 
7.  (U) The BEE Council will oversee compliance with the 
financial sector charter, including verifying charter points 
for Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) deals and assessing the 
BEE progress of banks and finance companies.  The council 
will hold its first meeting in the second week of October 
and will meet four times a year thereafter.  The agenda for 
the Council\'s first meeting includes electing a chairperson, 
discussing how to provide banking services and increase 
lending to disadvantaged South Africans, and deciding on a 
conflict resolution mechanism when consensus is 
unachievable.  A Banking Council employee told Econoff that 
if the council is unable to decide on a mechanism, Manuel 
would. 
 
------------------------------------- 
EMPOWERMENT FINANCE TARGETS ANNOUNCED 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The council will also review proposed empowerment 
financing targets of R122.5 billion (approximately $18.8 
billion).  In a September 15 meeting at the American Chamber 
of Commerce in South Africa (AmCham), Banking Council GM Cas 
Coovadia explained that nine task groups have been 
evaluating the scorecard\'s financing targets for nearly a 
year.  In June, the task groups presented their findings to 
industry stakeholders and recommended adding R47.5 billion 
to the original target of R75 billion in empowerment 
financing funds.  The money would be distributed over five 
years in the following manner:  (1) R50 billion for black 
empowerment deals; (2) R42 billion for low-cost housing; (3) 
R25 billion for infrastructure products; (4) R4.1 billion 
for small black business; and (5) R1.4 billion for black 
agriculture.  If this target is accepted, it will be the 
largest investment in BEE finance, overtaking the R100 
billion (approximately USD 15.4 billion) committed by the 
mining sector. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
DTI ON MULTI-CHARTER COMPLIANCE QUESTION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Recent comments by Department of Public Works 
Deputy Director-General Lydia Bici fueled speculation that 
institutions may need to comply with multiple charters.  At 
a breakfast hosted by the South African Institute of Black 
Property Practitioners, Bici said that a property charter 
would apply to companies participating in other charters. 
However, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Director of 
BEE Partnerships Jeffrey Ndumo told Econoff that this is not 
the case.  As an example, Ndumo said that a subsidiary of a 
bank that manufactures goods for sale in the ICT sector 
would be required to comply with the ICT Charter.  Likewise, 
a subsidiary of a bank that primarily buys, sells, and 
manages real estate would comply with the Property Charter. 
However, the bank itself would abide with just the Financial 
Services Charter.  He also pointed out that a subsidiary or 
division that just procures goods or services for the parent 
business (e.g., the IT department at ABSA, which has the 
largest IT procurement in the country) would not be required 
to adhere to a different charter.  Ndumo also explained that 
if a business operates across many sectors, it would be 
required to identify its core business and comply with the 
corresponding charter.  Ndumo told Econoff he would be 
willing to answer these types of technical questions for 
U.S. businesses in a forum facilitated by the American 
Chamber of Commerce.

SUBJECT: The South African Motor Industry 
 
 
     1. (U) Summary: In 1995, the Department of Trade and Industry 
     (DTI) introduced the South African Motor Industry Development 
     Program (MIDP) to promote production and exports of locally 
     produced vehicles.  The DTI recently announced that between 
     2005-2006 it would review the MIDP as part of a long-term 
     strategy aimed at the continued growth of the industry.  Since 
     introduction of the MIDP, industry exports have grown at an 
     annual rate of 33%, South Africa has become known as a high- 
     quality niche producer, and a number of international companies 
     have expanded or located production plants here.  Nevertheless, 
     South Africa remains a fringe player in global markets. 
     Exports account for just 0.20% of global demand, and domestic 
     demand accounts for only 0.70% of global production.  South 
     Africa wants to increase its share of global production so as 
     to become a global player.  In December 2002, the government 
     extended the MIDP to 2012, but there are doubts about whether 
     it can or should retain its current form until then.   End 
     Summary. 
 
     The Motor Industry Development Program 
           -------------------------------------- 
     2. (U) In 1995, the Department of Trade and Industry introduced 
     the MIDP to rejuvenate the industry by promoting the local 
     manufacture and export of vehicles.  At the heart of the MIDP 
     is an import-export formula that rewards exports with import 
     duty credits.  Companies get a rebate on import tariffs equal 
     to 100% of the local content value of their exports.  This is 
     supposed to be phased down to 70% in 2009.  Meanwhile, 
     protective import tariffs are supposed to be phased down from 
     40% to 30% in 2007, and 25% in 2012 (completely knocked down 
     components from 30% to 25% in 2007, and 20% in 2012).  Trade 
     rivals describe the MIDP as an export incentive, and question 
     whether it contravenes World Trade Organization rules. 
     Australia, whose own motor industry strategy was partly the 
     model for the MIDP, has been one of the strongest critics. 
     South African and Australian officials have held several rounds 
     of discussions on the MIDP.  Following the round held in 
     Canberra on August 27, 2004, both sides agreed to cooperate 
     during the upcoming review of the MIDP.  Australia will share 
     its experience. 
 
     3. (U) Prior to the initiation of the MIDP, South Africa\'s 
     motor manufacturing industry was in the doldrums.  Vehicle 
     exports numbered only 15,760 units, or 4% of local production. 
     From 1996 to 2002, under the MIDP, exports grew at an average 
     of 33% a year.  In 2002, they represented 31% of total 
     production.  Exports have since leveled off at about 125,000 
     annual units because of the strength of the rand.  The National 
     Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa 
     (NAAMSA) expects export growth to resume its 30% growth 
     trajectory in 2005. 
 
     The Motor Industry 
     ------------------ 
     4. (U) The South African motor industry comprises manufacturers 
     of whole vehicles as well as parts, plus retailers and after- 
     sale maintenance service providers.  Of nineteen major 
     companies, eight are larger manufacturers that produce light 
     and heavy vehicles, and eight are smaller specialist 
     manufacturers that produce commercial/heavy vehicles and 
     components. 
 
     5. (U) In 2003, total local vehicle production was 421,300 
     units, and imports were 87,900 units.  Exports totaled 126,000 
     units (not including sales to the SACU countries), consisting 
     of 114,900 cars and 12,000 light and heavy commercial vehicles, 
     and account for 0.2% of global demand.  NAAMSA projects 2004 
     domestic demand to increase by 13%, and Tony Twine, an 
     independent industry analyst from Econometrix, thinks that 
     total vehicle production could reach a 20-year high of 465,000 
     units for 2004, and grow by a further 13% in 2005. 
 
     6. (U) The industry is important to South Africa as a revenue 
     generator, foreign exchange earner, investor, and employer.  On 
     the strength of exports, the industry has increased its 
     contribution to GDP from 4.9% in 1999 to 6.6% in 2003.  In 
     2003, the industry invested $350 million in the economy.  It 
     earned $22 billion in income from domestic activities, $3 
     billion from built-up vehicle exports, and $3.5 billion from 
     component exports.  Fuel industry income (net of taxes) added 
     another $14 billion.  Employment in the industry exceeded 
     300,000, with the manufacturing and retail sectors employing 
     112,000 and 194,000, respectively. 
 
     Niche Player 
           ------------ 
     7. (U) According to Twine, speaking to a breakfast meeting in 
     Johannesburg on September 9, the South African motor industry 
     is not a mass producer of vehicles or components.  Rather, it 
     is a competitive niche producer of certain vehicle models and 
     specialized components.  There is growing international 
     reliance on South Africa to produce cars and commercial 
     vehicles for right-hand-drive countries, engines and components 
     for specific cars such as the VW Golf, and specific models such 
     as the BMW 300 series and the C-class Mercedes Benz for export. 
 
     8. (U) Twine said that he did not believe that the South 
     African motor industry could establish a \"home-grown\" industry. 
     There was too much global competition and excess capacity for 
     such a strategy to succeed.  However, he felt that South Africa 
     was on the way to becoming a more important niche player. 
     Future success depended on the ability of local industry to 
     navigate a competitive course by capitalizing on new niche 
     markets (such as hybrid vehicles) and new technology (such as 
     fuel cells), which offered opportunities for growth through 
     innovation.  Twine reckoned that South Africa would have to 
     produce over 2 million vehicles annually (roughly 4% of world 
     production) to become a global player -- even as a niche 
     producer.  He estimated that South Africa was more than 10% of 
     the way to reaching this goal. 
 
     South Africa as an Investment Location 
     -------------------------------------- 
     9. (U) Twine believes that international motor companies were 
     attracted to South Africa for a number of reasons: 1) South 
     Africa\'s relatively advanced economy and infrastructure were 
     conducive to supporting a sophisticated, mature industry; 2) 
     the availability of a sufficiently skilled work force; 3) an 
     existing local supply and support services industry 4) a 
     comparative advantage in raw material supply; 5) an emerging 
     market and the potential to grow with the black middle class in 
     South Africa and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.  He noted 
     that while the black middle class market-share had increased to 
     31% in South Africa, other sub-Saharan markets had not yet 
     materialized.  Currently, the Southern African Customs Union 
     (SACU) countries (which include South Africa, Botswana, 
     Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland) account for more than 70% of 
     the sub-Saharan market. 
 
     10. (U) On potential threats to the South African motor 
     industry, Twine thought that an economic slow-down in either 
     India or China would cause companies there to export excess 
     production to places like South Africa, where production costs 
     were twice as high.  He pointed out that although local 
     industry was partially integrated into global manufacturing 
     networks, it was still a minor player, with most decisions made 
     in boardrooms overseas.  This meant that South Africa was 
     especially vulnerable to a variety of external events. 
 
     11. (U) Twine cited possible government intervention in the 
     areas of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and pricing as a risk 
     factor for the industry that would negatively affect foreign 
     investors.  For example, if BEE policies were to require 
     foreign-owned firms to sell equity to local BEE partners, those 
     local partners might have difficulty ponying up $30-50 million 
     for model retooling every five to seven years.  This could mean 
     that foreign auto manufacturers might have to constantly search 
     for new BEE investors to maintain a minimum BEE share ratio. 
     To date, however, there is no BEE charter for the motor 
     industry, but it is in the works.  Another sensitive point 
     would be if parent companies had to share the profits with 
     their new BEE partners, even after having incurred most of the 
     investment risks up front.  Twine also noted labor hostility to 
     the industry as a negative factor, based as it is on union 
     misperception that the South African auto industry is vital to 
     multinational parent companies. 
 
     12. (U) DTI Director of BEE Partnerships Jeffrey Ndumo has 
     indicated that auto manufacturers will have latitude in 
     pursuing either enterprise charters or a sectoral charter.  DTI 
     does not have a preference of either way.  Ndumo said that if 
     the auto manufactures pursue a sectoral charter, DTI is 
     encouraging them to frame it as a set of broad guidelines that 
     would include the components market as well.  Ndumo said DTI 
     was sensitive to the issue of selling equity for auto 
     manufactures and was encouraging them to find a \"creative\" 
     solution to satisfy equity requirements.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN APPAREL INDUSTRY -- STRUGGLING 
TO BE COMPETITIVE 
 
REF: PRETORIA 4428 
 
1.   Summary. The South African apparel industry is struggling 
because of increased imports, mostly from China, and a 
decrease in exports.  The attractiveness of low-priced quality 
merchandise from China combined with the effects of the 
stronger rand is hurting its ability to compete.  Total 
imports into the United States of South African apparel 
declined by 43.6% and textiles by 5.7% during the first seven 
months of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.  The 
subtotal of AGOA textiles and apparel imports has also started 
to decrease.  Industry expects that the expiration of apparel 
quotas will make the situation even more difficult.  Labour 
unions and industry are calling on the South African 
government for help. End summary. 
 
2.  A leading representative of South African clothing 
exporters told econ officers on October 7 about the industry\'s 
difficulties in remaining competitive in both local and 
foreign markets.  He said SA Statistics indicated apparel 
imports from China had increased from 123 million garments in 
2002 to 235 million garments in 2003.  He could not be sure 
that all of this increase was actually staying in South Africa 
or going to other countries in the region, but there was no 
question that the increase in Chinese apparel imports was 
huge.  He acknowledged that most of the competition from China 
was legitimate in the sense that that country was producing 
good quality clothing at low prices.  He also cited the strong 
rand as having a major negative impact on the SA apparel 
industry\'s competitiveness. 
 
3.  According to the United States International Trade 
Commission data, the total value of South African apparel and 
textiles exports to the United States fell by 43.6% (apparel) 
and 5.7% (textiles) during the first seven months of 2004 
compared to the same period in 2003.  U.S. imports of South 
African apparel exports amounted to $142.9 million in the 
first seven months of 2003 but declined to only $80.7 million 
for the same period in 2004.  AGOA apparel also decreased from 
$69 million to $63.9 million during this period, representing 
a decrease of 7%.  Textile exports amounted to $19.8 in the 
first seven months of 2004, down from $21 million for the same 
period in 2003. 
 
4.  The Textile Federation of South Africa regards the 
strength of the local currency as the main reason for the 
decline in apparel export values to the US.  The rand 
appreciated by 29% against the dollar between January 2003 and 
July 2004. It traded on average at R8.68 to the dollar in 
January 2003 but appreciated to R6.13/$1 in July 2004. The 
president of the Textile Federation of South Africa lamented 
that no textile or clothing firm in the world can compete in 
an environment where a currency appreciated by such an extent 
against the dollar. 
 
5. The strength of the rand has reduced earnings from exports 
as well as the industry\'s ability to price its products 
competitively in world markets. This has resulted in a loss of 
market share to other exporting countries. Both industry and 
labor argue that the rand should trade between R9 and R10 to 
the dollar in order to ensure the competitiveness of the local 
industry in international markets. 
 
6. The South African Textile Federation also bemoan the strong 
rand as largely responsible for the increased apparel imports, 
especially from Asian countries.  It said that China has 
increased its share in clothing imports into South Africa from 
27% in 1996 to 86% so far in 2004.  The South African textile 
industry complains that the low production costs in China and 
other Asian countries makes it difficult for domestic 
companies to compete.  It further charges that manufacturers 
in Asia get such enormous support from their governments that 
the only real cost they experience is labor, which is about 
one-tenth of the South African textile industry average. The 
reduction of import protection and inflow of illegal clothing 
imports exacerbates the negative effect of cheap imports.  As 
a result, many local manufacturers have had to prune their 
operations, incurring closure and retrenchment costs. 
7. The Textile Federation of South Africa predicts that the 
expiration of textiles and apparel quotas under the World trade 
Organization\'s (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) on 
January 1, 2005 will result in a substantial increase in the world 
market share for Asian countries, and worsen the already 
depressing situation.  Both the trade union movement and the 
apparel industry have expressed fears that importers in Canada, 
the United States and the EU will move to import cheaper goods 
from China rather than from South Africa.  China\'s textile 
industry is enormous compared to the South African industry. In 
terms of world-installed capacities for spinning and weaving, 
South Africa represents only 1% of that of China. 
 
8. Labor unions are lobbying the government to intervene and 
postpone the scrapping of China\'s export quotas, but also to 
support the depreciation of the rand. The domestic industry is 
trying to rescue itself by implementing measures such as the 
\"Buy South African\" campaign, which encourages manufacturers 
to source 50% of products locally. Industry is also putting 
increasing pressure on retail chains to sell locally produced 
clothing. The industry and trade unions have formed a task 
team to advise government on the impact of tariffs and quotas 
on the textile and clothing industry.  They may recommend that 
the government consider such measures as voluntary restraint 
and various co-operative safeguard mechanisms in order to 
protect local industries from Chinese and other competitors. 
 
9.  According to South African industry sources, the South 
African government has told them it will not push for a re- 
negotiation of the demise of the ACT in Geneva because \"a deal 
is a deal.\"

 SEPTEMBER MOTOR VEHICLES CONTINUE HIGH GROWTH 
 --------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 2.  Encouraged by a 2003 5.5 percent reduction in 
 interest rates and an additional mid-August 2004 0.5 
 percentage point reduction, new car sales should post 
 a record sales year.  According to the National 
 Association of Automobile Manufacturers (NAAMSA), 
 September sales of motor vehicles increased by 22.7 
 percent (y/y), the second highest monthly increase on 
 record.  New car sales increased 21.2 percent in 
 September, with 1,164 new passenger cars being sold 
 per day compared to August\'s daily average of 1,117 
 and 961 in September 2003.  Compared to September 
 2003, year-to-date sales have been 20 percent higher. 
 Medium and heavy commercial vehicles also posted 
 strong year-to-date growth at 18.9 percent.  Nico 
 Vermeulen, NAAMSA\'s director, expects that 2004 new 
 vehicle sales should reach an all-time record of 
 455,000 vehicles.  Note Business Report, October 5; 
 Standard Bank Motor Alert, October 4 Endnote 
 
 TRADE CONDITIONS STILL UPBEAT 
 ----------------------------- 
 
 3.    Both the South African Trade Management Indices 
 and the South African Chamber of Commerce business 
 confidence index still indicate positive growth 
 expectations in the near future.  The South African 
 Trade Management Indices, measuring both trade 
 activity and expectations, indicate that September\'s 
 activity and short-run expectations are roughly the 
 same as August\'s and still positive.  The trade 
 activity index measures the monthly trading 
 conditions, while the trade expectations describes 
 expected activity in the next six months.  Eight 
 components (sales volumes, new orders, order backlog, 
 supplier deliveries, inventories, selling prices, 
 purchasing prices and employment) make up both the 
 trade activity and expectations indices.  September\'s 
 total trading activity index registered at the 
 threshold value of 50:  above (below) which trading 
 conditions have improved (deteriorated).  All 
 components but employment improved in September, 
 implying that no new jobs were created in September. 
 Since the beginning of this survey in 2000, the 
 employment sub-component has rarely exceeded 50, 
 confirming the endemic unemployment prevalent in 
 South Africa.  The survey shows that inflation 
 (selling prices) remained neutral (at 51 compared to 
 49 in August); however input purchasing prices keep 
 showing substantial increases (59 compared to 
 August\'s 57).  Over the next six months, the 
 September trade expectations index supports a 
 continued optimistic sales forecast at 63 (compared 
 to August\'s 64) with all but one components 
 registering above 50.  Sales volumes and new orders 
 show the highest expectations of increasing over the 
 next six months, in line with increasing economic 
 growth later in 2004.  The South African Chamber of 
 Business\'s (SACOB) business confidence index 
 increased 3.1 points in September to 130.9 with eight 
 of its 13 components improving in September.  The 
 index reached its highest level in September, with 
 inflation and interest rates relatively low and the 
 rand more stable in September.  Note Business Day,

 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES STRONG BUT LEVELING 
 --------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 4.  According to data collected from the Deeds 
 Office, house prices may have slowed in Q2 2004, but 
 this data is often revised substantially and the 
 slowdown in housing prices will need confirmation by 
 other sources.  National housing prices, both nominal 
 and real, are increasing at a record level of over 30 
 percent, as measured using a three-month moving 
 average.  However, recent increases have leveled off. 
 Prices for housing financed by Standard Bank 
 (including mortgages with assessment values up to R1 
 million or $154,000) seem to show the same leveling- 
 off trend, with prices increasing 20 percent over the 
 past three months.  The prices of existing houses 
 have increased substantially more than new homes. 
 The national affordability index, based on 
 installment to income ratio (calculated as mortgage 
 payments using the median national house price and 
 the prime rate, over per capita disposable income), 
 is still relatively low compared to the 1990s.  Note 
 Business Report, October 6; Standard Bank Residential 
 Property Note, October 5 Endnote 
 
 INCREASED FUNDING TO FINANCE BEE FINANCE CHARTER 
 --------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 5.  Banks, life insurers and pensions will commit 
 R122.5 billion (USD19 billion, using 6.5 rands per 
 dollar) over five years to fund black economic 
 empowerment (BEE) in SA.  If accepted at the first 
 charter council meeting next week, finance companies 
 will invest 60 percent more money than the R75 
 billion earmarked when the charter was signed a year 
 ago.  This will also be the largest single investment 
 in empowerment finance, more than the R100 billion 
 committed by mining companies and the R10 billion set 
 aside by government.  This R122.5 billion is 
 allocated into five areas:  (1) R50 billion for black 
 empowerment deals; (2) R42 billion to provide 
 financing for low-cost housing; (3) R25 billion to 
 finance infrastructure projects in rural areas; (4) 
 R4.1 billion for small black business; and (5) R1.4 
 billion for financing black agriculture.  The charter 
 was launched in 2003, but announcements of financial 
 sector targets were delayed because of disagreements 
 between the Banking Council, representing South 
 Africa\'s banks, and the Association of Black 
 Securities and Investment Professionals.  Companies 
 will be expected to provide a portion of the R122.5 
 billion according to market share of investable 
 assets.  REFTEL PRETORIA 4503 Note Business Day,

 RESERVE BANK ISSUES FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW 
 --------------------------------------------- - 
 
 6.  The South African Reserve Bank issued its 
 biannual Financial Stability Review, highlighting 
 inflation and financial risks facing South Africa, 
 one week before the Monetary Policy Committee meets 
 (October 14) to decide whether interest rates should 
 be changed.  Increasing oil prices presented the 
 largest risk to inflation and global economic 
 recovery.  A strong rand has cushioned South Africa 
 from much of the effects of higher oil prices, 
 although the rand has depreciated 1.1 percent in 
 September and domestic gasoline prices have risen 37 
 rand cents per liter since August.  The review also 
 highlighted the importance of providing banking 
 services to the two-thirds of South Africans who do 
 not have banking accounts, but urged that the adopted 
 policies be well conceived.  \"Unsound policy 
 decisions or financial sector initiatives to broaden 
 access have the potential of posing a threat to the 
 integrity of the formal financial sector.\"  Note

 SOUTH AFRICA DROPS IN GLOBAL INVESTMENT RANKINGS 
 --------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 7.  The 2004 annual AT Kearney Foreign Policy 
 globalization index ranked South Africa 49th out of 
 62 countries as a destination for foreign investment, 
 a drop of 11 places and behind Botswana, Nigeria and 
 Uganda.  The countries surveyed in 2002 account for 
 96 percent of the world\'s gross domestic product and 
 84 percent of the population.  South Africa ranked 
 low in the personal contact category, which includes 
 cross-border communications, because of the high cost 
 of international telecommunications and the low 
 levels of remittance and personal transfers. 
 Internet usage is ahead other African countries, but 
 below most other developed countries.  Tourism, 
 political engagement, and technological integration 
 were areas where South Africa ranked between 35 and 
 37 on the scale.  Note This Day, October 7 Endnote 
 
 CABINET RECOMMENTS PUBLISHED ADMINISTERED PRICE INDEX 
 --------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 8.  The cabinet recommended that Statistics SA 
 (StatsSA) monitor and publish its administered price 
 index on a monthly basis.  StatsSA estimates that 
 increases in prices regulated by the government 
 account for 16 percent of overall consumer prices and 
 18 percent of consumer prices when mortgage payments 
 are omitted.  Prices that are set by the government 
 include water, electricity, paraffin, gasoline, 
 public hospitals charges, freight, telephone calls 
 and postage.  StatsSA has proposed two approaches to 
 compiling the index, one limited to prices actually 
 set by government and the other including VAT and TV 
 license fees.  For the latest monthly price release, 
 StatsSA included administered prices (regulated by 
 both government and state-owned enterprises) and 
 found that they rose by more than the targeted 
 inflation range of 3 to 6 percent.  During August, 
 StatsSA estimated that administered prices using CPIX 
 (excluding mortgages) increased by 6.3 percent while 
 administered prices in overall consumer prices 
 increased 6.8 percent.  The cabinet agreed that price 
 setting should take into account inflation targets, 
 as well as efficiency, equity objectives and long-run 
 demand and supply projections.  Note Business Day, 
 This Day, October 7 Endnote 
 
 JULY RETAIL SALES INCREASE BY 15.5 PERCENT 
 ------------------------------------------ 
 
 9.  On an annual basis, retail sales grew by 15.5 
 percent, showing the underlying strength in consumer 
 demand that is driving South African economic growth. 
 Adjusted for inflation, retail sales increased by 
 11.7 percent in July.  Consumers continued to take on 
 new debt as the private sector credit extension 
 increased by 6 percent in July, in addition to an 
 11.3 percent increase in money supply.  So far, the 
 strong rand has shielded the economy from 
 inflationary pressures, allowing the Reserve Bank to 
 cut interest rates in August.  Whether the Reserve 
 Bank will cut interest rates at next week\'s Monetary 
 Policy Committee meeting will depend on its view of 
 future oil prices and wage settlements.  Note

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA LAUNCHES NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE 
RESPONSE STRATEGY 
 
 
1. Summary and introduction. Following Cabinet\'s approval on 
October 6, the Department of Environmental Affairs and 
Tourism (DEAT) on October 7 formally launched South Africa\'s 
climate change response strategy.  At the launch event, 
officials noted the urgency with which Cabinet views 
responding to climate change.  The cross-cutting strategy 
involves many government departments and provides a 
\"framework for action.\"  Departments are developing, or must 
soon develop, detailed plans for action and implementation 
of the climate change response strategy, although the 
strategy sets no deadlines.  The strategy balances climate 
change response with practical considerations such as 
ensuring sustainable economic growth and using locally 
available resources like coal.  End summary and 
introduction. 
 
2. DEAT Director-General Dr. Crispian Olver opened the 
presentations with an explanation of the impact of climate 
change and areas of vulnerability for South Africa.  He 
noted the negative environmental and other implications --on 
water supply, agriculture/forestry, biodiversity and human 
health-- from climate change.  He also stressed economic 
challenges the country faces in addressing climate change, 
in light of its heavy reliance on cheap electric power from 
low-grade coal-fired plants.  Dr. Olver noted that although 
South Africa contributes only 1.7 percent of global 
greenhouse gas emissions (number 15 in the world), it has a 
higher level on a per capita basis, and its rate of growth 
of GHG emissions is 5 percent per annum, so that in 15 years 
or so the level of emissions will double.  Olver also noted 
mitigation efforts underway or planned for a number of 
sectors, such as transport, coal mining, agriculture, along 
with the Department of Minerals and Energy (DME)\'s efforts 
to implement a White Paper on Renewable Energy and an Energy 
Efficiency Strategy. 
 
3. Dr. Olver described the implementing actions that 
different departments of government will undertake in 
support of the climate change response strategy.  DEAT 
intends to optimize waste management to minimize GHG 
emissions, to finalize air quality legislation, to put into 
place a national ambient monitoring network and information 
handling system that incorporates GHG data, and to develop 
protection plans for plant, animal and marine biodiversity. 
 
4. The Departments of Water Affairs & Forestry, Agriculture, 
Health, Transportation, Trade & Industry, Science & 
Technology and the Treasury all will be actively involved in 
implementing the strategy.  The other key partner in the 
strategy is the Department of Minerals and Energy, which was 
represented at the launch by Dr. Rod Crompton, Deputy 
Director General for Energy. 
 
5. Dr. Crompton noted a number of DME activities and policy 
initiatives underway, including: improving energy supply 
diversity by developing natural gas; establishing targets 
for renewable energy; tapping Global Environment Facility 
and World Bank funding to facilitate and subsidize renewable 
energy; reducing sulfur content in diesel fuel and requiring 
gasoline to be unleaded by 2006; and offering a low-smoke 
home cooking fuel program at the community level. At the 
international level, Crompton noted South Africa\'s 
participation in the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum 
and the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy 
initiatives. 
 
6. Representatives of industry and civil society also made 
brief statements at the launch.  Dr. John Kilani, Vice 
President for Sustainable Development of African Rainbow 
Minerals Limited and Chair of South Africa\'s Executive Board 
on the CDM (Clean Development Mechanism).  Dr. Kilani noted 
that business appreciated the government\'s efforts on 
climate change.  He encouraged South Africa to move quickly 
on CDM activities because other countries such as Brazil, 
India and China are far ahead. 
 
7. Erin Lorimer, representing the Climate Change Action 
Network, a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
welcomed the strategy and the government\'s multi-agency 
approach.  She also said the NGO community hoped to see more 
details of implementation plans soon, as the strategy was 
very vague and gave no timeframes for implementation.  Ms. 
Lorimer also noted that government renewable energy targets 
were too low.  She encouraged the government to focus on the 
social and economic benefits that climate change response 
can generate, by stimulating new economic sectors and 
industries. 
 
8. In closing comments, Deputy Minister of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism Rejoice Mabudafhasi emphasized the 
importance of raising public awareness on climate change and 
building capacity to support the strategy.  Speaking on \"the 
way forward,\" DEAT Deputy Director General Joanne Yawitch 
noted that the National Committee on Climate Change, 
comprised of government and stakeholders, will help advance 
the strategy.  Anticipating Russia\'s ratification and the 
entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, South Africa needs 
to be prepared for intensified action on climate change and 
possible new targets for developing countries. 
 
9. A question-and-answer period was dominated by queries and 
concerns about DME\'s implementation of the Clean Development 
Mechanism.  Dr. Crompton noted that DME intends to work with 
the Development Bank of South Africa to offer a \"hand- 
holding\" mechanism to assist interested parties to develop 
CDM projects. 
 
10. Post will forward a copy of the Climate Change Response 
Strategy to OES/EGC.  Note: A long-term technical adviser 
funded under the USAID-DEAT bilateral drafted the initial 
version of the strategy in 2002.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY. Minister of Trade and Industry Mandisi 
Mpahlwa reviewed the economic and social rationale for BEE 
and said that empowerment would contribute to economic 
growth during a September 30 breakfast briefing.  Mpahlwa 
said that Codes of Good Practice regulating rating agencies 
were imminent and that he was creating a new list of 
proposed candidates for the BEE Advisory Council.  The 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is updating the 
Preferential Procurement Act and regulations to place more 
emphasis on the achievement of social (BEE) goals.  Mpahlwa 
recognized the contribution of U.S. business in the 1970s 
and 1980s to the development of black professionals through 
implementation of the Sullivan Principles.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) In a September 30 breakfast briefing at the American 
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa (AmCham), the Department 
of Trade and Industry (DTI) Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa spoke 
about Black Economic Empowerment (BEE).  DTI is the lead 
government agency on BEE policy and is statutorily 
responsible for providing the government\'s seal of approval 
to industry charters. 
 
------------------------------ 
MINISTER REVIEWS BEE RATIONALE 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U) Mpahlwa pointed to the historical denial of economic 
opportunity and \"systematic oppression\" of South Africa\'s 
previous landless black majority as the economic and social 
rationale for BEE.  The Minister said that despite 
significant progress over the past ten years in establishing 
a strong macro-economic policy and legislative framework to 
combat the legacy of apartheid, a lack of access to finance 
through much of the 1990s stifled development of black 
business. 
 
------------------------ 
BEE WILL GENERATE GROWTH 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Mpahlwa said that BEE was part of South Africa\'s 
growth strategy and added that economic expansion will 
sustain the implementation of BEE.  Mpahlwa said that 
industry empowerment charters and scorecards promote a 
general approach to empowerment that is broad-based.  He 
acknowledged the corporate process that prevents local 
representatives of foreign firms from making key decisions 
and said that multinational companies should be recognized 
for their work in other BEE criteria if the local entity 
cannot sell equity.  Mpahlwa pointed to the Financial 
Services Charter as an example of this.  (COMMENT: The 
Minister\'s comment in this regard provides hope for the 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector where 
the current version of the Charter indirectly penalizes 
firms exempted from the sale of equity. END COMMENT). 
 
5.  (U) Mpahlwa told the audience that members of the 
Presidential International Advisory Council (PIAC) raised 
concerns about the ICT Charter process in a recent meeting 
with President Mbeki.  Mpahlwa said that the President 
promised to look \"seriously\" at the issues causing concern 
to business, which includes ICT Charter provisions on the 
sale and scoring of equity. 
 
---------------------- 
CODES OF GOOD PRACTICE 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Responding to a question on accrediting agencies, 
DTI Deputy Director-General Lionel October said that the 
Government is concerned with the proliferation of rating 
agencies and the high fees they charge to measure company 
compliance with the sector scorecard.  October said that the 
Government does not think these high costs are appropriate 
and that DTI is looking at an accreditation system and 
evaluating a fee structure.  (NOTE: DTI\'s Codes of Good 
Practice will address these issues.  Local business 
companies expected the Codes to be released this summer, but 
the Minister said he had not yet reviewed them.  He said he 
was scheduled to review them on October 3. END NOTE). 
 
-------------------- 
BEE ADVISORY COUNCIL 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Mpahlwa discussed the status of the National BEE 
Advisory Council, which has yet to be formed.  He said that 
he was busy compiling a new list of proposed candidates for 
the Advisory Council.  Another DTI official had previously 
told Econoff that Mbeki refused the first list of candidates 
because it was dominated by the BEE \"elite,\" politically 
connected businesspeople who have won a majority of the 
empowerment deals.  The official said that Mbeki had called 
for greater representation from the provinces and industry. 
 
------------------------------------ 
PREFERENTIAL PROCUREMENT ACT AND BEE 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (SBU) Mpahlwa said that the DTI is in the process of 
updating the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 
of 2000 to bring it more in line with BEE objectives.  The 
Preferential Procurement Act and its regulations govern the 
tender process for state-owned entities.  Currently, a bid 
for a government tender valued at over R500,000 (about 
$77,000) is judged 90 percent on its price and just 10 
percent for the bidding company\'s achievement of specified 
social development goals (e.g., (sub)contracting with 
historically disadvantaged individuals (HDI), promoting 
South African enterprises, promoting exports to create jobs, 
promoting Small Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs), 
developing human resources and skills, uplifting 
communities, etc.).  Bids for government tenders valued at 
less than R500,000 are judged 80 percent on price and 20 
percent on achievement of social goals.  A DTI official 
involved in the process told Econoff that the 90/10, 80/20 
gaps would be reduced, placing a stronger emphasis on a 
bidder\'s achievement of BEE objectives.  He said that a 
review of the Preferential Procurement regulations is 
currently underway, which will be followed by an amendment 
to the Preferential Procurement Act. 
 
--------------------------- 
KUDOS TO U.S. FIRMS 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) The Minister concluded his remarks by thanking 
American companies for providing economic opportunities to 
black professionals in the 1970s and 1980s through their 
implementation of the Sullivan Principles.  He specifically 
singled out IBM and SA Breweries for their contributions 
during that time.

1. (SBU)  Summary:    S/P consultations in South Africa 
October 6-10, 2004 confirmed strong public and private 
sector support for NEPAD, due largely to Presidents Mbeki 
and Obasanjo\'s strong leadership.  Expecting legal status as 
an African Union (AU) entity, the NEPAD Secretariat was 
optimistic, including about the related African peer review 
(APR) process, but curious about potential impact on NEPAD 
of UK Prime Minister Blair\'s Africa Commission.  Most 
interlocutors stressed the importance of capacity building 
and encouraged USG engagement with NEPAD but differed on the 
nature of threats to moderate Islam in Africa.  Prominent 
intellectuals warned that developed and developing countries 
must bridge the policy divide that, on one hand, contributes 
to widespread anti-Americanism in Africa, notably a 
perceived emphasis on antiterrorism to the exclusion of 
Africa\'s development concerns, and, on the other, failure to 
hold African countries accountable on human rights and good 
governance issues. Business representatives were generally 
positive about NEPAD\'s prospects and opined that NEPAD\'s 
failure would have serious consequences for the continent. 
End summary. 
 
CONSULTATIONS IN PRETORIA AND JOHANNESBURG 
 
2. (SBU)  S/P Deputy Director Ambassador Perina and Africa 
Specialist James conducted an October 6-10, 2004 fact- 
finding mission to South Africa on institution building in 
Africa, notably the African Union\'s (AU) New Partnership for 
Africa\'s Development (NEPAD), and Islam in Africa.  On 
October 6-7 meetings in Pretoria and Johannesburg included 
officials in the South African Government (SAG), NEPAD 
Secretariat, academicians, think tanks, and NEPAD Business 
 
SIPDIS 
Forum.   The team met with the Ambassador and DCM and 
received a briefing by POL, ECON and USAID officers.   The 
Ambassador welcomed the focus on USG support for institution 
building in Africa, highlighting the AU\'s strategic role. 
The Ambassador stressed the importance of working with the 
Africans and of publicizing our positive interest and track 
record to counterbalance misrepresentations in the media. 
She expected the South Africans to respond well to a USG/AU 
policy dialogue.  PolCounselor Brown and Pol/EconOff Walser 
in Pretoria and Cape Town (see septel) were control 
officers, respectively. 
 
///SAG LEADERSHIP ROLE IN NEPAD/// 
 
3. (SBU)  Perina explained S/P\'s policy coordinating role 
and focus of this mission (interest in dialogue on NEPAD, 
its major challenges, potential USG support for NEPAD, and 
perceived anti-Americanism in Muslim communities in Africa) 
in meetings with the SAG DFA Deputy Director General for 
Africa Ambassador Mamabola and Chief Director for 
Multilateral Affairs Ambassador Duarte.   Both highlighted 
Mbeki and Obasanjo\'s leadership in spearheading NEPAD\'s 
creation to address Africa\'s development problems.  Mamabola 
also cited Algeria, Senegal and Ethiopia as \"core group\" 
NEPAD supporters.  He said Africa\'s own contribution to 
NEPAD and conflict resolution efforts were primary focus, 
before seeking external assistance, although he hoped for 
USG support in moving NEPAD forward in the G-8.  Mamabola 
also highlighted the importance of strengthening the Peace 
and Security Council (PSC), Court of Justice, Pan African 
Parliament (PAP), and a voluntary, non-punitive Africa Peer 
Review Mechanism (APRM) to foster good governance \"based on 
African standards,\" not those of the US, UK, or the West 
generally.   A late October evaluation will monitor results 
to date.  Mamabola said that the SAG was looking carefully 
at UK PM Blair\'s Africa Commission, which appeared to 
duplicate the G-8 action plan itself.  Perina noted that 
NEPAD success would attract support. 
 
///NEPAD/// 
 
4. (SBU)  Duarte explained the planning process that 
eventually transformed the OAU to the AU, moving beyond 
\"resolutions\" to an \"instrument\" that could independently 
field Africa\'s own peacekeeping troops.  She said, \"NEPAD 
was located in the diversity of 53 states,\" including North 
Africa, which recently has identified with Sub-Saharan 
Africa.  The Challenge, in her view, was to implement AU 
directives and harmonize 17 overlapping regional 
organizations as NEPAD vehicles.  Duarte contended that a 
policy must allow each to remain independent but cooperative 
on trade and defense issues.  SAG views peace and stability 
as absolute prerequisites, the basic assumption for the 
African common defense policy of 2003.  She listed goals 
achieved to date:  positive role in conflict resolution in 
Burundi and DRC, plans for creation of an African standby 
force and a unified SADC position at DOHA.  The current 
strength of leadership binds NEPAD, but the goal, she said, 
was to find a continent-wide element for success that would 
be lasting but not treaty-based. 
 
5. (SBU)  Sudan/DRC:  Duarte noted two objectives in Sudan: 
keep the Government of Sudan (GOS) on board as a negotiating 
partner; otherwise the country will be split, and encourage 
the GOS to develop Darfur, the Upper Nile and other deprived 
areas.  There are currently 410 military observers in 
Darfur, she stated.  Major goals include: disarmament and 
return of people to their villages and fields to farm, 
otherwise starvation will result.  A SAG Public Service 
Administration official noted SAG assistance to develop a 
post conflict reconstruction plan for DRC.  Perina advised 
of a new State Department Office on Coordination for 
Reconstruction and Stabilization to assist with post 
conflict events.  Duarte expressed interest in this office 
given NEPAD interest in post conflict \"peace management.\" 
She noted an October 13-15 NEPAD peace and security workshop 
on post conflict reconstruction in Johannesburg to be 
attended by representatives at the ambassadorial level of 
the heads of state steering committee and partners.  Over 
the next thee years, NEPAD\'s status will be regularized as a 
legal AU entity.  The Secretariat will likely remain in 
South Africa. 
 
6. (SBU)  SAG Message to USG policymakers:  Duarte 
encouraged assistance with development and urged the USG to 
view the APRM as a non-punitive, long-term investment.  She 
noted that partnership with the USG is very important and 
asked about potential regional cooperation.  She also noted 
an equal commitment to stop terrorism as manifested by 
African participation in an October 15 meeting to 
assist/assess Africa\'s own counterterrorism efforts to date. 
 
///OPTIMISTIC NEPAD SECRETARIAT/// 
 
7. (SBU)  NEPAD Secretariat Multilateral Relations Director 
Sudir Chuckun noted strong support from the Germans (for 
APRM), Belgium, Dutch and Nordic countries and contact with 
USAID on specific projects.  The UN agencies also have a 
\"cluster system\" operating in Africa around NEPAD, which he 
described as a socio-economic program of the AU that as yet 
had no legal basis.  A 20-member (5 original plus 15 
members) NEPAD Implementing Committee is a subgrouping under 
the HSGIC (Heads of State and Government Implementation 
Committee), supported by a 45-person Secretariat in Midrand, 
South Africa.  A NEPAD strategic plan is in process.  He 
encouraged life-of-project funding and a more profound 
engagement on policy with the USG, particularly on trade, 
market access, and public administration and governance 
issues. 
 
8. (SBU)  Chief Economist Jahed welcomed USG interest in 
NEPAD.  Developing the regional economic commissions (REC) 
as key NEPAD building blocks is a major goal. Focus is on 
capacity building, not funding.  He said 23 countries have 
acceded to APRM, a voluntary peer pressure process under 
NEPAD to foster good governance and accountability. 
Strategic issues include:  debt, market access, corruption, 
building internal regional trade, developing an early 
warning system and post conflict reconstruction.  A private 
sector unit exists.  The African Business Round Table works 
with the NEPAD business groups in South Africa, Kenya, 
Swaziland, Lesotho, and Zambia.  Outside SA, the focus is on 
SMEs.  The groups will play a supportive role, according to 
Jahed, along with other partners (OECD, ADB, Commonwealth 
Business Council, etc.).  There is an advisor on 
gender/women and others planned for labor and civil society 
issues. 
 
9. (SBU)  NEPAD Secretariat message for USG policymakers: 
It is important to engage with NEPAD; evaluate ODA and 
quality of support; and support G-8 forum key issues. It 
would have been useful to have a dialogue on Millennium 
Challenge Corporation issues before the fact.  NEPAD is 
viewed as the continent\'s blueprint for which support is 
needed so the staffers questioned UK Africa Commission\'s 
likely impact on NEPAD. 
 
///NEPAD BUSINESS LUNCH/// 
 
10. (SBU)  Johannesburg CG Dunn hosted a lunch to provide 
business\'s perspective on NEPAD.   Guests included the head 
of the APR Secretariat, the Executive Director of the 
American Chamber of Commerce and members of the Chamber\'s 
NEPAD Committee, a Hewlett-Packard IT specialist who is a 
member of NEPAD\'s E-Africa Commission, and the President of 
the South African Black Accountants Association.  Geoff 
Rothschild, public relations director of the Johannesburg 
Securities Exchange and a member of the NEPAD Business 
Forum, explained the Forum\'s genesis, ties to companies 
participating in the World Economic Forum, sectoral focus, 
and support from President Mbeki.  He strongly supported 
NEPAD, contending that it facilitates sustainable efforts to 
alleviate poverty.  Others around the table repeated this 
theme, observing that an effective NEPAD is also good for 
business. The APR official said that feedback from 
\"stakeholders\" in the peer review process was a major 
departure for most African governments and defended the non- 
punitive character of the APRM, stating that it was not for 
donors or investors to put Africa\'s house in order.  The 
strategy of NEPAD leaders is to send a strong persuasive 
signal to non-participating countries to pressure them into 
joining up; progress to date has been encouraging. 
 
///INTELLECTUALS ON NEPAD ./// 
 
11. (SBU)  Four outspoken, much published intellectuals, 
academicians and journalists from the Center for Policy 
Studies, Institute for Strategic Studies, University of 
Witwatersrand, and South African Institute of International 
Affairs (SAIIA) met with the S/P staff and PolCounselor. 
Two agreed that with the OAU-AU transition Africa had 
reached a \"turning point\" with a new African-initiated 
emphasis on good governance, corporate responsibility, 
conflict resolution via the PSC and plans for the African 
standby force, and coordinated approach to development via 
NEPAD.   One suggested that it was more a \"breaking point\" 
pressed by events in Rwanda, Somalia, Sierra Leone and the 
DRC and pushed forward by South Africa and Nigeria\'s 
presidents.   Another said that NEPAD Secretariat was 
understaffed with no direction or vision or delivery vehicle 
on how to translate a plan into action, asking what happens 
after Mbeki and Obasanjo? 
 
12. (SBU)  One interlocutor acknowledged a turning point but 
queried its sustainability.  He said the OAU spearheaded 
political liberation and developed a culture of solidarity 
from the independence struggle - i.e., don\'t break ranks. 
New representative and accountability institutions such as 
the PAP, HSGIC, Ministerial Council, Economic and Social 
Council, and proposed courts were positive developments.  An 
interventional regime now exists, replacing the 
anticolonial, anti-apartheid focus of yesteryear.  The new 
pretext for action is against genocide, human rights 
violations and unconstitutional changes of government. 
NEPAD explicitly links peace, security, democracy and good 
governance continent-wide.  This has led to two contending 
threads of African nationalism:  the \"old style\" represented 
by Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the nationalist, sovereign ruler, and 
anti-colonial fighter who mobilizes Africans around these 
themes, and, until recently, Khadafi of Libya.  Secondly, 
the new pan-Africanist core group - Mbeki and Obasanjo 
(along with presidents of Mozambique, Tanzania, Senegal, 
Ghana, and Botswana) projects a politics of accommodation. 
Resources also remain a serious problem with five countries 
accounting for most of the AU budget.  There is a policy and 
implementation gap; the sooner NEPAD integrates into NEPAD 
the better.  He perceived a need to coordinate NEPAD 
capacity with the RECs, including retention of good staff at 
the Secretariat. 
 
13. (SBU)  Message for USG policymakers:  Specify the nature 
of the partnership vis--vis reform and delivery of donor 
resources.  Specifically, what does Africa get for airing 
its dirty laundry?  There needs to be some form of subtle 
reinforcement.  Blair \"is getting ahead of himself, not 
giving Africa enough time.\"  There needs to be a more honest 
and judicious way of communicating with Africans.  The RECs 
ability to deliver in one view is questionable; and as a 
result, the SAG is moving away from SADC to a more continent- 
wide approach on some issues.  NEPAD needs practical 
deliverables, but donors should not devise a NEPAD 
agricultural plan.  There should be careful statecraft in 
support of nations doing the right thing (i.e., invitations, 
White House visits, assistance, etc.  For example, the Dutch 
and Danes left Kenya).  The US especially should strengthen 
Africa\'s peacekeeping capacity via timely technical 
assistance and logistical support. 
 
///.AND PERCEPTIONS OF USG/// 
 
14. One said that perceptions of hypocrisy and self-interest 
preoccupation of the US do not play well in Africa as seen 
by the \"jump in Iraq\" and \"not one soldier in Liberia.\" 
Such things affect US credibility.  Another opined that the 
notion that all mistakes are on the US side is wrong, 
unhelpful and plays into the hands of those who wish to 
destabilize and alienate Africans from the United States. 
NEPAD/APRM could become a new form of conditionality.  Avoid 
coming across as if mutual accountability does not exist. 
How do we extract outside commitment based on that we do 
with respect to democracy, human rights and peace in 
exchange for open market access.  Also, using the slogan 
\"African solutions to African problems,\" potentially \"a cop 
out for reneging on responsibility.\"  Let\'s avoid 
\"aristocracy of death; there are conflicts everywhere.\"  For 
example, why expend billions of dollars for one conflict but 
blame Africa for African conflicts.  Western countries and 
Africans need to learn how to develop consensus on Darfur 
and Zimbabwe. 
 
///MUSLIMS IN AFRICA/// 
 
15. (SBU)  Perina noted the USG focus on Africa in the 
global context of a post-911 world and the need to reach out 
to Muslims.  He asked if there was a danger of these 
communities changing - for economic or other reasons - in 
ways that threaten stability?  One interlocutor noted an 
increase in students from all over Africa and Asia in 
Madrassas (Islamic schools) in Pakistan.  Another suggested 
that it would be a mistake to focus on only that segment of 
the population, because the USG has angered the entire 
continent, far beyond the Muslim community.  The US \"needs 
partners to defeat this problem.\"  At the 59th UNGA, Mbeki 
pressed for development and Bush antiterrorism; the issue is 
how to bridge this divide by compromise, according to the 
interlocutor.  Anti-Americanism is widespread.  Another 
interlocutor echoed these sentiments, stating that strong 
anti-American sentiment is widespread in Africa.  The 
perception is that America dictates how societies should 
organize themselves, fostering an existing degree of 
solidarity between Africa and the Arab world in particular. 
 
16. (SBU)  Muslim in Sub-Saharan Africa are moderate 
communities generally and those in South Africa do not 
necessarily harbor extremist views, because Africa seems to 
have embraced the western notion of democracy.  Most 
Africans do not mix religion and politics.  The US needs to 
be very careful in terms of its advocacy of its own beliefs 
about democracy and antiterrorism, particularly since Africa 
acknowledges the need to fight terrorism and is putting 
legislation in place.   One said the US comes on \"too 
strong\" and does not seem to understand that 911 represented 
a civil war in Islam in Central Asia, the Middle East and 
the Horn.   In one sense, he said the US was not the real 
target but a convenient hook for mobilizing this struggle. 
The US antiterrorist strategy misses the boat on how the US 
plays into this. 
 
17. (SBU)  One interlocutor suggested the need for a 
different model of US diplomacy, changing tone and style 
while still acting in its own self-interest.  A different 
approach could make a difference.  US diplomats should 
cultivate and develop personal relationships, building 
trust.  Much of the dynamics of the Zimbabwe situation 
relates to failure to do that.  Blair fell right into that 
mode and made it difficult for the SAG and others to take 
the moral position on Zimbabwe.  Why not quietly fund the 
right things?  For example, brisk debt relief would win the 
US some points, as would follow-through on Monterrey.  There 
needs to be a bridge.  They recognized that America was 
hurting after 911 and not interested in talking about 
development.  However, the world was ready for cooperation 
but instead reacted to post-911US actions with tremendous 
alienation.  The perception is that America is strong and 
democratic at home but a dictator abroad. 
 
18. (SBU)  SAG reaction:  Regarding the few Muslims in South 
Africa, DFA DDG Ambassador Mamabola stated that there was a 
history of coexistence and governance, but Darfur, in his 
view, will be a test for Africa.  He added that this issue 
threatened Nigeria as well.  A close ANC advisor and Muslim 
scholar noted the proliferation of proselytizing Saudi 
Arabian text books in South Africa that can be expected to 
have an impact in the future. 
 
19. (SBU)  Comment:  S/P staffers considered the mission to 
be highly successful and useful input into the US 
policymaking process on NEPAD and an approach to Islam in 
Africa.  Results of the October 12-13 NEPAD peace and 
security workshop on post conflict reconstruction and the 
October 22-23 Multi-stakeholders Review in South Africa 
should indicate how Africa\'s grades it own progress to date 
and perhaps suggest how it plans to proceed with existing 
and potential partners. 
 
(U)  Ambassador Perina cleared this message.

SUBJECT: South Africa: Fuel Price Increases 
 
REF: PRETORIA 2998 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (U) On October 5, the Department of Minerals and Energy 
announced a 2.64% increase in the price of gasoline at retail 
outlets, accompanied by larger wholesale increases for diesel 
(5.9%) and kerosene (8.5%).  This comes after two successive 
price decreases in July and August.  The current price of 
gasoline is only a half a U.S. cent less than June\'s all time 
high (reftel).  Diesel and kerosene are at record highs.  The 
government has no plans to tap into its Fuel Equalization Fund to 
smooth retail gasoline price increases as it did in June. 
Analysts generally agree that South African economic growth will 
not be seriously hurt as long as fuel price increases subside 
during the next six to twelve months and there is no major 
weakening of the rand.  On October 6, Reserve Bank Governor Tito 
Mboweni flatly stated that surging oil prices were an 
inflationary risk and reduced the likelihood of another interest 
rate cut when the Monetary Policy Committee meets on October 13 
and 14.  So far, the continuing strength of the rand has 
protected South African consumers from the full impact of rising 
world crude oil prices.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
Government Announces a Fuel Price Increase 
------------------------------------------ 
2.   (U) On October 5, the Department of Minerals and Energy 
announced a 2 U.S. cents per liter (7.6 U.S. cents per gallon) 
increase in the price of gasoline, and approximately 4 U.S. cents 
per liter each for diesel and kerosene (approximately 15 U.S. 
cents per gallon each).  These increases raised the average 
retail price per liter of gasoline in Johannesburg to 73 U.S. 
cents ($2.76 per gallon) and the wholesale price of diesel and 
kerosene to 68 and 53 U.S. cents per liter ($2.58 and $2.00 per 
gallon), respectively.  Diesel prices in South Africa normally 
rise between October and March because winter demand for heating 
oil in the northern hemisphere drives up international prices. 
This routinely poses a problem for South African farmers, who use 
diesel to plough in the southern hemisphere\'s spring and summer. 
This year, however, the increases may lead to slightly higher 
food prices than otherwise would be the case. 
 
The Fuel Equalization Fund 
-------------------------- 
 
3.   (U) The Fuel Equalization Fund was established in the 1970\'s 
to subsidize SASOL\'s synthetic fuel production when SASOL was 
still a government corporation.  The government imposed a 1.2 
U.S. cents per liter levy on fuel sales to support the fund.  The 
levy was discontinued when the crude price went above $16/bbl, 
and reintroduced on a sporadic basis when crude prices were 
especially high.  This happened twice during the Gulf war in 2002 
and in June of 2004 when the government withdrew $20-25 million 
to take the edge off a big price increase.  Currently, the fund 
has a reserve of $70-80 million, enough to subsidize fuel prices 
for about four months at 2 U.S. cents per liter. 
The Central Energy Fund manages the fund, but Treasury and the 
Department of Minerals and Energy jointly control it. 
 
4.   (U) The South African Petroleum Industry Association, whose 
membership includes refinerers and retailers, predicts another 
round of fuel price increases in November.  If this happens, 
South African gasoline prices would reach another all-time high. 
Another factor that will determine prices is the strength of the 
rand.  Since June, the South African rand has weakened against 
the dollar some 5%; it is currently trading at around R6.5 to the 
dollar.

1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The Broad-Based Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) Act, signed in January 2004, specifies 
that the Department of Trade and Industry will oversee the 
BEE process.  DTI still has to create a critical advisory 
council and issue important guidelines.  In the meantime, 
industry charters are proliferating without the benefit of 
these DTI resources.  Post has faxed a current list of 
charters to the Desk.  Adherence to empowerment objectives 
and targets is voluntary, but government procurement 
contracts provide preferential treatment to empowered 
companies and targets in sectoral charters encourage 
companies to purchase from empowered suppliers.  U.S. firms 
broadly support BEE, but generally oppose a requirement to 
transfer equity.  In some cases, American businesses feel 
that respective industry associations do not properly 
represent their interests.  European chambers of commerce 
have politely rejected AmCham efforts to collaborate in the 
ICT Charter process, although the Europeans seem to share 
many of the same concerns that American companies have. 
Union leaders and senior politicians have recently 
criticized the implementation of BEE, claiming it is 
enriching the lives of a small black elite.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) President Mbeki signed the Broad Based Black 
Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 into law in January 2004. 
The Act creates an institutional mechanism for fulfilling 
social objectives outlined in the ANC\'s Reconstruction and 
Development Program (RDP).  Adherence to empowerment 
objectives and targets is voluntary, but government 
procurement contracts provide preferential treatment to 
empowered companies.  In addition, procurement targets in 
sectoral charters provide incentive for companies to 
purchase from empowered suppliers. 
 
----------------------- 
THE BROAD-BASED BEE ACT 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (U) In general terms, the Act empowers the Minister of 
Trade & Industry (DTI) with overseeing the national policy 
on broad-based black economic empowerment.  More 
specifically, it authorizes the Minister to form a BEE 
Advisory Council, issue Codes of Good Practice and publish 
transformation (industry) charters.  The Advisory Council 
will advise government and industry on empowerment policy 
and the development of industry charters.  In addition to 
publishing approved industry charters as Codes of Good 
Practice, the Department of Trade & Industry can also issue 
additional BEE guidelines as Codes.  To date, the DTI has 
not yet formed the Advisory Council or issued Codes of Good 
Practice. 
 
---------------------------------- 
PROLIFERATION OF INDUSTRY CHARTERS 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The Government has actively encouraged the 
creation of charters in industries identified in the RDP as 
priority growth sectors - agriculture, tourism, culture, 
ICT, mining and metals, clothing and textiles, chemicals and 
biotech, and auto and transport services.  Industry charters 
where U.S. business interests could be most affected 
include:  ICT, Pharmaceutical, Automotive, and Agriculture. 
While industry charters are proliferating, there are still 
many sectors that have yet to initiate an empowerment 
discussion.  Post has faxed to State\'s South Africa desk a 
list of industries that have initiated an empowerment 
discussion and the status of their respective charters. 
 
------------- 
THE SCORECARD 
------------- 
 
5.  (U) In developing its strategy on BEE, the DTI issued a 
generic scorecard that, to date, has served as a model for 
subsequent scorecards.  The scorecard measures three \"core 
elements\" of BEE - direct empowerment, human resource 
development and employment equity, and indirect empowerment 
- plus a \"residual\" element, which typically measures 
corporate social investment programs.  The scorecard breaks 
down the measurement into the following components: 
Direct Empowerment       Equity Ownership 
                         Management 
 
HR Development           Employment Equity 
                         Skills Development 
 
Indirect Empowerment     Preferential Procurement 
                         Enterprise Development 
 
Residual                 TBD (e.g., CSI) 
 
Each industry\'s respective scorecard is the basis for 
measuring business compliance with charter targets. 
 
--------------------- 
U.S. COMPANIES ON BEE 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (U) American companies operating in South Africa support 
BEE objectives.  This commitment can be traced back as far 
as the 1970s when U.S. firms in South Africa embraced the 
Sullivan Principles and established workplace equality 
practices and corporate social responsibility programs. 
Today, most American businesses in South Africa already 
comply with many empowerment criteria. 
 
7.  (SBU) The major sticking point for U.S. companies has 
been the component that requires the transfer of equity. 
U.S. firms generally oppose this requirement as a matter of 
corporate policy.  Nevertheless, ChevronTexaco\'s CaltexSA 
subsidiary signed an agreement in 2002 to sell 25% of its 
South African operations to an empowerment consortium. 
Additionally, several American ICT companies in South Africa 
are considering employee shareholding schemes as a way to 
comply with the ICT Charter equity ownership component. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
DO AMERICAN FIRMS HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  (SBU) Industry charters are generally drafted by charter 
working groups led by steering committees, which are 
typically comprised of industry associations representing 
South African, foreign and black business, government, 
labor, and civic groups.  Charter working groups frequently 
lack big business experience and do not understand the 
corporate complexities of a multi-national company.  This 
underscores the need for businesses to work with and to 
educate the working groups and steering committees.  For 
example, American ICT companies provide valuable feedback to 
the ICT charter working group by applying the draft 
scorecard to their companies and explaining the financial 
implications for them.  While there has been no thorough 
analysis of the business costs of implementing empowerment 
targets, the financial services sector is committed to 
spending over R120 billion on funding BEE.  At the company 
level, an accountant for an American ICT firm in South 
Africa recently told AmCham members that targets in the 
fourth draft of the ICT Charter would erase his profits. 
 
9.  (SBU) Some charter steering committees and working 
groups seem to have an agenda of their own that is 
antagonistic towards U.S. firms.  Moreover, business 
association representatives sitting on the working group do 
not always accurately represent American (or foreign) 
business views.  U.S. companies were particularly frustrated 
by the working group\'s rejection of their reasonable 
proposals in the ICT Charter process.  Representatives of 
American firms in South Africa have discussed the 
possibility of creating their own Industry Association as a 
mechanism to increase their influence in the charter 
process.  Company reps voted down the idea, however, due to 
fears of alienating the existing political process and 
players and antagonizing existing associations.  European 
Chambers of Commerce have politely rejected AmCham efforts 
to collaborate in the ICT industry, although the Europeans 
seem to share many of the same concerns that American 
companies have. 
 
--------- 
BEE ELITE 
--------- 
 
10.  (U) BEE is a reasonable effort by the government to 
address the legacy of apartheid.  Its implementation, 
however, is creating controversy with black economic 
stakeholders who question its impact on most of the 
population.  For example, ANC Secretary General Kgalema 
Motlanthe recently raised concerns about the concentration 
of empowerment equity in the hands of a few mega-rich black 
business people.  His remarks came shortly after Finance 
Minister Trevor Manuel berated black professionals for 
undermining the economy with increasingly excessive salary 
demands.  COSATU General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi and 
Deputy Finance Minister Jabu Moleketi have also weighed in 
against perceived enrichment of a small black elite.  The 
media cites the following individuals in this category: 
Tokyo Sexwale, Cyril Ramaphosa, Saki Macozoma, Sandile 
Zungu, Fani Titi and Patrice Motsepe.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: BARCLAYS TO BUY ABSA 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. President Mbeki has publicly given his 
support for Barclays Bank\'s planned bid to purchase a 50.1% 
stake in ABSA, the fourth largest bank in South Africa. 
While Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has the final say, 
Mbeki\'s support certainly paves the road for approval.  The 
acquisition represents a clear departure from previous 
government policy to keep the four large banks South African 
owned.  Industry insiders believe that Barclays\' takeover of 
ABSA will be positive for South Africa, but are not sure that 
it will lead to more competition and thus lower banking fees 
as the government and consumers would like.  Some local labor 
and political organizations have voiced reservations about 
potential job cuts and capital leaving the country, but 
neither of these events is likely to happen in this case. 
End Summary. 
 
Barclays\' Interest in ABSA Goes Public 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On September 23, Barclays confirmed its intention to 
purchase a 50.1% stake in ABSA, the fourth largest bank in 
South Africa, for R20 billion (approximately $3.1 billion). 
ABSA\'s board has reportedly accepted Barclays\' bid in 
principle, but a final offer will not be made until South 
African Reserve Bank (SARB) regulators approve Barclays\' bid, 
and Barclays can complete due diligence on ABSA.  Due 
diligence will determine Barclays final offer price and 
percentage stake.  It will then be up to ABSA shareholders to 
accept Barclays\' offer, Barclays\' shareholders to approve the 
deal, and South African Finance Minister Manuel to give a 
green light. 
 
3. (U) Several weeks before Barclays emerged as ABSA\'s 
suitor, as Barclays talked to Sanlam about its 21.3% 
shareholding in ABSA, rumors abounded about a foreign 
takeover of a local bank.  On September 23, Barclays and ABSA 
came clean with the announcement that, indeed, they were 
talking to each other.  Sanlam, a South African financial 
services company, is ABSA\'s leading shareholder. Sanlam also 
relies on ABSA retail outlets to market its insurance 
products, a practice it would want to continue after Barclays 
takes over. 
 
4. (U) U.S. financial advisors are involved in the 
acquisition.  JP Morgan is advising Barclays, while Merrill 
Lynch and Goldman Sachs are advising ABSA.  The acquisition 
of ABSA would be the largest investment outside of the United 
Kingdom for Barclays, and the largest single foreign 
investment in South Africa since 1994. 
 
No Rivals 
--------- 
 
5. (SBU) The press has suggested that Standard Chartered 
(U.K.) or Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation (HSBC) (U.K.) 
might be rival bidders for ABSA, or might be interested in a 
different South African bank -- but neither has publicly 
indicated any such interest.  In fact, Standard Chartered 
flatly stated that it did not plan to place a competing bid 
on ABSA.  Industry insiders that we contacted see no 
indication that either Standard Chartered or HBSC are serious 
about a South African acquisition at this time. 
 
The Road is Paved for Barclays 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) The road is paved for approval of Barclays\' bid. 
Before going public, top executives from Barclays met with 
President Mbeki to ask for his blessing.  They assured him 
that Barclays would live up to ABSA\'s black economic 
empowerment commitments under the Financial Sector Charter, 
and that Barclays was coming to South Africa for the long 
haul.  Satisfied with Barclays\' good intentions, Mbeki 
immediately trumpeted Barclays\' move on ABSA as an indication 
of strong foreign investor confidence in South Africa, and as 
vindication that his macroeconomic stabilization and social 
transformation policies were working.  Publicly, Finance 
Minster Manuel and SARB Governor Tito Mboweni have had 
nothing negative to say about the deal, leading to the widely 
held presumption that nothing is standing in the way. 
 
What is Happening to the Four-Pillar Policy? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Consolidation of the South African banking industry 
during the past decade culminated in what is known as the 
government\'s \"four-pillar\" policy, i.e., the government\'s 
preference for keeping a minimum of four large banks 
relatively competitive, healthy, and South African owned. 
The big four are Standard Bank, FirstRand, Nedcor, and ABSA. 
SARB Governor Mboweni recently reiterated the government\'s 
\"preference for the big four South African banks to remain in 
South African hands,\" but had to admit that \"nothing remains 
stable.\"  He confessed that the Treasury and the SARB would 
have to consider modifying the policy at some point.  Some 
would argue that the policy lost its luster after Nedcor\'s 
majority shareholder, Old Mutual, moved its primary stock 
listing and headquarters to London from South Africa.  Old 
Mutual is an international financial services group with 
strong South African roots (where it still derives most of 
its income) that has maintained a secondary listing for 
itself on the JSE Securities Exchange and a primary listing 
for Nedcor.  If there was any doubt before as to whether the 
four-pillar policy was standing, Barclays\' takeover of ABSA 
should clear it up.  The policy will have to change. 
8. (SBU) The question is, \"How much?\"  Given that two of the 
four major retail banks in South Africa are foreign owned, 
will the government close the door to future foreign 
takeovers, or leave the door open?  Industry insiders do not 
think that the government will allow another foreign takeover 
of a big bank after ABSA, but this may depend on how and why 
Manuel chooses to approve the Barclays deal.  We will be 
watching to see whether he leaves the door open for other 
foreign banks to compete in South Africa, and to bring more 
capital to the country. 
 
Some Reservations, but Industry is Supportive 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Media reports suggested that Barclays would have an 
unfair competitive advantage in South Africa if no other 
foreign banks were allowed in, but most banking industry 
officials do not seem to be worried.  Indeed, stock prices in 
all banks got a shot in the arm on news of Barclays\' bid. 
Many in the private sector are hopeful that increased 
competition among the big four will bring down the high cost 
of local banking and make the whole economy a bit more 
competitive.  Currently, South African banks derive about 
half their income from banking fees, far more than in more 
developed markets.  The acquisition is also seen as good for 
South Africa, as it encourages more foreign investment. 
 
10. (SBU) A U.S. bank executive held reservations about 
whether it was a good idea for Barclays to leak news of the 
deal so soon.  ABSA shares have been increasing in value ever 
since and this only made the deal more expensive.  The 
executive also questioned the logic of buying a South African 
bank at a time when the rand was overvalued.  The rand has 
appreciated 16% against the British pound and 25% against the 
U.S. dollar since January 2003.  However, this may not be the 
issue it appears to be.  SARB Governor Mboweni recently 
suggested that Barclays might not need many British pounds to 
purchase ABSA.  He pointed out that the actual foreign 
exchange inflow \"might be disappointing\" because Barclays 
could finance much of the purchase through rand holdings that 
it has accumulated over time.  This would take pressure off 
the SARB to \"mop up\" excess foreign exchange in an effort to 
keep the rand from appreciating further. 
 
What Will Happen to ABSA and its Employees? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Some local labor and political organizations voiced 
reservations about job cuts after mergers and the potential 
of capital leaving the country, but neither of these events 
is likely to happen in the case of ABSA.  ABSA\'s CEO, Steve 
Booysen, stated publicly that the deal was \"about growth and 
leadership, not retrenchment\" or capital leaving the country. 
 He pointed out that there was little overlap between ABSA\'s 
and Barclays\' Africa business )- with the only overlap in 
the areas of corporate and investment banking in South 
Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.  A Banking Council official 
echoed this sentiment, noting that the acquisition was more a 
transfer of ownership than a merger.  Moreover, Barclays has 
a small number of employees in South Africa, making the 
likely solution to any redundancies the shifting of employees 
to other areas. 
 
12. (U) In 1986, Barclays disinvested from South Africa, 
leaving behind what later became First National Bank, now 
owned by FirstRand Limited.  Barclays returned in 1995 as a 
much smaller entity, focusing on corporate and investment 
banking, and on wealth management.  Barclays now has 400 
employees in South Africa, compared to 6,900 in all of 
Africa.  At this time, no one knows whether Barclays will 
retain the ABSA brand in South Africa, where it is well known 
on the retail level.  ABSA, with Afrikaner roots, is the 
largest retail bank in South Africa, employing 32,000. 
Barclays is well known internationally and is locally strong 
in corporate banking and credit cards. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (SBU) It is difficult for South Africans to argue against 
Barclays\' acquisition of ABSA, as it has Mbeki\'s blessing and 
represents a very large, high profile foreign investment for 
the country -- increasingly important to a government that 
wants to grow the economy and reduce high unemployment. 
Whether it brings more competition to the banking sector and 
along with it lower banking fees is another question.  The 
private sector would like to see that happen, but is not 
convinced that Barclays will not simply join the clubby 
profitability of the big four.  For its part, the government 
would like to see banking services more affordable, both for 
economic competitiveness reasons and to make services more 
accessible to the large \"unbanked\" population in South 
Africa.  Other unanswered questions concerning the 
acquisition revolve around what Barclays will do with the 
ABSA brand, and how the government might modify its 
four-pillar policy.  Will Barclays\' purchase of ABSA open or 
close the door for future foreign acquisitions of South 
African banks?

South African National Youth Risk Behavior Survey Released 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2.  The 2002 South African National Youth Risk Behavior 
Survey, using results from 10,699 students in grades 8-11, 
highlighted sexual practices of students in South African 
high schools.  The findings include:  (1) 40 percent of 
South African high school pupils are sexually active; (2) 
more than 14 percent of these students had their first 
sexual experience before the age of 14, and some of them had 
already had more than two sexual partners by the age of 14, 
and (3) in a sampling of 4,182 students, 8.1 percent has had 
an abortion or had a partner who has had an abortion. 
Provincially, in KwaZulu-Natal, of 1,151 students sampled, 
15.6 percent admitted to having had sex before the age of 
14; in Gauteng of the 1,129 sampled, 19.1 percent answered 
positively; in the Western Cape of the 1,390 sampled, 12.5 
percent answered positively.  In the Eastern Cape, 12.5 
percent of students admitted to having had sex before the 
age of 14 (1,108 sampled); in the Free State, 18.8 percent 
of the 1,101 students sampled; in the Limpopo province 11.5 
percent of the 964 students sampled; in Mpumalanga 15.7 
percent of the 1,220 sampled; in the Northern Cape 10.8 
percent of the 1 041 sampled; and in the North West province 
9.9 percent of the 1,162 sampled.  The survey, which 
consisted of a sampling of 23 schools per province, was 
conducted for the purpose of providing nationally and 
provincially representative data on the prevalence of key 
risk behaviors, namely: intentional and unintentional 
injuries, violence and traffic safety, suicide-related 
behavior, behaviors related to substance abuse, sexual 
behavior, nutrition and dietary behaviors, physical 
activity, and hygiene-related behaviors.  Source:  The Star,

South Africa: Vaccine Research Struggles to Find Trial 
Participants 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  South African HIV vaccine research efforts are being 
threatened by the low number of people willing to 
participate in trials, said the Medical Research Council 
(MRC).  According to researchers from the MRC in Durban, the 
fear of stigma and discrimination from their communities 
prevented people from taking part in the trials. The country 
began conducting vaccine trials in November 2003.  The 
stringent eligibility criteria also saw many potential study 
participants being rejected.  Although more than 400 people 
have attended the MRC\'s HIV vaccine information sessions in 
the past two years, only 90 have returned for the screening 
process - a medical check-up that establishes eligibility. 
Of these 90, only 18 have been enrolled in Phase I vaccine 
trials. The MRC has managed to find a further 30 eligible 
candidates during the past twelve months.  Eighteen 
volunteers is the minimum amount required to proceed with 
the trials at the Durban site, as the first phase needs a 
small number of participants. But the vaccine trials could 
be at risk if the existing participants drop out.  The MRC\'s 
HIV Vaccine Research Unit, based in Durban and the Perinatal 
HIV Research Unit at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in 
Soweto, Johannesburg are the only two trial sites. Two more 
sites are expected to start vaccine testing in the next few 
months.  Despite ongoing education campaigns, misconceptions 
and myths about the trials and the vaccine present another 
obstacle. A large number of people believed they could be 
infected with the HI virus by being inoculated with a test 
vaccine, researchers said.  Such fears were unfounded, \"as 
no live viruses are injected,\" explained MRC senior clinical 
research nurse Armstrong Makhofola.  The stigma associated 
with joining an HIV vaccine trial remains a big challenge. 
In addition, many willing volunteers also do not meet the 
stringent eligibility criteria, such as belonging to a 
certain age group, being in good health, having a good level 
of education, being HIV-negative and at low risk of 
contracting HIV, as well as not planning a pregnancy in the 
near future.  Phase I trials in Durban and Soweto will end 
in mid-2005. These results will dictate whether the research 
can move into its second and third phases.  The main 
objective of Phase I trials is to test the safety of the 
vaccine prototype. They will also determine its possible 
side effects.  Despite being in the early stages of the 
first phase of trials, \"so far, the [test] vaccine appears 
to have strengthened immune response,\" Makhofola said.  The 
candidate-vaccine had also not shown any unexpected side 
effects so far.  The next phase will focus on maintaining 
the safety level of the vaccine, as well as finding the best 
dosage and method of administering the vaccine. The third 
phase involves tens of thousands of participants to assess 
whether the vaccine pre-vents natural infection from HIV.

Auditor Criticizes Health Department for Lax Funds 
Allocation 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4.  Auditor-General Shauket Fakie has criticized the Health 
Department for paying out billions of rands in conditional 
grants to provinces and then failing to follow up on how 
these funds were spent.  Fakie qualified the department\'s 
annual report tabled in Parliament yesterday, saying there 
were fundamental deficiencies, and noncompliance with the 
law, particularly the Division of Revenue Act.  Fakie said 
the health department did not verify or follow up on all of 
the payments it made to provincial departments amounting to 
R7 billion ($1.1 billion using 6.5 rands per dollar), or 
91.4 percent of the department\'s budget for conditional 
grants to the provinces. \"The act requires funds to be 
withheld when significant under spending and the no 
achievement of objectives occurs. It was noted that, in 
spite of the grants being under spent, transfers were still 
made. In 18 instances, under spending of conditional grants 
amounting to R279 million occurred in the provinces on the 
various programs,\" he said.  On-site monitoring of the 
Health Professions Training and Development conditional 
grant of R1.8 billion was inadequate in Gauteng, Free State, 
Eastern Cape, North West and Limpopo.  The Health Department 
transfers conditional grants to the provinces for combating 
HIV/AIDS, hospital revitalization, integrated nutrition and 
hospital management, among other things.  Fakie also said 
the department transferred R110 million to non-governmental 
organizations and failed to ensure that audited statements 
for the use of the money were provided, or even that there 
were effective financial management and control systems in 
place at the organizations.  Source:  Business Day, October

Africa\'s Countries Lack Vitamins 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  It is estimated that vitamin and mineral deficiencies 
are costing sub-Saharan economies more than $2.3 billion a 
year in lost productivity. Iron deficiency alone costs South 
Africa 0.4% of its gross domestic product.  A report 
released by the World Health Organization, the Macronutrient 
Initiative, the United Nations Children\'s Fund, the Global 
Alliance for Improved Nutrition and the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa (DBSA) finds that adding essential vitamins 
and minerals to foods regularly consumed by a significant 
proportion of the population can cost as little as a few 
cents per person per year.  In South Africa, it is estimated 
that 37 percent of children under the age of five suffer 
iron deficiency; 160,000 children are born each year with 
severe mental impairments; and about 26 percent of women 
between the ages of 15 and 49 have iron-deficiency anemia. 
Also, 6,000 children under the age of six die each year 
because they lack vitamin A.  In May 2002 the United Nations 
General Assembly agreed that the elimination or reduction of 
vitamin deficiencies should be one of the principal goals of 
development to be achieved early this century.  Almost two 
years ago South Africa joined a global initiative to fortify 
flour with iron and folic acid and vitamin A, investing $11 
million a year over the next five years.  South Africa 
iodizes 62 percent of salt sold, hoping to save the lives of 
5800 children and prevent 3400 birth defects a year.  In 
South Africa, 33% of children under the age of six have 
subclinical vitamin A deficiency.  Source:  Business Day,

Western Cape\'s HIV/AIDS Antenatal Survey Results 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  Western Cape\'s latest antenatal survey reveals that 13 
percent of pregnant women attending public health facilities 
have HIV (up from 12.4 percent in 2002) and that teenage 
infection rates have been increasing by 1 percent annually, 
with 8.5 percent of all pregnant 15-19 year olds having HIV. 
52 percent of districts reported HIV prevalence rates of 
greater or equal to 10 percent. There had been a rapid rate 
of increase in urban settings, where over 65 percent of the 
province\'s populations reside.  The HIV prevalence rate in 
the under 20 age group has continued to rise consistently 
over the last eight years with the rate highest among 
younger women. It continues to increase rapidly among 15 to 
24 year old women.  The district with the highest infection 
rate is Gugulethu/ Nyanga, where 28 percent of pregnant 
women are infected.  The Western Cape has the lowest HIV 
prevalence of all provinces and around one-third of that of 
KwaZulu-Natal.  To combat the rise among teenagers, the 
Health Department is planning peer education programs in 
every high school this year. Around a quarter already run 
these programs.  The survey showed that:   (1) The districts 
with the highest prevalence were Gugulethu/ Nyanga, with 28 
percent prevalence, Khayelitsha (27.2 percent), Helderberg 
(19 percent), Oostenberg (16 percent), and the Knysna- 
Plettenberg Bay area (15.6 percent); (2) there were fewer 
infections in rural (8.3 percent) than in urban (14.7 
percent) areas, although infections were high along the N2 
between Plettenberg Bay and Cape Town; (3) lowest infection 
rates were found in the Klein Karoo (5.4 percent), the 
Central Karoo (6.5 percent), Mitchells Plain (6.3 percent) 
and Blaauwberg (4.4 percent); (4) the epidemic in the 
Western Cape is around five years behind the national 
epidemic; and (5) the HIV infection rate of the total 
population in the Western Cape is probably half that of 
pregnant women at around 6.5 percent.  The evidence 
indicates that the largest risk group in our province is the 
under-20s.  Source:  Cape Times, October 8; Health E-News,

Health Finance Chief Outlines Action on Health Funds 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.  The Health Department\'s chief financial officer, Gerrit 
Muller, conceded that the department had failed to properly 
oversee the spending of billions of rands given to provinces 
as conditional grants, but said remedial steps had been 
taken to address the problem.  Muller\'s comments came after 
auditor-general Shauket Fakie\'s damning report on the Health 
Department\'s spending, which became public when its annual 
report was tabled in Parliament (see above article).  Muller 
provided the parliamentary portfolio on health with details 
of the department\'s R172 million under spending during the 
2003-04 financial year, and said the department\'s staff 
complement would be strengthened to improve financial 
monitoring.  Co-ordination with the provinces would also be 
improved, he said, using forums such as the provincial chief 
financial officers gathering, the meeting of the health 
minister and the nine provincial ministers and meetings of 
the provincial heads of health.  Regarding the lack of 
oversight for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that 
received funding from government, Muller said it was 
difficult to obtain financial statements from NGOs that 
received once-off funding. Those requesting more funding had 
to provide financial statements and audited reports.

HIV Crisis Among South Africa\'s Health Workers 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  October\'s issue of South African Medical Journal 
published an article showing a high prevalence rate of 
HIV/AIDS of health workers in KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, 
Mpumalanga, and North West provinces.  Out of 595 
respondents, an estimated 15.7 percent of health workers in 
the four provinces had HIV/AIDS in 2002.  The authors said 
the high HIV prevalence among health workers had serious 
implications including increased absenteeism, and the fact 
that non-infected workers had to compensate by working much 
harder, leading to lower morale and burnout.  The study used 
a stratified cluster sample, drawn from 5% of health 
facilities in the country that represented the public and 
private health sectors in Free State, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu- 
Natal and North West.  The sample was designed to obtain a 
representative, nation-wide sample of medical professionals 
and nonprofessional health workers, with a sub-sample 
comprising workers in four provinces tested for HIV.  Among 
younger health workers, the HIV prevalence rates were even 
higher.  The group, aged between 18 and 35, had an estimated 
HIV prevalence rate of 20 percent.  About 20.3 percent of 
nonprofessionals were infected with HIV, while 13.7 percent 
of professionals were HIV-positive.  Black health workers 
had a much higher HIV prevalence than other race groups, 
however caution needed to be exercised in interpreting the 
results, because the figures among the other race groups 
were too small to yield meaningful results.  Source:

South Africa\'s Risk Behavior 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  Results from Durex\'s eighth annual online global sex 
survey, in which more than 3,000 South Africans 
participated, highlighted continuing South African risky 
sexual behavior. 
While 78 percent of South Africans are seriously concerned 
about HIV-Aids, 58 percent are having unprotected sex with 
partners whose sexual history they do not know.  The survey 
showed that of the South Africans who completed the 
questionnaire, 21 percent have never received any formal sex 
education.  The survey is internet-based with 350,000 people 
participating from 41 countries.  Source:  SAPA, October 12.

1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
 economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
 Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
 opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
 newsletter are: 
 -  No change in Interest Rates; 
 -  Tourism Earns More Foreign Exchange than Gold; 
 -  Record South African Expansion Could Last Two Years; 
 -  Housing Prices Continue to Increase; 
 -  Manufacturing Capacity Utilization Increases; 
 -  Carbon Trading to Begin; 
 -  August Manufacturing Production Shows Growth; 
 -  Building Confidence Survey at High Levels; and 
 -  Improved Ranking in World Economic Forum\'s 
Competitiveness Survey.  End Summary. 
 
 NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES 
 --------------------------- 
 
 2.  The South African Reserve Bank\'s (SARB) Monetary 
 Policy Committee (MPC) kept interest rates unchanged after 
 its October 13-14 meeting, leaving the repurchase rate at 
 7.5 percent.  SARB Governor Tito Mboweni stated that 
 targeted inflation (consumer prices excluding mortgages) 
 should remain well within its boundaries over the next two 
 years, increasing slightly in the near term, but 
 moderating later.  He cited a number of factors 
 responsible for an optimistic inflationary outlook:  (1) a 
 decline in inflationary expectations; (2) fiscal prudence 
 by government; (3) improved outlook for food prices; (4) 
 commitment to contain administered price increases; and 
 (5) lower average global inflation.  Source:  I-Net 
 Bridge, October 14. 
 
 3.  Comment.  Earlier in the week, Mboweni had cited 
 rising oil prices, concerns about low savings rates, 
 rising household debt, and increased consumption rather 
 than investment fueling growth as potential problems 
 facing the South African economy.  Out of 24 economists 
 polled by Reuters on October 13, 22 said they expected 
 interest rates to remain unchanged because of surging oil 
 prices. End comment. 
 
 TOURISM EARNS MORE FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAN GOLD 
 --------------------------------------------- 
 
 4.    Research from Standard Bank indicates that tourism 
 is growing in importance to the South African economy, 
 earning more in foreign exchange in 2003 (R53.9 billion, 
 $8.3 billion, using 6.5 rands per dollar) than net gold 
 exports (R35.3 billion, $5.4 billion).  Standard Bank\'s 
 research suggests that tourists are more influenced by 
 economic growth in their own countries than the rand\'s 
 level, which implies that the sector is resilient to the 
 rand\'s strength, especially when compared to the mining 
 sector.  The report estimated that for every 1 percent 
 increase in a country\'s GDP, the number of tourists from 
 that country who visit South Africa would increase by 1.73 
 percent.  On the other hand, a 1 percent increase in local 
 currency prices would decrease tourist arrivals by only 
 0.04 percent.  The relatively small impact on prices can 
 be partly explained by the composition of tourists 
 visiting South Africa.  In 2003, more than half of South 
 Africa\'s tourists came from other African countries, and 
 those tourists from countries whose currency is pegged to 
 the rand (Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia and Botswana) 
 comprised 20 percent of total foreign tourist spending. 
 For these tourists, their demand would be less sensitive 
 to overall price changes, since the prices they pay are 
 not influenced by the rand exchange rate and their local 
 markets are limited and expensive.  Standard Bank 
 estimates that tourist arrivals could increase 3 percent 
 next year, more than double last year\'s growth rate of 1.2 
 percent.  Even if the rand remains at current levels, 
 tourist arrivals should grow by more than 2 percent.

 October 11. 
 
 RECORD SOUTH AFRICAN EXPANSION COULD LAST TWO YEARS 
 --------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 5.  The Credit Guarantee Insurance\'s (CGI) latest economic 
 and business review suggests that the current five-year 
 South African expansion could last two more years.  Lower 
 structural inflation meant lower interest rates could last 
 into 2005 and beyond, but this depends on oil prices and 
 domestic secondary-round price increases being muted. 
 Despite a \'strong\' exchange rate, the manufacturing sector 
 is expanding rapidly and business confidence indicators 
 are at an all-time high.  Luke Doig, senior economist at 
 CGI warned that protectionist policy, a substantially 
 weaker rand, and over-regulation all serve to raise costs 
 and divert attention away from satisfying the real needs 
 of consumers.  CGI is forecasting a 2.8 percent GDP growth 
 rate this year from 1.9 percent last year and expects 
 growth to accelerate to 3.7 percent in 2005.  Source:  I- 
 Net Bridge October 12. 
 
 6.  Comment.  The highest GDP growth rate in post- 
 apartheid South Africa (since the April 27 1994 elections) 
 was 7.7 percent in the second quarter of 1996.  The 
 average GDP growth over the past 10 ten years is 2.8 
 percent.  Now South Africa has recorded 23 consecutive 
 quarters of economic growth, with the previous record for 
 consecutive positive quarterly GDP growth at 44 quarters 
 occurring in the early 1960s.  End comment. 
 
 
 HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO INCREASE 
 ----------------------------------- 
 
 7.  The ABSA Bank house price index in August continues to 
 show record growth, increasing a nominal 33.7 percent, 
 y/y, its highest in 23 years.  Helped by strong growth in 
 household incomes and low nominal interest rates, property 
 prices reflect increased demand.  As a result of the sharp 
 increase in residential property prices during 2003 and 
 the first nine months of this year, ABSA decided to lift 
 the upper cut-off price for residential properties in the 
 middle market from R1.8 million ($280,000) last year to 
 R2.2 million ($340,000) this year.  The upper cutoff price 
 in the luxury market was increased from R6.5 million ($1 
 million) in 2003 to R8 million ($1.2 million) this year. 
 ABSA\'s real (adjusted for inflation) housing price index 
 indicated that there was 32.7 percent year-on-year growth 
 in August compared to July\'s 30.9 percent increase.

 CAPACITY UTILIZATION INCREASES 
 ------------------------------ 
 
 8.  The capacity utilization for large manufacturers 
 increased to 84.2 percent in May 2004 up from 83.3 percent 
 in February according to Stats SA.  The rise of 1.1 
 percent or 0.9 percentage points was mainly due to higher 
 demand.  The largest rise was reported in food and 
 beverages (up 2.4 percentage points) followed by motor 
 vehicles and parts (up by 2 percentage points).  Source: 
 Business Day, October 12. 
 
 CARBON TRADING TO BEGIN IN SA 
 ----------------------------- 
 
 9.  Subject to approval from South Africa\'s JSE Securities 
 Exchange, Sterling Waterford Securities will list carbon- 
 trading credits by the end of 2004.  The carbon credits 
 allow companies in developed countries trying to meet 
 stringent carbon controls to buy credits from companies in 
 countries that pollute less than their allotted limits. 
 The draft National Energy Bill, legislation already 
 approved by the cabinet, will establish a designated 
 national authority to handle carbon credits with regard to 
 the Kyoto protocol.  Currently, the price of carbon 
 credits is between $3 and $7 a ton.  Currently, South 
 Africa has the third-highest per capita rate of emissions 
 of greenhouse gases in the world.  Russia is expected to 
 provide most of the carbon credits to the market.  Source: 
 Business Day, October 11. 
 
 MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SHOWS ROBUST AUGUST GROWTH 
 --------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 10.  Manufacturing production increased 6.8 percent (y/y) 
 in August, its strongest growth in nearly two years, 
 compared to July\'s growth of 5.2 percent.  From April 2003 
 until February 2004, manufacturing production slipped into 
 recession, with March being the first month of positive 
 growth.  On a quarterly basis, 8 of the 10 manufacturing 
 industries showed stronger growth, with the fastest growth 
 occurring in the glass, food and beverages, motor 
 vehicles, petroleum and chemical products.  However, there 
 are signs of weakening growth.  When measured monthly on a 
 seasonally adjusted basis, manufacturing production growth 
 and manufacturing sales declined 0.8 percent and 0.3 
 percent respectively between July and August.  The August 
 quarterly growth in manufacturing production reached 2 
 percent, down from July\'s quarterly growth of 2.5 percent. 
 Source:  Business Day, October 13; Standard Bank 
 Manufacturing Unpacked, October 12, September 7; 
 Statistics South Africa Statistical Release P 3041.2. 
 
 11.  Comment.  The manufacturing sector, accounting for 18 
 percent of gross domestic product, weakened in 2003 due to 
 stagnant global growth and the strong rand.  However, 
 strong domestic demand caused by low interest rates and 
 improving export outlook has boosted manufacturing growth 
 prospects for 2004.  End comment. 
 
 BUILDING CONFIDENCE SURVEY HIGH 
 ------------------------------- 
 
 12.  The Bureau for Economic Research\'s confidence index 
 for residential building contractors show most building 
 contractors expect activity to improve this quarter. 
 However, 89 percent of those surveyed complained about a 
 shortage of skilled labor.  Confidence of residential 
 contractors scored 87, close to the record high of 90 
 reached in the second quarter 2004 and confidence among 
 nonresidential contractors rose to 74, also close to the 
 second quarter\'s level of 72.  Skill shortages could lead 
 to an increase in wages for the sector, especially given 
 strong growth in both housing and retail construction.

 IMPROVED RANKING IN WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\'S COMPETITIVENESS 
 INDEX 
 --------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 13.  The latest annual World Economic Forum\'s (WEF) 
 competitiveness survey ranks South Africa 42 out of 104, 
 an improvement of just one place over last year.  Now, 
 however, South Africa is the most competitive economy in 
 the continent, ahead of Botswana, which dropped nine 
 places.  Ranked highest in Africa, South Africa\'s ranking 
 is still below many of its competitors, such as Chile, 
 Poland and Estonia.  Ranking 22, Chile was the only South 
 American country to rank above South Africa, with Mexico 
 only 48.  The survey comprised 8,700 business leaders and 
 emphasized macroeconomic environment, the quality of 
 public institutions and technological innovation.  The 
 four components of WEF\'s Global Competitiveness Index 
 (GCI) show a varied picture for South Africa, with the 
 country ranked 40th on technology, 48th on macroeconomic 
 environment and 35th on public institutions.  South 
 Africa\'s best performance is in business competitiveness, 
 where it ranked 25th, based on the strength and regulation 
 of its financial markets, corporate governance and 
 \"general effectiveness\" of government policies.  According 
 to WEF, South Africa\'s competitive disadvantages include 
 labor market issues, such as ease of hiring foreign labor, 
 hiring and firing practices and flexibility of wages. 
 HIV/Aids and crime are also cited as negatives.  Source:

1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
 economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
 Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
 opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s

 -  Economy Should Attract Increased Investment.  End 
 Summary. 
 
 THIRD QUARTER FDI IMPROVES BUT STILL LOW 
 ---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 2.  BusinessMap Foundation said third quarter foreign 
 direct investment (FDI) into South Africa at R27.8 billion 
 ($4.3 billion using 6.5 rands per dollar) improved over 
 second quarter\'s disinvestment primarily due to Barclays\' 
 announced plans to obtain a majority share in ABSA bank. 
 The rise in the third quarter followed a R10.6 billion 
 disinvestment in the second quarter because of Thintana 
 consortium\'s announced plans to sell its R 6.1 billion 
 share in Telkom.  Subtracting the R1.8 billion of 
 disinvestment that occurred (primarily in the consumer 
 goods sector), net FDI during the third quarter was R26.1 
 billion.  In 2003, Africa attracted 2.7 percent and South 
 Africa accounted for 1 percent of total FDI in the world. 
 Quarterly FDI into South Africa is small, volatile, and 
 impacted by a few large transactions that can affect 
 quarterly and yearly averages.  Source:  Business Day, 
 October 21; BusinessMap FDI Third Quarter, October 20. 
 
 3.  Comment.  BusinessMap Foundation collects foreign 
 direct investment data by using press accounts to count 
 both FDI intentions as well as actual investments.  It 
 uses the same FDI definitions as the South African Reserve 
 Bank (SARB) by including only long-term investment, and 
 cases with more than 10 percent ownership as well as 
 reinvestment activity; however, it includes intentions to 
 invest when they are announced as well as actual 
 investment.  Therefore, this method captures the 
 investment mood, but does not measure actual inflows. 
 The timing of recording streams of investment leads to the 
 primary difference in investment numbers between 
 BusinessMap and SARB.  In addition, BusinessMap\'s database 
 also allows aggregation by industry, unlike the SARB data. 
 End comment. 
 
 NOVEMBER GDP REVISIONS MAY BOOST GROWTH 
 --------------------------------------- 
 
 4.   On November 30, Statistics SA (Stats SA) will revise 
 gross domestic product (GDP) figures upwards, after new 
 data suggested higher levels of economic activity than 
 previously stated.  GDP figures from 1998 to 2004 will be 
 revised.  GDP grew 1.9 percent in 2003, but has since 
 accelerated gradually following a recovery in the 
 manufacturing sector. The latest figures show that GDP 
 increased at an annualized rate of 3.9 percent in the 
 second quarter, the fastest growth experienced since 2002. 
 Updated every five years, the base or reference year for 
 the GDP figures will be changed from 1995 to 2000.  The 
 GDP figures will also be benchmarked, an annual process 
 that combines high-frequency data with less frequent, but 
 more accurate, data.  After making improvements to some of 
 its surveys, Stats SA found that it had underestimated the 
 size of the manufacturing sector by 17 percent, while 
 retail sales had been underestimated by 20 percent before 
 the revisions were made.   It is unlikely that the 
 underestimation of total GDP will be of the same 
 magnitude, because not all industries had increased 
 economic activity.  Source:  Business Day, October 21. 
 
 FITCH UPGRADES RATINGS TO STABLE 
 -------------------------------- 
 
 5.  Fitch Ratings revised its outlook on South Africa\'s 
 sovereign ratings to stable from positive with the ratings 
 for its long-term foreign and local currency unchanged 
 from its March 2004 rating of BBB and A- respectively. 
 Fitch cited improvements in external liquidity, reduced 
 external debt, and improved prospects for sustaining 
 growth above 3 percent over the medium-term as primary 
 reasons for the sovereign ratings upgrade.  South Africa\'s 
 gross international reserves, currently $12.5 billion, 
 increased by $4 billion since February 2004.  Net external 
 debt (debt owed to foreigners less the foreign assets of 
 the banking system) is projected to fall to 5 percent of 
 GDP in 2004, compared to 17 percent in 2002.  Fitch\'s 
 announcement of the upgrade comes several days after 
 Moody\'s announcement of putting South Africa on review for 
 a possible upgrade.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, October 21; 
 Business Day, October 22. 
 MOODY RATINGS AGENCY CONSIDERS UPGRADE 
 --------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 6.  International credit ratings agency Moody\'s placed 
 South Africa\'s current Baa2 sovereign rating on review for 
 a possible upgrade, committing the agency to a decision 
 within three months.  A further incremental upgrade by 
 Moody\'s would place South Africa in the \'upper\' investment 
 grade category of Baa1, two levels above investment grade. 
 Other international ratings agencies, such as Standard & 
 Poor\'s and Fitch currently rank South Africa at one level 
 above investment grade: however, Moody\'s has traditionally 
 been the first to upgrade.  Upgrading South Africa\'s 
 credit rating will put the country in a better position to 
 attract significant capital inflows, while reducing the 
 cost of borrowing in the offshore markets.  Countries such 
 as China, Malaysia and Thailand have Baa1 rankings; with 
 higher economic growth rates, they have attracted more 
 foreign direct investment (FDI).   Moody\'s imminent 
 upgrade of South Africa\'s rating is another endorsement of 
 the country\'s minimal reliance on foreign debt, improved 
 external liquidity position and its macroeconomic 
 policies.  Moody\'s cited South Africa\'s weak economic 
 growth relative to other emerging market countries and low 
 levels of foreign reserves as constraints to its rating. 
 Moody\'s did note the strong economic performance this 
 year, particularly a strong upturn in investment spending 
 and robust demand, and South Africa\'s improved 
 international liquidity position.  Source:  Business 
 Report, October 17. 
 
 IMPROVEMENT BUT POVERTY STILL HIGH 
 ---------------------------------- 
 
 7.  Research Survey\'s 2004 poverty index ranking improved 
 to 39, up from 43 last year.  The poverty index ranks 
 poverty levels on a scale of 100 with 100 representing 
 extreme poverty and 0 representing complete affluence. 
 Details of the survey, conducted among a sample of 3,504 
 citizens, concentrated on a special poverty index based on 
 the provision of basic services, access to 
 telecommunications and transport, and adequacy of 
 nutrition.  Three groups fared the worst in the rankings, 
 including:  (1) those living in rural farm workers\' 
 quarters at 70; (2) those living in urban squatter shacks 
 at 63; and (3) those living in rural villages at 60.  The 
 quality of life improved once people had formal dwellings. 
 People in formal houses in the former townships scored 30. 
 The survey highlighted the inequalities which exist 
 between the various population groups, with blacks living 
 in townships and informal settlements scoring an overall 
 average of 47 (improving from 51 last year), while those 
 living in mostly white suburbs scored a high ranking of 
 eight.  By province, the poorest were the Eastern Cape at 
 50 (improving from 53), Limpopo at 48 (improving from 50) 
 and Mpumalanga at 47 (improving from 56).  The wealthiest 
 live in the Western Cape and Gauteng, scoring 22 and 27 
 respectively.  One in five adult South Africans said they 
 could not afford to eat the correct foods.  This figure 
 rose to one in four people for the over 50 population, and 
 one in three for those at the bottom end of the income 
 ladder and the unemployed.  Source:  SAPA, October 18. 
 
 STUDY REVEALS NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT TRENDS 
 ---------------------------------------- 
 
 8.  The Development Policy Research unit of University of 
 Cape Town\'s School of Economics released an employment 
 study commissioned by the President\'s Office.  Its 
 findings described employment trends between 1994 and 
 2002.  The South African economy created 1.6 million jobs, 
 however, the labor force increased by 5 million.  For 
 every 100 South Africans seeking employment, only 32 found 
 work of some kind.  In addition, unemployment among 
 university graduates has, proportionally, increased more 
 than in any other education sector -- with African 
 graduates hit the worst.  The study cited possible reasons 
 for high unemployment among African university graduates 
 including the perceived quality of the tertiary 
 institution that students attended, the public sector 
 restructuring with public sector being a major source of 
 black African employment, and training in fields with less 
 employment potential.  Source:  Cape Argus, October 15. 
 LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATOR RISES 
 -------------------------------- 
 
 9.  South Africa\'s August 2004 leading economic indicator, 
 compiled by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), 
 increased 10.7 percent (y/y) compared to July\'s 11 percent 
 increase.  Contributing positively to growth were average 
 manufacturing hours worked, job advertisements, 
 manufacturing orders, building plans approved, business 
 confidence, the interest rate spread between the money 
 market and capital market instruments, equity prices, and 
 real M1 money supply.  Negative factors were the 
 inventory/sales ratio, commodity prices, and the leading 
 indicator of major developed countries.  The SARB in March 
 2004 revised its leading and coincident business cycle 
 indicators, the second revision since it first published 
 business cycle indicators in 1983.  The leading indicator 
 has been pared down to 13 components from 21, while the 
 coincident indicator has been cut to 5 from 7.  The new 
 indicators are also less volatile than the old indicators, 
 while the lead time for the leading indicators has been 
 extended to 15 months from the previous 11.5 months.

 SOUTH AFRICA\'S POOR ARE SAVING 
 ------------------------------ 
 
 10.  Research by FinMark Trust, presented to the annual 
 South African Savings Institute\'s symposium, highlights 
 how low income households save.  The informal savings 
 industry is fairly well developed already, with burial 
 societies (where monthly payments are made to cover 
 funeral costs) and stokvels (where members deposit monthly 
 and withdraw annually) often the most popular forms of 
 community-based savings schemes.  5.6 million people in 
 the lowest income categories try to save regularly and 
 many poor people demonstrate a propensity to save. 
 However, most South Africans would prefer a bank account 
 to informal savings schemes, with confidence in bank 
 accounts fairly high, even among the poor.  Bank accounts 
 are the most popular form and the preferred method of 
 actual savings with 10.3 million out of 13.2 million 
 savers in South Africa holding bank accounts.   This 
 finding holds with people in the lowest income brackets as 
 well.  The informal and formal parts of the financial 
 services industry are interlinked.   FinMark Trust says 
 about 75 percent of stokvels have group bank accounts.  It 
 also appears that, as incomes improve, savers do not 
 abandon informal methods of savings, such as burial 
 societies and stokvels.   Ross Esson, a Cape Town 
 postgraduate student, presented research at the conference 
 showing that burial societies were the most popular forms 
 of savings among people in Cape Town\'s largest townships, 
 Khayelitsha and Mitchell\'s Plain, particularly among those 
 who earned relatively high wages.  Bank savings as a 
 proportion of total savings increased as incomes grew, but 
 stokvel savings remained relatively stable across all 
 income categories surveyed.  Females, although 41 percent 
 more likely than men to save, would tend to save less than 
 males, mainly because their income levels were lower. 
 Source:  Business Day, October 19. 
 
 11.  Comment.  Historically, the major South African banks 
 have ignored servicing the low-income population.  South 
 African banks earn more from bank charges than from 
 returns of investment capital.  Servicing the \'unbanked\' 
 population and increasing the savings rate are current 
 government objectives.  Approximately 30 percent of South 
 Africans (over 13 million) are without a bank account. 
 Next week, the government will announce a low-cost banking 
 initiative that should improve access to banking in all 
 geographic areas.  The new national bank account, or 
 \'Mzansi\' account, will be launched on October 25th by the 
 big four South African banks as well as Postbank, the 
 South African Post Office\'s savings institution.  The 
 Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) financial sector charter 
 drove this banking initiative.  In addition, the National 
 Treasury has recently introduced a retail bond in order to 
 encourage a savings culture among the population.  End 
 comment. 
 
 ECONOMY SHOULD ATTRACT INCREASED INVESTMENT 
 ------------------------------------------- 
 12.  Increased local and foreign direct investment will 
 lead to improved growth as the benefits of inflation- 
 targeting begin to impact South Africa\'s economy, 
 according to Martin Jankelowitz, head of market and 
 economic research at Investment Solutions.  A virtuous 
 circle will impact the economy as rand strength, leading 
 to lower inflation, facilitated by declining nominal 
 interest rates, will provide strong returns on local 
 assets and expanding business opportunities.  Spending by 
 consumers, the primary beneficiaries of the low inflation, 
 low interest-rate environment, has increased by over 4 
 percent during the last three quarters.  Private fixed 
 investment increased by 5.4 percent, supporting the view 
 that the benefits of inflation targeting are starting to 
 be felt.  The South African Investec PMI, essentially a 
 manufacturing activity index, indicates that manufacturing 
 is expanding at its fastest pace in almost two years, with 
 all the underlying sub-indices strong, notably business 
 activity and new sales orders.  Significantly, the 
 Employment Index has remained above 50 (indicating 
 expansion) for six consecutive months. With business 
 confidence indicators at a record high, expectations 
 remain optimistic.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, October 20.

REF:  (A) STATE 223549, (B) PRETORIA 4532 
 
(U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Not for 
Internet Distribution. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  Ambassador Frazer discussed the Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations and raised U.S. concerns 
about Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) in her meeting with 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Minister Mpaphlwa on 
October 19.  She underscored U.S. goals for a comprehensive 
FTA that covers all issues.  She explained an \"early 
harvest\" would not work.  The Minister was receptive to the 
Ambassador\'s call for senior leadership, and suggested we 
\"cascade up to the political level and give some fresh 
political direction on what we agree.\"  Drawing on demarche 
points in reftel A, the Ambassador noted support for BEE but 
raised continuing concerns about clarity in compliance with 
charters and equity transfer issues.  The Minister 
acknowledged that the government would have to address these 
issues, and referred to Amcham\'s memo expressing concerns 
about equity.  He hopes to issue the BEE Codes of Good 
Practice and appoint the members to the Advisory Council on 
BEE to the President before the end of the year. End 
Summary. 
 
------------- 
U.S.-SACU FTA 
------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Ambassador Frazer met with DTI Minister Mandisi 
Mpahlwa at his office on October 21. She underscored the 
U.S. perspective on the FTA as a comprehensive agreement 
that would expand trade and investment, and make AGOA 
benefits permanent for the Southern African Customs Union 
(SACU).  It would have to include all Phase 1 and Phase 2 
(e.g., procurement, intellectual property) issues.  An 
\"early harvest\" would not work with our Congress, private 
sector, or legislation.  There was room for flexibility, for 
example in the phasing in of the provisions of the FTA. She 
noted that after 18 months of negotiations there is still no 
agreement on even a single line of text.  She called for 
senior leadership by the Minister working with USTR 
Ambassador Zoellick as a way to move the process forward. 
She also noted that one problem has been that publicly the 
U.S. side has been making statements that are positive, 
while the SACU side has been saying things that are 
negative, adding, \"It doesn\'t help.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) Minister Mpahlwa was cordial throughout the 45- 
minute meeting.  He referred positively to the contacts 
between DTI Director General Alistair Ruiters and Deputy 
USTR Josette Shiner.  He noted the DG had mentioned to him 
the problem about statements made publicly by South 
Africans, including one in New York and some things that 
Iqbal (Sharma) has said.  \"I take your point very well.\"  As 
for the status of the negotiations, the Minister got the 
sense that at some stage it became too difficult in the 
negotiations because of simply bad chemistry between our 
negotiators or because the U.S. and SACU perspectives on the 
FTA were not the same. 
 
4.  (SBU) At the same time, the Minister noted SACU\'s lack of 
capacity compared to the United States and the \"intensity\" 
of the WTO negotiations as other factors. He lamented that 
he had not been able to meet with Ambassador Zoellick to 
have a bilateral on the FTA during the multilateral meetings 
in Mauritius (ACP) and Brazil (UNCTAD) where the focus was 
on other issues. Having lost time, he echoed the Ambassador 
by suggesting the need \"to cascade up to the political level 
and give some fresh political direction on what we agree.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) Victor Mashabela of the Americas desk added that 
both sides were far apart on perspective and philosophy.  He 
referred to the difficulties in negotiating the terms of 
reference, particularly on such issues as SACU\'s insistence 
on asymmetry and not going beyond the WTO.  Thus, it was not 
too surprising that it became difficult. (Comment: the 
Minister himself did not comment on the substance of the 
SACU perspective.) 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador reiterated the need to go to a 
higher political level in order to find commonality on 
principles, given that the negotiations were bogged down in 
set positions.  She suggested that after the elections the 
United States and SACU meet at the political level to find a 
way forward.  The Minister was uncertain how to proceed but 
was receptive to the idea, and agreed to touch base with the 
Ambassador after the elections and share expectations.  He 
noted there would be a SACU meeting on December 9. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) The Ambassador drew on reftel talking points on 
Black Economic Empowerment.  She explained that U.S. 
companies are committed to BEE and noted their successful 
efforts in broad based empowerment activities.  At the same 
time, they need clarity in understanding how to comply with 
BEE legislation and charters.  The main concern is equity 
ownership and uncertainty about requirements, such as how 
scorecards and codes of good practice will apply. 
A big issue for U.S. companies is to be able to offset 
equity requirements with other areas in scorecard.  For some 
companies, sharing equity would be very difficult because of 
corporate law, policy, and shareholders.  There were also 
questions about having to comply with different charters. 
Companies that operate across different sectors wonder 
whether they have to deal with multiple charters or just one 
and ask to whom do they answer.  She was raising these 
concerns and questions with the Minister because DTI is the 
focal point for implementation of BEE. 
 
8.  (SBU) Minister Mpahlwa thanked the Ambassador and 
acknowledged that the government would have to address these 
issues.  He noted that when he spoke at the American Chamber 
of Commerce breakfast a few weeks ago (reftel B) that 
\"clearly equity is a concern.\"  He also referred to a 
memorandum on BEE issues that Amcham gave him and their very 
deep concerns about equity, especially in the proposed ICT 
(information, communications, technology) charter. 
 
9.  (SBU) The Minister referred to the President\'s Advisory 
Council on the Information Society, which includes the CEOs 
of the biggest companies, such as Hewlett Packard, Oracle, 
and Microsoft.  He said President Mbeki said he gave them 
the commitment \"that we will deal with their issues and 
concerns.\"  The Minister said it would have to be an 
accommodating approach in dealing with these issues. He 
underscored that \"we are alive to these issues.\" 
 
10.  (SBU) The Minister also elaborated on differences in the 
process of developing the ICT Charter compared to the 
approach they had in Financial Services Charter. One 
disadvantage is that in the Financial Service Charter, there 
was a reference group composed of three people representing 
the President\'s Office, DTI, and the National Treasury. 
They could interact in the process and help for a smoother 
process. Such a group does not exist for the ICT charter. 
Moreover, the proposed ICT charter has not yet been brought 
to DTI. 
 
11.  (SBU) Minister Mpahlwa said there were \"many angles\" 
about BEE that are coming to the government\'s attention.  In 
particular, he noted the Italian Ambassador had met him the 
day before and raised issues related to a series of existing 
bilateral agreements that protect investments and questions 
about whether these agreements could be violated by such 
things as the Mining Act and charter.  He said, \"We have to 
look at those angles.\" 
 
12.  (SBU) The Minister committed generally on the BEE points 
raised by the Ambassador saying, \"As the lead, I will see to 
it that these issues will be brought to the attention of the 
Cabinet, so at least Cabinet can be apprised of what some of 
the issues are.\" 
 
13.  (SBU) The Minister also briefly discussed the scorecard 
and the Codes of Good Practice, which he said DTI intends to 
issue soon in order to provide some common base to evaluate 
the empowerment process. The work on the codes is pretty 
much done.  Those in phase one will come out soon while 
those in phase two will come out much later.  He underlined 
that the government is proposing a broad approach to 
empowerment that is not just about equity.  He said equity 
is only a small part of it, and also important are such 
areas as enterprise development and human resource 
development. 
 
14.  (SBU) The Minister also referred to upcoming 
appointments to the Advisory Council on BEE to the 
President.  While he expects criticism regardless of who is 
on the Council, he said they would need solid people who 
will inspire confidence in the broad based aspects of 
empowerment and can engage on these issues.  There will be 
four ministers, representing government, as well as private 
sector representation, but he said it should not just be big 
players from Gauteng province and Johannesburg.  There could 
also be representatives from academia, the NGO community, 
and unions.  He hopes to have the appointments done before 
the end of the year.

SUBJECT:  TRADE LINKAGES DRIVING SOUTH AFRICA\'S BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGOLA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jendayi E. Frazer for reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Conversations with several Angola watchers 
from government, business, and academia yielded the common 
theme that South Africa\'s relationship with Angola will over 
the coming years be defined by burgeoning trade linkages 
between the two.  South African firms are investing heavily 
in nearly all sectors of the Angolan economy, and no one sees 
signs of this abating.  Government-to-government relations 
are cordial and focused on facilitating increased economic 
integration, although underlying historical, cultural, and 
racial tensions will likely keep the two governments from 
cultivating close ties.   No contacts gave much credence to 
speculation of a growing political rivalry between the two 
countries, as Angola\'s inward focus and South Africa\'s desire 
to bolster its global and regional influence are markedly 
divergent priorities over at least the next 10 years.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CHECKERED HISTORY STILL AFFECTS RELATIONSHIP 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  South Africa\'s long and checkered history in 
Angola-particularly the pre-1994 apartheid government\'s 
attempts to undermine Angola\'s independence movement and, 
later, the MPLA government-still mars relations that are 
increasingly cordial but hampered by latent tensions.  The 
apartheid regime\'s involvement began in the mid-1960s, when 
Pretoria began seconding military assets to the Portuguese 
military to help it combat the insurgency that began in 1961. 
 After the MPLA took power after independence in 1975, South 
Africa swung its support to UNITA in an attempt to topple the 
communist-oriented government.  From 1975 until the early 
1990s, Pretoria plied UNITA with military assistance and, 
during the mid-1980s, sent South African forces to fight 
against Cuban troops backing the Angolan Government.  Many of 
the South African combatants came from the infamous 32 
\"Buffalo\" Battalion, which was mostly made up of native 
Angolan troops.  Several thousand 32 Battalion members and 
their families still live in South Africa today. 
 
3.  (C)  On the flip side, relations between the ANC in exile 
and the MPLA were never close.  The Angolan Government was 
always too occupied with its own troubles to play a 
meaningful role in assisting the ANC or pressuring the 
apartheid regime through international and regional forums, 
playing the role of \"free rider\" in SADCC and the Frontline 
States.  CEO of the South Africa-Angola Chamber of Commerce 
Roger Ballard-Tremeer also notes that underlying racial and 
ethnic tensions further undermined relations.  (Comment: 
Ballard-Tremeer is a former diplomat who served as South 
Africa\'s Ambassador to Angola from 1994 to 1996 and retired 
in 2001 after more than 25 years of DFA service.  He also 
serves as a private consultant to South African firms looking 
to invest in Angola.)  He said that after the accession of 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos to the presidency in 1979, there was 
an increasing perception by ANC members that mulatto Angolans 
were beginning to wield an inordinate amount of power in the 
Angolan Government, creating mistrust and a mutual dislike 
between the two sides.  These tensions have largely abated 
today.  However, Ballard-Tremeer said that his successor as 
Ambassador to Angola told elements of the South African 
Government in the late 1990s that Angola\'s black people \"were 
not free,\" a story corroborated by Dr. Sehlare Makgetlaneng, 
the southern Africa director at the Africa Institute of South 
Africa.  Ballard-Tremeer also recounted an anecdote of how 
after the Angolan Government allowed the ANC\'s military arm, 
Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), to open a camp on Angolan soil, the 
MK immediately surrounded the camp with landmines.  This was 
not done to protect the camp from UNITA or the South 
Africans, but rather to keep its MPLA \"allies\" from stealing 
supplies and equipment. 
 
4.  (C)  After South Africa\'s 1994 transition to majority 
rule and Angola\'s 1994-98 cessation of hostilities, relations 
improved beyond outright hostility but still remained cool. 
Ballard-Tremeer noted that the only substantive involvement 
of South Africa in Angola in the 1994-2002 period was in 
attempting to mediate between UNITA and the government, often 
sending a South African envoy (usually former general 
Constand Viljoen) to meet Savimbi secretly.  Luanda knew of 
these meetings and was not happy about them.  Dr. 
Makgetlaneng of the Africa Institute of South Africa also 
noted that Luanda thought Pretoria was not doing enough 
during this time to rein in Anglo-American\'s dealings with 
UNITA, while Angola\'s involvement in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo was another bone of contention in the bilateral 
relationship.  Nonetheless, relations during this time were 
characterized more by benign neglect than outright 
bitterness.  Ballard-Tremeer noted, for example, that limited 
visits by senior South African officials-notably Mandela and 
former Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo-were the result of health 
and security concerns rather than any anti-Angola agenda. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
BUSINESS TIES BOOMING SINCE SAVIMBI\'S DEMISE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The February 2002 death of UNITA leader Jonas 
Savimbi marked a turning point in bilateral relations between 
Angola and South Africa, with the desire of South African 
firms to gain access to the untapped Angolan market spurring 
increased bilateral cooperation.  Ballard-Tremeer said that 
South African entrepreneurs started looking seriously at 
Angola almost immediately after Savimbi\'s death, and in March 
2003 Ballard-Tremeer founded the Angola-South Africa Chamber 
of Commerce to facilitate greater South African investment. 
F.J. Lourenco Fernandes, Angola\'s Trade Representative in 
South Africa, echoed similar sentiments.  He said that he 
opened Angola\'s trade office in Johannesburg in 1996 but that 
there was virtually no interest in Angola until 2002.  Since 
that time, the previously one-man operation has taken on six 
staff members to cope with the demands of liaising with the 
South African Government and local businesses.  He also noted 
that the daily flight between Johannesburg and Luanda is 
nearly 
 always full, mostly with businessmen. 
 
6.  (SBU)  In terms of areas of investment, every contact 
points to nearly endless possibilities.  Fernandes and 
Ballard-Tremeer laid out a laundry list of sectors about 
which they have had discussions with South African firms: 
 
--Infrastructure is probably the preeminent area for South 
African investment, with companies showing interest in 
rehabilitating buildings, roads, and railroads.  Fernandes 
said five South African firms are working on rehab projects 
at the moment and that there were ongoing discussions on 
rehabilitation of the Benguela corridor. 
 
--Fernandes said his government is keen to rejuvenate the 
long dormant tourist industry, and he said a South African 
company is at the moment rebuilding two hotels in Lobito. 
 
--In agriculture, a South African firm has signed an 
agreement to cultivate sugar cane in Benguela, and he has had 
discussions with South African companies about investing in 
cotton, sunflowers, beans, and nuts. 
 
--Fernandes also pointed to the mining industry, particularly 
the diamond sector, as an area ripe for South African 
investment. 
 
--Ballard-Tremeer said there is extensive interest by South 
African businessmen, including heavyweights like Tokyo 
Sexwale, in Angola\'s booming oil and gas sector, although 
little has of yet resulted.  Pipeline reconstruction is 
another area of interest. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Despite the extensive interest and an improved 
business environment, Ballard-Tremeer notes that South 
African firms still encounter many problems when getting 
involved in Angola, particularly because they still do not 
have the proper understanding of Angola\'s business culture. 
The Angolans have a \"Mediterranean\" attitude toward business, 
based around the development of personal relationships, and 
Ballard-Tremeer notes that it is not uncommon for an Angolan 
minister to host an \"open house\" for businessmen that begins 
at 11PM and lasts until dawn.  These customs are quite 
foreign to South African businessmen, who, by contrast, work 
hard to establish contacts but are poor at maintaining them. 
Another difficulty is the fact that Angolans generally speak 
poor English, although this is changing among the younger 
generation, and South Africans speak even less Portuguese. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
INVESTMENT DRIVING POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP 
----------------------------------------- 
8.  (C)  Every contact Poloff spoke with described the 
political relationship as much better since 2002.  Deputy 
President Jacob Zuma has visited Angola twice since 2002, 
most recently in May, while Angolan Foreign Minister Joao de 
Miranda visited Pretoria in 2003.  Cecilia Baptista, 
Political Minister Counselor at the Angolan Embassy in 
Pretoria, waxed enthusiastic about the state of bilateral 
ties in the past two years, noting that the two countries 
have signed agreements dealing with agriculture, education, 
and health.  She said Pretoria has been extremely helpful in 
the health arena, providing extensive training for health 
care professionals.  Baptista also noted that a reciprocal 
promotion of investment agreement was on the verge of being 
signed, an act that Ballard-Tremeer and others thought would 
prove a major boon to trade expansion.   DFA Angola Desk 
Officer Willie de Groot (who has been on the desk for six 
years) shared similar sentiments about the stark improvement 
since 2002.  He said this was helped in part by the attempts 
of current Angolan Ambassador Isaac Maria dos Anjos to 
cultivate bilateral ties, whereas his predecessor distrusted 
Pretoria.  Nonetheless, de Groot still described Angola as 
\"corrupt as hell,\" though he noted that pressure from the IMF 
and United States was changing this.  (Comment: The American 
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, based in Johannesburg, 
is also considering organizing a visit of interested members 
to Angola in 2005 in pursuit of commercial opportunities.) 
 
9.  (C)  Dr. Makgetlaneng\'s view of these improved ties was 
that the business \"tail\" was wagging the political \"dog.\"  He 
opined that Pretoria\'s foreign policy is a delicate balancing 
act between not playing a domineering role in the region and 
also trying to open up regional markets for South African 
firms.  In the case of Angola, the potential for business 
investment is so great that Pretoria treats Luanda with kid 
gloves, especially in the political arena, because it does 
not want to jeopardize these potential business ties. 
Further complicating the political and business relationship, 
he noted, is the fact that many firms interested in Angola 
are Black Economic Empowerment concerns, headed by 
businessmen with close ties to the ANC. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
REGIONAL POLITICAL RIVALRY PROBABLY NOT IN THE CARDS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
10.  (C)  Some analysts have pointed to Angola\'s amazing 
economic potential, newfound political stability, and 
powerful military as factors that could lead it to play a 
more prominent political role in the region, possibly even 
challenging South Africa\'s regional hegemony some day.  No 
one Poloff spoke with gave this hypothesis any credence, with 
most contacts noting that Angola has shown no greater 
interest in engaging in international, pan-African, or 
regional forums since 2002.  Ballard-Tremeer said that 
Angolan representatives still are often absent or 
non-participatory in multilateral meetings, while de Groot 
described Angola\'s ongoing tenure on the United Nations 
Security Council as a non-event from a South African 
standpoint.  The only grouping in which Angola seemed to show 
much interest was in PALOP, the African lusophone union. 
Overall, contacts believed that Angola would continue to be 
motivated above all else by self-enrichment, avoiding greater 
multilateral commitments unless they made economic sense. 
Hence, South Africa\'s role as the regional superpower seems 
secure for the foreseeable future.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: AMBASSADOR MEETS MINISTER OF 
MINERALS AND ENERGY 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jendayi E. Frazer, Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Jendayi Frazer called on Minister 
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka of the Department of Minerals and 
Energy (DME) on October 19, 2004.  Ambassador Frazer stressed 
the need to move ahead on scheduling our first Joint Standing 
Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation and to bring closure 
to our research and development agreements on nuclear energy 
and on nuclear materials safeguards technologies. 
Mlambo-Ngcuka mentioned DME\'s objective to encourage oil and 
gas exploration on South Africa\'s continental shelf.  She was 
disappointed that Forest Oil (Denver) and PetroSA were unable 
to locate more natural gas in their offshore Ibhubesi field, 
but was appreciative of the support that the U.S. Trade 
Development Agency had provided the project and PetroSA.  She 
mentioned DME\'s intention to develop the jewelry industry in 
South Africa, but that this first required loosening controls 
on the possession of precious metals and diamonds in South 
Africa.  Mlambo-Ngcuka said that she wanted to bring the 
interagency dialogue on DME\'s Vehicle Emissions Strategy to a 
close by the end of this year.  She said that if MMT, the 
fuel additive sold in South Africa by Afton Chemical 
(Richmond, Virginia), were disallowed, the government would 
have to devise an \"elegant exit\" for Afton.  End Summary. 
 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Ambassador Frazer made her introductory call on 
Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka on October 19.  Also attending the 
meeting was Acting Head of Ministerial Services Sandile Tya 
Tya and Econoff.  Mlambo-Ngcuka, who has a reputation as one 
of the more effective ministers, began her second term as DME 
minister in April.  During her first term, she supervised the 
creation of the country\'s first black economic empowerment 
charters in the liquid fuels and minerals sectors. 
Mlambo-Ngcuka also was temporarily the acting Minister of 
Science and Technology when the post fell vacant in the run 
up to national elections in 2004. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: In 2002-04, Mlambo-Ngcuka\'s husband and 
former Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulenani Ngcuka, 
headed a corruption investigation involving Deputy President 
Jacob Zuma.  In the course of the investigation, Zuma 
supporters accused Ngcuka of being a former spy for the 
apartheid regime, and of abusing his authority.  In 2004, 
President Mbeki commissioned a hearing that exonerated 
Ngcuka.  The spotlight took its toll, however, and Ngcuka 
resigned his position in August 2004.  He is now involved in 
a black economic empowerment enterprise Amabubezi along with 
some well known black business leaders.  Mlambo-Ngcuka 
appears to have emerged unscathed from all the publicity 
surrounding her husband. End Comment. 
 
Nuclear Energy Cooperation 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Ambassador Frazer began the meeting by stressing the 
need to establish a United States-South Africa Joint Standing 
Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC) and to 
decide on an inaugural date as soon as possible.  The United 
States was prepared to come to South Africa December 1-3 to 
facilitate the inaugural meeting, but needed confirmation as 
soon as possible.  Ambassador Frazer also emphasized the need 
to bring closure to two research and development agreements 
in the area of nuclear energy and materials safeguards 
technologies.  These agreements established the framework 
within which cooperative technical projects could be pursued. 
 Mlambo-Ngcuka said that she would look into the JSCNEC and 
the agreements and get back to the Ambassador by October 21. 
(Note: On October 28, Sandile Tya Tya told Econoff that 
Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka still needed to be briefed by Deputy 
Director Nelisiwe Magubane and Chief Director Tseliso 
Maqubela on these subjects, but that Maqubela had told Tya 
Tya that holding the JSCNEC inaugural meeting in December 
\"was most likely.\"  Maqubela also told him that the 
agreements were in advanced stages, i.e., \"ready to be 
signed.\"  Earlier, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
informed the Embassy that an interagency meeting scheduled on 
October 22 to discuss the JSCNEC and R&D agreements had been 
postponed to October 29, to ensure the participation of all 
relevant officials.  The Embassy continues to actively press 
for an inaugural JSCNEC and the conclusion of the R&D 
agreements.) 
 
Ibhubesi Gas Field 
------------------ 
 
5. (C) Mlambo-Ngcuka was a bit disappointed that Forest Oil 
and PetroSA were not able to locate more natural gas reserves 
in the Ibhubesi field off the Western Cape during their 
recent drilling campaign.  She said that the Petroleum Agency 
of South Africa (PASA) was doing everything it could to 
promote oil and gas exploration on South Africa\'s continental 
shelf.  The problem had been that, until now, not much 
resource had been found.  She was appreciative of the U.S. 
Trade and Development Agency\'s support for Ibhubesi project 
and technical assistance to PetroSA.  Econoff mentioned that 
Forest Oil felt it had enough reserves at this time to 
justify a small power plant in the Western Cape, and that 
such a plant would provide valuable peaking power to the 
region.  Mlambo-Ngcuka agreed, adding that one of DME\'s 
objectives was to diversify away from coal for environmental 
reasons.  She also mentioned that on October 22 South Africa 
would sign an agreement with Namibia, Angola, Botswana, and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the development of a 
$4 billion hydroelectric dam at the Inga Rapids on the Congo 
River. 
 
Adding Value: Jewelry 
--------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Mlambo-Ngcuka explained DME\'s objective to create a 
domestic jewelry industry.  South Africa was an important 
source of gold, platinum, diamonds, and semi-precious stones. 
 She saw no reason why South Africa should export these 
commodities to Italy when they could be fashioned into 
jewelry in South Africa and used to advance black economic 
empowerment.  First, the government had to modify the law to 
allow the development of an indigenous industry by loosening 
the controls so that small businesses could acquire precious 
metals and stones for the purpose of manufacturing jewelry. 
She hoped that South Africa would be exporting jewelry to the 
United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
within five years.  (Note: South Africa may export most 
jewelry items to the U.S. duty free under the Generalized 
System of Preferences.) 
 
Vehicle Emissions Strategy: MMT 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) At the close of the meeting, Econoff mentioned Afton 
Chemical\'s effort to receive a fair hearing on the use of 
MMT, a fuel additive and replacement for lead, in South 
Africa.  South Africa had been considering banning MMT as 
part of its Vehicle Emissions Strategy.  Mlambo-Ngcuka agreed 
that whatever South Africa decided to do with MMT, it should 
be fair and based on sound science, but added that there 
seemed to be a balance of scientific research for and against 
the fuel additive.  She said that one idea had been for the 
government to give the consumer a say (e.g., through labeling 
at the pump), but the Department of Environment and Tourism 
seemed to be \"dead against it.\"  Whatever the government 
decided, she said that it would need to take into account all 
of the costs and benefits.  If it turned out that MMT were 
disallowed, then the government would have to devise \"an 
elegant exit\" for Afton Chemical and the refiners that used 
MMT -- meaning some sort of phase out over a number of years. 
 One way or the other, she wanted to bring deliberations on 
the Vehicle Emissions Strategy to a close by the end of the 
year.

SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC NEWSLETTER 
           OCTOBER 29, 2004 ISSUE 
 
 
1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
 economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
 Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
 opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
 newsletter are: 
 -  New Bank Account Aimed at Poor; 
 -  Mid Term Expenditure Framework Submitted to Parliament; 
 -  Consumer Inflation Subdued; 
 -  European Firm Survey Optimistic on SA Economy; 
 -  Producer Prices Remain Low 
 End Summary. 
 
New Bank Account Aimed at Poor 
------------------------------ 
 
 
2.  South African banks introduced a new national banking 
 account, Mzansi, aimed at attracting the over 13 million 
 South Africans not participating in the formal financial 
 sector.  The government\'s goal of banking the \'unbanked\' 
 population drove this low-cost account via the Black 
 Economic Empowerment (BEE) financial services charter. 
 Government hopes to reach this goal by encouraging banks 
 to lower their historically high bank charges and increase 
 the number of ATMs and branches in lower-income areas. 
 Charges for the Mzansi account vary between banks and 
 range from 30 percent to 60 percent less than charges on 
 previous account offerings.  Typical bank charges for 
 Mzanzi accounts include ATM cash withdrawals and cash 
 deposits, with each bank charging different amounts.  The 
 bank charges for ATM cash withdrawals range between R3.25 
 ($0.52, using 6.2 rands per dollar) and R5 ($.81).  Bank 
 charges for cash deposits range from R4 ($0.65) to R10.75 
 ($1.73).  Other types of charges also vary by bank.  FNB 
 charges the lowest rates for using the Mzansi card as a 
 debit card to pay for goods, while ABSA bank charges no 
 fee to open a new account, has no minimum balance 
 requirements, and does not charge for failed transactions 
 when funds are inadequate.  A deposit of R20 ($3.23) is 
 required to open an account, and some banks require a 
 minimum account balance as well.  South African banks 
 pooled their infrastructure costs of establishing Mzansi 
 accounts, which means that 12,000 ATMs are available to 
 every Mzansi account holder.  So far, the big four South 
 African banks and Postbank, the post office\'s savings 
 institution, are the only one offering the Mzansi account.

MID TERM EXPENDITURE FRAMEWORK SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  Every October, the Finance Minister presents the 
 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), which 
 highlights the South African budget framework for the next 
 three years.  MTBPS updates economic growth and revenue 
 and expenditure forecasts and suggests potential policy 
 changes that would support the government\'s key 
 priorities.  Key highlights of Finance Minister Trevor 
 Manuel\'s speech included:  (1) relaxation of foreign 
 exchange controls on South African corporations; (2) an 
 additional R50 billion ($8 billion) aimed at poverty 
 alleviation, infrastructure improvements and increased 
 wages of teachers and police; (3) no substantial tax 
 changes; and (4) increased budget deficit in 2005/6, 
 rising to 3.5 percent of GDP compared to 3.2 percent in 
 2004/05.  GDP forecasted growth for the next two years 
 were revised, reaching 3.9 and 3.7 percent 2005 and 2006, 
 compared to February 2004\'s forecasts of 3.6 and 4 percent 
 respectively.  Fiscal policy continues to remain slightly 
 expansionary in the short term.  In FY 2005, the deficit 
 as a percentage of GDP should reach 3.2 percent and then 
 gradually decline to 2.5 percent by FY2007, as revenues 
 should increase by 10 percent and expenditures by 9 
 percent over the two-year period.  High growth in social 
 services spending puts increasing pressure on government 
 expenditures.  Welfare and social security spending 
 (including child support, disability and elderly grants) 
 constitute the fastest growing share of overall 
 expenditures, increasing from 18.6 percent of total 
 government expenditures in FY 2004 to 20 percent by 2007. 
 Health spending shares will remain relatively constant at 
 12.5 percent in FY2004 and reaching 12.6 percent by 2007. 
 Little change in tax policy was announced.  Gross tax 
 revenue for 2004/05 is expected to be R1.9 billion higher 
 than the February 2004.  Corporate taxes are expected be 
 R6.2 billion less than budgeted, higher value added and 
 personal tax revenues offset weaker corporate tax 
 collections.  The inflation rate, consumer prices 
 excluding mortgages (CPIX) remains well within the 
 targeted 3-6 percent range at 5 percent over the next 
 three years.  Source:  Business Day and Business Report, 
 October 27; Standard Bank\'s MTEF Alert, October 26. 
 
4.   Comment.  The most unexpected announcement was the 
 relaxation of exchange rate controls for corporations. 
 The present rules limits offshore investments to R2 
 billion per project for investments in Africa and R1 
 billion elsewhere, in addition to 20 percent of the excess 
 cost.  Now, the limits on outward investments by local 
 corporations and restrictions on the repatriation for 
 foreign dividends are removed as well as restrictions on 
 individuals to invest in foreign firms listed on the South 
 African exchanges.  Even though there are no restrictions 
 on corporations\' foreign direct investment, corporations 
 will still be required to apply to the Reserve Bank for 
 approval.  Limits on pension funds, insurance companies, 
 mutual funds (unit trusts) and individuals are still in 
 place but expectations are that they will be removed soon. 
 More relaxed exchange controls for corporations should 
 help the government\'s goal of investment reaching 25 
 percent of GDP by 2014.  End Comment. 
 
CONSUMER INFLATION SUBDUED 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  In September, consumer prices increased 1.3 percent 
 (y/y) slightly higher than August\'s y/y increase of 1 
 percent, and consumer prices excluding mortgages (CPIX) 
 increased 3.7 percent well within the market expectations 
 of 3.9 percent.  Increases in transport and food explained 
 much of September\'s increase in prices while declines in 
 housing and medical care and expenses offset the sharp 
 increase in transport expenses.  Administered prices 
 (price set by either government or official regulatory 
 body rather than the market) continued to show strong 
 growth, increasing by 7.4 percent in September.  Food 
 inflation increased of 1.6 percent annually compared to 
 1.4 percent in August.  So far, rain in South Africa has 
 not been sufficient to plant, although increased imports 
 can increase domestic food supplies.   Rising food costs 
 and oil prices are potential future risks, although the 
 current rand strength will mitigate the impact of 
 increased inflation coming from imports.  Source:

 P 0141.1 and Discussion Document, Administered Prices 
 September 2004. 
 
EUROPEAN FIRM SURVEY OPTIMISTIC ON SA ECONOMY 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  The Bilateral Chamber Consultative Committee, an 
 informal group of business chambers representing about 
 3000 foreign companies with more than R360 billion ($58 
 billion) investments in South Africa conducted a survey 
 among 252 of its member companies from May to June 2004 
 and its findings were presented to Parliament\'s Trade and 
 Industry Portfolio Committee.  Germany, France, the UK, 
 Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland were 
 represented in the survey.   Of the companies that 
 responded, 59 percent said developments in Zimbabwe had 
 affected their businesses, while 79 percent rated 
 government\'s HIV/AIDS policy as \"bad to very bad\".  In the 
 recent survey, 78 percent of respondents found the economy 
 to be satisfactory to excellent, compared with 31 percent 
 in 2002, and 95 percent expected it to remain the same or 
 improve.  Sixty percent felt that investment would 
 increase and 47 percent had created new jobs.   Fourteen 
 percent of firms indicated intentions to disinvest, citing 
 this as a natural process within globalization.  A 
 reasonable return on investment, cheap electricity and a 
 competitive marketplace were some of the positive economic 
 features cited, though the rand\'s volatility had caused 
 problems.  Levels of confidence in the government had 
 strengthened considerably, with 53 percent expressing 
 increased confidence, compared with only 32 percent in 
 2002.  Relative confidence was expressed in the future of 
 a market-driven economy (70 percent), balanced taxation 
 (53 percent), democracy (46 percent), political leadership 
 (34 percent), and equal opportunities for foreign business 
 (32 percent).  However, significant concern was expressed 
 over corruption, the competence of the civil service, 
 inflexible labor regulations and crime and violence. 
 There was strong pessimism about the accountability of 
 trade unions, labor productivity, investment incentives, 
 and the free transfer of funds out of South Africa.  While 
 the survey findings were positive in many areas, some ANC 
 Members of Parliament, including committee chairman Ben 
 Martins, latched on to the negative perceptions and 
 expressed skepticism about its objectivity and the 
 validity of the findings, questioning the reasons for 
 including question about Zimbabwe on the survey and 
 arguing that Zimbabwe was no different to any other 
 African country.  Source:  Business Day, October 25. 
PRODUCER PRICES REMAIN LOW 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  The producer price index (PPI) increased 1.4 percent 
 in September, lower than the Reuters consensus view of 1.8 
 percent.  The main contributors to September\'s rise were 
 increases in the prices of petroleum and coal products as 
 well as the prices of basic metals.  While oil prices are 
 still high, the rand maintained its strength, averaging 
 R6.5 per dollar in September.  The rand has strengthened 
 further in October, offsetting some of the inflationary 
 impact of rising oil prices.  Domestic producer prices 
 increased by 2.4 percent while imported producer prices 
 declined by 1.7 percent.  Lower electricity prices, 
 declining by 28 percent as Eskom switched from higher 
 winter prices to summer, contributed to September\'s 
 moderation in producer inflation.  Source:  Business 
 Report, October 29; Standard Bank PPI Alert, October 29.

SUBJECT: MINISTER RADEBE ON OPEN SKIES 
 
Classified By: Acting Econ Chief Alan Tousignant.  Reason 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DoT) 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International 
Affairs Susan McDermott met with South Africa\'s Minister of 
Transport Jeffrey Radebe and Dr. Ian Phillips, Special 
Advisor to the Minister, on October 27, 2004 at the 
Minister\'s parliamentary office in Cape Town.  The meeting 
followed up on an Open Skies discussion between Radebe and 
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta at the 35th 
ICAO Assembly in Montreal, September 2004.  Radebe 
acknowledged Open Skies benefits outlined by McDermott and 
called for the United States and South Africa to form 
\"technical teams\" to discuss a proposed Open Skies agreement. 
 Restructuring and new management at Transnet, South Africa\'s 
administrator of state-owned transportation enterprises, may 
make this an auspicious time to engage South Africa on an 
Open Skies agreement.  The Minister expressed keen interest 
in the organizational structure of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DoT).  McDermott invi 
ted Radebe to visit Secretary Mineta in the United States and 
to meet with DoT administrators.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Department of Transportation (DoT) Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs Susan 
 
SIPDIS 
McDermott met with South Africa\'s Minister of Transport 
Jeffrey Radebe and Dr. Ian Phillips, Special Advisor to the 
Minister, on October 27, 2004 at the Minister\'s parliamentary 
office in Cape Town.  The meeting was scheduled to follow up 
on an Open Skies discussion between Radebe and U.S. Secretary 
of Transportation Norm Mineta at the 35th ICAO Assembly in 
Montreal, September 2004. 
 
3.  (U) Radebe (pronounced \"ha-Day-bay\") and Phillips warmly 
greeted DAS McDermott.  McDermott briefly mentioned the Safe 
Skies for Africa Aviation Security Workshop taking place in 
Johannesburg from Oct. 26-28.  She also thanked Radebe for 
the good relationship that exists between South Africa and 
the United States and expressed her hope that the 
relationship could be expanded through increased aviation 
collaboration. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
AN OPEN SKIES OVERVIEW - DAS MCDERMOTT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) McDermott provided a thorough overview of Open 
Skies and detailed likely benefits to tourism, trade, as well 
as more accessible and affordable transportation for 
passengers and cargo.  Although the United States is not 
fully utilizing its current bilateral agreement with South 
Africa, McDermott emphasized the importance of a broad 
aviation framework for future growth.  She said a liberal 
aviation agreement such as Open Skies conveys a message that 
South Africa is \"open for business,\" flexible, and committed 
to unlimited commercial opportunity.  McDermott cited LAN 
Chile as an example of how an Open Skies agreement can not 
only increase regional aviation services, but also 
dramatically improve the profitability and efficiencies of an 
airline.  She said that South Africa is well positioned to 
accomplish similar results in Africa.  McDermott said, 
however, that because of Africa\'s high cost of transport, 
potential players are squandering many African Growth and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA) preferences and sa 
id, \"You can\'t trade if you can\'t get there.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) McDermott also reviewed the important role of 
codeshares and alliances in servicing communities and in 
developing a global aviation network.  She explained the 
benefits of anti-trust immunity and said it may be considered 
only for Open Skies partners involved in pro-competitive 
codeshare arrangements.  In conclusion, McDermott said she 
appreciated the opportunity to present two ideas for Radebe\'s 
consideration:  1) Open Skies as a market development tool 
and a welcome sign for investment; and 2) a vital tool of 
real benefit to South African Airways (SAA) as it moves into 
a global alliance arrangement. 
 
----------------- 
RADEBE\'S RESPONSE 
----------------- 
 
7.  (C) Radebe (previously the Minister of Public 
Enterprises) thanked McDermott for her comprehensive overview 
of Open Skies and agreed that without transport links, trade 
cannot develop to its full potential.  Radebe acknowledged 
that this problem is crippling Africa\'s development. 
Reviewing the importance of intra-African integration, he 
said that the Yamoussoukro Declaration and Decisions aim to 
liberalize Africa\'s aviation industry in the same manner as 
Open Skies.  The Minister said that \"regrettably\" not much 
has been implemented.  However, he said that African 
Ministers of Transport would meet in South Africa during the 
first quarter of 2005 to further the Yamoussoukro accord. 
 
8.  (C) Radebe was clear in his belief that an Open Skies 
agreement would benefit the development of aviation services 
in Africa and said that South Africa was \"committed to do 
everything possible\" to liberalize Africa\'s skies.  He said 
that while many fear an Open Skies agreement means South 
Africa would be \"gobbled up\" by U.S. air carriers, the LAN 
Chile experience was reassuring.  Radebe said his primary 
responsibility as Minister was to oversee the expansion and 
accessibility of transportation (including aviation) services 
rather than the promotion and protection of SAA.  He said 
that Open Skies \"looks compelling.\"  He called on the United 
States and South Africa to form \"technical teams\" to look at 
the \"details\" of an Open Skies interaction between South 
Africa and the United States. 
 
9.  (SBU) McDermott responded that Secretary Mineta would be 
encouraged by this development.  When she sought to clarify 
whether these teams should conduct exploratory discussions or 
negotiations towards an Open Skies agreement, Radebe asked 
that they look at \"all the details.\"  He also indicated that 
Department of Transport Director General Wrenelle Stander 
should be contacted to initiate these talks. 
 
---------------------------------- 
RADEBE CURIOUS ABOUT DoT STRUCTURE 
---------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Over lunch, Radebe praised South Africa\'s emerging 
low-cost airline industry, said that privatization is not 
dead, and identified key Yamoussoukro partners (Kenya, 
Ethiopia, Nigeria).  He expressed keen interest in the 
organizational structure of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.  He questioned McDermott about the role of 
the FAA and asked who has responsibility for rail, roads, 
maritime services, traffic control, and state police.  After 
responding to Radebe\'s questions, McDermott invited the 
Minister to meet with Secretary Mineta in the United States 
and to see how the various DoT Administrators operate. 
 
11.  (C) COMMENT. Radebe\'s expression of support for Open 
Skies is encouraging as is his invitation to the United 
States to initiate bilateral talks between \"technical teams.\" 
 Although promising discussions with previous Minister of 
Transport Dullah Omar in the early 2000s failed to produce an 
Open Skies agreement, the commercial environment has changed. 
 SAA has suffered two years of massive hedging losses 
totaling R15 billion (about $2.38 billion).  SAA\'s Board of 
Directors and senior executive management have been replaced 
in the last year.  In addition, new management at Transnet, 
South Africa\'s administrator of state-owned transportation 
enterprises, is no longer willing to protect SAA 
inefficiencies.  Transnet\'s new CEO, Maria Ramos (former DG 
of National Treasury), said earlier this year that she does 
not consider SAA to be a core business of Transnet.  Public 
Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin is publicly supporting Ramos. 
 Accordingly, SAA has been removed from Transnet and is 
currently reporting direc 
tly to the Department of Public Enterprises.  SAA can no 
longer count on the political protection it formerly received 
from the Government.  The recent emergence of new low-cost 
airline competitors (e.g., Kulula, 1Time) may also make this 
an auspicious time to engage South Africa on an Open Skies 
agreement.  Post encourages Washington to follow up on the 
opportunity to further develop bilateral discussions.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA PUBLIC HEALTH OCTOBER 29 ISSUE 
 
1.  Summary.  Every two weeks, this post publishes a public 
health newsletter highlighting South African health issues 
based on press reports and studies of South African 
researchers.  Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect 
the opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
newsletter cover:  a UNFPA report that projects population in 
South Africa to decline by 2050; a new survey on sexual 
violence; the increasing but largely ignored South African 
orphans; the Global Fund contribution of R430 million to the 
Western Cape; a large increase in South African child 
mortality; the withdrawal of Thembalami Pharmaceuticals\' bid 
for government ARV contract; trends in HIV risk behavior in 
South African migrant workers; and the implementation of ARV 
treatment in all nine provinces.  End Summary. 
 
UNFPA Report Projects SA Population Decline 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  The latest United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report 
puts South Africa\'s population growth rate at 0.6 percent, 
indicating a concrete decline for the first time.  The report 
estimates that the country will have five million fewer people 
in 2050 with a little more than 40 million people, compared 
with previous projections of twice as many.  The world\'s 
population is expected to grow by a third (2.5 billion people) 
by 2050.  Statistics SA, projects a South African population 
growth rate of 1.8 percent primarily because of a higher 
assumed total fertility rate. The actuarial sciences department 
at the University of Cape Town said most population models 
based their calculations on an estimated growth of under 1 
percent, less than half of the South African official 
projections.  This is in line with other recent international 
reports such as that of the International Monetary Fund and the 
UN Development Program (UNDP), which projects a radical decline 
in life expectancy for South Africa to as low as 37 years by 
the end of the decade.  According to the latest UNFPA report, 
most of Africa\'s population is expected to grow by more than 2 
percent despite AIDS, with the exception of South Africa, 
Botswana (0.9 percent), Zimbabwe (0.5 percent), Namibia (1.4 
percent), Swaziland (0.8 percent) and Lesotho (0.1 percent). 
Five of these southern African countries were also rated by the 
UNDP as among the 10 most unequal societies, while they are 
also among those with the highest HIV and AIDS infection rate. 
70 percent of people in southern Africa live below the poverty 
line on less than $2 (R13) a day and 40 percent on less than $1 
a day.  The UNFPA report does not discuss the reasons for the 
decline in South Africa, but refers to AIDS as a prime cause. 
Professor Rob Dorrington, an actuarial scientist at the 
University of Cape Town, said that South Africa\'s fertility 
rate had been dropping since the 1980s and, along with AIDS, 
would be the main cause for the declining population rate, 
which he estimates to be 0.7 percent.  Source:  Sunday 
Independent, October 17. 
 
Survey Released on Sexual Violence 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  A study published by the British Medical Journal found high 
incidents of sexual violence and perceptions of sexual violence 
in South African pupils.  The study, conducted in the last 
quarter of 2002 interviewed 269,000 South African students in 
1418 schools.  It found 8.6 percent were forced to have sex in 
the past year. A further 58 percent said forcing sex on 
\"someone you know\" was not sexual violence, 30 percent said 
girls had no right to refuse sex with boyfriends and 26 percent 
said girls enjoyed rape, with findings similar across race, 
religions and class boundaries.  The questionnaires were in 
nine languages, and used the term forced sexual violence 
because not all languages have a direct translation for the 
word rape.  The study, funded by the Canadian International 
Development and Research Center and the United Nations, 
highlighted an apparent expectation of sexual coercion among 
young people that contributed to a culture of sexual violence. 
About 11 percent of boys and 4 percent of girls claimed to have 
forced someone to have sex in the past year. A third of the 
boys and 71 percent of the girls had themselves been forced to 
have sex.  Almost 16 percent said they would have unprotected 
sex, and a similar number said they would spread HIV 
intentionally. These views were expressed most by older (15-19 
years) boys from rural areas. Only 60 percent of the pupils 
surveyed believed condoms prevented the spread of HIV. A third 
said they never spoke to anyone about sex.  Source: Business 
Day, October 20. 
 
South African Orphans Increasing but Largely Ignored 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4.  Around a quarter of a million South African children are 
orphaned but large numbers are falling through bureaucratic 
cracks. By mid-2004, according to the Actuarial Association of 
South Africa (ASSA) 2002 model, 250,000 children in South 
African had lost both parents but government departments tasked 
with the welfare of these vulnerable children are unable to 
confirm actual numbers who are being cared for in children\'s 
homes.   Department of Social Development statistics indicate 
that 2,238 children were adopted in 2000 compared to 2,320 in 
2003 with only 369 of these children classified as abandoned. 
Figures from 169 affiliates of the SA National Council for 
Child Welfare, a non-governmental organization that collects 
statistics from many child welfare societies, indicate that 
during 2003 there were already 1,803 abandoned children.  6,356 
children were added in 2003. This translates into about 8,000 
abandoned children reported to the Council.  Nationally, 
238,610 children access monthly foster grants, amounting to 
just over R126 million ($20 million, using 6.2 rands per 
dollar).  Government statistics reveal that of the 2 320 
children adopted last year, 371 were cross-cultural and 224 
were by parents outside the country\'s borders.   More than half 
of the cases were processed in Gauteng courts alone.  Source:

Procedures Needed for South African Adoption 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  Generally, a child is available for adoption once the 
mother has been counseled by a social worker in an adoption 
agency or an accredited adoption social worker in private 
practice.  Once the mother has decided, the social worker 
identifies approved adopters.   When a child is abandoned, the 
procedures are more complex.  First the police will take the 
child to a place of safety pending a decision by the children\'s 
court. This may be a state Place of Safety, an NGO-run 
children\'s home, a foster family or a temporary \"safe house\" 
(basically an emergency foster home).  If the child is left at 
a hospital, the matter will immediately be referred to the 
Department of Social Development, a Child and Family Welfare 
agency or sometimes directly to a children\'s home.  In some 
regions abandoned children will remain in institutions because 
the local commissioner of child welfare insists on a two-year 
\"police search\" before the child is declared abandoned and 
released for adoption. There is no legal basis for this 
requirement.  Some agencies will place abandoned children with 
foster families (if they are available) until the children\'s 
situation is clarified but many babies will wait out this phase 
in institutional care.  Another scenario arises if a child has 
been abused or neglected and is placed by the court in foster 
care or a children\'s home. Accepted practice is for intensive 
services to be rendered immediately to the family in question, 
with a view to restoring the child to their care if at all 
possible, or to finding an alternative permanent family if 
there is no prospect of reunification. Because of extremely 
poor pay and stressful working conditions the Department of 
Social Development and many family welfare agencies are unable 
to hold onto experienced staff. The children are served by a 
constant procession of new recruits who often take months to 
catch up with their caseloads.  Once they do, the numbers and 
the rapid inflow of new cases make it impossible for them to 
give more than token attention to children who do, at least, 
have roofs over their heads and are not known to be suffering 
active abuse.  If the system worked properly, intensive 
services would be delivered to these families from the outset, 
assessments would be made at short and regular intervals as to 
whether or not they were responding, and in the absence of 
progress, prospective adoptive parents could apply to adopt the 
child.  Where appropriate, such adopters could be foster 
parents who are already caring for the child. The court would 
then decide whether or not to use its power to dispense with 
the consent of the parents.  There is at present no compulsory 
training for commissioners of child welfare, and provisions 
which had been made by the SA Law Commission in its draft 
Children\'s Bill for specialized training of children\'s court 
personnel have since been removed, a decision currently 
contested by non-government organizations.  Source:  Health-e

Western Cape Receives R430 Million from Global Fund 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6.  The Global Fund\'s R430 million ($69 million, using 6.2 
rands per dollar) grant to the Western Cape will accelerate 
AIDS programs and ensure that everyone who needs anti- 
retrovirals will get them by the end of next year. Two-thirds 
of the grant - the biggest to any department in the province\'s 
history - will go to treatment.  Currently, in the Western Cape 
approximately five thousand people are receiving anti- 
retroviral treatment.  New funding meant that all of the 
estimated 12,000 people who need the ARV drugs could be treated 
by the end of next year.  In addition, the funding will support 
(1) increased peer education programs; (2) additional hospices; 
and (3) more community-based and non-governmental 
organizations\' initiatives.  The R430 million will be spread 
over the next five years, with R100 million for the first two 
years.  The money also comes directly to the province, the 
first time that has happened in South Africa.  Twenty-eight 
implementing partners will be involved in the program including 
Nazareth House, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Lovelife and the 
Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation.  Source:  Cape Argus, October 21;

Large Increase in South African Child Mortality Rate 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.  A study released in 2003 by the Burden of Disease Research 
Unit of the Medical Research Council (MRC), has shown that the 
below-five mortality rate in 2000 was estimated at 95 per 1,000 
children.  Infant mortality has risen to 60 per 1,000 live 
births, compared to the 1998 figure of 45 per 1,000.  HIV/AIDS 
is the largest cause of fatalities in children younger than 
five, accounting for 40 percent of deaths.  Lower respiratory 
infections, diarrhea, low birth weight and protein energy 
malnutrition, all associated with poor socio-economic 
conditions, were responsible for 30 percent of childhood 
deaths.  The study indicated that HIV and AIDS resulted in the 
deaths of 42,749 children under the age of five in 2000, with 
32,636 fatalities recorded for the above four causes.   As 
children get older, the leading causes of death shift away from 
HIV/AIDS, with road traffic accidents accounting for about 50 
percent of deaths in the five to nine-year-old age group. Girls 
in this age group are still vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, which 
accounts for 33 percent of fatalities.  For 10-14 year olds, 
traffic accidents and homicide are responsible for 33 and 15 
percent of deaths respectively.   MRC researcher Nadine Nannan 
points out that although the data between 1992-2002 shows an 
increase in child mortality; there is no comparative data yet 
available for post 2002.  Leading causes of death in South 
African children under five in 2000:  (1) HIV/AIDS (40 
percent), (2) Low birth weight (11 percent), (3) Diarrhea 
diseases (10 percent), (4) Lower respiratory infections (5.8 
percent), and (5) Protein-energy malnutrition (4.3 percent).

Thembalami Pharmaceuticals Withdraws Bid 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  Thembalami Pharmaceuticals has withdrawn its bid for a 
slice of government\'s multimillion-rand AIDS drug tender, due 
to problems with the drugs made by its Indian partner, Ranbaxy 
Laboratories.  Thembalami is a joint venture between Adcock 
Ingram and Ranbaxy and was specifically established to supply 
generic AIDS medicines to the South African market.  Ranbaxy SA 
has voluntarily recalled its entire portfolio of AIDS drugs 
marketed in South Africa, citing problems with the research 
company, which conducted studies to determine whether the drugs 
offered the same therapeutic benefits as the originals.  As a 
result, only seven companies, two of which can provide 
generics, remain on government\'s short list for the tender to 
supply antiretroviral medicines needed to treat South Africa\'s 
millions of HIV sufferers.  The remaining bidders on the short 
list are Abbot, Bohringer Ingelheim, Bristol Meyers Squibb, 
GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharpe Dohme\'s South African subsidiary 
MSD, and generic manufacturers Aspen Pharmacare and Cipla- 
Medpro.  A report to the World Health Organization highlighted 
problems with the bioequivalence studies for Avocomb tablets, 
and subsequent investigations by Ranbaxy Laboratories 
identified similar problems with Lamaid, Nevran, and Zidaid. 
Ranbaxy SA CEO Desmond Brothers said the recall was confined to 
South Africa, in consultation with the Medicines Control 
Council.  Source:  Business Day, October 26. 
 
Trends in HIV Risk Behavior in South African Migrant Workers 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
9.  A study presented at the 11th Reproductive Health Research 
Priorities Conference October 5-8 found an increase in the 
number of South African migrant workers who report multiple 
partners (3-20) in the last six months.   Migrant workers from 
rural KZN province were interviewed over a three-year period 
(2000-2003).  Over the three years, the proportion who reported 
having two sexual partners remained constant at 39 percent; the 
proportion reported having three to 20 sexual partners within 
the past six months increased from 8 to 12 percent.  80 percent 
of the respondents thought they had little risk of contracting 
HIV, unchanged over three years.  The proportion of migrants 
reporting drug use increased significantly between 2000 (5 
percent) and 2003 (13 percent) as did the proportion who 
reported being intoxicated between five and 30 times during the 
past month (5 to 34 percent respectively from 2000 to 2003). 
Between 2000-2003, increased accessibility and availability of 
condoms were reported; the proportion that used condoms 
increased from 48 to 59 percent.  The proportion of migrants 
who reported trying to prevent pregnancy in partners increased 
significantly from 2000 (69 percent) to 2003 (81 percent), 
however the respondents who reported using a method for 
pregnancy prevention remained constant at 20 percent.  Source:

All Nine Provinces are Implementing ARV Treatment 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10.  The Health Department reports that all nine provinces have 
begun implementing the HIV/AIDS treatment plan using 
antiretroviral drugs, although the number of people on 
treatment is lower than planned.  11,253 people received ARV 
treatment by the end of September falling short of target of 
53,000 patients by March 2005.  All but one of the country\'s 53 
health districts have at least one ARV service point which 
provides a comprehensive service to people living with 
HIV/AIDS.  The Department also reports that there is improved 
infrastructure, improved training and retention of staff, 
certification of 250 laboratories and the establishment of a 24- 
hour helpline in place.  Source:  Business Day, October 21; The

E.O. 12958: N/A

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: MBEKI ECONOMIC ADVISOR OUTLINES THE 
PATH AHEAD 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. Alan Hirsch, Chief Director for Economic 
Policy Coordination and Advisory Services in the South 
African Presidency, met with members of the Southern African 
Regional Poverty Network on October 7 to discuss South 
Africa\'s growth path in the decade ahead.  Hirsch said that 
over the next five years, the Economics and Employment 
Cluster in the Cabinet would continue policies that supported 
macroeconomic stability, but introduce new policies to raise 
the level of private investment in infrastructure to lower 
the factor cost of production and improve the country\'s 
competitiveness.  Deep government intervention was required 
to avoid creating a cycle of dependency on government grants 
for the nation\'s poor.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Hirsch opened his presentation by recounting that in 
January, after the Government published its Ten Year Review, 
the Cabinet undertook extensive discussions on what was 
needed to grow and develop the economy.  The government had 
plenty to feel good about.  Under ANC leadership, South 
Africa had achieved macroeconomic stability and the longest 
period of growth since the 1940s (when GDP was first 
recorded).  South Africa also enjoyed its lowest inflation 
since 1959 (as measured by CPI) and its lowest interest rates 
in 23 years.  Since the political transition in 1994, GDP 
growth had stayed positive, averaging 2.8% per year, close to 
what the major advanced countries were experiencing, but 
lower than the average for all developed countries (a 
statistic skewed by the inclusion of a booming China). 
Hirsch noted that during this ten-year period, the government 
had managed to raise social expenditures from 44.42% to 
56.72% of the budget, and reduce public sector debt to below 
50% of the budget.  Nonetheless, the Cabinet saw that 3.4 
million South African households, about 35-40% of the 
population, were still living in poverty.  Moreover, 
unemployment had actually grown during the last ten years 
from 16% to 32% due to new entrants to the labor market 
(official unemployment is now 29%). 
 
3. (SBU) Hirsch said that Cabinet discussions about what to 
do about reducing high unemployment and poverty continued 
after the national elections in April.  The new Cabinet 
wanted to know why South Africa was not growing fast enough 
to improve the welfare of its poor population.  According to 
Hirsch, Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma demanded to 
know why South Africa did not achieve 6% GDP growth by the 
end of the 1990s, as envisioned under previous economic 
plans.  President Thabo Mbeki replied that the country could 
have grown faster, but at the expense of marginalizing more 
of its population.  The government\'s strategic objective now, 
as enumerated by the African National Congress\' election 
manifesto, was to cut poverty and unemployment in half by 
2014. 
 
4. (U) Hirsch said that the most telling weaknesses of the 
government\'s effort from a macroeconomic perspective was its 
performance on investment, job creation, and economic growth 
when compared to countries at a similar level of development. 
 He said that private sector investment had declined from 
16-17% to 12-13% of GDP over the past ten years and public 
sector investment had declined from 7-8% to a low of 2% of 
GDP -- although this increased to 4% of GDP in 2003.  He 
recollected that gross fixed capital formation was 25% of GDP 
in 1980, the last time the country saw a growth rate of 6%. 
Since 1992, however, gross fixed capital formation had 
leveled off to 15-16% of GDP, producing an average growth of 
around 3%.  The question he posed was \"Why did public and 
private investment fall from 1994 onwards?\"  He attributed 
this to government\'s preoccupation with transforming itself 
from being white dominated to black dominated, with economic 
restructuring, and to a lack of government confidence.  He 
said that the ANC government feared making too large a 
commitment on the expenditure side for social services and 
then not being able to pay for it.  Hirsch noted the 
efficiency of investment improved after 1994 (with capital 
intensive oriented investment) and economic growth improved 
somewhat, but it did not lead to greater employment. 
 
5. (U) Hirsch believed that the major constraints on 
investment during the last ten years included the country\'s 
relatively high cost of capital, exchange rate volatility, 
uncontrolled inflation, a low government investment rate, and 
the country\'s relatively low growth rate.  By 2004, most of 
these constraints were no longer important, yet investment as 
a percentage of GDP continued to be low.  Hirsch believed 
that this phenomenon had to do with misperceptions about 
South Africa.  These included that South Africa faced 
instability due to income equality among its people and the 
lack of social cohesion.  Another misperception was 
uncertainty about the government\'s will and capacity to 
resolve social problems.  Hirsch said that many in business 
held negative viewpoints about crime, active labor unions, 
and \"whites under siege\" in South Africa.  The government\'s 
apparent protection of Zimbabwe did not help this.  Finally, 
Hirsch thought that some investors had a \"gut feel\" or \"sixth 
sense\" that South Africa was destined to fail.  This, he 
thought, revolved around a lack of trust between the business 
and ruling classes arising from a cultural gulf between the 
political and economic elite.  For this reason, it was 
important to establish an organization like the National 
Economic Development and Labor Council (NEDLAC) and 
Presidential working groups with industry to be established. 
 
6. (U) Hirsch said that the government\'s main focus now was 
to increase the rate of investment.  The goal was to reach 
gross capital formation of over 25% of GDP by 2015.  To do 
this, the government would increase public sector investment 
to R267 billion over the Medium Term Economic Framework and 
reinforce its efforts to win over both foreign and domestic 
investors.  He said that monetary stability and successful 
inflation targeting had led to lower interest rates, and that 
would help.  What remained was to arrive at a competitive and 
stable foreign exchange rate, which he viewed as currently 
\"mispriced.\" 
 
7. (U) At the microeconomic level, the government would 
target priority growth and labor absorbing sectors, such as 
agriculture, tourism, crafts, telecommunications, 
mining/metals, clothing/textiles, chemicals, biotech, 
automobile manufacturing, transportation, as well as 
services.  To support growth in these sectors, government 
would improve infrastructure in transportation, energy, 
water, and telecommunications.  In this respect, Hirsch 
admitted that there had been a change of philosophy around 
state owned enterprises; they would now be employed to lead 
investment.  A concern was that the delivery of many 
infrastructure-related services were managed by local 
municipalities, where there was a lack of capacity and 
something had to be done.  Hirsch said that the government 
would continue undertake what he termed \"crosscutting 
interventions\" to promote black economic empowerment, reduce 
income inequality, and counter investor pessimism. 
 
8. (U) Hirsch went on to discuss South Africa\'s \"second 
economy,\" the one that \"is peripheral of the cities and 
towns, and in deep rural areas.\"  He said that one-third of 
South African households essentially lived outside the 
system.  Poverty and exclusion were leading to rapidly 
growing demands for public services and transfer payments. 
If things did not change, social transfers would grow to the 
point where the government could no longer afford them, and 
the result could lead to social conflict.  Resolving such 
problems required deep government intervention. 
 
9. (U) Hirsch said that social investment had grown to about 
10% of GDP over the past ten years.  At the same time, social 
transfers went from 1.5% to 4% of GDP.  Among the major 
movers in this category were child support grants and 
disability payments.  Government had to do something to break 
the growing demand and dependency on social grants. 
Government had to eliminate extreme poverty and at the same 
time ensure easy mobility to the country\'s first economy. 
 
10. (U) The government\'s second economy strategy included 
creating temporary work opportunities combined with skills 
and infrastructure development.  The government would also 
focus on home and child services, healthcare and health 
education, intense skills development, adult basic education 
and training, and increasing access to capital for small 
businesspersons.  To be successful, he thought that there 
would have to be more of a two-way flow of information 
between government and people in the communities affected. 
 
11. (SBU) Comment: Hirsch\'s overview was heartening in the 
sense that he grounded the government\'s economic program in 
realism.  The insight that he provided into government 
thinking revealed a Cabinet that was growing impatient with 
high unemployment, low growth, and the government\'s failure 
to merge the country\'s first and second economies.  The 
Cabinet does not believe that the private sector acting alone 
can deliver what it needs.  Privatization will stay on the 
back burner while the government employs its parastatals to 
manage and invest in large-scale infrastructure programs 
designed to foster targeted investment, growth, and 
employment.  Some may question this tack, given that the 
country\'s parastatals have consumed more fixed capital than 
they have created over the past ten years, and are 
increasingly criticized for ineptitude.  Interestingly, 
Hirsch made no mention of trade policy in his presentation.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: FOREIGN MINING COMPANIES FILE 
NOTICES RESERVING POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST GOVERNMENT 
 
Classified By: Acting Econ Chief Alan Tousignant for reasons 1.4 (B, D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Four foreign mining companies filed notices 
on October 29 with the Department of Minerals and Energy 
stating their intent to pursue legal action for mineral 
rights potentially lost as a result of the implementation of 
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act on May 1, 
2004.  The move was prompted by the \"Legal Proceedings Act,\" 
which gives the companies six months after a government 
action to file notice of a claim.  The companies involved do 
not view the procedure as tantamount to filing a lawsuit, but 
rather as preserving their right to sue should the state 
decide not to transfer their \"old order\" mineral rights which 
were purchased from landowners to \"new order\" mineral rights 
administered by the government.  Nevertheless, the action did 
not sit well with the Minister of Minerals and Energy, and 
some believe that the action may not have been legally 
necessary.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Placer Dome (Canada), SouthernEra (Canada), Lonmin 
(U.K.), and Aquarius (Australia, but incorporated in Bermuda) 
filed notices on October 29 with the Department of Minerals 
and Energy stating their intent to pursue legal action for 
mineral rights potentially lost as a result of the 
implementation of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources 
Development Act on May 1, 2004.  The companies involved do 
not view the procedure as tantamount to filing a lawsuit, but 
rather as preserving their right to sue should the state 
decide not to transfer their \"old order\" mineral rights which 
were purchased from landowners to \"new order\" mineral rights 
administered by the government.  The Department of Minerals 
and Energy must transform \"old order\" rights into \"new order\" 
rights by 2009. 
 
3. (U) The move by the four foreign mining companies was 
prompted by the Institution of Legal Proceedings Against 
Certain Organs of State Act of 2002, which states \"that no 
legal proceedings for the recovery of debt may be instituted 
against an organ of state unless the creditor has given the 
organ of state in question notice in writing of its intention 
to institute the legal proceedings in question.\"  Further, 
the creditor must serve a notice on the state within six 
months from the date on which a presumed debt became due. 
The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act came into 
effect on May 1, 2004 -- six months ago.  At issue for the 
companies is the prospect that the state will deny them \"new 
order\" rights because of their failure to meet Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) requirements as enumerated in the BEE 
mining charter and incorporated into the new Minerals Act. 
 
4. (C) Sam Coetzer, Managing Director for Placer Dome/South 
Africa, explained to Econoff that he felt the company had 
little choice but to file the notice.  Since 1999, the 
company invested $500 million in South Deep, a gold mine with 
which it maintains a 50/50 joint venture with Western Areas. 
Placer Dome shareholders will not agree to sell shares to a 
BEE partner because it would mean relinquishing operational 
control, which under its current arrangement, Placer Dome 
retains.  Its partner and original rights holder, Western 
Areas, also refuses to reduce its shareholding in this 
lucrative ultra deep mining venture.  This automatically puts 
South Deep in contravention of the BEE mining charter because 
it does not have BEE partner.  (Under the charter, companies 
are supposed to take on a 15% BEE partner by 2009 and a 26% 
BEE partner by 2014.)  Placer Dome is worried that this could 
be the basis for the government to deny the joint venture 
\"new order\" rights.  Despite many requests, it has not 
received assurances from the government that its investment 
in South Deep is secure. 
 
5. (C) No South African based companies filed similar 
notices.  According to Coetzer, Bobby Godsell, Chief 
Executive of AngloGold/Ashanti, argued at a Chamber of Mines 
meeting the previous week that a legal move under the Legal 
Proceedings Act was unnecessary.  He believed that he could 
still sue the state under the law at a later date, if he had 
to, and that filing notice would only show a lack of trust in 
the government.  \"This is a government of dialogue,\" he 
reportedly argued.  A Business Day editorial on November 2 
also opposed the filings, arguing that since the loss, if it 
existed, would only occur in 2009, it was hard to see why the 
Legal Proceedings Act would apply now. 
6. (SBU) The action by the foreign mining companies did not 
sit well with Minister of Minerals and Energy Phumzile 
Mlambo-Ngcuka, who reportedly told Placer Dome\'s Coetzer at a 
Chamber of Mines breakfast on November 2, \"If it is a fight 
you want, then I\'ll show you how to fight.\"  The next day, 
Business Day quoted Minerals and Energy Director General 
Sandile Nogxina saying, \"I don\'t understand why they (the 
four foreign companies) think they could be exempted from the 
application of local law -- it\'s sheer arrogance.\" 
Mlambo-Ngcuka is expected to address the issue in the media 
soon.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, EINV, ECON, SF 
SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: NEW BANK ACCOUNT FOR LOW-INCOME 
CLIENTS 
 
 
1. Summary.  The big four South African banks launched a new 
low-cost bank account named \'Mzansi\' on October 25.  This 
bank account fulfills a part of the South African 
government\'s goal to increase low-income individuals\' access 
to financial services, as expressed by the Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) financial services charter.  Most 
stakeholders hail the account as a positive initial step, but 
many have criticized the account\'s functionality.  At the 
same time, banks are concerned about middle-income clients 
switching to the low-cost account.  The future of retail 
banking competition is unclear, as traditionally high bank 
charges could face pricing pressure in light of this new 
account and emerging smaller banks catering to low-income 
customers.  End Summary. 
 
Account Details 
--------------- 
 
2. On October 25, South African banks launched the \'Mzansi\' 
(a Zulu word meaning south) account, a new South African 
low-cost bank initiative.  The Black Economic Empowerment 
(BEE) financial services charter drove this new product 
launch as part of the South African government\'s (SAG) 
objective to increase access to banking for the over 13 
million \'unbanked\' South Africans.  The four largest South 
African banks--Standard Bank, First National Bank, ABSA, and 
Nedcor--participated in the launch as well as Postbank, the 
savings division of the South African Post Office.  Nedcor\'s 
subsidiaries Nedbank, Old Mutual Bank, Peoples Bank, and Meeg 
Bank all participated in the launch. 
 
3. The Mzansi account offers bank fees that are 30% to 60% 
less than a typical bank account.  A valid ID document is all 
that is required to open an account.  Each bank is pricing 
its account services differently.  Account services that 
incur fees include ATM withdrawals, cash deposits, and check 
deposits.  The Mzansi account characteristics that remain 
consistent across banks include:  (1) free use of another 
bank\'s ATM; (2) no management fees; (3) at least one free 
monthly cash deposit; and (4) a debit card to use at 
retailers. 
 
Some Criticism But Plenty of Support 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. Various groups supported the Mzansi launch, but argued 
that the banks are not introducing the account in a practical 
form.  The Association of Black Securities and Investment 
Professionals (Absip), the South African Communist Party 
(SACP), and the think tank FinMark Trust stated publicly that 
the account should include electronic payment options to make 
a real difference.  This option would allow account holders 
to easily make payments for items such as insurance or 
housing bonds.  The banks recognize this need and predict 
that the functionality of the account will grow with time. 
The financial services charter council members hailed the 
account launch as a sign of progress and a unified front of 
its members, including Absip, the SACP, the Congress of South 
African Trade Unions (COSATU), banks, and government.  The 
SACP is pleased with this initial step, as it highlighted the 
\'unbanked\' population problem four years ago.  The financial 
services charter council will monitor progress of the Mzansi 
account going forward. 
 
Effects on Banking Market

5. Banks are concerned that the Mzansi account will 
cannibalize profits.  Their fear is that middle-income 
individuals will open Mzansi accounts and close their more 
expensive accounts.  To prevent switching, the account 
restricts activity and transaction amounts.  Nedcor set a 
R15,000 ($2,400) maximum balance and imposed a fee on excess 
transactions, taking a proactive approach to this potential 
problem. 
 
6. The Mzansi account introduces a measure of uncertainty 
into retail banking in South Africa.  Will the Mzansi account 
put pressure on banks to lower fees on other accounts?  One 
micro finance regulator described the Mzansi account as a 
preemptive move by the large banks to keep the smaller banks 
from expanding their low-income market share.  Capitec and 
Teba Bank, both supported by a USAID grant or credit 
guarantee, are two of these smaller banks.  Capitec, a niche 
bank and micro lender, decided not to participate in the 
Mzansi account, but already provides services to low-income 
South Africans.  Capitec offers low-cost accounts that 
provide more banking services to clients, including 
electronic payment options and higher interest rates.  Teba 
Bank, traditionally serving mineworkers, is expanding its 
product range to reach low-income clients outside mining 
communities.  The Mzansi account will not be a profitable 
venture in the short-term for the large banks, but it should 
bring the large banks new low-income customers that could be 
a future source of growth in retail banking.  The large banks 
are hoping to learn from the South African market so that 
they may apply this model elsewhere in Africa. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. The challenge for the banking sector is to find the 
balance between making the Mzansi account practical enough 
for low-income clients, but restrictive enough to keep middle 
or high-income customers from switching accounts.  Adding to 
this challenge, is the race to attract the low-income market. 
 In three months, the four big banks and Postbank (South 
African post office) will launch their individual Mzansi 
account marketing campaigns.  As part of this effort, banks 
will be setting up more branches and ATMs.  One of the 
financial services charter goals for 2008 is to locate an ATM 
within 10 kilometers and full banking services within 15 
kilometers of 80% of the homes in South Africa.  The Mzansi 
account, combined with the ATM and branch expansion, promises 
to go a long way in meeting financial services charter goals.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE CENTRE\'S 
FIRST FULL YEAR REVIEW 
 
(U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Not for 
Internet distribution. 
 
1. (U) Summary. South Africa\'s Financial Intelligence Centre 
(FIC) released its 2003-04 Annual Report in early October. 
In its first full year of operation, the FIC received almost 
7,500 suspicious transaction reports (STRs).  The FIC is now 
turning its attention to raising the quality of STRs, 
recruiting and training its employees, and improving 
coordination with law enforcement agencies.  Still pending is 
terrorist financing legislation that mandates the seizure of 
terrorist assets.  As they build their institution, FIC 
officials seem very open to U.S. training programs and 
exchanges.  The complete annual report may be found at: 
http://www.fic.gov.za under \"Documents.\"  End Summary. 
 
Suspicious Transaction Reports 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) On October 4, South Africa\'s Financial Intelligence 
Centre (FIC) released its annual report covering 2003-04.  In 
its first full year of operation the FIC received 7,480 
suspicious transaction reports (STRs) through March 2004. 
The number of reports exceeded what was anticipated and 
placed South Africa \"at the higher end of international 
experience.\"  The critical statistic was how many STRs led to 
criminal investigations, but the FIC was not publicizing this 
figure.  (Comment: We believe that this number is very low. 
End Comment.) 
 
3. (U) An FIC official admitted to Econoff that the quality 
and consistency of STRs needed to be improved and that for 
this to happen, training was key.  While all South African 
banks received general guidelines on how to train their 
staff, it was up to each to implement a training program.  At 
the upper end, one of the largest South African banks had 
managed to train nearly 95% of its employees.  Training was 
essential if the FIC was to obtain complete information on 
suspected criminal activity. 
 
4. (U) During the past year, the FIC averaged between 500 and 
700 STRs monthly.  Money remitters (i.e., wire transfer 
services) and banks submitted the bulk of them -- 4,079 and 
2,732 reports, respectively.  Other reports came from coin 
dealers, individuals, casinos, brokers, and law enforcement 
agencies.  These sources mirrored international experience. 
Normally, financial institutions collected STR information 
manually before management determined whether a suspicious 
transaction should be reported.  The FIC received over 90% of 
all STRs electronically with the remaining sent by fax or 
delivered by hand.  Most South African banks were aware of 
automated software that could assist them with the internal 
information collection and reporting process, but have not 
yet invested in it. 
 
Complaints 
---------- 
 
5. (U) Both FIC and Banking Council officials commented on 
the difficulty that banks had transferring money if it went 
through a U.S. institution.  This difficulty was because of 
the disparity between the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List and 
the U.N. 1267 Sanctions Committee List (the one that South 
Africa adhered to).  The danger was that if a South African 
bank customer was entering into a transaction with a 
U.S.-identified suspected terrorist organization or 
individual, and the customer\'s transaction was handled in any 
way by a U.S. bank, the customer\'s assets could be frozen by 
that U.S. bank.  This caused some banks to simply avoid doing 
business with U.S. banks whenever possible. 
 
6. (U) Many banks felt as if the FIC reporting obligations 
were burdensome and hampered their efforts to attract new 
customers.  For example, \"Know Your Customer\" requirements 
mean that account holders must present identifying documents 
to their banking institutions in person or risk having their 
accounts frozen.  The measure was designed to prevent 
suspicious transactions, but has become an administrative 
nightmare.  At the banks request, the South African National 
Treasury extended the June 30, 2004 deadline according to a 
staggered timetable wherein higher risk customers must meet 
an earlier deadline and lower risk customers a later 
deadline.  October 31, 2004 was the deadline for banks to 
report on all nonresident account holders, trusts, and 
partnerships as well as 20% of high-risk clients.  Meeting 
this deadline was not a problem for the high-risk clients, 
but it has been for trusts and partnerships, where compliance 
appears to be very low.  Banks have 15 days to before they 
must freeze the non-compliant accounts or face large fines 
and prosecution, which could result in imprisonment.  The 
final \"Know Your Customer\" deadline is September 30, 2006. 
 
Legislation Needed 
------------------ 
 
7. (U) South Africa still does not have the legal means to 
deal comprehensively with suspected terrorist financing. 
Banks report to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) every 
six months on any U.N.-designated terrorist activity, but 
there is no law mandating that they freeze assets unless the 
activity has been linked to a specific crime in South Africa. 
 South African law also does not currently have cash 
threshold or cross-border reporting requirements for banks. 
The Parliamentary Select Committee on Security and 
Constitutional Affairs is debating draft legislation that 
recognizes terrorist activity as a threat to the country,s 
safety and mandates the seizure of terrorist assets.  This 
legislation could be approved by the end of the year, and 
would coincide with the Financial Action Task Force\'s (FATF) 
evaluation recommendations for South Africa put forth last 
year. 
 
Institution Building 
-------------------- 
 
8. (U) When the FIC became independent from the National 
Treasury in November 2003, it had to start from scratch to 
create a new agency.  It soon found that reaching its goal of 
hiring 75 employees by March 2005 without a personnel 
department was not going to happen.  Now, with a personnel 
department in place, the FIC has relaunched its recruitment 
drive and hopes to surpass its original goal of 75 employees. 
 
9. (U) In the last year, the FIC has made considerable 
headway in building its capabilities and credibility in the 
South African law enforcement community.  Initially, the 
FIC\'s nascent database on suspected criminal activities did 
not contain much information and law enforcement agencies 
were not aware of how the FIC might help them with their 
investigations.  The FIC\'s database is more useful now, 
enabling the FIC to adopt a proactive approach toward 
assisting law enforcement agencies by regularly searching for 
information on a known case to support a criminal 
investigation.  By showing that it can add value to an 
investigation, the FIC has been gaining credibility among law 
enforcement agencies.  During its first full year of 
operation, the FIC received 161 information requests from 
local (105) and international (56) law enforcement agencies. 
FIC officials expect these numbers to rise. 
 
Training: Detection of Terrorist Financing 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10. (SBU) Ursula M\'Crystal, Head of FIC Prevention and 
Compliance, told Econoff that the FIC welcomed future 
training opportunities from U.S. agencies, such as the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,s (FinCEN).  She 
specifically requested training on how to detect terrorist 
financing in the absence of specific intelligence.  (Note: 
M\'Crystal also encouraged us to proactively share any 
intelligence information with the FIC that we can.  End 
note.) 
 
11. (U) FIC\'s Annual Report highlighted the important 
contribution that FinCEN,s analysis training made to FIC\'s 
development.  Other international training programs 
highlighted included the British High Commission\'s financial 
crimes investigator training and a future one-year university 
certificate program in financial crimes investigation.  We 
would add that the videoconference on October 13 with John 
Byrne of the American Bankers Association on the U.S. Patriot 
Act attracted more than 100 FIC officials, bankers, and 
regulators.  The event was co-hosted by the Money Laundering 
Forum and the Johannesburg Consulate and held at Investec (a 
South African investment bank). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (SBU) South Africa deliberately chooses to rely upon U.N. 
designation lists, rather than the U.S. OFAC list.  As far as 
we know, the FIC does not enter our list into its database. 
We will continue to encourage South Africa to use our lists 
as much as possible, track pending terrorist financing 
legislation in Parliament, and report on FIC\'s progress.  The 
FIC and banking industry have made significant progress in 
the detection of financial crimes, but could use some help. 
We believe that the FIC is open to further cooperation with 
FinCEN and to participating in international training 
programs.

SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC NEWSLETTER 
           NOVEMBER 5, 2004 ISSUE 
 
1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
newsletter are: 
-  Trade Deficit Narrows; 
-  Tourism Increases Although Signs of Decline; 
-  Manufacturing Activity Slows; 
-  Another Strong Month for Vehicle Sales; 
-  Poverty in Africa Expected to Worsen by 2015; 
-  Real Health Care Spending 4.8 Percent Lower in 2003; 
-  Increasing Welfare Grants Crowd Out Other Government 
Expenditures; and 
-  First Bank Account Identification Deadline Passed 
 End Summary. 
 
Trade Deficit Narrows 
--------------------- 
 
2.  The trade deficit narrowed in September to R0.3 
 billion from a deficit of R3.1 billion in August, 
 recording its sixth consecutive decline this year.  The 
 value of exports increased by 29.2 percent to R27.9 
 billion in September from August\'s R21.6 billion.  The 
 value of imports increased by 14 percent to R28.2 billion 
 compared to August\'s level of R24.7 billion.  For the 
 first nine months of this year, the cumulative deficit 
 stands at R6.6 billion compared with a R16.4 billion 
 surplus recorded during the same period in 2003.  In 
 September, South Africa had a trade deficit with most of 
 the regions except for Africa and Oceania, with the Asian 
 trade deficit reaching R5 billion, the highest regional 
 trade deficit.  South Africa had the highest trade surplus 
 within the African region, reaching R2.7 billion.  In the 
 near future, imports are expected to remain high and 
 exports will be under competitive pressure.  As oil 
 imports account for 10 percent of the country\'s total 
 imports, continuing high global oil prices will put 
 continuing pressure on growth in imports.  In addition, 
 the recent rand strength implies that imports will be 
 high.  The July, August and September monthly average rand 
 per dollar exchange rates were 6.09, 6.42 and 6.51 
 respectively.  Even though the rand depreciated between 
 July and September, it has strengthened recently leading 
 most to expect a future deterioration in the current 
 account and increased pressure on exports.  Source: 
 Standard Bank, Foreign Trade Alert, October 29; Business 
 Day, October 30. 
 
TOURISM INCREASES ALTHOUGH SIGNS OF DECLINE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  According to Statistics SA, tourist arrivals increased 
 3.3 percent (y/y) in August, even though overseas tourist 
 arrivals declined by 2.1 percent.  Visitors from Africa 
 increased by 4.6 percent and accounted for 71 percent of 
 the total increase in tourist arrivals.  Visitors from six 
 neighboring countries make up more than 91 percent of 
 foreign visitors to South Africa.  August\'s rand 
 depreciation had a greater impact on other non-neighboring 
 African arrivals since they view South Africa as a 
 shopping destination.  The number of non-African visitors 
 to South Africa fell to 152,544 in August, with German and 
 French visitors dropping 14 percent and Spanish visitors 
 by 23 percent.  Arrivals from the United Kingdom, the 
 leading country of origin of overseas visitors, increased 
 by 3.9 percent while U.S. visitors increased by 1.4 
 percent.   The number of arrivals from China showed the 
 biggest increase, increasing 66.5 percent from 2,672 in 
 2003 to 4,450 in August 2004.  The number of immigrants 
 arriving in South Africa increased 12.3 percent y/y in 
 August.  Most immigrants came from Nigeria (133), Pakistan 
 (98), UK (93), Zimbabwe (88) and China (70).  Of the total 
 immigrants to South Africa, 91 percent were not 
 economically active, as the majority were spouses and 
 students.   Of those economically active, 41 percent were 
 managers, administrators or executives.  Source:  Business 
 Day, November 2; Standard Bank Tourism Gauge, November 1. 
 
MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY SLOWS 
---------------------------- 
 
4.   The Investec Purchasing Managers Index, measuring 
 manufacturing activity, fell to 56 in October compared to 
 September\'s 59.1 level.  This drop may indicate a future 
 slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 
 roughly 20 percent of South African gross domestic 
 product.  However, a value above 50 still signals 
 expansion.  The Investec survey showed a decline in new 
 sales orders, with its index dropping to 58.9 compared to 
 September\'s value of 63.8.  The employment index dropped 
 below 50, signaling future job losses.  High oil prices, 
 slowing global demand, and the recent strength of the rand 
 are current growth constraints facing the manufacturing 
 sector.  Helped by August\'s reduction in interest rates, 
 strong consumer demand should offset weakening exports.

ANOTHER STRONG MONTH FOR VEHICLE SALES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  According to the National Association of Automobile 
 Manufacturers (NAAMSA), motor vehicle sales increased 22.9 
 percent in October, with strong growth in commercial 
 vehicles fueling total vehicle sales growth.  Passenger 
 cars increased 17 percent y/y, a rate slower than 
 September\'s 21.2 percent annual growth.  An average of 
 1,087 new cars were sold each day in October 2004 compared 
 to October 2003\'s average of 895.  Sales of commercial 
 vehicles grew by 35 percent in October, with bus sales 
 showing the highest growth at 46 percent.  Lower 
 inflation, falling real car prices, and strong consumer 
 demand all explain 2004\'s substantially higher vehicle 
 sales.  Source:  Standard Bank Motor Alert, November 2. 
 
POVERTY IN AFRICA EXPECTED TO WORSEN BY 2015 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  Half of the world\'s poor will live in Sub-Saharan 
 Africa by 2015, despite significant inroads made in 
 reducing global poverty.  This figure is up from 27 
 percent in 1999 according to the South African Institute 
 of Race Relations\' latest issue of the South Africa 
 Survey.  More than 400 million people are expected to live 
 on less than $1 a day in 2015, up from 315 million in 1999 
 while global poverty will be reduced by a third.  The 
 report shows that regions such as South and East Asia will 
 show dramatic gains in reducing poverty because of the 
 faster growth of countries such as China and India.  The 
 main reason for Sub-Saharan Africa\'s poor track record in 
 reducing poverty was a lack of good governance.  South 
 Africa Survey shows that income levels in South Africa 
 have grown disparately among various race groups since 
 1960, with Indians gaining the most and whites showing the 
 lowest growth.  Between 1960 and 2005, Indian incomes rose 
 384 percent, black incomes grew 208 percent, incomes for 
 coloreds increased 177 percent, while white incomes grew 
 66 percent.   University graduation statistics shows 
 differences among race groups as well, with black students 
 comprising over half of university students, but making up 
 a quarter of business graduates, 28 percent of computer 
 science graduates and 22 percent of engineering graduates. 
 White students, accounting for 33 percent of the overall 
 university student body, make up 56 percent of business 
 graduates, 55 percent of computer science graduates, 65 
 percent of engineering graduates and 48 percent of 
 mathematical science graduates.  South Africa was the only 
 developing country with low and declining levels of 
 entrepreneurship in 2003.   The number of people employed 
 in the informal sector, which consists largely of 
 entrepreneurs, declined by 22 percent from 2000 to 2003. 
 Source:  Business Day and I-Net Bridge, November 3. 
 
REAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING 4.8 PERCENT LOWER IN 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  The South Africa Survey shows that healthcare spending 
 in 2003 was 4.8 percent lower in real terms than in 1996, 
 with large inequities still existing between the 
 provinces.  Some provinces spent as little as 75 rand 
 ($1.23 using 6.1 rands per dollar) per capita per annum, 
 where the government goal is 200 rand.  Two of the 
 provinces with the highest HIV/AIDS infection rates, 
 Gauteng and Mpumalanga, failed to spend all the money 
 allocated to them in conditional grants to fight the 
 pandemic in 2002/03.  Gauteng spent only 52 percent of its 
 funds, while Mpumalanga spent only 38 percent.  In 1995 an 
 estimated 85 percent of companies were providing benefits 
 to their pensioners, while in 2003 this number had fallen 
 to only 43 percent. The government increased the value of 
 the old-age social pension by 13 percent between April 
 2002 and April 2003.  During the same period, the number 
 of beneficiaries of child support grants increased by 45 
 percent.   Between 1997 and 2003, the number of welfare 
 grant beneficiaries in South Africa grew by 124 percent 
 from 2.5 million to 5.6 million.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, 
 November 3. 
 
INCREASING WELFARE GRANTS CROWD OUT OTHER GOVERNMENT 
EXPENDITURES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  Welfare grants will comprise over 40 percent of the 
 government expenditure increases for the next three years. 
 Finance Minister Manuel allocated R20.8 billion ($3.4 
 billion using 6.1 rands per dollar) of the R50 billion 
 ($8.2 billion) for welfare grants.  Two million people 
 were added to the beneficiary lists for various grants 
 between April and September this year alone, pushing the 
 total number of recipients to nine million, about one in 
 five of the total population.   Much of the increase was 
 in the unexplained escalation in disability and foster 
 care grants, which Manuel said was most likely due to poor 
 administration.  Manuel said that in some provinces, 
 officials were adding applicants to the list without any 
 checks, families were registering their own children as 
 foster children and government officials were illegally 
 claiming childcare support for their own children.  The 
 government has no figures on the number of people claiming 
 disability grants as a result of HIV/Aids and there are no 
 firm guidelines on their eligibility.   In addition, there 
 are plans to raise the ceiling for child grants from 10 to 
 13 years through 2008.  Welfare grant administration will 
 be shifted to a national social welfare agency in 2006, 
 but Manuel moved this week to limit the damage to other 
 services by shifting welfare funds from the equitable 
 share paid to provinces to the conditional grants that go 
 to these regional governments.  The change would mean that 
 overruns would be the responsibility of the national 
 department even though distribution would remain a 
 provincial responsibility until March 2006.  At present, 
 welfare claims take precedence over other provincial 
 expenditure.  Provinces have had to cut back on critical 
 health and education budgets or have taken out bank 
 overdrafts to pay welfare grants expected to total R38.4 
 billion ($6.3 billion) in the current financial year, 
 rising to R47 billion ($7.7 billion) in the 2007/08 fiscal 
 year.  In the financial year through March 2004, Northern 
 Cape overspent on welfare grants by 8.6 percent, KwaZulu- 
 Natal by 7.2 percent, Eastern Cape by 7.7 percent and 
 Gauteng by 4.1 percent. Western Cape and North West 
 provinces under spent in this regard.  Source:  Business 
 Times and I-Net Bridge, November 3. 
 
FIRST BANK ACCOUNT IDENTIFICATION DEADLINE PASSED 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9.  The first \"Know Your Customer\" deadline for banks 
 based on the South African Financial Intelligence Center 
 Act (FICA) passed on October 31.  All account holders for 
 trusts, partnerships and banks\' 20 percent of its most 
 active clients were required to identify themselves to the 
 bank.  If account holders have not presented themselves, 
 the banks are required to freeze the accounts within 15 
 days of the deadline.  FICA is part of an international 
 effort to reduce money laundering by keeping track of 
 large financial transactions.  In June, Finance Minister 
 Manuel set forth a revised timetable of \"Know Your 
 Customer\" deadlines.  The next deadline for the remaining 
 most active clients is December 31, 2004.  All medium to 
 low activity customers have to be identified before 
 September 30, 2006.  Source:  Business Day, November 1.

SUBJECT:  MID TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (U) Finance Minister Trevor Manuel presented the 
 Mid Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), supporting 
 the South African government\'s three-year budgeting 
 plans under the Mid Term Expenditure Framework.  The 
 MTBPS updates economic growth, revenue and 
 expenditure forecasts and suggests potential policy 
 changes that support government\'s key priorities. 
 Highlights of Manuel\'s presentation include:  (1) 
 fiscal policies remaining slightly expansionary with 
 an increased budget deficit expected in the next 
 fiscal year; (2) no substantial tax changes; (3) an 
 additional R50 billion ($8 billion using 6.2 rands 
 per dollar) aimed at poverty alleviation, 
 infrastructure, and increased wages for teachers and 
 police; and (4) relaxation of foreign exchange 
 controls on South African corporations.  Compared to 
 last February\'s formal budget submission to 
 Parliament, the SAG is now forecasting higher growth 
 for 2005 and 2006.  While macroeconomic indicators 
 are good, the government still faces challenges in 
 reducing unemployment and controlling growing 
 expenditures on social welfare grants. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
2. (U) Every October, the Finance Minister presents 
 the Mid Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to 
 Parliament which details updated budgetary plans for 
 the next three fiscal years.  On October 26, Trevor 
 Manuel summarized proposed policy changes and updated 
 economic, expenditure and revenue estimates in his 
 Mid Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), which 
 outlines the government\'s MTEF.  The MTBPS provides 
 an opportunity for a mid-year adjustment for policies 
 that would support key government priorities and 
 forecasts that determine how well macroeconomic 
 targets are met. 
 
MACROECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS ON TRACK 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The National Treasury revised GDP growth 
 forecasts upward.  It now expects growth to be 3.9, 
 3.7, and 4.2 percent for 2005, 2006, and 2007 
 respectively, compared to 2.9 percent expected for 
 2004.  (Note: Growth forecasts are given for calendar 
 years instead of fiscal years. Endnote.)  The 
 Treasury expects the targeted inflation rate (i.e., 
 consumer prices excluding mortgage costs) to remain 
 within the 3-6 percent range throughout the MTEF 
 period at roughly 5 percent, slightly higher than 
 expected for 2004.  In 2004, the current account 
 deficit should widen, reaching 2.2 percent of GDP as 
 compared to 0.8 percent in 2003, but be easily 
 financed from capital inflows.  The current account 
 deficit rises over the MTEF period gradually, 
 reaching 2.8 percent in 2007.  The country\'s balance 
 of payments position is strong, allowing the South 
 African Reserve Bank to steadily increase foreign 
 reserves. 
 
4. (U) Domestic investment has grown over the past 
two years, with real fixed capital formation 
 increasing by 6.1 and 8.4 percent compared with real 
 GDP growth of 3.6 and 1.9 in 2002 and 2003.  However, 
 the government wants to dramatically increase gross 
 fixed capital formation over the next three years to 
 grow the economy at 6 percent, the figure believed to 
 be necessary to make real progress in reducing the 
 country\'s very high unemployment.  Gross fixed 
 capital formation currently is 16 percent of GDP. 
 The government\'s goal is increase this to 25 percent 
 of GDP by 2014.  Low inflation and interest rates 
 should help this effort, as should the government\'s 
 intention to undertake a massive spending program to 
 invest in the country\'s infrastructure through public- 
 private partnerships. 
 
REVENUE OUTLOOK STRONG 
---------------------- 
 
5. (U) For FY2004, tax revenue is expected to be R1.9 
 billion higher than estimated last February, largely 
 because of higher than expected collections in value 
 added and personal tax revenues.  Corporate taxes 
 should be R6.2 billion less than budgeted, as the 
 strong rand has hurt corporate profits.  In FY2004, 
 revenues as a percent of GDP should be 24.5 percent, 
 rising to 25.1 percent by FY2007.  Over the next two 
 fiscal years, revenues are expected to increase by 10 
 percent and expenditures by 9 percent, which should 
 cause the deficit gradually to improve.  According to 
 the National Treasury, the budget deficit as a 
 percentage of GDP should be 3.2 percent in FY2004, 
 3.5 percent in FY2005, 3.2 percent in FY2006, and 2.7 
 percent by FY2007.  Manuel announced no new tax 
 policies, but did tag the mining sector for a full 
 review. 
 
EXTRA SPENDING NEEDED THIS YEAR 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The government will spend an extra R50 billion 
 ($8 billion) on poverty alleviation, infrastructure 
 improvements, and increased wages of teachers and 
 police.  Out of the R50 billion, 20.8 ($3.4) billion 
 will go to cover growing expenditures related to 
 social welfare grants, especially in the categories 
 of child support and disability.  Two million people 
 joined the list of grant beneficiaries between April 
 and September alone, pushing the total number of 
 beneficiaries to nine million - or one out of every 
 five South Africans.  Currently, the provinces 
 administer three types of grants are given: (1) child 
 grants (also including foster care) for children up 
 to 10 (this will be extended to children aged 13 in 
 2005); (2) disability grants (here, definitions have 
 been unclear and this is a source of concern); and 
 (3) grants for the elderly. 
 
7. (U) Beginning in March 2006, a new national 
 welfare grant agency will take over the 
 administration of welfare funds from provincial 
 government.  In the meantime, welfare funds will be 
 sourced from conditional grants (grants paid by the 
 national government to provinces for prescribed 
 purposes) rather than from the equitable share of 
 revenue that the provinces get from the national 
 government.  The change means that overruns will now 
 be the responsibility of the national government, 
 even though the provinces will continue to distribute 
 the grants until the changeover in 2006.  Under the 
 current system, the provinces must fulfill their 
 obligations for paying out social welfare grants over 
 other forms of provincial expenditure.  In some 
 cases, this has meant that the provinces have had to 
 cut back on critical health and education 
 expenditures, or taken bank overdrafts, to pay out 
 growing numbers of social welfare grants. 
 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS RELAXED 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Minister Manuel also recommended that certain 
 foreign exchange controls be relaxed.  Current rules 
 limit direct foreign investment by South African 
 corporations to R2 billion per project in Africa and 
 R1 billion elsewhere, plus 20 percent of any excess 
 cost.  Manuel removed these limits and lifted 
 restrictions on the repatriation of foreign 
 dividends.  However, corporations will still be 
 required to apply for South African Reserve Bank 
 approval (one of the stipulations being that the 
 investment must be in the interest of South Africa). 
 To facilitate his move to allow secondary foreign 
 listings on the South African exchanges, Manuel will 
 also allow South Africans to invest in such shares. 
 Limits on other foreign investments by South African 
 pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds 
 (unit trusts), and individuals remain in place, but 
 could be removed in future. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) The state of the economy outlined by the 
 National Treasury in its MTBPS is fairly strong.  The 
 National Treasury fully expects inflation to stay on 
 target in the near term.  It believes that falling 
 interest rates will encourage more investment and 
 that this should lead to an average economic growth 
 of 4 percent over the next three years.  As revenues 
 increase and social grant payments are brought under 
 control, the National Treasury expects the fiscal 
 deficit to increase to 3.5 percent next year, but 
 then decline.  The healthy state of the South African 
 economy has led several international credit agencies 
 to revise or review their credit ratings.  One 
 question mark on the horizon is whether strong global 
 economic growth stays on track and whether the rand 
 will grow even stronger.  Another question mark is 
 what would happen if growth in Europe (South Africa\'s 
 major trading partner), and China (which is fueling 
 world demand for commodities) slows, as this would 
 have unfavorable consequences on South Africa\'s 
 manufacturing and minerals exports, and thus growth. 
 Finally, the government knows that the increase in 
 social welfare grant payments is not sustainable over 
 the long term and it needs to get control of the 
 situation.  Right now, the trend line shows these 
 expenditures rising from 16.9 percent of all 
 government expenditures in FY2003 to 20 percent in 
 FY2007.  The government wants to reverse this trend 
 in social welfare grants by growing the economy 
 faster and putting people to work.  While the 
 government\'s forecasted growth of 4 percent growth 
 over the MTEF is a solid improvement over the last 
 three year period, it is still less than what the 
 government thinks it needs to make a significant dent 
 in unemployment, i.e., GDP growth on the order of 6 
 percent.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  U.S. telecommunications firm SBC 
Communications and Telkom Malaysia announced November 8 that 
they would sell their remaining interest in Telkom SA and 
exit South Africa.  An empowerment consortium led by senior 
ANC officials and influential empowerment figures (Andile 
Ngcaba, Smuts Ngonyama, and Gloria Serobe) will acquire the 
shares no later than November 15 pending agreement of a 
purchase price.  A source close to the deal said that 
Ngcaba, former Department of Communications Director- 
General, is conspiring to become CEO of Telkom.  While 
industry analysts say that the deal will raise Telkom\'s 
black economic empowerment (BEE) profile, critics complain 
that it will benefit only a small, black elite.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) U.S. telecommunications firm SBC Communications and 
Telkom Malaysia announced November 8 that they would sell 
their remaining interest in Telkom SA, ending months of 
speculation.  SBC and Telkom Malaysia hold 15.1 percent of 
Telkom SA through their Thintana Communications joint 
venture.  SBC controls 60 percent of Thintana while Telkom 
Malaysia owns 40 percent. 
 
3.  (SBU) In June, Thintana reduced its Telkom holdings from 
30 to 15.1 percent and agreed to retain its remaining stake 
until the November quarterly reports.  SBC recouped $543 
million from the June sale, almost 72 percent of its 
investment of $756.6 million in 1997.  Privately, SBC 
officials told Econoff that they were \"very pleased\" with 
the results of the June sale and said it bode well for SBC\'s 
eventual disinvestment from Telkom.  They also indicated at 
the time that corporate policy to reduce overseas holdings 
would likely lead to SBC\'s complete divestment from South 
Africa this year. 
 
4.  (SBU) Since that time, Thintana has been quietly 
negotiating with a consortium of empowerment groups led by 
senior ANC officials and influential empowerment figures.  A 
group shareholder told Econoff that the consortium dubbed 
\"Project Elephant\" consists of a group known as \"Project 
Lion\" led by former Department of Communications Director- 
General Andile Ngcaba and another group of investors called 
\"Project Buffalo\" headed by ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama and 
ANC Women\'s League member Gloria Serobe. 
 
5.  (SBU) Consortium and SBC officials were in Dallas 
negotiating terms of the deal when the Minister of 
Communications announced on September 2 that the industry 
would be liberalized in February 2005.  Telkom stock prices 
tumbled to R72 (NYSE $47.80).  Anticipating that Telkom 
prices would rise again, the consortium shareholder said 
that he then encouraged consortium officials to lock in a 
purchase price at R75 per share, but was rebuffed.  The 
consortium now faces stock prices of more than R93 (NYSE 
$56.74).  The sale is contingent upon the consortium 
finalizing a purchase price by November 15.  Otherwise, 
Thintana will sell its shares on the open market beginning 
November 16. 
 
6.  (SBU) Under terms of the deal, the consortium will 
acquire the special class B ordinary share in Telkom held by 
Thintana which will give it certain rights as a strategic 
equity investor, including potential seats on the Board of 
Directors and senior executive positions.  Although Telkom 
has the right of first refusal on the shares, a Department 
of Communications source told Econoff that it is a virtual 
surety that Government will not exercise that right.  A 
source close to the deal told Econoff that Andile Ngcaba is 
conspiring to lead Telkom and has a strategy in place to use 
this acquisition as a springboard to replace current Telkom 
CEO Sizwe Nxasana. 
 
7.  (U) While industry analysts say that the deal will raise 
Telkom\'s black economic empowerment (BEE) profile, critics 
complain that it will benefit only a small, black elite.  A 
front-page editorial in Business Day\'s November 10 edition 
criticized the deal, calling it \"an insult to the poor.\"  It 
slammed President Mbeki, Finance Minister Manuel and Public 
Enterprises Minister Erwin for not seizing this opportunity 
to redistribute the wealth of Telkom to South Africa\'s poor.

Summary 
 
Treasury Questions Shift of Primary Health Care to Provinces 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2.  Under the National Health Act, expected to begin in the 
2005-06 financial year, provincial health departments are to 
take over responsibility for primary health care, which they 
can then delegate to local authorities.  The act\'s intention is 
to consolidate fragmented primary health-care services under a 
single level of government, and will leave local government 
responsible only for environmental health services.  The act 
will also mean that the national treasury will replace local 
government as the funder of primary health-care services, via 
increases to the equitable share form of grant funding given to 
provinces. But a senior treasury official said that the health 
department was being urged to discuss alternative arrangements 
with the metropolitan areas.   The six metropolitan councils of 
Johannesburg, Tshwane (Pretoria), East Rand, Cape Town, Durban 
and Nelson Mandela (Port Elizabeth) currently account for about 
R700 million of the R1 billion annual primary health-care 
spending, which they fund from local taxes.  Primary health- 
care facilities include clinics, community health centers and 
some hospitals.   Treasury\'s health policy director, Mark 
Bletcher, said one option was to make the metropolitan 
authorities responsible for primary health care and fund them 
directly.   Another possibility would be for the metros to run 
the services and provide top-up funding above a norm supplied 
via the provinces.  Bletcher also said February\'s budget would 
include allocations to the nonmetropolitan areas via the 
equitable share, starting with about R200m in 2005-06, and 
rising to R300m in 2006-07 and R400m in 2007-08.   The 
Department of Treasury was concerned about the ability of some 
of the weaker district councils to manage the primary health 
care transition.  Source:  Business Day, November 1. 
 
Obesity a Problem in Africa 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  The first international obesity conference in Africa 
highlighted the health problems associated with overweight 
adults and pointed out that Africa suffers health impacts from 
obesity as well as the rest of the world.  There are over 300 
million overweight adults worldwide, suffering from weight- 
related illnesses like diabetes, heart disease and sleeping 
disorders.  One in three South Africa males and over one in two 
adult women are overweight.  In Morocco, 40 percent of the 
population is overweight, while in Kenya it is 12 percent. In 
Nigeria, 6 to 8 percent of people are obese.   Obesity has 
created a double burden in parts of Africa still struggling to 
overcome malnutrition.  Obesity among the young was pointing to 
a large increase in type 2 diabetes.  The spread of AIDS 
dissuades people from losing weight.  AIDS is nicknamed \"slim\" 
(thin) throughout Africa as victims waste away. People do not 
want to lose weight in case others think they have HIV.  About 
25 percent of people living in the Middle East are overweight, 
while obesity has doubled among Japanese men since 1982. 
Children around the world are also growing obese, with the 
fattest children living in the Middle East, Chile, Greece and 
southern Italy.  Source:  The Cape Times, November 2. 
 
Cape Study Shows Most Addicts Share Needles 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  Between 12,000 and 18,000 Capetonians are addicted to 
heroin and almost all those who inject the drug share needles, 
according to a recent report by the Medical Research Council 
(MRC) on drug use in South African cities.  The report found 
that escalating numbers of Capetonians are seeking help for 
addiction to heroin and to tik (methamphetamine), which was 
hardly in use four years ago.  An MRC study conducted in July 
and August found that around a quarter of heroin addicts in 
treatment centers in Cape Town had been injecting the drug and 
four out of five had shared a needle within the previous 30 
days.  Two years ago only one percent of all those getting 
treatment at the centre were addicted to tik. Last year it 
increased to five percent and this year to at least 40 percent. 
The study found that a quarter of all addicts receiving 
treatment in the city use tik as their main or secondary drug.

Real Health Care Spending 4.8 Percent Lower in 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5.  The South Africa Survey shows that healthcare spending in 
2003 was 4.8 percent lower in real terms than in 1996, with 
large inequities still existing between the provinces.  Some 
provinces spent as little as 75 rand ($1.23 using 6.1 rands per 
dollar) per capita per annum, where the government goal is 200 
rand.  Two of the provinces with the highest HIV/AIDS infection 
rates, Gauteng and Mpumalanga, failed to spend all the money 
allocated to them in conditional grants to fight the pandemic 
in 2002/03.  Gauteng spent only 52 percent of its funds, while 
Mpumalanga spent only 38 percent.  In 1995 an estimated 85 
percent of companies were providing benefits to their 
pensioners, while in 2003 this number had fallen to only 43 
percent. The government increased the value of the old-age 
social pension by 13 percent between April 2002 and April 2003. 
During the same period, the number of beneficiaries of child 
support grants increased by 45 percent.   Between 1997 and 
2003, the number of welfare grant beneficiaries in South Africa 
grew by 124 percent from 2.5 million to 5.6 million.  Source: 
I-Net Bridge, November 3. 
 
Increasing Welfare Grants Crowd Out Other Government 
Expenditures 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  Welfare grants will comprise over 40 percent of the 
government expenditure increases for the next three years. 
Finance Minister Manuel allocated R20.8 billion ($3.4 billion 
using 6.1 rands per dollar) of the R50 billion ($8.2 billion) 
for welfare grants.  Two million people were added to the 
beneficiary lists for various grants between April and 
September this year alone, pushing the total number of 
recipients to nine million, about one in five of the total 
population.   Much of the increase was in the unexplained 
escalation in disability and foster care grants, which Manuel 
said was most likely due to poor administration.  Manuel said 
that in some provinces, officials were adding applicants to the 
list without any checks, families were registering their own 
children as foster children and government officials were 
illegally claiming childcare support for their own children. 
The government has no figures on the number of people claiming 
disability grants as a result of HIV/AIDS and there are no firm 
guidelines on their eligibility.   In addition, there are plans 
to raise the ceiling for child grants from 10 to 13 years 
through 2008.  Welfare grant administration will be shifted to 
a national social welfare agency in 2006, but Manuel moved this 
week to limit the damage to other services by shifting welfare 
funds from the equitable share paid to provinces to the 
conditional grants that go to these regional governments.  The 
change would mean that overruns would be the responsibility of 
the national department even though distribution would remain a 
provincial responsibility until March 2006.  At present, 
welfare claims take precedence over other provincial 
expenditure.  Provinces have had to cut back on critical health 
and education budgets or have taken out bank overdrafts to pay 
welfare grants expected to total R38.4 billion ($6.3 billion) 
in the current financial year, rising to R47 billion ($7.7 
billion) in the 2007/08 fiscal year.  In the financial year 
through March 2004, Northern Cape overspent on welfare grants 
by 8.6 percent, KwaZulu-Natal by 7.2 percent, Eastern Cape by 
7.7 percent and Gauteng by 4.1 percent. Western Cape and North 
West provinces under spent in this regard.  Source:  Business 
Times and I-Net Bridge, November 3. 
 
Alcohol-related Sexual Risk Behavior Study Released 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  The Medical Research Council (MRC) released a report 
investigating alcohol-related sexual risk behavior, funded by 
the World Health Organization.  The study included qualitative 
assessments involving interviews and focus groups, developing 
in-depth questionnaires and finally testing the survey using 
160 24-44 adults in two townships and one city in Gauteng.  Key 
findings were:  (1) Alcohol use was widespread among adults in 
the 25-44 year age group.  Although less likely to drink, 
females were more involved in risky drinking (defined as 5 or 
more drinks per day for males and 3 or more drinks for 
females); (2) Sexual gender differences exist; males were more 
likely to have younger and multiple sexual partners and use 
condoms, while females were more likely to have older partners 
and view sexual intercourse as safer with older men;  (3) 
Access to condoms and knowledge about HIV infection due to 
multiple sexual partners were high, but condom use was not. 
Condom use was more common with a casual rather than a regular 
sexual partner;  (4) Sexual risk behavior was identified as one 
of the consequences of heavy drinking; and (5) there was no 
correlation between various alcohol use variables and condom 
use.  The research suggests that reductions of heavy alcohol 
consumption and sexual risk behavior should be targeted to 
families and communities as well as individual treatment. 
Treatment should reduce opportunities and demand for heavy 
drinking, leading to possible reductions in sexual risk 
behaviors.  Source:  www.sahealthinfo.org, November 1. 
 
Shortage in Health Staffing 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  According to Health Systems Trust\'s (HST) 2003-04 South 
African Health Review, 31.1 percent of health posts in the 
public sector were vacant between 2001 and 2003, and health 
care vacancies differed widely among provinces, with 67.4 
percent of Mpumalanga\'s posts vacant, 13.4 percent in Limpopo 
and 13.8 percent in Western Cape.  HST asserts that the 
migration of graduates to other countries is probably the 
largest contributor to the shortage of health care 
professionals.  In addition, the introduction of the rural and 
scarce skills allowances this year, designed to attract health 
professionals to the public sector and keep them there, had 
limited success in increasing the supply of personnel in 
underserved areas.  The number of medical graduates involved in 
community service has declined.  To increase black health 
professionals, Health Professions Council of SA registrar Boyce 
Mkhize called for equity targets to be set for training 
institutions, and suggested there be broadened criteria for the 
admission of black students, asserting that many blacks were 
excluded due to poor matric grades from poorly resourced 
schools.  The Council\'s statistics show that only 23,419, or 22 
percent, of the 104,463 health professionals registered with it 
describe themselves as black or African, and when those 
describing themselves as Asian (5491) and coloured (1708) are 
added, the percentage is only 25 percent. But new registrations 
of black, coloured and Asian professionals have increased to 
70.2 percent this year, from 42.7 percent in 2000.  Since 1998, 
most of South Africa\'s eight medical universities have used 
\"alternative admissions tests\", which take non-academic 
criteria into account in an effort to increase admissions of 
black students. In 2003, 45 percent of first year medical 
students were black, about 10 percent coloured, 15 percent 
Indian and 30 percent white.  Source:  Business Day, November 
5. 
 
South Africa:  AIDS Drugs Needed for HIV-positive Children 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
9.  Although there is no separate national target, the number 
of children currently receiving ARVs is low. The AIDS lobby 
group, Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), recently conducted a 
survey in 13 of KwaZulu-Natal\'s largest public hospitals and 
found that only 39 children were receiving anti-AIDS 
medication.  According to Dr Neil McKerrow at Grey Hospital in 
Pietermaritzburg, the province\'s unofficial target is to have 
2,000 children on ARV treatment by March 2005.  The national 
treatment plan, unveiled last November, initially targeted the 
treatment of 53,000 people by March 2004, which has since been 
extended to March 2005.  Efforts to establish the national 
status of the ARV rollout for children were difficult, as the 
National Department of Health would not disclose the number of 
children on treatment in the public sector.  Nevertheless, 
doctors and healthcare workers are still debating at what age a 
child should start taking ARVs. Under South African law, a 
child younger than 14 years requires consent from a parent or 
guardian to be given the drugs, but TAC is saying the \'right 
age\' cannot be regulated by government and should be assessed 
by doctors on a case-by- case basis.  Another obstacle to 
providing free drugs to children is the prohibitive cost of 
specialized tests for diagnosing HIV in children younger than 
18 months.  The most commonly used HIV antibody test, the rapid 
test, is unable to discern between maternal and child 
antibodies in infants. Because HIV antibodies can cross the 
placenta and stay in a child\'s bloodstream for 15 months, a 
baby needs a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, which can 
detect small quantities of viral protein in the blood, to 
establish their status.  This test is not widely available and 
is substantially more expensive than rapid tests.  Adult ARVs 
are available to children above three years of age, with 
specific formulations and dosages based on age and weight. 
Despite pediatric syrup having been made more widely available 
over the last few months, not all caregivers, particularly 
those living in remote rural areas, have the refrigeration 
facilities needed to store the medication.  The adherence of 
children to the drugs is another challenge. According to Noreen 
Ramsden from the Children\'s Rights Centre in Durban, only 70 
percent of children adhered to the treatment plan.  Orphaned 
children in child-headed households in both urban and rural 
areas, who lack supportive care and proximity to treatment 
centers, find it even more difficult to access the drugs.

Insurance Companies Remove HIV Exclusion Clauses 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10.  South Africa\'s R163.8 billion ($26.9 billion using 6.1 
rands per dollar) insurance industry could drop HIV/AIDS 
exclusion clauses on all new policies starting January 2005. 
The Life Offices\' Association (LOA) is expected to issue a 
statement to this affect just after its annual general meeting 
on November 19, when the issue will be put to the vote. 
Already some insurance companies have dropped HIV/AIDS 
exclusions from certain products in anticipation of the 
agreement.  African Life last week removed all HIV/AIDS 
exclusions on its new and existing burial policies and Old 
Mutual, the country\'s largest life insurer, removed one of its 
few remaining HIV exclusions by scrapping the clause from its 
premium waiver cover on newer life and investment products. 
Gerhard Joubert, the executive director of the LOA, said that 
the removal of the exclusion clauses effectively placed 
HIV/AIDS equal to any other medical condition as far as long- 
term insurance policies were concerned.  For most insurance 
companies, this will mean that applicants who initially tested 
HIV-negative would have to be paid out in full even if the 
eventual cause of death is AIDS-related.  While insurance 
companies may still require HIV testing, they would no longer 
be allowed to deny new applications from those who test HIV- 
positive.  Joubert said on average 5 percent of applicants for 
long-term insurance risk products were HIV-positive.  Source:

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  South Africa is working to identify an acceptable 
solution to the problem of elephant overpopulation in its 
national parks.  An October conference with stakeholders 
held at Kruger National Park reviewed different elephant 
management methods, including relocation, contraception and 
culling.  Culling appeared to be the most favored option 
despite concerns from animal rights activists.  The 
country\'s park service will make policy recommendations to 
the government in 2005 and culling is likely to be part of 
the final plan for elephant management.  In the meantime, 
Kruger will be demarcated into several zones in an effort to 
protect the park\'s biodiversity from the growing numbers of 
elephants. End Summary. 
 
Elephant culling is emotional issue 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU)  Wanda Mkhutshulwa, Head of Communications at the 
South African National Parks (SANParks), told ES&T Assistant 
that the country\'s elephant population is approximately 
20,000.  The Kruger National Park (KNP) is home to over 
12,000 of these elephants, a rapid increase from under 7,000 
in 1995.  KNP can accommodate only 7,500 elephants 
comfortably, so the current population is well above 
\"capacity.\"  The remaining elephants are scattered in other 
parks around the country.  Ms. Mkhutshulwa stressed that 
culling is a highly emotional and sensitive subject, and 
that SANParks is treating it as such. 
 
Elephant numbers grow, have negative impact 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U)  According to conservationists, elephants do not have 
any natural enemies in the wild and are well protected from 
poaching in the parks in South Africa.  Elephants are also 
not susceptible to diseases and have a long lifespan.  As a 
result, their numbers can only increase.  According to 
Mkhutshulwa, ten years ago the South African government 
discontinued population control by culling.  Since then 
elephant numbers have swelled, creating serious problems for 
humans, fauna and flora.  She said that conservationists and 
scientists agree that elephants are overgrazing the park 
land, to the detriment of other species.  They also destroy 
trees, some of which take long to reach maturity, or are a 
very rare species. 
 
4.  (U)  SANParks is also concerned with the impact of 
elephants on the environment.  Mkhutshulwa cited the example 
of Maphungubwe National Park, a world heritage site in 
Limpopo province.  She said the park has only about 50 
elephants, but their impact on the vegetation is very 
visible.  The park had three forests of Ilala palm, a rare 
palm family species, in its natural habitat.  Elephants 
destroyed two of the forests, and the remaining forest 
survived only because it is enclosed in a private property. 
Local communities living in the vicinity of the parks have 
also complained about the elephants breaking through fences 
and raiding crop fields and the drinking holes of livestock. 
Escaped elephants also pose a threat to nearby inhabitants, 
and the fences broken by the elephants can also result in 
other dangerous predators escaping, a threat to humans and 
livestock. 
 
Stakeholders discuss options to manage growing elephant 
population 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU)  SANParks hosted a conference in the KNP in October 
2004, to discuss various elephant population control and 
management methods.  National laws require all-inclusive 
consultations on national park policies that affect 
stakeholder groups.  Over 200 interested and affected 
parties, including academics, scientists, local community 
members, NGOs and the government, represented by Department 
of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, attended the 
conference.  Although the participants reached no final 
decision on how to downsize the elephant numbers, according 
to Mkhutshulwa, most supported culling.  She said that five 
breakaway groups discussed different approaches to the 
problem, and three supported culling, one objected, while 
the last group was indecisive.  Culling, which involves 
selective elimination of elephants for conservation 
purposes, was perceived to be the most viable and reasonably 
humane option to adopt. 
 
Alternative options considered weak, less effective 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6. (SBU)  Animal rights groups and other stakeholders 
attending the conference suggested alternative management 
methods such as contraception, translocation to parks in 
Africa or other foreign countries showing an interest. 
SANParks did not dismiss such suggestions, but it has a 
responsibility to provide an effective solution to the 
problem as soon as possible.  Mkhutshulwa said that 
contraception is a slower-acting and more expensive method. 
She said elephants that have been relocated to another 
country, such as Mozambique, have walked back to their old 
habitat in South Africa.  Some countries eligible for 
relocation do not want the elephants, as they too have 
elephant overpopulation.  Zimbabwe has 80,000 while Botswana 
has 120,000 elephants, according to Mkhutshulwa.  South 
Africa does not want to repeat the mistake of allowing the 
elephant population to reach such great proportions. 
 
7. (SBU) SANParks\' view is that because elephants are such 
free ranging animals, South Africa would appear 
irresponsible if it were to relocate them to countries where 
they will be confined to captivity.  It would also be 
traumatic for elephants to be deprived of the freedom they 
have had all their lives, especially the older ones. 
Translocation is costly and is not expected to make a big 
impact on the existing numbers.  A scientist at the 
conference said that exporting the elephants to places as 
far away and foreign as West Africa would be like sending 
the elephants to another planet, where they would struggle 
to adapt.  Also, the elephant species found in West Africa 
are different from their Southern African relatives of the 
savannah grassland.  Security is another problem, as it is 
not clear that the elephants can be sufficiently protected. 
According to Mkhutshulwa, most options have serious 
limitations. 
 
SANParks responsible for efficient park management 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8. (SBU)  South Africa\'s Protected Areas Act stipulates that 
SANParks\' management policy must be approved by the Minister 
of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.  SANParks is 
responsible for efficient management of the country\'s 
national parks, and if it fails to deliver, the government 
can transfer responsibility to another entity.  Mkhutshulwa 
said that SANParks is also planning to divide the KNP into 
different zones so that the impact of the elephants on the 
park\'s biodiversity can be better controlled.  According to 
Mkhutshulwa there will be a high impact absorbing area in 
the center of KNP, low impact areas and specific protected 
vegetation areas, where elephants would be kept out to 
protect the plants.  As a signatory to the Convention on 
Biodiversity, SANParks believes South Africa cannot afford 
to be seen losing species through poor park management. 
 
9. (SBU)  Mkhutshulwa said that culling is not likely to 
encourage poaching because KNP management had almost 
eliminated poaching in the last ten years.  Most of the 
policing work is done through intelligence methods involving 
community participation.  If communities stand to benefit 
from saving the parks and protecting wildlife, they will not 
tolerate poaching or allow it to occur. The law also imposes 
very stringent penalties against transgressors, which is 
another deterrent. 
 
Next steps by South African government 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  Following the elephant management conference, 
SANParks plans to hold bilateral meetings with interested 
parties for further deliberations.  SANParks will formulate 
policy recommendations to be presented to the Minister of 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism by April 2005.  The 
Minister will then publish the policy document for public 
comment before making a final decision on whether or not to 
cull.  If the Minister approves a recommendation to cull, 
the government will consult relevant stakeholders and 
appoint an ethics committee for advice on specific culling 
methods.  The stakeholders and the committee members will be 
invited to witness the culling to ensure that the animals do 
not suffer.  SANparks officials will apply agreed-upon best 
practices in culling elephants, which have a higher level of 
intellect and consciousness relative to other animals. 
Tusks recovered from any culling will be added to the 
national stockpile stored at the KNP, while the skins and 
meat will be sold to the local communities. 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (SBU)  Elephant culling stirs emotions in South Africa 
and around the world.  SANParks is carefully balancing the 
concerns and emotions of stakeholders on the culling issue 
with its responsibility to manage biodiversity in national 
parks.  We expect the final, well-debated decision to 
include an option of culling.

SUBJECT:  SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC NEWSLETTER 
           NOVEMBER 12, 2004 ISSUE 
 
 
1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
 economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
 Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
 opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
 newsletter are: 
 -  Manufacturing Growth for Eighth Consecutive Month; 
 -  Rise in Individual Credit Debt Unsustainable; 
 -  Reserve Bank Increases Foreign Exchange and Gold Reserves; 
 -  Real Wholesale Trade Sales Increase 18.1 Percent; 
 -  Provincial Governments Project R2.2 Billion Deficit; 
 -  September House Prices Increase 33.9 Percent; and 
 -  Economic Inequalities Still Remain. 
 End Summary. 
 
MANUFACTURING GROWTH FOR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  According to Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), 
 manufacturing production grew by 6.1 percent (y/y) in 
 September compared to August\'s 6.8 percent growth. 
 September\'s manufacturing sales grew by 12 percent.  Third 
 quarter 2004\'s manufacturing production grew by 2.7 
 percent (seasonally adjusted) compared to second quarter 
 2004\'s 1.8 percent growth.  Third quarter growth was 
 robust with eight out of ten manufacturing sub-sectors 
 reporting higher growth.  The main contributors to third 
 quarter growth were the food, motor vehicle and furniture 
 sectors.  Strong domestic consumption was the key reason 
 behind manufacturing growth, as the Euro zone\'s growth has 
 not been as strong as initially expected.  Approximately 
 30 percent of South Africa\'s manufactured goods are 
 exported, and of these exports, roughly 35 percent go to 
 the Euro zone.  Continued strength of the rand and 
 uncertain global oil prices constrain domestic producers 
 from raising their prices.  Source:  Standard Bank, 
 Manufacturing Unpacked, November 9; Business Day, Business 
 Report, November 10. 
 
3.  Comment.  There are signs of manufacturing growth 
 leveling off in the near future.  The Investec Purchasing 
 Manager\'s Index declined in October, (although it is still 
 above the 50 level, which signals activity expansion) and 
 the rand has recently strengthened.  During October 2004, 
 the rand appreciated 2.5 percent, while the average 
 monthly change in 2004 so far is a 0.3 percent 
 appreciation.  Lower than expected global growth may also 
 contribute to a possible slowdown in manufacturing 
 activity.  ABSA economist John Loos believes that consumer 
 demand peaked in the third quarter and predicts consumers 
 to curtail future spending.  Healthy growth is still 
 expected for manufacturing though lower than the current 6 
 percent monthly growth.   Manufacturing contributes 18 
 percent to South Africa\'s economy and continuing expansion 
 in this sector is needed for sustained economic growth. 
 End Comment. 
 
RISE IN INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DEBT UNSUSTAINABLE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  Efficient Research financial services group contents 
 that South African credit debt levels are manageable, but 
 current growth rates cannot be supported.  Total credit 
 card debt in September 2004 was R3 billion ($500 million 
 using 6.1 rands per dollar) higher than the previous 
 September, with individuals accounting for most of the 
 increase.  The amount owed on individual credit cards is 
 at the highest level yet at R18 billion ($3 billion). 
 Overall, total South African credit increased by R9.5 
 billion ($1.6 billion) in September compared to August 
 2004.  However, the use of overdrafts by individuals 
 declined, indicating that savings on lower home (all of 
 South African mortgages issued use variable rates) and 
 vehicle loan rates were sources of financing increased 
 individual credit.  Increased use of overdrafts is one 
 indication of credit overextension.  Source:  Business 
 Report, November 10. 
 
RESERVE BANK INCREASES FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5.   The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) increased 
 foreign exchange reserves, reaching US $11.3 billion in 
 October from $10.7 billion in September and $10.4 billion 
 in August.  Gold reserves of $1.7 billion lifted total 
 gross reserves to $13 billion at the end of October.  In 
 October, SARB bought $590 million worth of foreign 
 exchange and provided $372 million worth of financing for 
 repayment of a National Treasury euro-denominated loan. 
 Many economists believe that the SARB should have at least 
 $20 billion in foreign exchange reserves given that 
 average monthly imports have exceeded $4 billion this 
 year.   From 1999 though February 2004, the foreign 
 exchange reserves had fluctuated around the $6 billion 
 level.  In March 2004, reserves increased by $2 billion 
 and have been increasing ever since.  Source:  I-Net 
 Bridge, November 5; Business Day, November 8. 
 
REAL WHOLESALE TRADE SALES INCREASE 18.1 PERCENT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  According to Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), August 
 real wholesale trade sales, excluding diamonds, increased 
 18.1 percent (y/y) compared to June and July growth of 
 16.7 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively.  The three 
 months\' (ending in August) seasonally adjusted real 
 wholesale trade sales increased 15.1 percent (y/y), as 
 wholesale inflation remained around 2 percent.  In May 
 2004, StatsSA revised the company list that comprises 
 wholesale and retail trade data, saying that sales were 
 systematically under reported.  The new list, based on the 
 value-added tax (VAT) database obtained from the South 
 African Revenue Service (SARS), covers all businesses in 
 South Africa expecting to reach sales of R300,000 
 ($50,000) for a 12-month period.  The coverage of the new 
 company list is greater than that of the old list. 
 Company information is provided by SARS and verified by 
 StatsSA.  StatsSA has further plans to improve company 
 coverage by accessing corporate income tax records.

PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS PROJECT R2.2 BILLION DEFICIT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  Provincial governments are projecting a R2.2 billion 
 deficit ($361 million using 6.1 rands per dollar) in 
 expenditure in the FY2004, largely due to unexpectedly 
 high increases in the number of people receiving foster 
 care and disability grants.  Those provinces not having 
 surplus funds will have to finance these deficits from 
 next year\'s budgets, as the national government\'s policy 
 is to not fund overruns of provincial budgets.  In the 
 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, Finance Minister 
 Manuel announced an additional R4.3 billion ($705 million) 
 provincial appropriation for FY2004; however, the 
 projected aggregated R2.2 billion budget deficit takes 
 this into account.  The Eastern Cape and Northern Cape 
 provinces are already operating on overdrafts, while some 
 provinces have already instituted cost containment 
 measures and other initiatives to ensure their deficits 
 are reduced to levels of available funding.  Provincial 
 revenue this fiscal year included budgeted equitable share 
 spending not earmarked of R160 billion, conditional grants 
 of R21.2 billion and provincial revenue of R5.4 billion. 
 The figures on provincial spending for the first six 
 months of this fiscal year also showed slow spending of 
 capital expenditure.   Provinces spent 29.5 percent (R3.3 
 billion) of their R11.3 billion capital budgets.  Capital 
 spending in education was 23.2 percent and provinces spent 
 27.2 percent in health capital spending.  The lowest rates 
 of capital spending were in Gauteng (6.4 percent), 
 Mpumalanga (11.9 percent) and Northern Cape (12.3 
 percent); Free State and Limpopo recorded the highest at 
 48.1 percent and 54.6 percent, respectively.  Provinces 
 spent 52 percent of their R47.3 billion social development 
 budget by the end of September.  Provincial spending on 
 social development rose from R20.9 billion in 2000-01 to 
 R42.4 billion in 2003-04, an annual average nominal growth 
 of 26.6 percent.  Source:  Business Day, November 8. 
 
SEPTEMBER HOUSE PRICES INCREASE BY 33.9 PERCENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.  Real house prices increased by 33.9 percent this year 
 through September, compared with a revised increase of 
 33.3 percent through August, according to the latest ABSA 
 bank house price index.  Monthly house price increases 
 were on a declining trend, from 3.1 percent in January to 
 1.5 percent in September, indicating potential lower 
 growth in the near future.  Relatively stable interest 
 rates this year, combined with the continuing rise in 
 house prices, already resulted in an increase in new 
 mortgage payments.  Ultimately, rapidly growing housing 
 prices will increase housing costs leading to lower demand 
 for housing and lower growth in prices.  The ABSA bank 
 house price index showed a nominal year-on-year increase 
 of 35.4 percent in house prices in October and the revised 
 increase of 35.6 percent for September, with the y/y 
 increase in the past 10 months averaging 32 percent.

ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES STILL REMAIN 
---------------------------------- 
 
9.  The Economic Transformation Audit and Scorecard, 
 compiled by a panel of economic experts for the Institute 
 for Justice and Reconciliation, showed poverty and 
 inequality are still increasing in South Africa.  The 
 Institute\'s calculations show that 58 percent of the South 
 African population and 69 percent of black South Africans 
 now live under the basic poverty level.  Between 1996 and 
 2001, the study found that with poverty measured in terms 
 of income increased, more households fell below the basic 
 poverty line of R250 ($40) a day.  Those living under the 
 mean (average) poverty line of R91 ($15) a day rose from 
 26 percent in 1996 to 28 percent in 2001, while black 
 South African per capita income as a percentage of white 
 income declined by 1.3 percent from the already low base 
 of 8.2 percent in 1996. The average black South African 
 now has less than seven percent of the income of an 
 average white South African.  White and Asian shares of 
 the total income are growing again after a slight drop, 
 but the average white person is somewhat worse off, 
 indicating more poverty as well as wealth.  Real household 
 income at the higher end of the income spectrum increased 
 (in all population groups), resulting in a widening in 
 inequality for the first time since 1975.  Income of 
 households headed by South African women relative to those 
 headed by men increased by 4 percent since 1996.  The 
 percentage of households with clean water and electricity 
 increased since 1996, although up to one third of the 
 population is still without these basic services.  The 
 percentage of families living in permanent structures 
 decreased from 77.6 percent in 1995 to 73.8 percent in 
 2002, and the number of households increased during the 
 same period.  Between 1995 and 2002, the percentage of 
 children at school decreased by 0.7 percent and the infant 
 mortality increased by 14 percent.  The number of jobs 
 increased by 1 million during the same time frame, 
 however, due to a large increase in the labor force, 
 unemployment is now at 42 percent.  Source:  Sunday Argus,

1. (U) Summary.  Finance Minister Trevor Manuel addressed 
Parliament on October 26 to table the Medium Term Policy 
Statement, an appropriations adjustment bill, and a tax 
amendment.  He presented a detailed overview of the 
government\'s development priorities over the next three years 
and economic outlook.  Manuel said that sound fiscal 
management and successful inflation targeting meant that the 
government could now focus more on growing the economy \"to 
create employment, and to generate resources to plow into 
education, health care, social security, fighting crime, and 
reducing poverty.\"  He predicted growth would average 4% over 
the next three years and flatly declared that the 
government\'s goal was to increase the rate of gross fixed 
capital formation from 16% of GDP to 25% by 2014.  While 
acknowledging that private sector investment would be 
responsible for most of this increase, he focused most of his 
discussion on what the public sector needed to do.  Manuel 
warned that public sector borrowing would rise as state-owned 
enterprises borrowed from capital markets to fund a large 
proportion of their infrastructure investment. 
 
2. (U) Manuel departed from political convention on several 
occasions.  He commented that the ownership criteria in some 
draft Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) charters were self 
defeating, leading to unnecessarily complex and risky 
financing structures.  Just as critical, he thought, was 
building the economy, increasing production, creating jobs, 
developing young black managers, and investing in social 
development.  Manuel conceded that immigrant skills could be 
critical to growth, since it would take time before education 
and training programs yielded substantial returns to the 
economy.  Manuel admitted that the social security net was 
under severe strain, and should be removed from the provinces 
and consolidated under a new national social welfare agency 
that would be able to stem the flow of grants to people who 
did not warrant them.  Finally, he said that the Cabinet 
wanted to introduce an index to monitor government 
administered prices in electricity, water, transport, 
education, and health sectors -- all of which seemed to be 
growing faster than inflation.  End Summary. 
 
3. (U) Finance Minister Trevor Manuel addressed Parliament on 
October 26 to table the Cabinet\'s Medium Term Policy 
Statement, the Adjustments Appropriations Bill, and the 
Revenue Laws Amendment Bill.  Manuel\'s speech reflected the 
government\'s growing confidence in its ability to manage the 
economy.  Manuel made the point that sound fiscal policy and 
inflation targeting had contributed to lower interest rates 
and buoyant consumer demand.  This, in concert with high 
commodity prices and a strong international economy, had 
fomented greater local business confidence.  He said that 
trade reforms of the 1990s had caused South African business 
to become internationally competitive and more able to 
penetrate new markets.  The result was that domestic 
investment was evident across a wide range of sectors -- 
particularly construction, services, and manufacturing -- and 
more balanced growth.  Moreover, strong capital inflows meant 
that the country could finance a higher current account 
deficit and use that deficit to grow faster.  Manuel 
concluded that the reforms of the last ten years were now 
bearing fruit. 
 
State of the Economy 
-------------------- 
 
4. (U) While the South African economy grew just under 3% per 
year since 1994, Manuel said that government projections 
suggested that the economy would now grow faster.  Manuel 
confirmed the government\'s forecast at least 2.9% growth in 
2004.  However, continued fiscal stimulus, firm commodity 
prices, and a more competitive real exchange rate (assumed in 
the future) along with low interest rates and rising income 
would support an average of 4% growth over the next three 
years.  At this point, Manuel broke from his prepared text to 
say that he, personally, felt 4% was a conservative estimate; 
actual growth might be closer to 5%. 
 
5. (U) Manuel reaffirmed his commitment to inflation 
targeting, predicting that CPIX (consumer inflation less 
mortgage costs) would remain firmly within the 3-6% target 
range over next three years.  He pointed out that sticking to 
the target thus far had successfully lowered inflation 
expectations.  While high oil prices posed risks to both 
global growth and domestic inflation, projected inflation for 
2004, at 4.4%, would still fall within the target range. 
Administered prices, on the other hand, had become a subject 
of Cabinet attention.  Manuel noted that the Cabinet wanted 
to introduce an index to monitor administered prices in 
electricity, water, transport, education, and health sectors 
-- all of which seemed to be growing faster than inflation. 
While administered prices still needed to balance price 
stability, capital requirements, and service delivery 
objectives, the Cabinet also felt that there was room to 
improve the price setting process. 
 
6. (U) Manuel was mindful of the current strength of the 
rand, particularly vis-a-vis the dollar.  He acknowledged 
that there were adjustment problems for industry at R6 to the 
dollar and equally important problems at R10 to the dollar, 
especially with oil prices at record highs.  On the bright 
side, he thought that business confidence in the face of a 
strong rand revealed South African resiliency and improved 
competitiveness, and also reflected the general perception 
that doing business in South Africa now carried lower risk. 
 
Priorities 
---------- 
 
7. (U) Manuel reminded Parliament of President Mbeki\'s three 
challenges: 1) to encourage the growth and development of the 
First Economy to increase employment; 2) to address the 
challenges of the Second Economy; and 3) to build a social 
security net to alleviate poverty.  With these in mind, 
Manuel said that the government could now focus more on 
growing the economy \"to create employment, and to generate 
resources to plow into education, health care, social 
security, fighting crime, and reducing poverty.\"  He said 
that for the first time in ten years, there was evidence that 
growth was resulting in employment gains.  Between March 2003 
and 2004, South Africa gained 400,000 new jobs, causing the 
official unemployment rate to fall by 3.4%. 
 
8. (U) Manuel outlined the government\'s short and long-term 
approaches to growth.  In the short-term, targeted incentives 
and public works programs would accelerate investment and job 
creation.  In addition, the government would take measures to 
make the distribution and pricing of water and energy 
resources more efficient.  Manuel conceded that immigrant 
skills could be critical in the short-term, since it would 
take time before education and training programs yielded 
substantial returns to the economy.  In the long-term, Manuel 
said that the government had to pay attention to investment 
in economic infrastructure (including electricity supply and 
rail service), regional development policy reform, and more 
effective competition policy. 
 
9. (U) During this discussion, Manuel highlighted sequencing 
and coordination issues in social policy.  Housing programs 
could be accelerated, he said, but needed to be aligned with 
regional development plans, job creation, and community 
services.  Social health insurance was a long-term goal that 
needed to be preceded by the modernization of public 
hospitals.  Land redistribution and BEE agricultural 
development needed to move forward, but not until the 
restitution program was completed and needed bureaucratic 
resources freed. 
 
The First Economy 
----------------- 
 
10. (U) Manuel flatly declared that the Government\'s goal was 
to increase the rate of gross fixed capital formation from 
16% of GDP to 25% by 2014.  To do this, the Government would 
pursue a supportive investment environment which included 
moderate inflation, low real interest rates, a stable and 
competitive currency, and implementation of certain 
microeconomic reforms.  Manuel was encouraged by 7% private 
sector investment growth in 2003 and 7.6% in the first half 
of 2004.  While acknowledging that most investment in the 
economy would have to come from the private sector, he then 
spent more time talking about what the public sector would 
do.  This included employing public-private partnerships to 
overhaul the country\'s public transport systems, investing in 
ports, and renewing the country\'s rolling stock.  Other 
public sector priorities included investment in health and 
education infrastructure, roads, housing, as well as 
expanding water and electricity services to the poor. 
11. (U) In a departure from past ministerial statements, 
Manuel admitted that the ownership criteria in some draft BEE 
charters were not realistic, leading to unnecessarily complex 
and risky financing structures.  This was self-defeating, he 
said.  While increasing the level of ownership of black 
people in corporate South Africa remained critical, just as 
critical was building the economy, increasing production, 
creating jobs, developing young black managers, and investing 
in social development.  At the same time, Manuel lauded the 
Financial Services BEE Charter for providing the impetus 
behind the launch of the low-cost Mzansi bank account that 
was designed to attract millions to the formal banking system. 
 
The Second Economy 
------------------ 
 
12. (U) To foster development of the country\'s \"Second 
Economy,\" Manuel said that the government would have to 
balance direct income support with investing in human 
capital.  This covered a wide spectrum of programs, including 
expanded public works programs to create jobs and 
infrastructure, housing and municipal grants, 
micro-enterprise development, skills development, land 
restitution, land reform, and agricultural support programs. 
Manuel also promised that the 2005 budget would further raise 
teacher salaries.  He said that the renewal of the primary 
school nutrition program under the education departments of 
the provinces was already in progress.  The provinces would 
receive additional funding to cover increases in social 
grants, higher personnel costs, greater infrastructure 
spending, and the consolidation of spending programs in 
education and health. 
 
Social Security Net 
------------------- 
 
13. (U) Manuel admitted that the social security net was 
under severe strain.  Social welfare services were unable to 
respond adequately to the range of needs and distress that 
confronted them.  In particular, the rapid growth in 
disability and foster care grant applications indicated both 
rising income support needs and deficiencies in 
administrative systems.  He added that the caseloads in 
public hospitals and clinics reflected large numbers of 
victims of crime, road accidents, and disease -- especially 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  Manuel stated that the government 
believed that a single Social Security Agency would be better 
able to target and deliver social welfare grant programs.  A 
national agency would to tighten procedures, develop clear 
qualifications for the grants, and reduce the number of 
welfare grants going to people who did not warrant them. 
 
14. (U) Manuel explained that the administration of social 
security grants would shift to the new national agency once 
it was up and running.  In the interim, the provinces would 
continue to deliver social welfare grants under the 
conditional funding category from the national budget instead 
of equitable share funding as was now the case.  The 
provincial equitable share formula would be adjusted to take 
this shift into account as well as 2001 census data.  He said 
that the restructured equitable share formula would have a 
larger education and health components and no longer 
contingent on social welfare payments taking priority over 
other categories of expenditures.  This change would allow 
for a more stable budgeting process for education and health. 
 In addition, he said that the housing grant would receive a 
substantial boost, and a new housing strategy, focusing more 
on the creation of whole communities, would be phased in over 
the next three years, together with the expanded provision of 
basic household services. 
 
Fiscal Policy 
------------- 
 
15. (U) Manuel said that after a concerted effort to reduce 
the budget deficit between 1996-2001, the government was now 
able to increase public expenditure in real terms through 
borrowing at lower interest rates and managing a higher 
budget deficit.  He said that in 2003/4 the government 
recorded a budget deficit of 2.4%, a bit higher than 
predicted because revenue fell a bit below expectations. 
Revenues should be above expectations in 2004, but greater 
spending on social security grants and wages (government 
workers successfully went on strike recently for an above 
inflation wage increase) should result in a budget deficit of 
3.2% of GDP as compared to the 3.1% expected.  Manuel 
predicted that for 2005, rising corporate profits, continued 
strength in VAT and personal income tax receipts, and further 
broadening of the tax base would result in a moderate 
increase in overall revenue.  He said that the budget deficit 
was expected to widen to 3.5% of GDP next year, bringing net 
borrowing to its highest level relative to GDP since 1997/8. 
Nonetheless, he projected that the deficit in 2007/8 should 
fall to 2.7% and that debt service costs should stabilize at 
about 3.6% of GDP. 
 
16. (U) Manuel added that R50 billion in extra spending would 
be added to the budget estimates.  Of this, about R21 billion 
would finance growth in disability and foster care grants. 
Over the next two years, the rest would go to fund recently 
agreed salary increases for government workers, the land 
restitution program, social welfare grants, and increased 
salary payments from increased government hiring.  In third 
year, additional allocations would be required for 
infrastructure, education and training, and municipal 
services. 
 
17. (U) Manuel warned that public sector borrowing would rise 
as state-owned enterprises borrowed from capital markets to 
fund a large proportion of their investment in 
infrastructure.  New borrowing to finance provincial and 
municipal government spending on infrastructure projects 
would also contribute to the growth in public sector debt. 
The Treasury expected public sector borrowing to reach 4.6% 
of GDP in 2007.  Since the debt would be directed toward 
improving the country\'s economic infrastructure, it would be 
supportive of growth. 
 
18. (U) Manuel said that revenue was R5.1 billion short in 
2003 mainly because of lower profits in resources sector. 
However, he expected revenue to exceed its target for 2004. 
In 2005, the contribution from the resources sector would 
likely remain below target, but should be offset by a 
recovery in VAT and personal income tax receipts. 
 
Tax Policy 
---------- 
 
19. (U) Manuel said that tax relief would not be a prominent 
feature in the 2005 budget.  However, efforts to simplify the 
income tax system and reduce the compliance burden on small 
businesses would continue, as would consideration of easing 
taxes related to health insurance. 
 
20. (U) One of the purposes of Manuel\'s presentation to 
Parliament was to introduce the 2004 Revenue Laws Amendment 
Bill.  He explained that the amendment contained measures to 
encourage foreign investment and improve South Africa\'s 
position as a regional economic center.  These included the 
elimination of the existing tax on interest-bearing 
investments by residents from Swaziland, Namibia, and 
Lesotho, changes to the VAT to support South Africa\'s 
position as a freight distribution hub, and allowing 
companies to distribute shares valued up to R9000 to 
employees over a three-year period without any tax 
consequences under certain conditions.  On the other hand, 
Manuel said that tax benefits from share options for 
high-income earners would be subject to more stringent 
limitations. 
 
21. (U) Manuel also said that the Treasury was undertaking 
reviews of the South African pension fund industry from both 
a regulatory and a tax perspective to derive a regulatory 
framework that had more transparent disclosure rules 
regarding costs and benefits, encouraged the preservation of 
built-up reserves and discourage early withdrawals, and 
improved competition in the industry by providing incentives 
for portability.  Manuel said that a discussion paper on the 
regulatory aspects of pension funds would be released for 
comment later this year.  It would be followed by a tax 
policy discussion paper that dealt with existing shortcomings 
of the pension fund tax regime and proposing changes that 
would align South Africa\'s taxes in this area with 
international best practices.  He explained that the central 
aim was to protect and promote individual savings for 
retirement. 
 
22. (U) With respect to the mining industry, Manuel stated 
that the 2003 Mineral and Petroleum Royalty Bill would have 
to be revised to address outstanding issues such as the 
differentiation of royalty rates, marginal mine treatment, 
the elimination of the double royalty risk, and transitional 
matters.  He said that Treasury would undertake a holistic 
review of the mining sector that would include the low 
effective tax rates that mining companies paid, 
recommendations relating to the gold mining tax formula, the 
appropriateness and international comparability of the 
current mining investment allowances, and the consideration 
of special allowances for exploration and mining 
rehabilitation programs.  Possible tax measures to assist the 
small-scale mining sector would also be considered. 
 
23. (U) Manuel recalled the exchange control amnesty 
announced in 2003.  He reported that the government had 
adjudicated 16,033 of 43,000 applications received -- 
yielding a total of R826 million in tax revenue from newly 
declared income on foreign assets.  The Treasury estimated 
that the value of declared foreign assets would reach about 
R65 billion, yielding a total of R2.2 billion in additional 
annual tax revenue. 
 
Foreign Exchange Liberalization 
------------------------------- 
 
24. (U) Manuel announced that, following discussions with 
SARB Governor Mboweni, the Treasury was proposing abolishing 
exchange control limits on new outward foreign direct 
investment by South African corporations.  He added that 
demonstrated benefit to South Africa would still be a 
criterion for SARB Exchange Control Department approval.  In 
addition, Manuel said that South African corporations would 
now be allowed to retain foreign dividends offshore, and 
transfer any dividends repatriated to South Africa at any 
time for any reason.  To position South Africa as a financial 
center for the rest of Africa, Manuel restated the 
government\'s February announcement that foreign companies, 
governments, and institutions would be able to list on South 
Africa\'s bond and securities exchanges.  Manuel said that in 
November, Aquarius Platinum (an Australian mining company) 
would be the first company to take a secondary listing in 
South Africa.  Manuel stated that all investment restrictions 
in such companies would be eliminated for South Africans. 
Explaining that the sequencing of reforms was critical to 
liberalizing exchange controls, Manuel added that the 
government\'s end goal was to abolish exchange controls 
altogether and put in place a set of prudent financial 
benchmarks that protected the institutional savings of 
working people. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
25. (SBU) Manuel\'s presentation covered all major issues of 
concern with clarity and purpose.  His recurring message was 
that since the economic fundamentals were good, job-creating 
growth could now be the central aim of economic policy.  The 
government\'s growth plan grants a new lease on life to South 
Africa\'s huge parastatals, as their role now will be to raise 
and manage the lion\'s share of public sector investment. 
Manuel is convinced that the impact on the national budget 
will be limited because considerable funding will be sourced 
from the country\'s deepening bond market at relatively low 
domestic interest rates (i.e., when compared to recent 
years).  Moreover, parastatals will be expected to contract 
or enter into joint ventures with private sector firms to 
accomplish their dual objectives of turning around their 
operations and building the nation\'s infrastructure.  The 
result will be greater public sector debt, but Manuel clearly 
believes that the markets can supply it.  He also believes 
that the resulting increase in government expenditures, 
especially on economic infrastructure, will kick start faster 
growth for the rest of the economy.  The onus, of course, 
will be on the parastatals, provinces, and municipalities to 
manage public sector investments well.  This may be the 
Achilles heel of the grand scheme as their record on this has 
been mixed.  Manuel\'s warnings about social welfare grants, 
recognition of the value to an economy that skilled 
immigrants bring, and criticism of BEE ownership requirements 
reflect his concern that strict adherence to achieving 
certain social goals as originally set out can be self 
defeating and perhaps hinder growth.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The sale of a 15.1 percent stake in 
Telkom took a twist when the Public Investment Commissioners 
(PIC) announced November 16 that they had acquired the stake 
for R6.6 billion ($1.1 billion).  PIC CEO Brian Molefe said 
the Commissioners purchased the shares on behalf of an 
empowerment consortium (\"Elephant Consortium\") to allow it 
more time to arrange favorable financing, among other 
things.  An Elephant Consortium shareholder told Econoff 
that the Consortium is in no danger of losing the shares, 
although the PIC may bow to public resentment over the 
involvement of senior ANC and former government officials in 
the deal and call on the Consortium to become more broad- 
based.  After seven years, SBC walks away from South Africa 
with a $446 million profit.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) The Public Investment Commissioners (PIC) announced 
November 16 that they had acquired Thintana\'s remaining 15.1 
percent Telkom stake for R6.6 billion ($1.1 billion) on 
behalf of the \"Elephant Consortium.\"  The PIC, which manages 
over R300 billion of government employee pension funds, was 
one of the original parties financing the purchase of the 
shares for the empowerment consortium.  Thintana was a joint 
venture between U.S. telecommunications firm SBC 
Communications and Telkom Malaysia which at one point 
controlled 30 percent Telkom. 
 
3.  (U) CEO Brian Molefe said that the PIC would warehouse 
the shares for a period of not more than six months while 
the parties negotiated terms for the transfer of the shares 
to the Consortium.  Molefe said the PIC agreed to purchase 
the shares on behalf of the Consortium for the following 
reasons: 
 
- Thintana\'s tight November 15 deadline to conclude the deal 
adversely affected the Consortium\'s ability to arrange 
favorable financing terms. 
 
- Thintana offered the Consortium a 15 percent discount to 
current market value for the shares. 
 
- Telkom\'s prospects to continue to deliver value to its 
shareholders looked promising following the release of its 
interim results showing a R2.8 billion profit (after tax) 
for the six months ended September 30, 2004. 
 
4.  (SBU) An Elephant consortium shareholder told Econoff 
that PIC officials agreed to purchase the shares after 
reviewing the expensive terms and debt structure of the 
original financing.  The arrangement provides the Consortium 
with time to negotiate more favorable financing terms.  He 
said that the Consortium would save R450 million ($75 
million) in bank fees through this arrangement. 
 
5.  (SBU) The shareholder said the Consortium is in no 
danger of losing the shares as it is listed as the buyer of 
record for the transaction and has a written agreement with 
the PIC requiring it to deal exclusively with the Consortium 
for the resale of the shares.  He said that the Consortium 
would negotiate the transfer of the shares from the PIC to 
the Consortium by December 15, 2004.  The Consortium also 
holds all voting rights associated with the 15.1 percent 
stake. 
 
6.  (SBU) He did say, however, that the PIC may bow to 
public resentment over the involvement of senior ANC and 
former government officials in the deal and call on the 
Consortium to become more broad-based despite the inclusion 
of Women Investment Portfolio Holdings (Wiphold), 
representing over 200,000 black women.  The Consortium is 
led by Chief Spokesman and Head of the ANC Presidency Smuts 
Ngonyama, former Department of Communications Director- 
General Andile Ngcaba, and ANC Women\'s League member and 
former Executive Director of Finance at Transnet Gloria 
Serobe. 
 
7.  (U) U.S. telecommunications firm SBC Communications 
invested $756.6 million in 1997 for its 18 percent stake in 
Telkom.  In June, SBC sold half its holdings for $543 
million and received $660 million (R3.96 billion) from the 
sale of its remaining stake this week.  After seven years, 
SBC walks away from South Africa with a $446 million profit.

SUBJECT: REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - A 
SPAGHETTI BOWL 
 
 
1. Summary: The reality in southern Africa is that except 
for SACU, regional integration has predominantly not 
progressed much further than attempts to create free trade 
areas amongst some states and talks about possible customs 
unions.  Within Southern Africa there are a number of 
regional integration agreements and bilateral agreements, 
which resulted in countries belonging to more than one 
regional bloc simultaneously, creating an overlapping 
membership problem.  Given that five out of eleven SADC 
members are already members of SACU, and every other SADC 
member (with the exception of Tanzania) is also a member of 
COMESA, it is difficult to see how SADC and COMESA are going 
to implement a customs union.  A country can only belong to 
one customs union, because within a customs union each 
member must adopt the group\'s common external tariff and 
apply this rate to all third parties.  Legally it would also 
be difficult for the different regional blocs to form their 
own customs union because the current agreements as they 
stand will be in contradiction to one another\'s treaties.  A 
possible solution would be to synchronize the common 
external tariff of each group so that in the end they would 
all form one large trading bloc, but such a long-term 
regional plan does not appear to be in place. 
The European Union aims to use the Economic Partnership 
Agreements (EPAs) to boost regional integration in Southern 
Africa, but it does not seem to be very effective.  The 
answer to the current regional integration problem might lie 
in a political as well as a technical or administrative 
solution.  End Summary. 
 
2. On November 4 and 5, 2004 Embassy\'s economic specialist 
attended a conference jointly organized by the South African 
Institute of International Affairs with the European Centre 
for Development Policy Management, International Lawyers and 
Economist Against Poverty.  Speakers explored the impact of 
the Trade, Development and Co-operation Agreement (TDCA), 
signed by South Africa and the European Union in 1999. 
Others examined the changed circumstance under which the 
agreement is now being implemented and the problems and 
conflicts associated with regional integration in southern 
Africa.  This cable reports on the conference, especially 
regional integration as that was the topic receiving the 
most attention. 
 
3.  The World Bank has estimated that between 40% and 60% of 
world trade occurs within regional trading blocs. According 
to a study by the Harvard Institute for International 
Development, Africa\'s appetite for integration outstrips 
that of any other continent, with many African countries 
belonging to more than one regional entity simultaneously, 
referred to as a \"spaghetti bowl\" by the World Bank.  Within 
southern Africa there are a number of regional integration 
agreements and bilateral agreements taking place within the 
context of the worldwide multi-lateral trading system. These 
include: 
--- South African Customs Union (SACU) 
--- Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
--- Common Market for Eastern and southern Africa (COMESA) 
--- East African Community (EAC) 
--- Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) 
--- Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) 
 
The various regional structures and agreements highlight the 
potential problems of overlapping membership as well as 
overlapping trade policies. Overlapping membership between 
the groupings has the potential to result in conflicting 
programs in trade and trade-related issues, imposing greater 
transaction costs on the business communities, financial 
costs of multiple memberships on governments, and a possible 
waste of resources through duplication of effort. 
 
4. The conference pointed out that the forming of customs 
unions would be the biggest problem arising from overlapping 
membership, causing the current regional integration 
agreements not to be sustainable.  No country can belong to 
two customs unions simultaneously because within a customs 
union each member must adopt the group\'s common external 
tariff and apply this rate to all third parties.  One 
country cannot apply two different external tariffs.  Given 
that five out of eleven SADC members are already members of 
SACU, and every other SADC member (with the exception of 
Tanzania) is also a member of COMESA, it is difficult to see 
how SADC is going to implement a customs union.  SADC 
launched the free trade area in 2000 and its objective is to 
be a customs union by 2010 and a common market by 2015. 
Peter Draper, research fellow at the South African Institute 
of International Affairs, feels that if COMESA goes ahead 
with its planed customs union it could cause regional 
realignments and create confusion over implementation of the 
SADC free trade agreement in a new customs union. 
 
5.  The lawyers at the conference pointed out that it would 
be difficult legally for the above blocs to form their own 
customs union because the current agreements as they stand 
will be in contradiction of one another\'s treaties.  For 
example, Article XXXI paragraph 3 of the new SACU agreement 
prohibits members from entering into new agreements with 
third parties without the consent of the remaining member 
states.  Moreover, according to Article XXVII paragraph 2 of 
the SADC protocol on trade, member states cannot enter into 
a preferential trade agreement with third countries that may 
\"impede or frustrate the objectives of the protocol\" and 
that any advantage, concession, privilege or power granted 
to a third country under such agreements is extended to 
other member states.  Lastly, Article 56 of the COMESA 
states that member states are free to enter into bilateral 
or multilateral agreements provided that such agreements are 
not in conflict with the COMESA Free Trade Agreement and 
Customs Union. 
 
6.  The European Union is using its new Economic Partnership 
Agreements (EPAs) as a driver for regional integration in 
southern Africa. The EPAs negotiations flow from the Cotonou 
Agreement that was signed in 2000 between 
the EU and its 77 developing country partners in Africa, the 
Caribbean and the Pacific - or the so-called ACP states. 
According to Talitha Bertelsmann-Scott from the South 
African Institute of International Affairs, the European 
Union is negotiating the EPAs as regional agreements and the 
negotiations could have a defining impact on regional 
integration and the shaping of regional organizations in 
southern Africa.  Southern African states, however, have 
decided not to negotiate as existing regional groupings, but 
have formed two new groups that will be negotiating with the 
EU. COMESA extended an invitation to all the states in 
eastern and southern Africa to form the ESA (Eastern and 
Southern Africa) trade-negotiating unit, and launched talks 
with the EU on February 7, 2004.  A number of SADC states, 
now called the SADC-minus group, which includes the BLNS, 
Tanzania, Angola and Mozambique, however, decided not to 
join the ESA group.  This only complicates and frustrates 
the current regional integration situation, which casts a 
shadow over the effectiveness of the EPAs in promoting 
regional integration. 
 
7.  The problems caused by the overlapping multiple 
agreements could be reduced if there were overall plans to 
synchronize the common external tariff of each group so that 
in the end they would all form one large trading bloc. 
According to Richard Hess, managing director of Imani 
Development, such a long-term regional plan does not appear 
to be in place, however, except for the goal of establishing 
the African Economic Community by 2025. He felt that it was 
time for the political leaders to make some hard choices, 
based on an economic as well as political rationale to make 
progress with regional integration.  Mark Pearson, regional 
integration adviser at the COMESA secretariat, felt that the 
way forward and a resolution of the \"Spaghetti Bowl\" lies as 
much in a political resolution as it does in a technical or 
administrative solution.

REFTEL: PRETORIA 3943 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for Internet 
distribution.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  A telecommunications consultant to Nexus 
Connexion, the empowerment shareholder in South Africa\'s 
second national/network operator (SNO), said that Nexus 
would remove its legal challenges to the SNO by the end of 
2004 and have a license to operate by February 2005.  Nexus 
is withdrawing its litigation for the following reasons: 
First, an agreement with the Minister of Communications 
provides Nexus and its lawyers with three weeks\' notice 
prior to her implementing the SNO license; Second, Nexus is 
satisfied that bids by qualified investors for the SNO\'s 
remaining unallocated equity will prevent Two Consortium and 
CommuniTel from controlling the SNO; and Third, an SNO 
shareholder agreement prevents Two Consortium or CommuniTel 
from putting in place lucrative contracts for themselves. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) A telecommunications consultant to Nexus 
Connexion, the empowerment shareholder in South Africa\'s 
second national/network operator (SNO), told Econoff that 
Nexus has withdrawn one court interdict standing in the way 
of licensing the SNO and would soon set aside the other. 
This would pave the way for a shareholding agreement between 
the SNO partners, which is required before the Independent 
Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) can issue a 
license.  The consultant said Nexus anticipates finalizing a 
shareholding agreement before the end of the year and 
expects to have a license before February 2005 when the 
telecommunications industry will be liberalized. 
 
3.  (SBU) This contrasts sharply with Nexus\' response 
following a September pronouncement by the Minister of 
Communications approving a license for the SNO.  At that 
time, Nexus said it would not drop its first interdict 
calling for a judicial review of the Minister\'s decision to 
grant 25 percent of the SNO to CommuniTel and Two 
Consortium, despite a recommendation from the regulator to 
the contrary.  Nexus had also filed a second interdict to 
prevent the Minister from implementing her decision to 
license the SNO. 
 
----------------- 
NEXUS INTERDICT 2 
----------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) In late October 2004, Minister of Communications 
Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri agreed to provide Nexus and its 
lawyers with three weeks\' notice, should she decide to go 
ahead with implementing the SNO license.  According to the 
Nexus consultant, Nexus subsequently withdrew its interdict 
on this issue, secure in the knowledge that three weeks 
would be sufficient to refile the interdict should they 
wish. 
 
----------------- 
NEXUS INTERDICT 1 
----------------- 
 
5.  (U) Nexus\' first legal challenge was more complex.  In 
December 2003, the Minister awarded a 26 percent share in 
the SNO to Two Consortium and CommuniTel, just months after 
ICASA had determined that neither was qualified for the 
equity stake.  Shortly thereafter, Nexus filed an interdict 
calling for a judicial review of the Minister\'s decision. 
 
6.  (SBU) In an effort to break the SNO deadlock, Casaburri 
announced on August 27, 2004, that she was reducing the 
combined holdings of CommuniTel and Two Consortium from 26 
percent to 25 percent in the SNO\'s 51 percent equity stake 
(SepCo).  The remaining SepCo shares would be reserved for a 
yet-to-be-named financial investor.  The consultant said 
that Nexus was unsatisfied with this arrangement because it 
left CommuniTel and Two Consortium in a position to control 
SepCo, and ultimately the SNO, until an investor was found. 
 
7.  (SBU) The consultant said that Nexus\' concerns were 
resolved when the Minister revealed on October 20 that Old 
Mutual Asset Managers and TATA Africa Holding (Pty) Ltd. 
had submitted Expressions of Interest for the 26 percent 
unallocated equity of the SNO.  The imminent allocation of 
the remaining SepCo shares means that neither Two Consortium 
nor CommuniTel would be able to control the SNO, which has 
been Nexus\' concern all along. 
 
8.  (SBU) The consultant said that while Nexus favors TATA 
Africa Holding, it would not object to either of the equity 
bidders.  He said Nexus was satisfied that both bidders 
bring the desired experience and capital to the SNO.  Among 
other things, the bidders were required to have net assets 
of at least R5 billion, experience in telecommunications, 
the ability to arrange funding of more than R5 billion, and 
a willingness to hold its shares for at least five years. 
 
9.  (SBU) Finally, the consultant said that Nexus\' concerns 
were further alleviated in an agreement with the other SNO 
shareholders to limit shareholder seats on the Board of 
Directors to 49 percent, prohibit any shareholder from 
providing a management contract to the SNO, and require 
unanimous approval among the SNO shareholders on all supply 
contracts.  These last two provisions effectively put in 
place obstacles to any future attempt by shareholders to 
obtain lucrative contracts for themselves.

2004 ISSUE 
 
 
1.  Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
newsletter are: 
 
 -  Foreign Exchange Reserves Target Published Next Year; 
 -  Street Traders Important to Farming; 
 -  Survey Reveals Informal Sector Importance; 
 -  New Forum Started to Advise SMMEs; 
 -  Local Car Manufacturers Create 1,519 Jobs; 
 -  SA is World\'s Sixth-largest Wine Producer; 
 -  Holiday Season Expected Best in 20 Years; 
 -  100,000 Mzansi Account Holders; and 
 -  6.5 Percent of GDP Spent on Red Tape. 
End Summary. 
 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES TARGET PUBLISHED NEXT YEAR 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  A standing committee will be established to determine 
an appropriate level for South Africa\'s foreign exchange 
reserves and would publish its recommendations in 2005, 
according to Lesetja Kganyago, the Treasury Director- 
General.  To develop the reserves target, a formula that 
considered current account deficit forecasts as well as 
short-and long-term government debt would be used.  The 
committee, comprised of National Treasury and Reserve Bank 
officials, would also be responsible for coordinating the 
government\'s debt management strategy with that of 
reserves management.  South Africa has gradually grown its 
gross reserves to $13 billion, prompting Moody\'s to 
consider upgrading the country\'s investment grade next 
month.  Compared with emerging market peers such as Turkey 
and the Czech Republic, South Africa\'s reserves are 
minimal, as both peer countries have gross reserves in 
excess of $20 billion.  The International Monetary Fund 
recommends that a country must hold reserves that can 
cover three months of imports.  From June through August 
2004, South African imports totaled $12.4 billion.

STREET TRADERS IMPORTANT TO FARMING 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  The latest issue of Farmer\'s Weekly emphasizes the 
importance of informal traders to the agricultural sector. 
Informal traders buy 43 percent of potatoes and 23 percent 
of all market produce.  While no formal research had been 
completed on the market share of vendors in fresh produce 
markets, Agricultural Business Chamber Chief Executive 
Tobias Doyer estimates a 30 percent share.   The informal 
trader has become such a strong market player in the fresh 
produce distribution network that business training is now 
provided by most markets, including Tshwane\'s (greater 
Pretoria) Fresh Produce Market, the second largest after 
Johannesburg\'s market.  Source:  Business Day, November

SURVEY REVEALS INFORMAL SECTOR IMPORTANCE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  The University of South Africa and the University of 
South Carolina collaborated on a survey of the informal 
retail sector in South Africa and found that these 
informal businesses were more sustainable than previously 
thought.  The survey covered 800 businesses, ranging from 
spaza shops (small retail stores in former township areas) 
to shebeens (bars) and hawkers (street vendors) that did 
not pay value added tax.  The study found that these 
enterprises had an average monthly turnover (a measure of 
sales) of more than R5,300 ($880 using 6 rands per 
dollar).  More than half of the owners of South Africa\'s 
informal businesses said they would not look for a job in 
the formal sector if they had a choice.  Spaza owners 
ranked soft-drink sales more important than bread in 
contribution to sales and the informal sector generated 
between 40 and 50 percent of Coke\'s R3 billion ($500 
million) sales in South Africa.  Approximately 35 percent 
of survey respondents were unemployed before starting 
their businesses and 70 percent used savings, 10 percent 
used money from separation packages and 2 percent used 
bank financing to start their businesses.  Most of the 
money earned went to replenishing stock merchandise with 
very little going into capital outlay.  Approximately 40 
percent of respondents had no refrigeration and only 8.2 
percent received formal business training.  Source: 
Business Day, November 16. 
 
NEW FORUM STARTED TO ADVISE SMMES 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMME) Forum 
will advise small start-up businesses, aid training and 
lobby government on SMME\'s behalf.  Originally established 
to encourage small business input into several empowerment 
charters, its efforts are now expanded to provide more 
services to entrepreneurs and to large companies looking 
to procure services from SMMEs as well.  The forum would 
help small enterprises by collecting tender information, 
offering legal advice, providing online training and 
helping to collect unpaid debts.  The forum plans to 
establish a database of small, reliable suppliers by 
economic sector and has a policy that member companies 
cannot remain members forever, as they are expected to 
grow into larger enterprises.  Source:  Business Day, 
November 16. 
 
LOCAL CAR MANUFACTURERS CREATE 1,519 JOBS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  According to the latest quarterly review of business 
conditions released by the National Association of 
Automobile Manufacturers of SA (NAAMSA), a total of 1,519 
jobs were created in the new vehicle manufacturing 
industry in the first nine months of 2004, an improvement 
of 4.9 percent on the corresponding period last year. 
These latest employment trends follow a report on the 
automotive industry released last week by the Trade and 
Industry Department, stating that total automotive 
industry employment, including the assembly, component and 
tire industries and motor trade, increased by 2 percent to 
303,700 in 2003.  Recent developments in the South African 
car market include Volkswagen\'s contract to produce the 
new Golf A5 for the local and export markets and Toyota\'s 
Durban plant being named as one of five facilities 
worldwide that will produce a new-generation light 
commercial vehicle.   In addition, Nissan SA was awarded a 
R1 billion ($167 million) contract to export locally 
assembled Hardbody pick-ups to Europe, Singapore, 
Australia and New Zealand, starting in October 2005.  The 
influence of the strong rand and highly competitive global 
market conditions contributed to lower vehicle exports 
during the first nine months of 2004.  From January to 
September, 2004 exports declined 13.3 percent (11,288 
vehicles) compared to the first nine months of 2003.

SA IS WORLD\'S SIXTH-LARGEST WINE MANUFACTURER 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  South Africa is the world\'s sixth-largest wine maker, 
at 2.8 percent of global production and with gross output 
of wine-related firms estimated to be worth R14.6 billion 
($2.4 billion) a year.  In 2001, there were 4,390 primary 
wine producers and 388 cellars, an increase of 15 percent 
since 1999.  About 746 million liters of wine were made 
annually from 314 million vines.  On average, 71 percent 
of production found its way into good wine (for drinking), 
an increase from 65 percent in 1999.  In the late 1990s, 
there was considerable foreign investment in Western Cape 
vineyards, large-scale replanting and quality 
improvements, which led to a boom in exports.  Exports 
grew to 210 million liters in 2002, from 50.7 million 
liters in 1994, and accounted for 33.5 percent of good 
wine production, up from 14.6 percent in 1995, with the 
total export value for wines in 2001 estimated at R4.5 
billion ($750 million).  About 50 percent of bottled wine 
exports were to the United Kingdom, 21 percent to the 
Netherlands, 9 percent to Scandinavia and 6.5 percent to 
Germany.  Markets identified as growth opportunities 
include the United States, India, China and Japan. 
Approximately 43 percent of tourists to South Africa visit 
the vineyards with the wine industry indirectly 
contributing over R3.5 billion a year to tourism. 
Viticulture contributed 30 percent to the Western Cape\'s 
horticultural income and about 3 percent of its gross 
regional product.  Source:  Business Report, November 16. 
 
HOLIDAY SEASON SALES EXPECTED BEST IN 20 YEARS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  South Africa\'s holiday season retail sales in the 
fourth quarter, which covers the Christian Christmas 
season, as well as the Hindu Diwali festival, the Muslim 
Eid festival and the Jewish Hanukkah festival, should be 
the best in at least 20 years, according to the Ernest & 
Young Festive Season Retail Trends survey covering 500 
retailers by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the 
University of Stellenbosch.  Retail sales are expected to 
grow by 17.4 percent (y/y) during the holiday season, the 
highest increase since 1987, compared to 10.2 percent 
(y/y) growth during 2003.   Increases in both prices and 
volume of goods sold should fuel the expected growth in 
retail sales.  Volumes of goods sold should increase by 
11.7 percent and prices should increase by 5.1 percent. 
During last year\'s holiday season, units of goods sold 
increased by 8 percent while prices increased by 2.1 
percent.  Income for both high and low-income individuals 
should increase.  The BER survey defines high-income 
individuals as those earning R4500 ($750) per month or 
higher.  Investment income, tax rates, and interest rates 
impact high-income earners.  Low-income earners benefit 
more from higher wages, social grants and low food costs. 
While wage earnings as a proportion of personal disposable 
income has declined over time, from 81 percent in 1990 to 
72 percent in 2003, the importance of social grants and 
investment income has increased.  Social grants accounted 
for 7 percent of disposable income in 2003, compared to 5 
percent in 1990.  In 2003, investment income\'s share of 
disposable income was 35 percent compared to 27 percent in 
1990.  The study also estimates that black adults comprise 
1.8 million of the 4.5 million high-income earners in 
South Africa this year.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, November 
16; Business Day and Business Report, November 17. 
 
9.  Comment.  Previously, Statistics South Africa reported 
real retail sales 9.1 percent for the first half of 2004, 
and increases in monthly retail sales of over 10 percent 
for July and August.  Real wholesale trade sales for the 
first half of 2004 increased by 7.2 percent.  Given 
expectations of continued strong retail sales growth, 2004 
GDP growth should be much higher than 2003\'s 1.9 percent. 
End comment. 
 
100,000 MZANSI ACCOUNT HOLDERS 
------------------------------ 
 
10.  Since the October 25 Mzansi account launch, more than 
100,000 people have opened the new bank account aimed at 
low-income customers.  Although these accounts are aimed 
at lower income individuals, estimates suggest that nearly 
R30 million ($5 million) have been deposited.  Eight banks 
are offering these accounts to the estimated 13-16 million 
eligible South Africans without accounts, with ABSA and 
Standard Bank leading by opening 30,000 accounts each, 
Nedbank and PostBank opening 10,000 and 15,000, 
respectively.  Spokesmen from both Standard Bank and 
Nedbank could not estimate how many of the new Mzansi 
accounts were switched from existing accounts and stated 
that additional study is needed.  Source:  Business Day, 
November 17. 
 
6.5 PERCENT OF GDP SPENT ON RED TAPE 
------------------------------------ 
 
11.  SBP, a non-profit independent private sector research 
company (originally Small Business Project), developed a 
survey of 1,800 firms that examines the cost of regulatory 
compliance to South African firms.   The survey covered 
most economic sectors including firms in manufacturing, 
mining, construction, trade, agriculture, and services 
sectors.  Among the key findings include:  (1) total cost 
to business of complying with regulations is R79 billion 
($1.3 billion) in 2004, 6.5 percent of GDP; (2) 34 percent 
of businesses believe that regulations inhibit business 
growth; (3) 20 percent of employers say that labor law and 
government regulations constrain increases in employment; 
(4) businesses report that the most troublesome and time 
consuming regulations are VAT, other aspects of tax 
administration, labor laws, SETA/RSC taxes (SETA is fee 
paid by business for labor training and RSC is a regional 
services council tax), in that order; (5) 76 percent of 
respondents say that compliance costs have increased in 
the past two years; (6) large firms pay the most in 
absolute terms, but regulatory compliance costs weigh more 
heavily on smaller enterprises--compliance costs represent 
8.3 percent of turnover (a measure of sales for restocking 
purposes) for firms with turnover of less than 1 million 
rand a year, and 0.2 percent of turnover for corporations 
that turnover 1 billion rand or more a year; and (6) the 
impact of red tape is greatest in transport, services and 
tourism and least in retailing and wholesaling.  The SBP 
survey looks at two kinds of regulatory costs faced by the 
private sector - efficiency costs and compliance costs. 
Efficiency costs occur when regulations distort the 
market, such as when labor market legislation affects 
employment and output, or when a business decides to limit 
sales in order to stay below the VAT threshold. 
Compliance costs are purely the costs of red tape, 
including management time, interacting with authorities, 
paperwork and professional services and consultants\' fees. 
They do not include tax payments or levies.  Source:  I-

1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) 
Director of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Jeffrey Ndumo 
met with representatives from U.S. firms at the American 
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa (AmCham).  Ndumo said 
that DTI would release nine Codes of Good Practice in two 
phases over the next several months.  He said that a new DTI 
scorecard containing targets for each Charter component 
would be included in the Codes.  Ndumo announced the 
formation of a DTI \"BEE Secretariat,\" which will engage with 
all sector BEE councils.  He also said that DTI would 
announce the National BEE Advisory Council this year.  Ndumo 
criticized state-owned companies (SOEs) who attendees 
claimed are requiring firms to comply with multiple industry 
targets.  He said that this is a \"misunderstanding and 
misapplication of BEE\" and that he would address this issue 
with SOEs and government agencies in an upcoming roadshow. 
Ndumo thanked AmCham and its members for their engagement 
with DTI on BEE policy.  He said that no other business 
chamber had presented DTI with the thoughtful and critical 
analysis of BEE the way that AmCham had.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) On November 10, 2004, Department of Trade and 
Industry (DTI) Director of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
Jeffrey Ndumo met with representatives from U.S. firms at 
the American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa (AmCham). 
Ndumo spoke about DTI\'s Codes of Good Practice and responded 
to questions and concerns that U.S. firms have about BEE. 
 
3.  (U) Ndumo explained that DTI would release nine Codes of 
Good Practice in two phases over the next several months. 
Phase one includes three Codes, which will be published 
before the end of this year.  Phase two Codes are scheduled 
for release in February 2005.  Each Code will attempt to 
explain all the issues pertaining to a particular BEE 
element.  The Codes will consist of one or more 
\"statements.\"  A \"statement\" includes a related set of 
principles guiding the implementation of one BEE issue. 
Ndumo pointed out that these Codes are not to be confused 
with industry Charters that, once approved and gazetted by 
DTI, will also be referred to as Codes of Good Practice.  A 
list of DTI\'s Codes and statements to-date follows: 
 
PHASE ONE: 
Code 000: Framework 
     Statement 000: Conceptual Framework 
     Statement 020: Charter Guidelines 
     Statement 030: BEE Council 
     Statement 070: Broad-based BEE Implementation 
     Statement 090: Glossary 
Code 100: Ownership 
     Statement 100: Ownership 
     Statement 140: Government Ownership 
Code 200: Management 
     Statement 200: Management 
 
PHASE TWO: 
Code 300: Employment Equity 
Code 400: Skills Development 
Code 500: Affirmative Action 
Code 600: Enterprise Development 
Code 700: Corporate Social Investment (CSI) 
Code 800: BEE Practice Notes 
 
4.  (U) As part of Code 000, Ndumo said that DTI would 
release a new scorecard containing targets for each 
component.  The new scorecard will also allocate points for 
the inclusion of women.  Preferential procurement will be 
based on BEE contribution.  Bonus points will be given for 
over-performance.  The scorecard will include more options 
for indicators and sub-minimum scores will be required to 
achieve BEE-compliant status.  When asked about potential 
differences between existing Charter targets and DTI\'s new 
scorecard targets, Ndumo responded that DTI had looked at 
market trends emerging in the industry scorecards.  Ndumo 
said that industry would find DTI\'s targets \"reasonable.\" 
 
5.  (U) Ndumo said that DTI is forming a \"BEE Secretariat,\" 
which will be a DTI organ.  The Secretariat will absorb 
existing DTI personnel dedicated to BEE and will engage with 
all sector councils.  The Director of the Secretariat will 
sit on the National BEE Advisory Council.  Government 
decisions pertaining to BEE, however, will be made by the 
Advisory Council, which Ndumo said would be announced this 
year. 
 
6.  (U) Several people in attendance commented to Ndumo that 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) across various sectors are 
requiring firms to comply with the SOE\'s respective industry 
targets.  Ndumo said that this is a \"misunderstanding and 
misapplication of BEE\" and that he would address this issue 
with SOEs and government agencies in an upcoming roadshow. 
 
7.  (SBU) Ndumo thanked AmCham and its members for their 
engagement with DTI on BEE policy.  He said that no other 
business chamber had presented DTI with the thoughtful and 
critical analysis of BEE the way that AmCham had.  Ndumo 
welcomed future opportunities to engage with AmCham and 
American firms in South Africa.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Econ Minister Counselor and Econoff 
gauged interest in a potential Open Skies agreement between 
South Africa and the United States in separate meetings with 
Commissioner Seboseso Machobane from the South Africa Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA); South African Airways Executive 
Manager for International Affairs Oosha Chirkoot and Manager 
for International Affairs Darren Hay; and Department of 
Transport Director for Aviation Regulation Godfrey Selepe. 
The parties said that Africa\'s immediate priority is to 
liberalize air transport within Africa.  Selepe suggested 
that the United States and South Africa look at a Cargo Open 
Skies agreement and incrementally liberalize the passenger 
side by removing restrictions such as the existing 
limitation on domestic codeshare points.  Selepe is 
tentatively planning a trip to the United States and Canada 
in July 2005 with officials from the Department of 
Environment and Tourism, SATourism, and interested airlines. 
He said he would welcome formal or informal engagement with 
a U.S. team prior to his trip, but said that a ministerial 
meeting between Radebe and Mineta before any such engagement 
might be most productive.  Selepe also listed a number of 
stakeholders with an interest in a U.S.-South Africa Open 
Skies agreement.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------- 
SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Econ M-C and Econoff met with South African 
Airways (SAA) Executive Manager for International Affiars 
Oosha Chirkoot and Manager for International Affairs Darren 
Hay on November 17.  Chirkoot said that from SAA\'s 
perspective, South Africa\'s first priority is to liberalize 
air transport within Africa.  She said that SAA would be 
interested in opening route schedules and increasing the 
number of allowable codeshare points between the United 
States and South Africa, however, SAA was not ready for full 
Open Skies.  Chirkoot said that if South Africa were to 
enter into an Open Skies agreement with the United States, 
it would be compelled to consider Open Skies agreements with 
the U.K. and others.  Chirkoot also cited concern for what 
an Open Skies agreement might do to South Africa\'s secondary 
carriers. 
 
----------------------- 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) On November 22, Econ M-C and Econoff were 
scheduled to meet with Department of Transport Director 
General Wrenelle Stander, but she was replaced at the last 
minute by Director of Aviation Regulations Godfrey Selepe. 
Selepe, who attended the Montreal meeting between Secretary 
Mineta and Minister Radebe, said that it\'s \"not a matter of 
if, but how we go about liberalization.\"  He said that South 
Africa is pursuing a \"managed liberalization\" approach to 
opening its skies.  Selepe expressed disappointment that the 
U.S. negotiating team in 2000 had little flexibility to 
negotiate anything other than an Open Skies agreement.  He 
suggested that the United States and South Africa look at a 
Cargo Open Skies agreement and incrementally liberalize the 
passenger side by removing restrictions such as the existing 
limitation on domestic codeshare points.  Selepe expressed 
skepticism about arguments for expanded air services to 
support growth in tourism.  He argued that airline passenger 
figures did not support the high growth figures cited by 
tourism officials.  He acknowledged, however, that a more 
liberal agreement would provide airlines with greater 
operational control in the context of an expanding or 
contracting economy. 
 
4.  (SBU) Selepe is tentatively planning a trip to the 
United States and Canada in July with officials from the 
Department of Environment and Tourism, SATourism, and 
interested airlines.  He said he would welcome formal or 
informal engagement with a U.S. team prior to his trip, but 
said that a ministerial meeting between Radebe and Mineta 
before any such engagement might be most productive.  (NOTE: 
Selepe referred to his negotiating team as \"young and 
inexperienced.\") 
 
5.  (SBU) According to Selepe, the following groups would 
have a stake in an Open Skies agreement between South Africa 
and the United States:  Department of Environment and 
Tourism, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Trade 
& Industry, CAA, Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), 
SATourism, SAA and other interested airlines, and possibly 
the Department of Public Enterprises. 
 
------------------------ 
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU) In September, Minister Counselor for Economic 
Affairs and Econoff met with Commissioner Seboseso Machobane 
of South Africa\'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).  Machobane 
said that bilateral agreements are mostly dealt with at the 
Department of Transport.  He suggested that it might be more 
productive to approach higher rather than lower level 
officials to discuss an Open Skies agreement.  Machobane, 
educated in the United States, appeared receptive to the 
concept of an Open Skies agreement with the United States, 
but noted that South Africa\'s immediate priority is to 
liberalize aviation regulations with its African neighbors 
as expressed in the Yamoussoukro Decision.

1. (U) Summary.  In his October Medium Term Budget Policy 
address to Parliament, Finance Minister Manuel took important 
steps in the gradual relaxation of foreign exchange controls 
that began in 1995.  He removed foreign exchange controls on 
South African corporations and allowed foreign company 
listings on the South African bond and securities exchanges. 
The government hopes that these changes will help South 
Africa become a larger player in global and regional capital 
markets, and attract more foreign investment to the country. 
South African Reserve Bank (SARB) approval is still required 
on all outward foreign investments.  Foreign investment 
restrictions still remain on individual investors, 
institutional investors, and corporate portfolio investment. 
End Summary. 
 
Corporate Foreign Exchange Controls Relaxed 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In his October Medium Term Budget Policy address to 
Parliament, Finance Minister Manuel took another important 
step in the gradual relaxation of foreign exchange controls 
that began in 1995.  He removed foreign exchange controls on 
South African corporations.  The move makes it easier for 
South African firms to invest directly abroad, but does not 
apply to portfolio investment.  Previously, South African 
companies were restricted to R1 billion ($120 million) in 
outward investment and R2 billion ($320 million) when 
investing elsewhere in Africa (plus 20% of the excess cost of 
a particular project).  South Africa has been a leading 
foreign investor on the African continent despite these 
restrictions.  South African corporations may also retain 
foreign dividends offshore and, as from October 26, 2004, may 
transfer repatriated dividends offshore again for any purpose 
at any time. 
 
3. (U) The foreign exchange controls that remain restrict 
individual investors to holding no more than R750,000 
($120,000) in assets offshore and institutional investors, 
such as pension funds, long-term insurers, and investment 
managers, to holding no more than 15% of their total 
portfolio assets offshore.  Mutual fund managers may invest 
up to 20% of their portfolio assets offshore. 
 
Central Bank Still Has Final Say 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) All South African companies must still apply to the 
SARB Exchange Control Department before investing offshore. 
The primary decision criterion is whether the investment 
benefits South Africa, but the size and timing of an 
investment may also be considered.  The SARB reserves the 
right to stagger capital outflows on large foreign 
investments to minimize the disruption on the local foreign 
exchange market. 
 
Foreign Secondary Stock Listings 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Manuel also recently announced that foreign companies 
would now be allowed to establish a secondary listing on 
South African securities bond and securities exchanges. 
South African individuals will be allowed to invest in these 
foreign corporations without restriction.  Institutional 
investors may also invest an additional 5% of their total 
portfolio assets in foreign corporations listed in South 
Africa.  (Note: This 5% is in addition to the imposed limits 
on offshore investment of 15% and 20% of total portfolio 
investment mentioned previously.  End Note.)  The government 
hopes that the move will entice more foreign companies to 
locate in South Africa. 
 
6. (U) Aquarius Platinum, an Australian mining company, will 
likely be the first foreign company to take a secondary 
listing on the JSE Securities Exchange (JSE) by the end of 
November.  Celtel, a pan-African cell phone company, is 
second in line and may take a secondary listing in the first 
half of 2005.  Anooraq, a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) 
owned mining company with a local presence, is another 
company interested in a JSE listing.  (Note: Anooraq is the 
first BEE company with a primary listing in North America; it 
lists on both the Toronto (TSX) and American Stock (AMEX) 
exchanges. End Note.) 
 
7. (U) The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) still must 
approve all secondary listings in South Africa.  In line with 
New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) objectives, 
which are championed by the South African government, its 
stated policy is to favor those foreign companies located in 
or undertaking most of their activities in Africa. 
 
Realistic Hopes 
--------------- 
 
8. (U) The government hopes that the relaxation of exchange 
controls and the introduction of foreign listings will 
encourage foreign investment in South Africa, improve the 
country\'s draw as a regional financial center, and facilitate 
global expansion by South African companies -- especially 
into the rest of Africa in support of NEPAD.  The government 
also believes that these changes will help grow the country\'s 
capital markets, improve market liquidity, and foster greater 
corporate competitiveness. 
 
9. (U) Government officials did not expect a flood of capital 
outflows as a result of this latest foreign exchange control 
announcement, since the decision was part of the gradual 
relaxation on foreign exchange and not made in response to 
demand.  Moreover, outward foreign investment has leveled 
recently, as South African companies appear to be more 
interested in expanding along with their own economy, which 
is being driven by strong consumer demand and historically 
low interest rates.  Officials expect large South African 
corporations and mining companies will be the first ones to 
take advantage of the nearly free reign to invest abroad. 
 
10. (U) Most economists agree that the rand will face only 
mild weakness as a result of this policy change, since the 
currency continues to be strong due to interest rate 
differentials with the markets of major currencies.  Indeed, 
the rand has appreciated 25% against the U.S. dollar since 
January 2003 and forex markets greeted the Minister\'s 
announcement with no discernible movement.  Only one labor 
and one NGO group expressed concern about creating 
\"footloose\" South African capital at a time when greater 
investment at home was needed to fuel higher growth and 
employment.  To them, the relaxation of foreign exchange 
controls seemed to fly in the face of government\'s goal of a 
gross fixed capital formation ratio of 25% of GDP by 2014. 
Currently, gross fixed capital formation is about 16% of GDP. 
 The opposition Democratic Alliance had no such worries as it 
publicly stated its support for Minister\'s decision.  It 
viewed the government\'s move as vote of confidence in the 
South African economy, and a signal of the end of foreign 
exchange controls born in the market distortions of the 
apartheid era. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (SBU) These announcements demonstrate South Africa\'s 
continued commitment to economic liberalization and to the 
eventual removal of all foreign exchange controls.  On the 
other hand, the SARB still must approve every foreign 
investment made by a South African company.  We will keep an 
eye on how transparent and/or sticky the approval process is, 
but believe it unlikely that the SARB, which is an 
independent institution owned by member banks, will create 
many difficulties.  The government wants to attract greater 
foreign investment, become a more prominent regional and 
global player in the capital markets, increase domestic 
market capitalization and liquidity, and foster greater 
domestic competition.  While the relaxation of foreign 
exchange controls is a step in the right direction, it is 
just one of the policy changes needed to accomplish these 
objectives.

2004 National HIV/AIDS Survey Launched 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Human Sciences Research 
Council are launching the 2004 national HIV/AIDS survey, the 
second national survey undertaken.  Results of the study will 
determine the prevalence of HIV/AIDS based on national data, 
rather than extrapolation of data from public antenatal 
clinics.  The survey will also concentrate on social and 
economic factors related to HIV infection.  A total of 15 000 
households have been selected throughout the country to 
participate in the survey, cutting across all races, economic 
standing and geographical location.  Participation was not 
compulsory, but co-operation would enable the study group to 
calculate informed information critical in fighting the 
pandemic.  The information gathered would assist in developing 
effective strategies and campaigns to combat HIV and Aids. All 
persons in the study will remain anonymous and personal 
information will not be released.  Source:  Pretoria News,

SA Survey Highlights Problem of Gender Violence 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  South Africa has the highest rate of rape and spousal abuse 
in the world, with one in four women beaten by their partners, 
according to a gender survey by the University of Cape Town\'s 
Unilever Institute of Strategic Marketing.  The survey found 
that at least one woman is raped every minute somewhere in 
South Africa and about one third of South African women will be 
raped in their lifetime.  The survey involved 3,500 people in a 
weighted sample representative of major city and rural areas. 
Gender was likely to replace race as the big issue facing South 
African marketers in the future.  Other survey results 
included:  (1) 61 percent believe men and women are equal; (2) 
66 percent say men and women should earn the same amount; (3) 
41 percent believe it is acceptable that society favors men; 
(4) 32 percent believe a woman\'s place is in the home; (5) 73 
percent believe men should be the head of the household; and 
(6) 64 percent believe men should be the primary breadwinner.

Anti-AIDS Seaweed Vaginal Gel Tested in SA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  The final phase three testing of Carraguard, a seaweed- 
based vaginal microbicide that could help prevent the spread of 
AIDS, is currently underway in three South African locations. 
The study is particularly important in societies where women 
have difficulty persuading partners to use condoms.  The final 
phase three testing of the Carraguard gel is currently underway 
at Soshanguve in Pretoria, Isipingo in KwaZulu-Natal and 
Gugulethu in Cape Town.  The final phase three testing involves 
a larger sample of 6,200 women and began in March 2004 and is 
expected to end in three years.  If proven to be efficacious, 
plans will be made to mass-produce and market the product. 
Carrageenan - the active ingredient in Carraguard - is found in 
seaweed and generally regarded as a safe product, and is 
already found in ice cream and lotions.  The Carraguard gel had 
a negative charge, while the human immunodeficiency virus had a 
positive charge.  Carraguard may work by binding to the 
positively charged regions of the virus and by inhibiting cell- 
to-cell transmission of the virus, by acting as a barrier 
between infected and non-infected cells.  Carraguard would be 
feasible and cost effective to mass-produce because the seaweed 
was readily available, a benefit for developing countries 
having high AIDS prevalence rates.  Research goals look for a 
33 percent difference in seroconversions between the placebo 
and the Carraguard samples. However, we only expect the entire 
rate of seroconversion - from HIV negative to HIV positive - 
across the trial to be about 3.5 percent.  Among the major 
challenges for the trial was to retain all the women 
participants and the possibility of prevalence rates 
increasing, which would mean that less women would be eligible 
and therefore requiring more screening.  According to Dr Lydia 
Altini, the principal investigator at the Gugulethu site, 
researchers had enrolled about 800 out of a targeted 2,100 
women since March.  Some of the criteria needed for women to 
participate included being over the age of 16, sexually active, 
HIV negative, living in the area for the past two years and not 
planning to fall pregnant.  Women were expected to visit the 
clinic about 10 times for the duration of the trial.  They were 
also provided with a compensation fee for traveling and 
incidentals.  Vice-president of the Population Council\'s Center 
for Biomedical Research, Dr Elof Johansson, said Carraguard was 
the first generation of microbicides under development.  The 
first generation microbicide does not kill the virus, but only 
binds the virus.  The South African site costs are in the 
region of R40 million to R60 million ($6.7 to $10 million using 
6 rand per dollar) and funded by the United States Agency for 
International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation.  Source:  SAPA November 18. 
 
Diabetes Common Among Youngest South Africans 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  More South African youth are diagnosed with Diabetes type 
1, the disease that occurs when the pancreas stops production 
of blood sugar-controlling insulin.  One in 500 children in 
South Africa have type 1 diabetes.  \"Twenty years ago our 
youngest patients were between seven and 10 years old, now 
toddlers and babies of barely five months come in,\" said 
Professor Francois Bonnici of the diabetes education centre at 
the Red Cross Children\'s Hospital.  Bonnici states that he 
knows of no clear explanation why younger patients are 
diagnosed with diabetes now.   There is a genetic tendency of 
susceptibility of diabetes and treatment involves three to four 
insulin injections per day.  Short-term effects of the disease 
include are extreme thirst, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, 
dizziness, and coma.  Source:  Cape Times, November 17. 
 
Antibiotic May Help Children with AIDS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.  The positive results of a study of children in Zambia, 
carried out by the British Medical Research Council (MRC) and 
funded by the Department for International Development, suggest 
that deaths among children infected with HIV in Africa could be 
almost halved if the antibiotic co-trimoxazole were widely 
used.  While co-trimoxazole will not prevent children 
eventually developing AIDS, it could give extra years of 
healthy life before they need the powerful and toxic anti- 
retroviral drugs that suppress HIV in the blood.  The results 
of the trial, published in this week\'s Lancet medical journal, 
have persuaded the World Health Organization and UNICEF to 
change their policies and recommend the use of co-trimoxazole 
in all children with HIV.  In the study, 541 children aged 
between one and 14 were given the antibiotic or a placebo. The 
trial was stopped early when it became clear that substantially 
fewer children on the antibiotic were dying. After 19 months, 
74 (28 percent) children on co-trimoxazole had died, compared 
with 112 (42 percent) of those on the placebo.  All those who 
took part are now taking co-trimoxazole.  No severe side 
effects were reported.  Source:  Guardian Newspapers, November

SA Government Devising Plan for Health Care Staffing Shortages 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
7.  During a two-day workshop of government, health care 
workers and university representatives, Percy Mahlathi, the 
Health Department\'s Deputy Director-general, announced plans 
for a comprehensive human resource strategy for the public 
health sector, hoping to begin implementation by March 2005. 
The proposed plan will help respond to weaknesses caused to the 
system by HIV/AIDS, infrastructure challenges and the exodus of 
professionals from public service.  Delegates at the workshop 
have been divided into several working groups to deliberate on 
human resource challenges in health, and make contributions 
towards the department\'s envisaged master plan. About 14 health 
workers\' organizations are represented, including the 
Democratic Nursing Organization of South Africa (DENOSA).

One Million Orphans in South Africa by 2006 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  The Actuarial Society of South Africa\'s (ASSA) 2000 
demographic model predicts that almost one million children 
will be orphaned nationally due to the AIDS epidemic by the 
year 2006.  By 2006 the model projects that 857,000 will be 
orphaned nationally - in KwaZulu-Natal more than 252,000, in 
Gauteng 133,204, Eastern Cape 99,227, Free State 47,062, 
Limpopo 75,487, Mpumalanga 72,995, Northern Cape 7,331, North 
West Province 57,956 and Western Cape 19,648.  By the year 
2015, more than 1,854,462 will be orphaned because of the Aids 
epidemic.  The case study definition of an orphan is any child 
under 15 whose mother has died of HIV and Aids.  According to 
child care workers poverty, depression and HIV and Aids are 
some of the major factors that contribute to mothers abandoning 
their babies.  Source:  Pretoria News, November 20. 
 
KZN Progress in HIV/AIDS 
------------------------ 
 
9.  In March, KwaZulu-Natal did not have a government program 
for getting HIV-positive people on to anti-retroviral 
treatment.  In the past seven months, the province has made 
good progress.  As of November 5, the department had 3,247 
adults and 167 children (aged from three to 15 years) on anti- 
retroviral treatment, while 25,036 people had been screened for 
the treatment program.  The World Health Organization released 
a report this year which said that 5.3 million people were 
living with HIV and Aids in South Africa. The report estimated 
that 370,000 people would die from Aids-related illnesses in 
South Africa this year.   In KwaZulu-Natal, the province 
reputed to have the highest prevalence of HIV and Aids in the 
country, anti-retroviral treatment involves more than just 
taking medication.  Patient education and building health 
infrastructure are crucial elements to the comprehensive 
treatment plan.  Patient literacy involves education about the 
disease, its implications, clinical and dietary assessments and 
anti-retrovirals.  Hospitals have to be equipped with all the 
necessary resources before getting accreditation to administer 
anti-retroviral treatment. In the province\'s 11 health 
districts, at least two hospitals in each district have been 
accredited for the anti-retroviral treatment plan.  Districts 
like Uthungulu (near Richards Bay) has six hospitals and 
eThekwini (Durban metropolitan area) have eight.  Source:  IOL, 
November 21. 
 
Metropolitan Tshwane\'s Fight Against HIV/AIDS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  The Tshwane (greater Pretoria) Metropolitan Council has 
adopted a HIV/AIDS treatment strategy encompassing anti- 
retroviral treatment, treatment of sexually transmitted 
infections, behavior change, and voluntary testing and 
counseling.  Based on research commissioned by the Council, an 
estimated 6 percent of the municipality\'s employees are HIV- 
positive and one percent have AIDS-related diseases.  The risk 
profile of the metropolitan\'s employees is lower than that of 
the general South African population.  Despite the lower HIV 
prevalence rates, progression to AID-related sicknesses is over 
half that of the general population and there is a higher 
proportion of employees who are at ages where progression to 
AIDS is likely (30 - 50 years) than the case in the general 
population.  The research states that by beginning the broad 
strategy for treatment immediately, the council could reduce 
the general mortality of its employees by more than half and 
the AIDS-related deaths from six out of 10 to one out of 10 
within 12 months.  Source:  Pretoria News, November 18. 
 
Update on Gauteng\'s HIV Treatment 
--------------------------------- 
 
10.  On November 19, 2003, the South African government 
announced its HIV/AIDS comprehensive treatment plan with the 
plans to provide anti-retroviral treatment to 53,000 by March 
2005.  Several of the provinces only began providing treatment 
until August and September 2004, however Gauteng began its 
program in April 2004.  Both the Western Cape and Gauteng 
provinces have more developed health infrastructure and 
political leadership in providing HIV/AIDS treatment and these 
provinces are crucial so that South Africa can meet its stated 
goal of 53,000 on treatment.  Gauteng health care facilities 
are experiencing the same sort of capacity problems that other 
provinces endure.  Large inner-city research hospitals have 
been able to start programs relatively efficiently; however, 
most clinics located in former township areas and opened during 
the second wave of accreditation during July 2004 have similar 
staffing and equipment shortages experienced by the health care 
facilities located in poorer provinces.   Gauteng\'s Department 
of Health has been able to recruit 70 percent of the 214 
additional staff needed to implement the comprehensive 
treatment plan although it admits that filling staff 
requirements for former township areas has been especially 
difficult.  Source:  Sunday Independent, November 21.

 End Summary. 
 
 OCTOBER CONSUMER PRICES SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN MARKET 
 EXPECTATIONS 
 --------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 2.  In October, targeted inflation (CPIX, consumer prices 
 excluding mortgage costs) increased by 4.2 percent (y/y), 
 slightly higher than the 4.1 percent growth Reuter\'s 
 market consensus forecast.  October\'s overall consumer 
 prices increased by 2.4 percent (y/y) compared to 
 September\'s growth of 1.3 percent.  Higher food, fuel and 
 power and transport prices were why October\'s CPIX 
 inflation was higher than September\'s 3.7 percent.  Rising 
 meat, fruit and vegetable prices pushed up food costs in 
 October and food prices are expected to rise as a result 
 of adverse weather conditions (drought has lasted over two 
 years) and rising global food prices.  Source:  Standard 
 Bank, CPI Alert, November 24; Business Day, November 25. 
 
 PRODUCER PRICES SHOW MILD GAIN 
 ------------------------------ 
 
 3.  October producer prices increased 1.9 percent (y/y), 
 slightly higher than market expectations of 1.8 percent 
 and an increase of 0.5 percentage points over September\'s 
 producer price inflation.  Domestic producer prices 
 increased 2.7 percent while imported producer prices 
 showed a 0.3 percent decline.  In October, the sharp 
 increase in oil prices contributed 0.6 percent to the 
 month/month increase in producer price inflation, with oil 
 price contribution strong in plastics, chemicals and 
 petroleum products.  Increases in oil prices in the 
 domestic economy should be lower in November as the rand 
 remains strong and the global oil prices have retreated 
 from recent highs.  Source:  Investec, PPI Update; 
 Standard Bank, PPI Alert, November 25; Business Day, 
 November 26. 
 
 BER EXPECTS SA GROWTH TO EXCEED 4 PERCENT IN 2005 
 --------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 4.  The University of Stellenbosch\'s Bureau for Economic 
 Research (BER) expects South African economic growth to 
 exceed four percent in 2005, helped by strong consumer and 
 investment demand.  Although growth should be higher than 
 this year\'s expected 2.9 percent, exports should show slow 
 growth next year because of the rand\'s strength.  BER 
 expects that growth in consumer spending would slow next 
 year to around 3.7 percent down from 4.1 percent in 2004, 
 while investment was set to increase by 9 percent next 
 year compared to 8.4 percent this year.  BER forecasts the 
 rand to weaken to around R7.50-R8 against the dollar in 
 2005, given South Africa\'s widening current account 
 deficit.  Economist Mike Schussler forecasts that growth 
 will rise above 4 percent over the next two years, with 
 record growth in economic activity likely to continue 
 until 2010, when South Africa hosts the Soccer World Cup.

 LIMPOPO STUDY AIMS TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION 
 --------------------------------------------- - 
 
 5.   Half of Africa\'s population will face water stress or 
 scarcity by 2025.  For the next five years, researchers 
 will study the way farmers along the Limpopo basin through 
 Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and SA collect and 
 manage water. The $5 million World Bank-funded research 
 project will examine how the river basin could be a more 
 reliable producer of food for the 14 million people 
 surrounding the river.  According to Adriaan Louw of the 
 South African Agricultural Research Council, which is 
 coordinating the research project, about 10 percent of the 
 population was expected to abandon their homes and migrate 
 south in the next five years.  The poverty of people 
 living in the Limpopo basin makes them susceptible to 
 failures in the water supply.  In dry years, some 
 stretches of the river only see water flowing for 40 days 
 and pollution and competition for usable water can prevent 
 efficient use.  The Limpopo is one of nine river basins 
 the researchers will study.  As well as gathering 
 information about the problems, they will introduce 
 different farming methods to ensure better management of 
 soil and water.  Small farmers, who rely on seasonal rains 
 making them vulnerable to the frequent floods and 
 droughts, do much of the farming in the Limpopo basin.

 LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATOR UP 9.3 PERCENT 
 ----------------------------------------- 
 
 6.  South Africa\'s September 2004 leading economic 
 indicator rose by 9.3 percent (y/y), according to the 
 South African Reserve Bank (SARB), compared to August\'s 
 y/y change of 10.7 percent.  In September, four leading 
 indicator components showed slower growth and three showed 
 higher.  Interest rate spreads between the money market 
 and capital market instruments, commodity prices, and the 
 leading indicator of major developed countries contributed 
 to slower September growth while job advertisements, 
 average manufacturing hours worked, equity prices and real 
 M1 money supply growth showed higher growth.  The 
 coincident indicator is up 20.2 percent y/y in August 
 compared to 18.7 percent y/y in July. This increase 
 reflects the strong growth in domestic activity and is at 
 its highest y/y growth since 1995.  In March 2004, the 
 SARB revised its leading and coincident business cycle 
 indicators. The SARB first published business cycle 
 indicators in 1983.  These indicators were revised in 1994 
 and have now been revised again.  The leading indicator 
 has been reduced to 13 components from 21, while the 
 coincident indicator has been cut to 5 from 7.  The new 
 indicators are less volatile than the old indicator, while 
 the lead for the leading indicators has been extended to 
 15 months from the previous 11.5 months at the peak and 
 five months at the trough.  Source:  I-Net Bridge November

 ERWIN CLARIFIES LISTING OF NEW STATE IPOS 
 ----------------------------------------- 
 
 7.  Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin launched this 
 week the IPO Reference Manual, a guide for upcoming share 
 sales of state assets.  The Public Enterprises Department 
 said it viewed IPOs as one option available in the 
 restructuring of state-owned enterprises.  Erwin said 
 parastatals would need to meet conditions for listing. \"An 
 IPO would be considered when the corporate structure and 
 balance sheet of the state-owned enterprise is strong, and 
 where we see the opportunity of lowering the cost of 
 capital through an IPO; however, no IPOs are envisaged 
 this financial year,\" he said.  He expects concessions, 
 joint ventures and public-private partnership arrangements 
 to continue in the next year.  Although government would 
 retain strategic control of power utility Eskom, national 
 carrier South African Airways and Transnet, parts of these 
 parastatals could be partially listed as their balance 
 sheets and corporate structures become stronger.  Airports 
 Company SA (ACSA), which owns and operates 10 of South 
 Africa\'s major airports, will be sold next year.  ACSA was 
 the first parastatal to be partially privatized when 
 Italian operator Aeroporti di Roma paid R918 million for 
 its 20 percent share in 1998.  The transport department 
 has scheduled a shareholders\' meeting for December to 
 discuss the sale of shares in the company and details 
 should be announced by the end of the year. Aeroporti di 
 Roma is expected to exercise its option to buy another 10 
 percent in the company.   Government owns 76 percent of 
 ACSA, while five empowerment consortia collectively own 4 
 percent. Source:  Business Report, Business Day and I-Net

 INTEREST RATE REDUCTION MORE LIKELY IN EARLY 2005 
 --------------------------------------------- ---- 
 8.  The next South African Reserve Bank\'s Monetary Policy 
 Committee (MPC) meeting, scheduled for December 8 and 9, 
 promises to surprise either financial markets or 
 economists, reflecting divided views.  The MPC could cut 
 the repurchase rate by 50 basis points, as reflected by 
 forward rates, which are now pricing in close to a 100 
 percent probability of a 50 basis point rate cut. 
 Alternatively, the bank may leave rates unchanged.  The 
 Reuters consensus forecast indicates that most economists 
 believe this will be the outcome.  The major factor in 
 support of a rate cut is the low inflation rate, which has 
 been supported by the strong rand.  CPIX, the bank\'s 
 official inflation measure, reached a low of 3.7 percent 
 in October, and although it is expected to increase from 
 this level, there is consensus that it will remain within 
 the target range of 3 percent to 6 percent in the next two 
 years.  The currency broke the key R6 to the dollar level 
 this month, supported by improving South African 
 macroeconomic variables and dollar weakness.  Reuters 
 forecasts indicate that most economists believe the rand 
 will weaken steadily in the near to medium term.  If 
 currency strength persists, there is a risk the bank might 
 undershoot the inflation target. However, the bank has 
 explicitly said it would not intervene, so it seems a rate 
 cut may be the only option available to weaken the 
 currency.  Factors not supportive of another rate cut 
 include continuing strong consumer demand and high oil 
 prices.  Over the past few months there has been a retail 
 and vehicle sales point to robust consumer demand. 
 Private sector credit extension is at high levels, meaning 
 consumers are borrowing in order to spend, and this tends 
 to be inflationary.  Since consumer demand is normally 
 quite high during December, it implies that an interest 
 rate cut at this meeting would add fuel to consumer 
 spending and credit demand.  For these reasons, analysts 
 believe that the MPC will wait until early 2005 to change 
 interest rates, even with a strong currency.  Source:

 SIGNS OF STRONG DOMESTIC INVESTMENT 
 ----------------------------------- 
 
 9.  Domestic fixed investment shows signs of increasing at 
 record levels over the next several years.  The announced 
 private sector investment plans include:  R 5 billion 
 ($830 million using 6 rands per dollar) over the next five 
 years by SAB (part of SABMiller), SASOL (an oil company) 
 with capital spending at R 15 billion ($2.5 billion), PPC 
 (a cement company) spending R1 billion ($170 million); and 
 investment by vehicle manufacturers reaching a five-year 
 high of R3.5 billion ($580 million) in 2004.  Public 
 enterprise investment spending should also increase 
 briskly.  Eskom (the electricity parastatal) and Transnet 
 (transportation public enterprise) are expected to spend 
 R165 billion ($27.5 billion) improving South Africa\'s 
 infrastructure.  Source:  Business Day, November 23. 
 
 OVER HALF OF SOUTH AFRICANS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY 
 --------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 10.  Fifty-seven percent of South Africans are living 
 below the poverty line, according to a recent study by the 
 Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC).  Based on data 
 gathered in the 2001 census, the report said the provinces 
 with the highest proportion of poor people were Limpopo 
 (77 percent) and Eastern Cape (72 percent). Western Cape 
 and Gauteng had the fewest proportion of poor with 32 
 percent and 42 percent, respectively. 
 The poverty gap, which is the amount it would take to 
 bring the income of the poor up to the poverty line, 
 increased from R56 billion in 1996 to R81 billion 
 currently.  KwaZulu-Natal, at R18 billion, has the largest 
 poverty gap, followed by Eastern Cape and Gauteng. 
 Gauteng\'s poverty gap grew faster than other provinces 
 because the area\'s population has grown faster than its 
 economy.  The poorest municipality was Ntabankulu in the 
 Eastern Cape where 85 percent of people lived below the 
 poverty line.  Municipalities with the lowest poverty 
 rates included Stellenbosch (23 percent) and Saldanha Bay 
 (25 percent) in Western Cape.  Of the large cities, Cape 
 Town had the fewest poor people at 30 percent, followed by 
 Pretoria (35 percent) and Johannesburg (38 percent).

 11. Comment.  The HSRC study\'s poverty line is based on 
 the Bureau of Market Research\'s minimum living level in 
 2001.  The poverty line varies according to household 
 size; the larger the household, the larger the income 
 required to keep it out of poverty.  The poverty income by 
 household size in 2001 used in this study was: 
 Household Size, Rands per Month (6 rands per $) 
 1    587 ($98) 
 2    773 ($129)

1.  Following the recent passage of a World Conservation 
Union resolution recommending a moratorium on the further 
release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), South 
African anti-GMO activist groups Biowatch and African Centre 
for Biosafety blasted the Government of South Africa for its 
failure to support the resolution, claiming the government 
was kowtowing to multinational biotechnology corporations. 
 
2. Local media quoted Director General of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism Dr. Crispian Olver\'s explanation of the 
government\'s position: \"The government could not support the 
call because it was not properly phrased or thought through. 
We want the IUCN to focus on building up a scientific base. 
Making rash calls like this undermines the IUCN\'s 
credibility.\" 
 
3. Comment. The SAG speaks from experience.  It has a 
national biotech strategy and science-based biosafety regime 
in place, and has approved several varieties of genetically 
engineered commodities for commercial planting in South 
Africa.  The government also supports significant programs 
in biotech research, development and commercialization. 
Success of a locally-developed product would go a long way 
towards quelling the anti-GMO lobby\'s protests, which center 
on the dominance of multinational corporations in plant 
biotechnology.  FRAZER

SUBJECT: GENDER VIOLENCE CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS CONFLICTING 
STATUS OF WOMEN IN SOUTH AFRICA 
 
 
1. SUMMARY.  The South African Government\'s \"16 Days of 
Activism\" gender violence awareness campaign brings into 
focus the conflicting status of women in South Africa.  South 
Africa leads the region in the number of women at the 
parliamentary, cabinet, and deputy minister levels.  NGOs, 
however, describe South Africa as a \"war zone for women,\" 
singling out poverty, gender-based violence, and HIV/AIDS as 
the biggest problems facing South African women.  The chasm 
between government\'s good intentions and limited legislative 
success and the reality facing South African women is real. 
This is a society in transition; while much progress has been 
made, there is a long way to go.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
LOTS AT TOP 
----------- 
 
2. Following President Mbeki\'s April 28 appointment of 12 (of 
28) women ministers and 10 (of 21) women deputy ministers 
(three more women ministers and two more women deputy 
ministers than in the previous cabinet), South Africa leads 
the South African Development Community (SADC) countries in 
the representation of women at the parliamentary, cabinet, 
and deputy minister levels.  South Africa has not only 
surpassed the minimum 30 percent target of the 1997 SADC 
Declaration on Gender and Development -- with 33.4 percent of 
its MPs, 42.9 percent of its ministers, and 47.6 percent of 
its deputy ministers being women -- but it has also surpassed 
the African National Congress (ANC) target of 33 percent. 
 
3. There are lower percentages of women at the provincial and 
municipal levels of government.  The third annual conference 
of the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) in 
2004 released a report saying the representation of women at 
the local level of government was 29.06 percent, slightly up 
from 28 percent in 2000.  The report also stated that 
political parties had few women candidates on their party 
lists and deployed even fewer to decision-making positions. 
Due to the perception of many delegates at the conference 
that the 29 percent figure was too low, Cape Town Mayor 
Nomainda Mfeketo said to loud applause, \"The women in this 
conference are saying they want 50 percent.  They want 50 
percent because they realize that they are mothers of this 
nation.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
RURAL WOMEN THE WORST OFF BY FAR 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. Outside of government, Sheilah Meintjes, Professor at the 
University of the Witwatersrand and a former Commissioner at 
the Commission on Gender Equality, says two of the biggest 
problems facing South African women are poverty and 
gender-based violence.  The majority of the 40 percent of 
unemployed South Africans are women, and even those women who 
are able to work often experience economic discrimination and 
sometimes sexual harassment.  In July, the Department of 
Labor and the Commission for Employment Equity launched a 
report showing that South African women have never held more 
than 21 percent of top management positions and that they 
earned an average of 76 percent of their male counterparts\' 
wages. 
 
5. Meintjes calls gender-based violence \"endemic\" to South 
African society, and she notes that it crosses class and 
race.  She says it is embedded in the idea of \"men as 
superior citizens\" and forms a continuum from sexual 
harassment to rape to murder.  There are disputes over rape 
statistics, but the University of Cape Town\'s Unilever 
Institute of Strategic Marketing\'s 2004 gender survey 
indicated that South Africa may have the highest incidence of 
rape and wife battering in the world.  The same survey 
indicated that a women is raped every minute in South Africa, 
and that one-third of South African women are raped at some 
time during their lifetime. 
 
6. The situation for many South African women, especially 
those poor to begin with, is worsening due to HIV/AIDS and 
the \"collapse of NGOs,\" according to Susan Bazilli, an 
advisor at the Center for Development and Population 
Activities (CEDPA), making \"rural women the worst off they\'ve 
been in ten years.\"  The \"feminization\" of HIV/AIDS has led 
to 20 South African women being infected for every 10 South 
African men, where there are more people living with HIV/AIDS 
in South Africa than anywhere in the world.  HIV/AIDS is not 
only killing women, it is also placing a larger burden on 
them as they struggle to look after children whose parents 
have died.  Bazilli also blames the worsening condition of 
rural women on the collapse of many NGOs due to donors\' shift 
of resources from NGOs to government following the 
establishment of a democratic regime in 1994. 
 
--------------------- 
GOVERNMENT\'S APPROACH 
--------------------- 
 
7. The three main bodies in the Government for dealing with 
gender issues are the constitutionally-mandated Commission on 
Gender Equality; the Office on the Status of Women and Gender 
Equality in the Presidency; and the Parliamentary Joint 
Monitoring Committee on the Quality of Life and Status of 
Women.  The first two, which are often viewed as rivals to 
each other, spend their time -- according to Meintjes -- 
\"tinkering and tailoring.\"  They tinker to put policies in 
place, to get a critical mass of women in prominent 
positions; and they tailor organizations to make them gender 
sensitive through training.  But the Commission is swamped 
with more complaints than it can handle, and the Office on 
the Status of Women is mostly just an advisory body with only 
a small budget. 
 
8. The Parliamentary Joint Committee has seen through several 
important pieces of legislation on customary law, domestic 
violence, and child support.  Connie September, a Member of 
Parliament, thinks the high level of female representation at 
the national level has made a difference to South African 
women through making the law more gender friendly.  For 
example, South Africa is one of the few African countries 
with a law specifically targeting domestic violence.  In 
addition, the Justice for Women Campaign has successfully 
defended women for murdering their abusive partners.  On the 
other hand, Mmatshilo Motsei, a consultant for the Women\'s 
Legal Rights Initiative, said South Africa needs to move from 
the \"victories\" at the legislative and judicial levels to the 
\"realities\" in the rural areas. 
 
--------------------------- 
FROM VICTORIES TO REALITIES 
--------------------------- 
 
9. The \"realities\" speak for themselves: 80 percent of 
female-headed households have no wage earners; 40 percent of 
Black African households are headed by women; 60 percent of 
female-headed households are poor; 70 percent of South 
African children under six live below the poverty line; and 
the majority of these children are living in households with 
only one parent, where in most cases the parent is a woman. 
But how, then, to move to \"victories\"?  Some say changes need 
to be made in government and the private sector\'s 
institutional cultures, gender composition, and approaches 
towards human rights.  Motsei stresses that change can only 
be accomplished through the revitalization of NGOs, and still 
others say there needs to be more publicizing of the laws and 
more cooperation from men. 
 
10.  Most analysts agree that on a deeper level societal 
attitudes must change.  This includes the way parents raise 
their sons to be masculine protectors, who then become 
frustrated by the realities of not being able to work or 
otherwise support themselves or their families.  This also 
includes a broader acceptance of the higher levels of 
education that women have achieved over the past ten years. 
In this sense, the continuing gender gap and all the problems 
that go along with it remain not an indication of a 
schizophrenic society but of a society in transition.  The 16 
Days of Activism campaign, which President Mbeki says should 
really be 365 days, is part of this slow transition.

REF: A. PRETORIA 4042 
 
     B. PRETORIA 4689 
     C. PRETORIA 5218 
 
Classified By: AMB. JENDAYI E. FRAZER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.   (SBU) We welcome USTR Ambassador Robert Zoellick\'s 
upcoming visit to southern Africa.  The U.S.-SACU FTA 
negotiations are at a crossroads.  Ambassador Zoellick\'s 
initiative to meet with SACU trade ministers on December 10 
in Walvis Bay is critical to any hope for re-establishing 
momentum for a successful FTA.  Over the last four months, we 
have achieved buy-in from South Africa\'s senior political 
leadership to move forward.   This was evident in President 
Bush\'s phone call with President Mbeki, in Ambassador 
Frazer\'s meeting with new Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi 
Mpahlwa in October (Reftel B), and just last week at the 
Amcham Thanksgiving dinner, where former Trade Minister and 
current Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin stated SACU\'s 
interest in making the AGOA benefits permanent through an FTA 
(reftel C).  It is important for ultimate success that a good 
relationship is established between Amb. Zoellick and South 
Africa\'s new Trade Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa. 
 
2.  (C) South Africa remains the biggest stumbling block to 
progress.  It is a corollary that South Africa is also the 
key to getting an FTA done.  South Africa sees the FTA as 
symbolic.  They do not believe they or the United States 
really need it.  But prestige is important for South Africa 
and, given the extension of AGOA, at this point South Africa 
wants an FTA for the prestige it bestows on the country as a 
global player rather than for the economic benefits.  The 
United States similarly has important geopolitical reasons 
for advancing an FTA with South Africa in addition to the 
trade advantages. 
 
3.  (C) When Ambassador Frazer met new Minister of Trade and 
Industry Mandisi Mpahlwa in late October (reftel B), he 
admitted there were capacity issues as well as chemistry 
problems between the negotiators.  Still, he acknowledged the 
need to raise the FTA politically in order to give fresh 
political direction on areas where we agree in the FTA.  He 
regretted that he had not been able to meet with Ambassador 
Zoellick before.  Mpahlwa feels he has been turned down twice 
in requests to meet with USTR Zoellick, in Brazil during the 
June UNCTAD XI meetings and in Mauritius during the July ACP 
meetings. 
 
4. (C) Walvis Bay presents an opportunity to grant Mpahlwa\'s 
meeting request and thereby improve the bilateral trade 
relationship and prospects for ultimate success negotiating 
the U.S.-SACU FTA.  We strongly recommend that Ambassador 
Zoellick meet with Minister Mpahlwa, perhaps as a pull aside 
in addition to the SACU ministers meeting, or during a flight 
layover in Johannesburg or Cape Town.  This would allow both 
Ministers to develop the relationship that will be needed to 
achieve a successful FTA.  It is important that the USTR have 
the Trade Minister\'s ear, particularly to provide needed 
balance to the broken record \"can\'t do\" soundtrack of his 
chief negotiator.  Two key objectives in a meeting with 
Minister Mpahlwa would be to:  (1) get South Africa to commit 
to a more ambitious FTA and (2) get clarity on the exceptions 
desired in market access most important to South Africa. 
 
5.  (C) In the past the stumbling block presented by South 
Africa\'s lead negotiator, Xavier Carim, at the rhetorical 
level is getting an FTA that in his view is \"balanced\" and 
accommodates South Africa\'s demands for asymmetry and special 
and differential treatment.  He wants an agreement that falls 
far short of the \"template\" FTAs that the United States has 
reached with other trading partners.  Achieving this goal 
will burnish South Africa\'s credentials as a G20 leader of 
developing countries.  It will also further the strategy to 
liberalize as little as possible beyond what the WTO 
requires.  The existing FTA with the EU covers only 90% of 
trade.  South Africa\'s vision to negotiate trade agreements 
with other developing countries, as well as with EFTA, is 
marked by modesty rather than boldness. 
 
6.  (C) On a practical level, this overall low level of 
ambition translates into demands for partial liberalization 
and exclusions regarding market access in goods and services 
in a U.S.-SACU FTA.  South Africa has given no indication of 
the depth or breadth of these exceptions.  On agriculture, 
however, the negotiator specifically wants to deny benefits 
to any U.S. goods that benefit from subsidies.  Besides 
securing access to the U.S. market, he would also like 
special treatment from U.S. trade remedies, such as 
countervailing duties and anti-dumping.  South Africa sees 
the United States as the demandeur on all the other issues: 
investment, dispute settlement, labor, environment, IPR, 
procurement, e-commerce.  South Africa believes an FTA 
covering these subjects would require SACU to make 
substantial changes in its laws and policies while providing 
marginal, if any, additional access to the U.S. market and 
little, if any, requirements on the United States to change 
its laws and policies.  Lastly, South Africa has argued that 
because SACU does not have any common policies on these 
issues it is premature to negotiate on them.

 GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT REVISED UPWARDS 
 -------------------------------------- 
 
 2.  On November 30, Stats SA released revised statistics 
 for gross domestic product revealing mainly higher growth 
 during the 2000-2004 time period.  The annual real GDP 
 growth rates from 2000 to 2003 are now 4.2, 2.7, 3.6 and 
 2.8 percent respectively compared to previous growth 
 estimates of 3.5, 2.7, 3.6 and 1.9 percent.  The average 
 annual real GDP growth rate for the period 2000-2003 rose 
 to 3 percent, compared to a pre-revision growth of 2.7 
 percent; while for the period 1997-2003, the average 
 annual real growth rates increased from 2.4 percent to 2.7 
 percent.  The nominal GDP estimate for 2000 is 3.8 percent 
 higher than the previous estimate.  The largest revision 
 (3.9 percent) occurred in 2002 and the smallest (0.5 
 percent) was in 1998.  Growth in 2004 has been steadily 
 increasing, indicating that the impact of interest rate 
 cuts outweighed the relatively weak global demand growth 
 and the strong rand.  Growth in the third quarter 2004 was 
 5.6 percent, compared to the first and second quarter\'s 
 growth of 3.8 and 4.5 percent respectively.  In the third 
 quarter, growth of agriculture (relative size 2.6 percent 
 of GDP), construction (relative size 2.5 percent), 
 transport and communication (relative size 9.9 percent), 
 manufacturing (relative size 16.4 percent), and finance 
 and real estate (relative size 18.5 percent) sectors 
 showed 14.7, 10.3, 6.7, 6.3, and 5.5 percent growth 
 respectively, contributing the most to real GDP growth. 
 Economic growth in the first nine months of 2004 was 3.4 
 percent higher than the corresponding period in 2003, 
 indicating that 2004 growth will be higher than the pre- 
 revision market expectations of 3 percent.  The revised 
 higher growth rates should contribute to higher business 
 confidence and possible additional credit upgrades; 
 however, many analysts question whether the South African 
 Reserve Bank will lower interest rates at the December 
 meeting in the face of increased demand.  Source: 
 Business Day, Business Report, December 1; Standard Bank, 
 GDP Alert, Investec GDP Update, Stats SA Release P0441, 
 November 30. 
 
 3.  Comment.  For the seventh time, Stats SA has revised 
 the national income accounts by updating data sources, 
 incorporating new methodologies, including new areas of 
 economic activities, and changing the base period to adopt 
 weights that more clearly reflect current economic 
 conditions.  Typically, rebasing occurs every five years, 
 and Stats SA has shifted the base year to 2000 from 1995. 
 Particularly important to this revision is data from new 
 sources, such as the development of a new business 
 register that is based on the South African Revenue 
 Service\'s VAT database.  The change in contribution to 
 gross value added between the 1995 and 2000 benchmark 
 years show that finance, real estate and business services 
 increased from 18.1 percent to 20.1 percent, while general 
 government\'s contribution decreased from 17.3 percent to 
 14.7 percent.  The revisions also result in GDP per capita 
 increasing from R17,700 ($3,200 using 5.53 rands per 
 dollar, the average in 1998) in 1998 to R27,100 ($3,585 
 using 7.56 rands per dollar, the average in 2003) in 2003. 
 End comment. 
 
 OCTOBER TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS 
 ---------------------------- 
 
 4.  The trade deficit widened in October to R5.8 billion 
 compared to September\'s deficit of R0.3 billion.  The 
 value of exports declined by 14.7 percent (m/m) to R23.8 
 billion in October from September\'s value of R 27.9 
 billion.  The value of imports increased in October by 5 
 percent (m/m) to R29.6 billion from R28.2 billion in 
 September.  Mineral product exports increased, although 
 declines in exports of wood and paper products, precious 
 and semi-precious metals, and vehicles, aircraft and 
 vessels explained the October export decline.  Cumulative 
 trade figures for the first 10 months of 2004 shows a 
 deficit of R13.6 billion compared to last year\'s surplus 
 of R15.5 billion.  The trade deficit is expected to 
 continue.  Both the continued strength of the rand and 
 slower global demand due to higher global oil prices 
 negatively impact the South African export market. 
 Domestic demand remains at high levels and import growth 
 is expected to remain robust as foreign manufactured goods 
 become more affordable.  The current account will probably 
 remain in deficit, although if oil prices recede and 
 global demand accelerates, the deficit could narrow.

 OCTOBER MONEY SUPPLY INCREASED 15.7 PERCENT 
 ------------------------------------------- 
 
 5.   The October money supply increased 15.7 percent, up 
 from 14.7 percent September growth, as increased credit 
 demand funded purchases of houses and motor vehicles. 
 Private sector credit demand, excluding the volatile 
 investments and bills category, increased 15.1 percent 
 last month, up from September\'s rise of 13.2 percent. 
 Figures released by the South African Reserve Bank showed 
 that mortgage credit increased by more than R8.5 billion 
 last month to R391.7 billion, with mortgage advances 
 rising 21.2 percent from a year ago.  Leasing finance grew 
 22.9 percent (y/y) in October, while installment sales 
 credit increased 17.2 percent.  Given these increases in 
 credit demand and the recent rand strength, the SARB will 
 have to decide next week whether to reduce interest rates.

 BUSINESS CONFIDENCE INCREASES TO 23-YEAR PEAK 
 --------------------------------------------- 
 
 6.  Business confidence jumped to a 23-year high this 
 quarter, fuelled by low interest rates that have boosted 
 economic growth and consumer spending.  The latest 
 confidence index measured by Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) and 
 the University of Stellenbosch\'s Bureau for Economic 
 Research increased nine index points to 88 this quarter, 
 only three points shy of the record high reached in the 
 third quarter of 1980.  The survey shows a fairly broad- 
 based improvement in confidence across all sectors, with 
 sentiment among building contractors, retailers and motor 
 vehicle dealers particularly strong.  In these sectors, 
 more than 90 percent of respondents were positive about 
 business conditions.  Although confidence among 
 manufacturers increased, sentiment in this sector lagged 
 behind the rest of the economy.  Despite the lower 
 confidence levels in manufacturing compared to other 
 sectors, the survey showed that two-thirds of 
 manufacturers were positive about prevailing business 
 conditions.  The strong level of business confidence in 
 the economy was partly the result of increasing domestic 
 demand, but also due to a stronger economy.  The survey 
 also showed an increase in net employment across all 
 sectors this quarter.  Source:  Business Day, November 30. 
 
 GAUTENG\'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FACES CHALLENG OF UNEVEN 
 ECONOMIC EXPANSION 
 --------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 7.  Gauteng\'s growth and development draft strategy traces 
 the economic impacts of the province\'s shift towards the 
 service industries combined with having the highest 
 employment growth of all the provinces.  Gauteng 
 contributes 33 percent of South Africa\'s gross domestic 
 product and continues to attract more job seekers than it 
 can absorb, increasing the number of unemployed and poor. 
 The province has shifted away from its dependence on 
 minerals towards the services industries, which today 
 account for 70 percent of Gauteng\'s employment.  The shift 
 towards high-value, high-skills jobs is a major 
 contributor to unemployment and poverty among the job 
 seekers who previously would be easily absorbed into the 
 mining industry but now cannot find employment.  In 2003, 
 unemployment in Gauteng was 28.2 percent and the average 
 monthly income was estimated at R2,000 ($265, using 7.56 
 rands per dollar, the 2003 average).  Representatives of 
 government, business, labor and nongovernmental 
 organizations met at a two-day summit in Johannesburg to 
 develop the growth and development strategy.  The draft 
 document points out the province\'s progress in service 
 delivery and infrastructure improvements.  Over the past 
 10 years, Gauteng has invested more than R1 billion in 
 economic infrastructure to stimulate growth and 
 sustainable job creation.   The province has also extended 
 the provision of social grants to more than 900,000 
 recipients.  But unemployment and poverty persists, and 
 the strategy suggests that the solution may lie elsewhere. 
 Providing education, health care and grants contributes to 
 building a skilled, healthy and nourished population that 
 will need further opportunities to be integrated into the 
 mainstream economy.  The strategy prefers labor-absorbing 
 industries such as tourism, financial services, business 
 services, telecommunications, transport and logistic 
 services.  Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa is scheduled 
 to launch the final development strategy early next year.

 DRAFT BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TARGETS FOR TOURISM 
 INDUSTRY RELEASED 
 --------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 8.  The Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) scorecard 
 steering committee will give its draft empowerment targets 
 for the tourism industry to the Minister of Environmental 
 Affairs and Tourism, Marthinus van Schalkwyk on December 
 8.  The committee, made up of industry, labor, and 
 community representatives, recommended:  (1) 26 percent 
 black ownership by 2009 and 40 percent by 2014; (2) 70 
 percent black employees with 33 percent manager 
 representation by 2009; and (3) 70 percent of the 
 industry\'s skills training should be allocated to black 
 employees in the first draft of targets released two 
 months ago.  In October, the committee presented its draft 
 targets to various communities, generating response about 
 the targets\' impacts on small and medium enterprises and 
 concerns about the relative weighting of ownership versus 
 skills development.  As a result, the human capital 
 component has a larger weight than ownership targets 
 during the first five years after the scorecard is 
 adopted.  Source:  Business Report and Business Day,

 INTERNET USE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
 ---------------------------- 
 
 9.  The South African Advertising Research Foundation\'s

 South African adult population accessed the Internet 
 within the past four weeks, compared to 4.6 percent in 
 2002, 4.5 percent in 2001 and 5.1 percent in 2000.  In 
 2003, 2.8 percent used the Internet at home, while 2.3 
 percent accessed it at the office.  Using internet banking 
 services and email services increased in 2003, with 1.9 
 percent of adults accessing online banking services from 
 1.6 percent in 2002, and 4.5 percent using email services 
 compared to 3.6 percent in 2002.  Few South Africans 
 purchase goods via the Internet with 0.4 percent buying 
 online, compared to 0.3 percent in 2002.  Source:

SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
OPEN SKIES 
---------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Dr. Ian Phillips, Special Advisor to Transport 
Minister Jeffrey Radebe, met with Econ M-C and Econoff 
December 3 to clarify recent comments about the SAG\'s 
approach to proposed Open Skies talks with the United States 
(Reftel A) and to discuss the Minister\'s upcoming visit to 
the United States.  According to Phillips, Radebe instructed 
Department of Transport Director of Aviation Regulations 
Godfrey Selepe to provide him a briefing memo on an Open 
Skies agreement with the United States including a list of 
pros and cons.  In preparing the memo, Selepe is to offer 
explanations for each obstacle and propose solutions.  The 
list memo is to be submitted to the Minister within a week. 
 
3.  (SBU) Phillips said that he envisages two possible 
courses of action during Radebe\'s January trip to the United 
States.  One, if the SAG decides to support a full Open 
Skies agreement with the United States, Radebe could 
possibly sign the agreement during his January visit.  Two, 
if it is decided that a full Open Skies agreement is not 
possible at this time, Radebe will bring Selepe and his 
negotiating team to Washington in January to begin talks to 
explore solutions to obstacles.  Phillips admitted that the 
second scenario is most likely.

MINISTER\'S VISIT 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Phillips said that Radebe is tentatively planning 
to arrive in New York on January 23 and stay three to four 
days.  He would then travel to Washington for one to two 
days.  Selepe\'s team will join Radebe in Washington if talks 
are needed.  Radebe will likely travel with a small 
delegation including Dr. Phillips, Godfrey Selepe, Deputy 
Director-General for Public Transport Lucky Montana, and 
Professor van Niekerk (Maritime advisor to the Minister). 
 
5.  (SBU) Phillips indicated that the Minister prefers to 
minimize protocol and ceremony and, instead, focus on making 
the visit as productive and educational as possible.  He is 
particularly interested in the organizational infrastructure 
of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT), how its 
agencies interact, and how DoT addresses funding issues and 
restraints.  While in New York, the Minister would also like 
to learn more about how DoT administers its maritime and 
aviation ports, the Container Security Initiative, and the 
synergies of the public transport system.

SUBJECT: South Africa establishes National Biodiversity 
Institute 
 
REF: Pretoria 2001 
 
1.  On December 2, Minister of Environmental Affairs and 
Tourism (DEAT) Marthinus Van Schalkwyk officially 
launched the South African National Biodiversity 
Institute (SANBI) at Pretoria\'s National Botanical 
Gardens.  The institute came into being in September 
2004, transforming from the National Botanical Institute 
(NBI) and taking on expanded responsibilities beyond the 
plant kingdom.  The change resulted from new 
environmental legislation (reftel) signed into law in 
June 2004 that established SANBI\'s mandate and 
responsibilities in respect to South Africa\'s fauna and 
flora.  Key responsibilities of the institute include 
reporting the status of biodiversity and all listed and 
protected species and ecosystems.  SANBI controls and 
maintains all eight of South Africa\'s botanical gardens, 
and will collect and disseminate information on 
biodiversity, as well as maintain a biodiversity 
database. 
 
National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. In his keynote address at the SANBI launch ceremony, 
Minister Van Schalkwyk told attendees that his department 
has commissioned SANBI to facilitate an ongoing \"National 
Spatial Biodiversity Assessment\" (NSBA).  The purpose of 
the exercise is to identify spatial biodiversity priority 
areas for conservation action.  The NBSA will contain 
marine, terrestrial, river and estuary components.  The 
products of NSBA will include reports on the status of 
the ecosystem, analysis of species of special concern, 
socio-economic opportunities and constraints on 
biodiversity.  The Minister regards the NSBA as the top 
priority for SANBI.  Initial work on the NSBA began early 
in 2004 and identified nine priority action areas.  The 
national and provincial cabinets have already approved 
the draft document of the assessment, which is likely to 
be published early in 2005.  SANBI has also established a 
biodiversity center in Pretoria, which will function as a 
global hub for biodiversity (Note: South Africa is 
considered to be one of the world\'s most biodiverse 
countries.  End note).  The institute will continue the 
mission of the NBI to provide environmental education to 
communities and schools, and carry out research projects 
and conservation activities. 
 
Environmental awareness, poverty relief programs for 
communities 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
------- 
 
3. Minister Van Schalkwyk also stated that plants and 
animals of Southern Africa have provided food, fuel, 
medicine and shelter to the people for many centuries, 
and because of their tremendous contributions they have 
to be continuously protected.  He said his department 
awarded R70 million or about USD 12 million (US$ = R5.70) 
to SANBI for the next three years to develop and 
implement a \"Greening of the Nation Program.\"  The 
program aims to rehabilitate degraded land, combat air 
pollution, develop indigenous gardens in schools and 
prevent the extinction of indigenous medicinal plants and 
trees.  The greening program will be run in Gauteng, 
KwaZulu Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. 
SANBI will also receive R40 million to top up a R60 
million fund received in the last three years for 
upgrading botanical gardens, according to the Minister. 
The Minister pledged to continue the Poverty Relief 
Project, one of the projects inherited from NBI, which 
helped create 826 jobs and develop 58 Small, Medium, and 
Micro Enterprises (SMME) in 2003-4.  The Minister said 
that his department will inject an additional R28 million 
to the next phase of the project (2005-6).  This 
financial boost will help create 50 more jobs in the 
national gardens. 
 
SANBI Administration 
---------------------- 
 
4. SANBI is a statutory body funded by the Department of 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism and other local and 
international donors.  The chairman of the institute is 
Ms. Bongiwe Njobe, who serves as Director-General in the 
National Department of Agriculture.  SANBI has eight 
gardens in four provinces.  An official of SANBI told EST 
Assistant that discussions are underway to plan the 
establishment of another garden in the Eastern Cape.

creation of a UN Environment Organization (UNEO).  She noted 
that in light of South Africa\'s strong interest in UN 
reform, it remains open to discussion with France about its 
proposal.  At present South Africa is unconvinced of the 
merits of transforming UNEP to a UNEO.  The SAG believes the 
current governance structure works well.  It shares USG 
concerns about the potential effectiveness of UNEO and the 
financial impact of creating UNEO, particularly on 
developing countries.  In addition, South Africa is 
concerned about a possible move of any new organization from 
Nairobi to a location outside Africa.  Haber also commented 
that her DEAT colleague did not appear to have complete 
information about the issue.

employing over 100,000 South Africans. 
 
2.  (SBU)  As last year, respondents most frequently 
cited \"Healthy Economy/Macroeconomics\" and \"Stable 
Government\" as favorable factors influencing business 
and investment.  Companies also cited \"Future 
Potential of South Africa\" as a positive investment 
factor.  The most frequently cited negative factor 
was local equity ownership requirements in BEE

SUBJECT: SACU TO NEGOTIATE FREE TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA 
 
1.  Summary:  The Southern African Customs Union (Sacu) and 
India will start free trade negotiations in the middle of 
2005. The free trade talks would evolve in two stages, 
starting with the establishment of a preferential trade 
agreement covering trade in goods, to be later upgraded into 
a free trade agreement, to cover services, investment and 
procurement.  Free market access should boost trade between 
SACU and India, as the two regions are currently not really 
important trading partners.  Sacu\'s textile, clothing and 
electronics industries are expected to come under serious 
threat from Indian imports if the trade barriers come down. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  On November 26, 2004 Embassy\'s economic specialist 
attended the launch of a publication on the proposed Sacu- 
India Free Trade agreement, organized by the South African 
Institute of International Affairs and the University of the 
Witwatersrand\'s Business School.  This cable reports on some 
of the important points raised by the speakers at the 
launch. 
 
3.  According to Willem van der Spuy, director of Asian 
bilateral trade programmes at the Department of Trade and 
Industry, Sacu and India will start free trade negotiations 
in the middle of 2005, and hope to conclude the negotiations 
by the end of 2005. South Africa and India have been in 
talks on and off since 2001, and managed to sign a framework 
agreement in 2002, but progress was halted by the 
renegotiation of the Sacu agreement. Van der Spuy said that 
in June 2004 SACU ministers formally agreed to re-open 
negotiations with India, and in September 2004 a new 
framework agreement was discussed according to which free 
trade talks would evolve in two stages. The first phase 
would focus on establishing a preferential trade agreement 
(PTA) covering trade in goods. This would enable local 
exporters to have free market access to India\'s $2.66 
trillion economy with a population of over 1 billion.  The 
second phase envisages the upgrading of the PTA into a so- 
called \"new generation\" free trade agreement, to cover 
services, investment and procurement. 
 
4.  The discussions pointed out that South Africa and India 
are not currently very important in either of each other\'s 
import or export basket, as both countries compete for 
consumers in bigger OECD markets.  South Africa is India\'s 
14th most important source of imports but only the 20th most 
important export destination.  According to Philip Alves, a 
trade research intern at the South African Institute of 
International Affairs, South African imports from India were 
concentrated in textiles and clothing, raw hides and leather 
and vegetable products, while Indian imports from South 
Africa consists of minerals, chemicals, base metals, 
textiles and pulp.  The Indian economy is far more protected 
than the Sacu economy, as Indian exports to Sacu currently 
face an unweighted average tariff of 12%, while South 
African exports to India face an unweighted average tariff 
of 24%. 
 
5.  According to Philip Alves, India regards an agreement 
with SACU as the best way to increase its commercial 
presence in the sub-Saharan region.  Suresh Goel, India\'s 
Consul General in South Africa, said the free trade 
agreement would promote privileged market access for Indian 
and South African firms and increased trade between the two 
countries.  According to Goel, Indian manufacturers should 
in future target the South African motor, pharmaceutical, 
chemical and textiles industries.  Already two of India\'s 
prominent motor manufacturers, Tata and Mahindra, had 
entered the South African domestic market and Indian drug 
makers Cipla and Ranbaxy are also active in the domestic 
market.  Julius Sen, an academic at the London School of 
economics, said India was unlikely to include agriculture in 
the free trade agreement as the sector was one of the most 
sensitive in India, with millions of small-scale farmers 
heavily dependent on farming. 
 
6.  From the discussions it was evident that although market 
access-related opportunities could exist for exporters in 
both regions, Sacu\'s textile, clothing and electronics 
industries would come under serious threat from Indian 
imports if the trade barriers came down.  The clothing and 
textiles industry as well as trade unions have expressed 
their concern about the proposed Free Trade Agreement with 
India.  Philip Alves felt that the potential for increased 
intra-industry trade would be of considerable interest to 
politicians, as it will provide evidence in support of the 
argument that south-south integration can benefit all 
involved.

equity levels, 40 percent black management, 50 
percent procurement from black-owned firms, and 50 
percent equality in employment.  Sector charters 
should use these figures as a guide and limit 
variations to 5 percent.  Greater deviations might be 
accepted if objectively \"based on sound economic 
principles.\"  A DTI official told Econoff that the 
Minister would eventually release a statement on 
\"Ownership for Multinationals\" to address the issue 
of exemptions for multinationals.  Public comments on 
these Codes will be accepted for the next 60 days. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) South Africa\'s Minister of Trade and Industry 
Mandisi Mpahlwa released three draft Codes of Good 
Practice December 8.  The Codes provide long-awaited 
guidelines on the Black Economic Empowerment 
Framework (Code 000), Equity Ownership (Code 100), 
and Management (Code 200).  Public comments on the 
Codes will be accepted for the next 60 days.  The 
Minister said these Codes come at a time of 
\"inconsistent application of Broad-Based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) both from the public and 
private sector\" and that \"there has been a lack of 
full understanding and appreciation of the principles 
of BBBEE.\"  The Minister said that these Codes will 
ensure harmonization among the various industry 
charters and will bring about \"predictability, 
consistency, and sustainability in the marketplace.\" 
 
3.  (U) The Minister clarified that he is not 
releasing these Codes as an approved Cabinet 
document.  He said that while Cabinet members 
reviewed the draft Codes and gave a precursory go- 
ahead, the BBBEE Act requires a 60-day public comment 
period which may lead to modifications of the Codes. 
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) plans to 
review public comments and have these three Codes 
gazetted in March.  Another seven Codes will be 
released in a \"second phase.\" 
 
4.  (U) The Codes of Good Practice explain and 
clarify issues pertaining to the various BEE 
scorecard components and consist of one or more 
\"statements.\"  A \"statement\" is a key principle 
guiding the implementation of a particular BEE issue. 
These Codes are not to be confused with industry 
Charters that, once approved and gazetted by DTI, 
will also be referred to as Codes of Good Practice. 
The three Codes released December 8 are available at: 
www.dti.gov.za. 
 
5.  (U) The Black Economic Empowerment Framework 
(Code 000) includes a new generic scorecard 
recommending clear targets.  Among other things, the 
scorecard recommends that companies achieve 25.1 
percent BEE equity levels, 40 percent black 
management, 50 percent procurement from black-owned 
firms, and 50 percent equality in employment.  The 
Minister said that sector charters should use these 
figures as a guide and that variations should, as far 
as possible, be limited to 5 percent.  He also said 
that industries with existing Charters that are not 
in line with the new generic scorecard would have 
twelve months in which to adjust their targets. 
Deviations greater than 5 percent might be accepted 
if objectively \"based on sound economic principles.\" 
In response to a question, the Minister stated that, 
ultimately, scorecard targets of gazetted charters, 
that is, charters approved by DTI and the sector 
department, would take precedence over DTI\'s generic 
scorecard targets. 
 
6.  (U) Code 100 on Equity Ownership outlines the 
various elements of ownership: economic interest and 
voting rights.  The Code recommends that ownership 
points be divided between \"facilitation points\" and 
points that will accrue as the BEE partner(s) achieve 
unencumbered equity.  The Minister said this 
arrangement would ensure that companies are 
separately rewarded for facilitating an empowerment 
transaction as well as the sustainability of the 
transaction. 
 
7.  (SBU) A DTI official told Econoff that the 
Minister would release at an unspecified date an 
Equity Ownership statement on \"Ownership for 
Multinationals.\"  He said that this statement would 
address the issue of exemptions for multinationals 
and would likely generate a great deal of 
controversy.  FRAZER

1. (U) Introduction:  In January 2004, the Economic Section 
of Embassy/Pretoria produced the first issue of a new monthly 
newsletter called \"The Assay\".  The purpose of this monthly 
newsletter is to highlight minerals and energy developments 
in South Africa.  This includes trade and investment as well 
as supply.  South Africa hosts world-class deposits of gold, 
diamonds, platinum group metals, chromium, zinc, titanium, 
vanadium, iron, manganese, antimony, vermiculite, zircon, 
alumino-silicates, fluorspar and phosphate rock, and is a 
major exporter of steam coal.  South Africa is also a leading 
producer and exporter of ferroalloys of chromium, vanadium, 
and manganese.  The information contained in the newsletters 
is based on public sources and does not reflect the views of 
the United States Government.  End introduction.

HOT ISSUES 
---------- 
ISPAT ISCOR Looks for a Power Alternative 
----------------------------------------- 
3. (U) According to Bateman Africa, ISPAT ISCOR is planning 
to build its own power station in order to secure a future 
power supply and reduce pollution at its Vereeniging Steel 
Works in Pretoria.  Management is concerned that South Africa 
could run into a national base-load power shortage by 2010, 
which could have a detrimental effect on the company.  If the 
ISPAT ISCOR project becomes a reality, it would be South 
Africas first industrial independent power producer and the 
first power station to be built in South Africa by Bateman, 
one of the top five engineering and construction companies in 
South Africa.  The National Energy Regulator (NER) has 
already granted a license for the construction of the power 
station.  Waste heat from the Vereeniging Steel Works would 
drive the planned 140 MW plant.  BHP-Billion is investigating 
similar options for its Richards Bay and Maputo aluminum 
smelters, and its Samancor ferro-alloy plants.  These 
operations are heavy users of electricity and generate huge 
amounts of process heat that could be recycled to generate 
additional electricity. 
 
Rolling Over Slow Moving Spoornet 
--------------------------------- 
4. (U) The inability of South Africas rail parastatal, 
Spoornet, to grow with the economy and provide efficient 
service has caused a number of mining and manufacturing 
companies to resort to road transportation, and others to 
consider purchasing their own rolling stock.  James Lennox, 
Chief Executive of the South African Chamber of Business, has 
publicly encouraged chamber members to get involved in the 
rail business because he thinks it would be good for them and 
the economy.  He argues that the economic benefits would 
include reducing transportation costs for customers and the 
more efficient use of rail assets. 
 
5. (U) Because of the lack of rail capacity, iron and 
manganese ore producers have not been able to ride the 
current global commodity boom driven by China demand.  Rail 
inefficiencies have also frustrated automobile manufacturers. 
As a result, two iron ore mining companies, Kumba Resources 
and Assmang, are now negotiating with the government for 
permission to buy their own rolling stock so that they are no 
longer dependent upon Spoornets limited ability to respond 
to growing demand.  Kumba and Assmang are situated next to 
each other in the Northwest Province, and want to increase 
their exports to China through ports at Saldanha Bay and Port 
Elizabeth.  Also on the table for these iron ore exporters is 
the construction of a new rail spur to Coega, where a new 
deep-water port is under construction some 20 km east of Port 
Elizabeth.  Meanwhile, the automotive industry, largely based 
in Port Elizabeth, has indicated interest in investing in new 
rail capacity between the Port of Durban and Johannesburg. 
 
6. (U) Bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore, manganese 
ore, steel, and ferro-alloys account for more than 70% of 
Spoornets business.  Add motor vehicles to this and the 
total exceeds 80%. 
 
-------- 
MINERALS 
-------- 
Uranium Byproduct Worth its Weight in Gold 
------------------------------------------ 
7. (U) Afrikander Lease (Aflease) is a junior gold mining 
company that operated a now mothballed gold mine in the North 
West Province where uranium was an important byproduct.  The 
mine occurs in the Dominion Reef geological formation, which 
is older than the gold-rich Witwatersrand formation and has 
relatively high uranium values.  The mine contains so much 
uranium, in fact, that commodity prices determined whether 
one called it a gold, uranium, or dual-metal mine.  Over the 
past decade, Afrikander Lease operated the mine as a marginal 
gold producer.  Last year, the company closed the mine due to 
high costs of operation associated with the strength of the 
rand.  Since 2003, however, the price of uranium has risen by 
more than 37%, and this may give the mine a new economic 
lease on life as a uranium mine  this time with gold as the 
by-product. 
 
8. (U) Afleases infrastructure, inherited from AngloGold, is 
still in place, but requires repair.  Chief Executive Neal 
Froneman said that by 2005 the mine could resume gold 
production and move toward exploiting South Africas largest 
deposit of \"near available\" uranium by 2006.  The project 
could provide 4 million pounds of uranium oxide a year to a 
growing nuclear energy market.  Froneman said that the United 
States, Canada, Britain, France, Switzerland, and Japan had 
already shown interest in the mines 330 million pound 
uranium resource, and current and future market and price 
fundamentals looked good.  At full production, the mine would 
also produce 100,000 oz a year of gold as byproduct.  The 
projected capital cost tostart up the open-pit mine is $27 
million, resulting in a breakeven cost of $14 a pound of 
 of 
uranium oxide (i.e., yellow cake).  The price of yellow cake 
is currently about $20 a pound. 
 
-------- 
DIAMONDS 
-------- 
De Beers and the Draft Precious Metals and Diamonds General 
Amendments Bill 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
9. (U) De Beers has long struggled with the problem of how to 
align its diamond production and \"supplier of choice\" 
marketing strategy with the new Mineral and Petroleum 
Resources Development Act and BEE Mining Charter.  One way 
would be to become more involved in creating a local cutting 
and polishing industry and supplying BEE companies with rough 
diamonds mined in South Africa.  Government has put 
considerable pressure on De Beers on this score, which some 
believe may be behind the 8% royalty on diamond revenues 
proposed in the draft Royalty Bill and the 5% excise tax on 
all rough diamond exports proposed in the draft Precious 
Metals and Diamonds General Amendments Bill (the Diamond 
Bill).  De Beers and the diamond industry oppose both these 
bills, but see the BEE writing on the wall. 
 
10. (U) At the end of a two-day workshop to solicit the 
diamond industrys input into the draft Diamond Bill, 
Minister of Minerals and Energy Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka 
announced that De Beers had agreed to incorporate BEE 
requirements into its \"supplier of choice\" program.  The 
\"supplier of choice\" program replaced De Beers old Central 
Selling Organization sight holder method that characterized 
its monopoly in rough diamonds until the late 1990s.  Under 
the \"supplier of choice\" program, De Beers selects its 
customers for their ability to promote and market diamond 
jewelry.  It will now select its South African suppliers 
based also on their ability to meet BEE requirements as 
prescribed by the mining industry charter.  The De Beers 
Diamond Trading Company (DTC), the successor to the Central 
Selling Organization, currently distributes to 14 \"suppliers 
of choice\" in South Africa, but has committed to add BEE 
EE 
suppliers and to facilitate the development of BEE diamond 
cutting and polishing businesses.  Israel-based diamond 
consultant Chaim Even-Zohar, who coordinated the workshop, 
explained that De Beers would require its \"suppliers of 
choice\" to supply diamonds to BEE cutters and polishers.  In 
a parallel move, De Beers invited the South African 
Government to take a 50% stake in its Diamdel rough diamond 
trading subsidiary that sells diamonds to small clients. 
 
11. (U) The diamond industry in South Africa employs about 
28,000 people, of which 13,000 are in mining, 300 in sorting 
and valuing, 2,100 in cutting and polishing, 3,000 in jewelry 
manufacturing, and 9,000 in retailing.  Locally mined 
production is valued at about $l billion, with $550 million 
worth of rough diamonds supplied to the South African market 
and a similar value of polished diamonds exported.  De Beers 
operates as a worldwide wholesaler of rough diamonds, 
producing about 40 million carats worth $5.5 billion last 
year (about 62% by value of total world demand).  Most of the 
rough diamonds come from Botswana, South Africa, and Namibia, 
but De Beers also purchased $800 million worth of diamonds 
from Russia last year. 
 
Synthetic Diamonds Worry De Beers 
--------------------------------- 
12. (U) BHP-Billiton, the world\'s largest mining company, and 
De Beers, the worlds largest producer and distributor of 
rough diamonds, are concerned that synthetic diamonds might 
adversely impact their $57 billion retail diamond market for 
natural stones.  In an attempt to protect the high mark- up 
on its product, De Beers wants jewelers to buy analytical 
machines that can distinguish the synthetic stones from 
natural diamonds; the difference is not otherwise 
discernable.  Two U.S. companies, Apollo Diamonds (Boston) 
and Gemesis (Florida), produce synthetic diamonds with 
equipment that replicates the high pressures and temperatures 
found in the earth.  These synthetic diamonds make up about 
4% of annual diamond production, but only 0.3% by value since 
they are sold at much lower prices.  Until recently, 
synthetic diamonds were mainly used for industrial purposes, 
such as in drill bits for oilrigs.  However, new technology 
has enabled the production of larger and more impressive 
stones.  Blackie Marole, the Managing Director of Debswana, 
the Botswana Government\'s joint venture with De Beers, 
recently said that the marketing challenge posed by synthetic 
stones was as great as that recently posed by conflict 
diamonds.  Sales of rough diamonds grew 8% in the first half 
of 2004 after totaling $8.9 billion last year. 
 
------------ 
LIQUID FUELS 
------------ 
Biodiesel 
--------- 
13. (U) As the world price of crude oil climbs, the 
scientific community and the South African Government have 
begun to contemplate producing biodiesel from sunflower seeds 
or soya, and ethanol from maize and sugar cane.  According to 
Andre Otto, Deputy Director for Renewable Energy at the 
Department of Minerals and Energy (DME), locally produced 
biodiesel could reduce imports of crude oil and act as a 
cushion against sharp increases in oil prices.  Biodiesel 
might also create a viable market for South Africas new 
black farmers.  The Department of Science and Technology, the 
South African Bureau of Standards (SABS), the South African 
Revenue Service (SARS), and the South African Petroleum 
Association want to propose an implementation plan to 
government in March 2005.  Otto states that the aim is to 
supply 150 million gallons of biodiesel a year within 10 
years, equal to about 8% of the countrys annual diesel 
consumption or 2.5% of total liquid fuel consumption.  SARS 
says that there should be tax benefits given to farmers who 
grow crops to produce biodiesel.  However, local automobile 
manufacturers are concerned about biodiesel quality, and have 
asked SABS to set acceptable standards. 
 
14. (U) The greater fuel efficiency of new diesel engine 
e 
technology from Europe has helped diesel car sales reach 10% 
of all new vehicle sales in South Africa.  Econometrix senior 
economist Tony Twine believes that this could even rise to 
40% by 2013.  South Africans now pay about $3.00 for a gallon 
of gasoline.

Labor

AIDS Takes its Toll on Gold Miners 
---------------------------------- 
15. (U) Harmony Gold, the third largest gold producer in 
South Africa, estimated that AIDS would kill one third of the 
41,000 workers it employs in South Africa. In its 2004 annual 
report, Harmony stated that the HIV infection rate among the 
company\'s workforce would peak this year at 33.9%.  AngloGold 
Ashanti, the countrys largest gold producer, had an 
infection rate among its South African workers of 30.2%, 
according to Petra Kruger, head of the company\'s HIV/AIDS 
unit.  Gold Fields, the second largest producer, has an 
estimated 28% infection rate among its workforce.  The rate 
of infection among miners has placed a financial and 
healthcare burden on companies as they battle falling 
productivity among the sick and rising medical costs for 
their workers.  Harmony estimated that the impact of HIV/AIDS 
on their cash flow would be in the range of $2 to $5 an 
ounce. 
 
 
Russians Talk Minerals and Energy 
--------------------------------- 
16. (U) A large delegation of Russian officials met with 
their South African counterparts in Pretoria on November 17- 
18.  Heading the delegation was the Minister of Natural 
Resources, Yury Trutnev.  One of the most important agenda 
items for South Africa was assuring a long-term supply of 
crude oil.  In 2002, PetroSA, the state-owned oil company, 
bought crude oil from Russia in a once-off deal.  PetroSA 
officials have since visited Moscow several times to discuss 
further purchases, but without success. 
 
17. (U) Trutnevs visit could also signal interest in natural 
resource trade and investment by both countries.  South 
Africa and Russia are leading producers of platinum group 
metals, gold, and diamonds.  South African company sources 
said that this would depend on the resolution of disputes 
between South African companies and their Russian 
counterparts.  The most notable of these is the refusal by 
the Russian mining company, Arkhangelskgeoldobycha (AGD) to 
honor the investment and licensing partnership agreement 
signed with the De Beers-owned company, Archangel Diamond 
Corporation (ADC).  Other South African companies engaged in 
Russia include Mondis (Anglo American group) joint venture 
with the Syktyvkar paper and pulp mill, AngloGold Ashanti\'s 
recent $32 million purchase of shares in Trans Siberian Gold 
(a London-listed miner with projects in central and eastern 
Siberia, and Anglo Platinum\'s stake in a platinum deposit in 
the Urals, funded through Eurasia Mining (another London- 
listed miner). 
 
18. (U) In the news, Anglo American recently sold its 20.3% 
holding in Gold Fields Limited, South Africas number two 
gold producer, to Norilsk, the giant Russian nickel and 
d 
palladium producer.  Although Norilsk management stated that 
the purchase was purely for its portfolio, rumors persisted 
that they were positioning for a takeover of Gold Fields. 
Harmony may have beaten Norilsk to the punch, which is why 
Norilsk is now teaming with Harmony in a hostile takeover bid 
for Gold Fields.

1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy Pretoria was pleased and 
privileged to host Dr. Subhash Gupta as Embassy Science 
Fellow from September 29 to December 8, 2004.  During his 
ten-week stay, Dr. Gupta met with research groups at five 
universities and two government research councils, private 
sector representatives, numerous South African Government 
officials, and other biotechnology stakeholders.  He made 
ten presentations at workshops, conferences and seminars. 
At the end of his stay, he gave an extensive outbrief and 
recommendations to receptive officials at the Department of 
Science & Technology.  His concluding remarks encouraged: 
the South African government to take a stronger leadership 
role on plant biotechnology domestically and beyond; the SAG 
to strengthen initiatives for graduate students training in 
biosafety; the GMO regulatory body to engage in greater 
dialogue with scientists, developers and anti-GMO groups; 
and, the office of the registrar for genetically-modified 
organisms (GMO) to add several qualified scientists to its 
staff, to respond better to anti-GMO pressures.  End 
summary. 
 
Two-way information sharing with research community 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (U) Embassy Science Fellow Subhash Gupta, a senior 
biotechnologist from USDA\'s Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS), gained extensive insights into 
plant molecular biology and biotechnology research taking 
place in major universities and parastatal research 
institutions.  He met with groups of researchers at the 
Universities of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Stellenbosch, 
Pretoria, and the North, as well as the Council for 
Scientific and Industrial Research and the Agricultural 
Research Council.  In addition to learning about research 
activities underway and hearing local scientists\' views of 
South Africa\'s regulatory system, Dr. Gupta shared 
information about the U.S. regulatory system for 
biotechnology products with the researchers. 
 
Interaction with private sector 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Dr. Gupta visited local seed manufacturer Pannar 
Seeds at their main office in Greytown, KwaZulu Natal 
province.  He met with the CEO, biotech researchers and 
several other key groups in the company.  Pannar uses 
licensed genetic engineering (GE) technology from Monsanto 
in several of its seed products, and also is conducting 
significant research, both through conventional breeding 
techniques and GE, to address wide-ranging plant pests. 
Dr. Gupta also attended a conference of major commercial 
agricultural producers, during which he met with sugar 
farmers and millers and learned about biotechnology research 
in the sugar industry.  At this event, Dr. Gupta had the 
opportunity to meet Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs 
Thoko Didiza. 
 
Many formal presentations, including to key policy group 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (U) During his stay in South Africa, Dr. Gupta 
participated in several major workshops and conferences 
organized by the South African government and by AfricaBio, 
a local NGO that supports biotechnology and develops 
information to educate and train officials and the public. 
He made presentations at a \"Bio2Biz Conference\" focused on 
commercialization of biotechnology, workshops on the 
Management of Applied R&D Projects with GM Crops and on Food 
Aid and Biotechnology, along with a breakfast seminar on the 
global regulatory climate for biotechnology.  Dr. Gupta also 
spoke to a group of graduate students from all over the 
African continent at University of Cape Town\'s All-Africa 
House--reportedly one of his toughest audiences. 
 
5. (SBU) One of Dr. Gupta\'s most critical presentations was 
to members of the national Executive Council on Genetically 
Modified Organisms, the regulatory entity for GMOs in South 
Africa.  Representatives from six different SAG departments 
sit on the council, whose secretariat, the GMO Registrar, is 
based in the National Department of Agriculture (NDA).  On 
November 23, he gave a talk entitled \"U.S. regulations, risk 
analysis and compliance for agricultural biotechnology 
products.\"  Based on the knowledge he had built up over 
seven weeks in-country, he commended the regulators for the 
system in South Africa.  He addressed particular issues of 
concern, including the treatment of stacked genes, 
encouraging adoption of a pragmatic approach.  He also added 
some discussion of biotech-derived pharmaceuticals, at the 
request of a Department of Health representative.  Dr. 
Gupta\'s comments were appreciated and well-received, 
although due to a tight schedule, there was little time for 
questions and answers.  On the margins of the session, Dr. 
Gupta urged NDA\'s Julian Jaftha to strike a reasonable 
balance and take a practical approach to regulating GMOs. 
 
Start-to-Finish Interaction with DST 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) Department of Science and Technology was an 
enthusiastic and attentive interlocutor.  The DST Director 
for Biotechnology Ben Durham provided Dr. Gupta with a 
comprehensive overview of the SAG\'s activities in biotech 
soon after his arrival.  DST supported Dr. Gupta\'s 
attendance at events such as the launch of PlantBio, a DST- 
sponsored innovation center focused on plant biotechnology 
(where he was able to meet Minister of Science & Technology 
Mosibudi Mangena), at the DST-supported Bio2Biz conference, 
and in meetings with its other biotech innovation centers 
and incubators supported by DST.  Durham and his colleagues 
sought Dr. Gupta\'s feedback and observations in an extended 
wrap-up session on December 3.  Dr. Gupta shared his views 
of South Africa\'s regulatory system, the challenges it 
faces, and suggestions for addressing the challenges and 
engaged in an excellent exchange of ideas with four 
biotechnology officials from this highly-supportive 
government Department. 
 
7. (SBU) Dr. Gupta\'s feedback to DST noted the vital and 
crucial leadership role South Africa could and should play, 
at a regional, continental, and global level, given the 
country\'s scientific expertise, financial support for 
biotech development, and progressive regulatory system. 
However, he also noted the chilling effect that anti-GMO 
pressure groups such as BioWatch and SAFEAGE had on SAG 
leadership in agricultural biotechnology. 
 
8. (SBU) Dr. Gupta also discussed a notable shortcoming of 
the current regulatory system-the lack of active 
consultation with academia and industry, and the distrust 
between academia/industry and government regulators.  He 
commented that this could be caused by fear of the anti-GMO 
lobby, as well as the regulator\'s lack of confidence and 
capacity to carry out risk analyses.  He encouraged the 
regulators to be more open to interaction with researchers 
and the private sector, and even the anti-GMO lobby, noting 
that this will provide them with helpful insights and 
information.  He suggested that the GMO Registrar\'s office 
add several positions, including a full-time senior 
scientist, possibly through establishment of a prestigious 
program for scientists.  He also encouraged the government 
to organize hands-on risk analysis training to prepare 
regulators as well as researchers and developers to deal 
with biosafety issues and concerns. 
 
9. (SBU) Dr. Gupta raised another area of concern, namely 
the limited availability of local graduate students and the 
brain-drain of that limited number of graduates.  He 
suggested that the government consider providing incentives 
to retain graduates in South Africa and establishing science 
fellow programs at the post-doctorate or graduate level to 
help integrate science and policy. 
 
10. (SBU) Dr. Gupta noted the efforts of DST in supporting 
innovation centers and incubators but stressed that efforts 
needed to be expanded, to help develop and commercialize 
indigenous technologies that address agricultural needs of 
the continent.  He also urged increased funding for programs 
to raise the public\'s awareness and understanding of 
biotechnology, observing that only one such program existed. 
DST\'s Director for Biotechnology welcomed Dr. Gupta\'s 
comments and feedback and sincerely thanked Dr. Gupta for 
coming to South Africa.  He said he planned to continue 
their productive dialogue electronically for the foreseeable 
future. 
 
Sidetrip to Botswana 
-------------------- 
 
11. (U) Dr. Gupta traveled to Botswana for a productive day- 
long program on December 6, organized by Embassy Gaborone in 
cooperation with the APHIS and FAS representatives in this 
region.

 End Summary. 
 
 NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES 
 --------------------------- 
 
 2.  The South African Reserve Bank\'s (SARB) Monetary 
 Policy Meeting (MPC) kept its key lending rate steady at 
 7.5 percent, mostly in line with market forecasts.  This 
 means the prime rate remains at 11 percent.  SARB\'s 
 governor Tito Mboweni expects inflation could increase 
 somewhat in 2005, but should remain comfortably within the 
 target range of 3 to 6 percent.  Mboweni cited the 
 following indicators as possible future reasons for an 
 increase in inflation:  (1) the decline in growth of labor 
 productivity from 3.3 percent in the first quarter 2004 to 
 0.5 percent in the second quarter; (2) the recent strong 
 growth in money supply (14.9 percent in October); and (3) 
 the high growth of total loans of the banks to the private 
 sector (15.1 percent in October).  Combined with strong 
 growth in demand in the third quarter, the MPC left 
 interest rates unchanged.  Two thirds of economists 
 surveyed by I-Net Bridge expected no change in rates, 
 while the rest forecasted a 50 basis points cut.  The 
 announcement came at the same time that the Bureau for 
 Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch 
 released its findings of the inflation expectation survey. 
 The survey differed very little from the third quarter, 
 with overall inflation expectations remaining in the 
 SARB\'s 3 to 6 percent target range for a second time in a 
 row.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, December 9; Statement of the 
 Monetary Policy Committee, December 9. 
 
 3.  Comment.  Even though the rand has strengthened 5.1 
 percent against the dollar in November alone, fears that 
 strong consumer demand along with wage increases already 
 negotiated being just above the 6 percent range made the 
 SARB reluctant to reduce interest rates just before the 
 holiday season.  Recent press statements by SARB Governor 
 Mboweni emphasized that the Bank would not lose its focus 
 in targeting inflation.  End comment. 
 
 IMF SEES PROGRESS IN ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS BUT INEQUALITY 
 STILL PROBLEMATIC 
 --------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 4.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its 
 annual report on South Africa and noted that South African 
 growth should increase over the short to medium term as 
 monetary easing, a moderate expansionary fiscal policy, 
 increases in investment and strong domestic demand provide 
 a solid base for over 3 percent growth.  The IMF expects a 
 modest increase in inflation over the next twelve months 
 and views adjustments in interest rates likely.  The IMF 
 views recent increases in South Africa\'s net international 
 reserves as crucial since the closure of the SARB\'s 
 forward book in the foreign exchange market in February 
 2004, and considers further increases in reserves as 
 desirable in order to help reduce currency volatility and 
 keep long-term interest rates low. In response to strong 
 domestic demand and the currency appreciation, the 
 external current account position reversed from a surplus 
 of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to a deficit of 0.8 percent 
 of GDP in 2003; however, South Africa continues to attract 
 inflows to easily finance its current account deficit. 
 Increased government expenditures have provided counter 
 cyclical support and helped address South Africa\'s social 
 problems.  \"The authorities agree that a government 
 deficit in the region of 3 percent of GDP should be 
 considered the upper limit of what is desirable to 
 maintain macroeconomic stability and to keep indebtedness 
 under control,\" the IMF said.  Universal provision of 
 antiretroviral HIV/AIDS drugs through the public health 
 system is an important example of increased government 
 expenditures.  The annual report also emphasizes the 
 importance of policies designed to reduce income and 
 wealth disparities and encourages progress in both black 
 empowerment programs and land reform as being crucial to 
 maintain social cohesion.  In order to reduce 
 unemployment, the IMF report stated that labor market and 
 tax reforms and increased competition were necessary.  The 
 IMF staff recommends that steps be considered to 
 decentralize the collective bargaining system so that 
 small and medium-sized enterprises gain more autonomy in 
 setting wages. It is, moreover, concerned that increases 
 in minimum wages have aggravated the unemployment problem, 
 particularly in the agricultural sector. \"The government\'s 
 skills development program could be strengthened by 
 relying less on labor levies as a source of funding and by 
 focusing more on training those presently unemployed,\" the 
 IMF said.  The IMF staff urged that further liberalization 
 of the tax regime be undertaken and that implementation of 
 the privatization program, which has come to a halt, be 
 stepped up.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, December 2. 
 
 39 PERCENT OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE CLOSED EXPORT CAPACITY 
 --------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 5.   Thirty-nine percent of South African manufacturers 
 have closed down export capacity permanently over the past 
 two years as the rand has moved from above 13 rand per US 
 dollar in December 2001 to below 6 rand per dollar.  The 
 Bureau of Economic Research (BER) at the University of 
 Stellenbosch found these results during its survey of 
 1,100 manufacturers conducted between October 25 and 
 November 22.  Other survey results included:  (1) 28 
 percent \"suffered a decline in export volumes\"; (2) 16 
 percent managed to maintain export markets, if not grow 
 them; and (3) 14 percent managed to \"continue growing 
 export volumes\" over the past two years.  The BER noted 
 that the global economy has been in a growth phase over 
 the past 18 months, with growth being exceptionally strong 
 during the second half of 2003 and the early part of 2004. 
 In some sectors, production for export is being switched 
 to the domestic market as 25 percent of the respondents 
 indicated that this has been their company\'s response over 
 the past two years.  Since the manufacturing sector 
 contributed more than half of export revenues in 2003, the 
 implied loss of export capacity suggests larger economic 
 costs tied to the strength of the currency.  BER expressed 
 concern that the strong rand is indirectly fueling 
 domestic expenditure while constraining local production 
 (because of the low cost of imports) leading to unbalanced 
 and unsustainable growth.  It recommends that the South 
 African Reserve Bank (SARB) should accumulate reserves 
 more aggressively.  The SARB should also consider easing 
 interest rates to close the gap with interest rate levels 
 abroad, currently inviting volatile money inflows on the 
 capital account of the balance of payments.  When asked to 
 give their view on what constituted the optimal level of 
 foreign reserves for South Africa, 48.9 percent of the 
 survey participants said six months import cover, 28.9 
 percent said one year\'s import cover, 16.7 percent said 
 three months import cover and only 5.6 percent said three 
 years\' worth.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, December 2. 
 
 SA\'S LABOR FORCE DECLINES DUE TO DISCOURAGEMENT AND 
 HIV/AIDS 
 --------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 6.  South Africa\'s labor force has declined over the past 
 few years, probably because more people have given up 
 looking for work or are infected with HIV, says a new 
 report in the South African Reserve Bank\'s (SARB) Labor 
 Market Frontiers report.  South Africa\'s labor force 
 participation rate, which counts the number of people 
 working and actively seeking work as a proportion of the 
 total population, dropped to 54.1 percent in September 
 2003, down from 58.9 percent in September 2000.  Official 
 figures from Statistics SA show that unemployment dropped 
 to 4.6 million in September 2003 from 5.3 million in March 
 2003, based on the narrow definition of unemployment where 
 an individual had been actively seeking work prior to the 
 survey.  The drop in unemployment was not matched by an 
 increase in total employment over that period, with more 
 people dropping out of the labor market.  The number of 
 discouraged job seekers increased the unemployed figure to 
 more than 8 million.  The SARB\'s report states that job 
 seekers were discouraged because of the slim chances of 
 finding a job, or because they lacked funds to search 
 actively for work.  Another likely cause for a drop in 
 labor market participation was the effect of HIV/AIDS. 
 The report points to research that shows a drop in 
 HIV/AIDS prevalence among younger people in their 
 twenties, and an increase in higher age groups, making up 
 most of the labor force.  The report also assesses whether 
 social grants have a negative incentive on labor force 
 participation, but found mixed results.  Some studies show 
 that pension payments cause an indirect effect of 
 withdrawal from the labor market.  However, other studies 
 show that a child support grant could result in higher 
 labor force participation.  Source:  Business Day,

 BEE TRANSACTIONS DOUBLE THOUGH BENEFITING FEW 
 --------------------------------------------- 
 
 7.  Black economic empowerment deals this year increased 
 to an estimated R80 billion ($14 billion using 5.7 rands 
 per dollar) amid debate that only a small black elite was 
 benefiting from the transactions.  This was more than 
 double the R40 billion worth of empowerment deals 
 concluded last year, fuelled mainly by black economic 
 empowerment charters.  Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi 
 Mpahlwa stated that 72 percent of last year\'s deals had 
 involved at least one of the top six empowerment 
 companies, Mvelaphanda, Shanduka, ARM, Kagiso, Tiso and 
 Safika, adding weight to concerns that government\'s 
 current empowerment strategy is not broad-based enough. 
 Trade and Industry Deputy Director-General Lionel October 
 estimated that the number of recorded deals had doubled 
 this year from last year\'s 118.  Apart from the financial 
 sector, key sectors contributing to the huge deal-making 
 this year included information technology, retail and 
 manufacturing.  Mpahlwa said the average reported value of 
 all the transactions last year was R515.3 million ($90 
 million), and the largest transaction in terms of rand 
 value last year was the ARMGold and Avmin deal worth R10.6 
 billion ($1.86 billion).  The use of vendor financing, 
 inflows of foreign capital and the involvement of the 
 Industrial Development Corporation were among the 
 financing mechanisms used.  Source:  Business Day, 
 December 7. 
 
 OCTOBER MANUFACTURING GROWTH LEVELS 
 ----------------------------------- 
 
 8.  Both manufacturing production and sales declined on a 
 monthly basis (seasonally adjusted) at -0.7 and -1.0 
 percent, although when compared to figures from last 
 October, they grew 5.3 and 11.4 percent respectively. 
 October 2004\'s year-on-year growth shows high growth 
 compared to a low base last October.  The manufacturing 
 sector experienced a recession from April 2003 to February 
 2004, and October 2003\'s manufacturing production declined 
 by 2.3 percent.  On a quarterly basis, 7 out of 10 sectors 
 reported improvements, with the greatest contribution to 
 manufacturing output growth coming from food and 
 beverages.  Production growth was also strong in the motor 
 vehicle, paper, wood, and furniture industries.  The 
 textile sector and communication equipment reported the 
 largest decline in both production and sales, as 
 competition from cheaper imports is especially severe in 
 these industries.  Source:  Standard Bank, Manufacturing 
 Unpacked December 7; Business Day, December 8. 
 
 CURRENT TRADE CONDITIONS STILL PREDICT GROWTH 
 --------------------------------------------- 
 
 9.  Started in 2000, the South African Chamber of Commerce 
 and Standard Bank publish two monthly trade indices 
 measuring South African trade activity and expectations. 
 November\'s indices still indicate growth, although 
 expectations have marginally decreased from October\'s 
 level.  The trade activity index increased to 56 compared 
 to October\'s level of 50, with sales volumes and new 
 orders showing the highest growth in November.  Sales 
 volumes indicate strong November growth even when 
 seasonally adjusted, confirming that domestic demand 
 growth remains quite strong.  The survey showed that 
 inflation (selling prices) slowed in November, although 
 purchase prices (prices of inputs) increased.  Since 2000, 
 the employment component of the activity index has rarely 
 exceeded 50, a value indicating expansion in employment. 
 November\'s value of 51 indicates modest expansion, 
 although employment growth may reflect seasonal increased 
 hiring.  The trade expectations index also predicts 
 expansion at 60, although it has declined marginally from 
 September and October\'s values of 63 and 61 respectively. 
 There is strong expectation that growth in both sales 
 volumes and new orders will increase over the medium term, 
 although not as strong as in October.  Traders expect that 
 both selling and purchasing prices will increase over the 
 medium term, with selling price increases moderating. 
 Employment prospects remain positive at 53, the fourth 
 consecutive month of expanding employment expectations.

 NET RESERVES INCREASE BY 14 PERCENT IN NOVEMBER 
 --------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 10.  The South African Reserve Bank\'s (SARB) net reserves 
 increased by 14 percent in November to $11.02 billion. 
 The SARB increased its purchases to $1.3 billion compared 
 to its October purchase of $962 million.  Gross gold and 
 foreign exchange reserves increased to $14.425 billion 
 compared to October\'s level of $13 billion.  According to 
 Nedcor economist Magan Mistry, the current level of 
 reserves will cover about four months of imports and 
 Mistry expects that the bank will continue to increase 
 reserves until six months of imports are covered.  On 
 average, the rand appreciated 5.1 percent against the 
 dollar in November, and with continuing rand strength and 
 higher gold prices, further increases in reserves are 
 expected in December.  Source:  Standard Bank, Foreign 
 Reserves Alert, December 7; Business Report, December 8. 
 
 UNION CRITICIZES MOTOR VEHICLE SECTOR\'S BEE EXEMPTION 
 --------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 11.  The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (NUMSA) has 
 criticized the motor sector\'s original equipment 
 manufacturers\' exemption from Black Economic Empowerment 
 (BEE) since the companies were not South African-based. 
 In October, Trade and Industry Minister Mpahlwa stated 
 that the government would allow multinationals in the 
 motor vehicle sector to commit to their own BEE 
 initiatives rather than forcing them into a single 
 approach.  Since multinationals comprised the majority of 
 the vehicle assembly and component manufacturing sectors 
 and alliances were formed with both upstream and 
 downstream producers, government was open to negotiation 
 regarding BEE ownership requirements for original 
 equipment manufacturers.  NUMSA views that since these 
 companies derive benefits from the government\'s motor 
 industry development program, they should not be exempt 
 from following the government\'s BEE policies.  NUMSA wants 
 to establish an empowerment charter, code of conduct, 
 standards and monitoring mechanisms for the industry as a 
 whole.  Nico Vermeulen, executive director of the National 
 Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA reported 
 that representatives of the motor vehicle industry were 
 finalizing a sectoral approach to BEE and expects 
 additional discussion with all stakeholders in the near 
 future.  Source:  Business Report, December 8.

SA\'s Response to HIV/AIDS Still Includes Denial and Ignorance 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
2.  The latest figures from the Actuarial Society of South 
Africa suggest that about one in nine South Africans is 
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and about 5 
million people who are living with the disease, the largest 
case load in the world.  The Human Sciences Research Council\'s 
2002 household survey estimated that 6.2 percent of white South 
Africans were infected with HIV, the biggest middle class 
epidemic in the world. By comparison, an estimated 12.9 percent 
of black Africans were infected.  Many health care 
practitioners find that their patients know about HIV/AIDS but 
few are changing their behavior.  The same patients repeatedly 
ask for HIV tests. These are not sex workers for whom HIV is a 
hazard of their jobs, but people who refuse to accept that they 
need to protect themselves with condoms.  The point about an 
HIV test is to have it once, and if you are negative to keep it 
that way.  \"There\'s a mistaken belief among many middle- to 
upper income professionals, particularly whites, that they are 
not at risk,\" says Mark Heywood of the Treatment Action 
Campaign.  The fact that HIV has disproportionately affected 
poor, black, young women is an indication that many of them 
think it cannot affect them, says Jonathan Berger, of the AIDS 
Law Project at the University of the Witwatersrand.  That 
denial is worsened by SA\'s HIV-prevention campaigns, which 
focus almost exclusively on young people.  \"By telling part of 
the story as if it were the entire story, the vulnerability 
picture often painted is both inaccurate and misleading,\" he 
says in a paper accepted for publication by the journal 
Development Update.  Berger argues that SA\'s limited public 
education campaigns are deeply flawed, presenting a sanitized 
view of sex that bears little relation to people\'s lives. They 
focus on young men and women having heterosexual sex, and shy 
away from anything vaguely taboo, he says.  Very little 
research investigates what kind of sex people are having. And 
when research does shed light on potentially dangerous 
practices, Berger states that the findings are not incorporated 
in education campaigns.  Despite the frustration expressed by 
many HIV/AIDS experts, there is some encouraging evidence that 
young people are waiting longer before they have their first 
sexual encounters; are using condoms more consistently; and are 
more conscious of the dangers of HIV, says loveLife CEO David 
Harrision.  Source:  Business Day, December 1. 
 
HIV/AIDS Places Burden on Elderly 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) released a study 
on the impact of HIV/AIDS on the elderly (aged 60 and older) in 
Mpumalanga that highlights the particularly heavy financial and 
care burden the elderly are paying.  The study found that 72 
percent of older people in the province are the main 
breadwinners in multi-generational households, spending most of 
their income on household necessities and the education of 
grandchildren.  Nine percent are caring for sick young adults 
living in the household, 22 percent are staying with 
grandchildren whose own parents are either dead or away in the 
cities on a long-term basis, 20 percent take care of children 
six years or younger, and 46 percent take care of children 
between the ages of six and 18.  With 60 percent of orphans in 
South Africa being cared for by their grandparents, bringing up 
a second generation weighed heavily on the elderly.  Funerals 
carry a substantial cost, often shouldered by the elderly as 
the main breadwinner, or receiver of a state pension. The 
majority of the elderly are female, according to census 2001 
there are 34 males to 100 females in Mpumalanga.  Most stay in 
rural areas, with even those who worked in the cities returning 
to rural areas when reaching retirement age to reunite with 
their extended families.  Source:  SAPA, Mail and Guardian, 
December 1. 
 
Some Regions Fear HIV/AIDS, Others Cancer 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  A global survey has found that Africans, West Asians and 
Latin Americans believe that HIV/AIDS is the most important 
disease confronting them -- while people elsewhere fear cancer. 
The Gallup International/Markinor poll interviewed more than 
50,000 people in over 60 countries between June and August for 
their annual Voice of the People survey.  They were asked for 
their views of the most important disease in their country. 
Overall, four out of every 10 (42 percent) citizens in the 
countries polled around the world mentioned cancer as the most 
threatening disease -- a concern shared in most countries, but 
not unanimously.  Twenty-seven percent rated HIV/AIDS as the 
top disease and 15 percent heart attacks and strokes.  Three 
percent rated tuberculosis highest, two percent malaria and one 
percent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, while eight percent 
rated other illnesses and four percent did not know or would 
not answer.  All five African countries included in the survey 
are amongst the first 11 that regard HIV/AIDS as the most 
important disease.  In the five African countries polled, two 
thirds of interviewees believed that HIV/AIDS was the most 
important disease facing them.  Malaria was the second most 
frequently mentioned disease in Africa and was of particular 
concern for Nigerians (35 percent) and the people of Cameroon 
(31 percent).  Source:  SAPA, December 1. 
 
Health Department Reports Increase in Number of Patients on ARV 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
5.  The number of people receiving anti-retroviral therapy in 
accredited government facilities increased from 11,250 at the 
end of August to 19,500 in October, Health Minister Manto 
Tshabalala-Msimang reported.  Treatment is available in at 
 
SIPDIS 
least one facility in 50 of the 53 districts in the country. A 
total of 103 facilities have been accredited and are providing 
care and treatment for people with HIV and AIDS.  Three centers 
have been established to detect, assess, and prevent adverse 
reaction to anti-retroviral drugs.  A center at the Medical 
University of SA focuses on the use of anti-retroviral drugs 
and traditional medicine between adolescent and adults with HIV 
and AIDS.  The second center at the Free State University deals 
with the use of anti-retroviral drugs among pregnant women and 
infants.  The University of Cape Town also serves as a 
reference center for adverse reaction to all types of medicines 
registered in the country.  At least 67 percent of all public 
health clinics were providing voluntary counseling and testing 
(VCT) services, which had increased the coverage rate. The 
number of people using VCT services had increased from 412,696 
in 2002/2003 to 690,537 in 2003/4.  The Health Department 
reported that there were now 10,000 counselors at service 
points throughout the country at the end of March 2004. Rapid 
HIV test kits were widely available at the service points to 
ensure people received results immediately.  In addition, more 
than R9.4 million ($1.6 million, using 5.7 rands per dollar) 
had been spent on communication, including newspaper, radio and 
billboard advertising, and production of information and 
educational material to support the implementation of the 
comprehensive plan.  Source:  SAPA, Health Dept Health News 
Release, November 25. 
 
Economic Costs of AIDS May Worsen 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  Although data on the extent of HIV/AIDS and its impact on 
the South African economy vary, analysts agree that government 
and businesses need to take urgent action to combat the virus. 
Already HIV/AIDS is estimated to be reducing South Africa\'s 
growth rate by a minimum of 0.3 to 0.4 percent per year. 
Forecasts of future growth show large discrepancies, however, 
as financial experts have created different mathematic models 
to calculate the consequences.  Analysts at Apt Associates 
estimated that the country\'s gross domestic product (GDP) will 
be 17 percent lower by 2010 than it would have been without 
AIDS, leading to a loss of $22 billion.  Financial analysts at 
ABSA bank, in contrast, estimate the shrinkage of GDP at 9.6 
percent by 2015, while ING Barings put the figure at only 2.8 
percent.  One of the paradoxes of the HIV epidemic in sub- 
Saharan Africa is that in the past 10 years it has not made a 
huge dent on standard macroeconomic yardsticks, such as GDP. 
This is due, in part, to the labor situation in South Africa. 
The country\'s labor surplus means that workers removed by AIDS 
can be replaced without much loss of productivity.  The World 
Bank analysis emphasizes the long-term impact of the disease on 
human capital, arguing that the damage in terms of accumulated 
loss of GDP per capita will be large, if left untreated.  This 
suggests that a country like South Africa could face 
progressive economic decline over several generations, unless 
it combats its AIDS epidemic more urgently.  By mainly taking 
the lives of young adults, AIDS seriously weakens a country\'s 
tax base; as a result, national finances will come under 
increasing pressure.  Less income from taxes will reduce the 
government\'s ability to finance public expenditures, including 
those aimed at accumulating human capital, such as education 
and public health services.  It will also have to handle severe 
financial strain in other social spending categories, such as 
grants for AIDS orphans. To balance these, the government is 
likely to raise taxes.  AIDS will create significant costs to 
business. At the company level, the pandemic poses a serious 
threat to profitability as well as competitiveness. Firms will 
have to face increasing absenteeism due to illness, funeral 
attendances and care taking of family members.  Businesses will 
also see rising expenditure on medical and pension benefits, 
loss of skilled manpower leading to disruption of production, 
as well as increases in training, recruitment and personnel 
turnover costs.  Old Mutual Healthcare, for example, estimated 
that additional healthcare costs as a result of HIV/AIDS could 
reach $3.8-billion per year by 2009.  By 2010 life expectancy 
will be 43 years, 17 years less than it would have been without 
AIDS. Analysts estimate the South African labor force will 
decline by up to 23.5 percent by 2015.  To what degree 
enterprises are affected varies between business sectors. The 
mining sector has been worst hit by the pandemic, with an AIDS 
prevalence rate among its workforce of 25 percent, closely 
followed by manufacturing with a prevalence rate of up to 19 
percent. Construction, retail and wholesale count as medium- to 
low-risk sectors.  The effects of AIDS on businesses will also 
depend on a company\'s location.  In provinces with high 
prevalence rates, such as KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, close to 
40 percent of firms indicated that AIDS already had a negative 
impact on their profits, according to Bureau for Economic 
Research. In the Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the numbers 
were 25 percent and 27 percent respectively.  HIV/AIDS is a 
risk of doing business in South Africa, right next to asset 
security, crime and exchange rate volatility, besides political 
and infrastructural risk.  Only about a quarter of the 
country\'s businesses -- mainly large corporations -- have 
workplace policies in place. Small and medium-sized firms often 
the lack human and financial resources to implement an AIDS 
plan.  Source:  Mail and Guardian, November 26. 
 
Telkom HIV/AIDS Prevalence Rate Expected to Peak at 11.4 
Percent 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
7.  Telkom, the telecommunications parastatal, expects its 
HIV/AIDS rate among employees to peak at 11.4 percent in 2006, 
with the company\'s current HIV/AIDS prevalence rate at 9.6 
percent.  Telkom\'s introduction of antiretroviral treatment, 
which started in October, is part of an integrated health 
management strategy to manage health risks and invest in human 
capital.  Telkom had allocated R8 million ($1.4 million) in the 
current financial year for the management of HIV/AIDS.  The 
company is offering a voluntary counseling, testing and 
treatment (VCT) program, which offers employees around the 
country access to a range of HIV/AIDS related services in 
absolute privacy and confidentiality.  Telkom does not have 
access to details of an employee\'s HIV and AIDS status unless 
he or she voluntarily discloses the information. The first 
phase of Telkom\'s VCT program ended in October, during which 
2,504 employees were tested. The second phase is currently 
running until March next year with a target of 10,000.  Source:

Correctional Services Conducts HIV Survey in Prisons 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  The Department of Correctional Services announced that a 
national survey of prison inmates to determine HIV/AIDS 
prevalence is now in the preparation phase, with a task team 
and steering committee established.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS 
will be ascertained by extrapolation from a sample. The 2003/04 
annual report of the judicial inspectorate of prisons, 
described HIV/AIDS in prisons as a \"major problem\". The report 
noted that about 58 percent of prisoners were men below the age 
of 30, who were more sexually active and prone to take risks 
than older men.  The report found that natural deaths were 
rising and the increase could be \"fairly attributed\" to 
HIV/AIDS and the opportunistic diseases that followed. Natural 
deaths rose by 584 percent from 1995 to 2000, with 1087 deaths 
in 2000 and 1683 in 2003.  Seven months ago an AIDS directorate 
was established focusing on care and support, prevention and 
treatment.  The Department of Correctional Services was 
conducting a baseline study of the number of offenders 
currently using ARVs in prisons, with preliminary results 
expected in early December.  Source:  SAPA, December 1. 
 
HIV/AIDS Budgets for National and Provincial Government 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
9.  Government commitment to HIV/AIDS funding only really 
materialized in 2000 with the introduction of special 
conditional grants, according to Alison Hickey, manager of 
Idasa\'s AIDS Budget Unit.  Before 2000, the AIDS budget was 
minimal.  The 2004/5 national budget shows a serious commitment 
to making financial resources available for the new ARV 
treatment programs.  National Treasury has specifically 
allocated R1.439 billion ($250 million) for HIV/AIDS programs 
and services in this year.  This is seven times what was set 
aside to fight HIV/AIDS in 2000/1. However, HIV/AIDS funds 
still constitute less than 1 percent of the total budget. 
Money for ARV treatment is sent to provinces via conditional 
grants. However, Hickey is concerned that provinces such as the 
Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga may struggle to spend their grants. 
\"For those provinces with weaker financial and project 
management skills, absorption capacity could well be the 
primary obstacle to roll-out,\" she says.  One of the weaknesses 
in the national Department of Health identified by the Auditor 
General is its inability to monitor conditional grants 
properly.  A new clause in the Division of Revenue Bill allows 
unspent HIV/AIDS grants to be relocated to better-performing 
provinces.  Researcher Hein Marais found that the Western Cape, 
Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga did not allocate any funds 
specifically for HIV/AIDS in 1998.  Gauteng was the only 
province to allocate a substantial sum, with R49 million 
allocated across all its departments and R4 million set aside 
for NGOs.  Source:  Health E-News, November 28. 
 
Provincial Progress on Implementing Government\'s HIV/AIDS 
Treatment Plan 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
10.  North West Province 
Provincial Health Department has allocated close to R50 million 
for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), prevention of 
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and sexually transmitted 
infections.  The high AIDS prevalence rate (29.9 percent) has 
led to more rapid implementation of the treatment plan, with 
more than 5,000 new patients coming to the 3 available service 
points and more than 1,000 patients being treated.  The 
provincial health department was allocated R70 million for the 
HIV/AIDS program, including R29 million for ARVs. 
Gauteng 
Nineteen hospitals in the province are now providing ARV drugs 
and the province plans to expand the program to 80 facilities 
by 2009.  By November 5, 49,268 people have been assessed, of 
whom 5,588 adult and 800 children received ARVs.  2002 records 
indicate that 54 percent of people between 15 and 34 years of 
age admitted to state hospitals were infected with HIV. 
Limpopo 
Limpopo has the third lowest (17.5 percent) HIV prevalence rate 
in the country.  Since October, more than 2,000 patients have 
been assessed, with 300 adults and 40 children on ARV 
treatment.  The province has eight treatment sites and by April 
2005, will introduce the ARV treatment program to 30 district 
hospitals and 22 community health centers.  The province has 
R80 million for the AIDS program during the 2004 financial year 
and R120 million for next year. 
Northern Cape 
The provincial treatment program started three months ago and 
now has 1,200 patients qualified for ARV treatment with 250 
patients registered for treatment.  Approximately 500 patients 
with more than a CD4-count of 200 have been assessed.  R31.8 
billion has been allocated for the AIDS program this year. 
Eastern Cape 
The province launched its treatment program in May and 2,000 
patients, 135 of them children, are receiving treatment at 11 
sites.  R40 million has been allocated and about R22.6 million 
has been spent on ARV treatment in the 2004 fiscal year.  A 
regional training center, funded by the Department of Health, 
Columbia University and CDC, provides HIV/AIDS training to 
health care professionals.  So far, 1,000 have received 
training. 
Western Cape 
The province has 31 treatment sites, a total HIV/AIDS budget of 
R119 million, of which R29 million is a grant from the Global 
Fund.  The province estimates that about 12,000 people need ARV 
treatment and so far about 5,500, of which 1,000 are children, 
are receiving ARVs.  The Western Cape has the lowest HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate of 13.1 percent. 
Free State 
In October, the number of patients on treatment was 250, much 
lower than the March 2005 target of 2,127; however its goals of 
providing 5 treatment sites have been reached.  A budget of R30 
million has been allocated for 2004 and R50 million for next 
year.  For next year, an additional 16 sites providing ARV 
treatment are planned. 
Mpumalanga 
The province currently has eight ARV treatment sites, though 
the national Department of Health declared in October that the 
province had 12.  R 67 million was allocated to the AIDS 
program this financial year and the province will likely not 
reach its target of 1,934 patients on ARV treatment by March 
2005.  Currently Mpumalanga is treating 378 patients compared 
to 130 patients in July. 
KwaZulu-Natal 
KZN has the highest AIDS prevalence rate at 38 percent and will 
likely not meet its March 2005 target of 20,000 patients on 
treatment.  The province is currently treating 3,247 adults and 
167 children at 31 sites.  A further 16 sites have been 
recommended for accreditation by the national advisers.  A 
conditional grant of R64 million is available for the ARV 
treatment program.  Source:  Mail&Guardian, November 26 to

SA\'s Labor Force Declines with HIV/AIDS, Discouragement Impacts 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
10.  South Africa\'s labor force has declined over the past few 
years, probably because more people have given up looking for 
work or are infected with HIV, says a new report in the South 
African Reserve Bank\'s Labor Market Frontiers report.  South 
Africa\'s labor force participation rate, which counts the 
number of people working and actively seeking work as a 
proportion of the total population, has dropped to 54.1 percent 
in September 2003, down from 58.9 percent in September 2000. 
Official figures from Statistics SA show that unemployment 
dropped to 4.6 million in September 2003 from 5.3 million in 
March 2003, based on the narrow definition of unemployment, 
where an individual had been actively seeking work prior to the 
survey.  The drop in unemployment was not matched by an 
increase in total employment over that period, with more people 
dropping out of the labor market.  The number of discouraged 
job seekers increased the unemployed figure to more than 8 
million.  The Bank\'s report stated that job seekers were 
discouraged because of the slim chances of finding a job, or 
because they lacked funds to search actively for work.  Another 
likely cause for a drop in labor market participation was the 
effect of HIV/AIDS.  The report points to research that shows a 
drop in HIV/AIDS prevalence among younger people in their 
twenties, and an increase in higher age groups, making up most 
of the labor force.  The report also assesses whether social 
grants have a negative incentive on labor force participation, 
but found mixed results.  Some studies show that pension 
payments cause an indirect effect of withdrawal from the labor 
market.  However, other studies show that a child support grant 
could result in higher labor force participation.  Source:

SUBJECT: UNAIDS/UNOCHA Consultation on HIV/AIDS and 
Humanitarian Response in Africa 6-8 October 2004 
 
 
Summary 
 
1. The worldwide increase of natural disasters and 
complex emergencies, complicated by rising cases of 
HIV/AIDS continue to disproportionably affect sub- 
Saharan Africa. Correspondingly, there is a growing 
recognition that humanitarian action must respond 
to this dual challenge. UNAIDS and OCHA regional 
offices in Johannesburg organised a regional 
technical consultation on \"HIV/AIDS and 
Humanitarian Response in Africa: Putting Theory 
into Practice\" from 6-8 October 2004 in 
Johannesburg, South Africa. Over sixty people 
attended representing U.N agencies, NGOs, donors 
and others. USAID/OFDA and USAID\'s Regional 
HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) staff attended to learn how 
OFDA could respond to HIV/AIDS in emergencies via 
all sectors. After the consultation, OFDA staff 
travelled to Lesotho to visit agricultural projects 
that have HIV/AIDS components. 
 
Background 
 
2.  Earlier this year, the U.N. Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee\'s (IASC) published the \"Guidelines for HIV/AIDS 
Intervention in Emergencies Settings\" to help individuals 
and organizations in their efforts to address the special 
needs of HIV-infected and HIV-affected people living in 
emergency situations.  The guidelines include activities 
that should be accomplished in ten different sectors and 
in three phases of an emergency:  emergency preparedness; 
minimum response (to be conducted in the acute phase); 
and comprehensive response (conducted in the post-acute 
phase). 
 
3. In order to ensure effective implementation of the 
Guidelines, the regional offices of UNAIDS and OCHA in 
Johannesburg performed an HIV/AIDS mapping assessment in 
southern Africa based on the IASC guidelines and 
circulated the results to UN Country teams in the sub- 
region. The aim was to:  1) raise awareness around 
HIV/AIDS and humanitarian response; and 2) initiate an in- 
country process of mapping existing HIV/AIDS related 
interventions within humanitarian planning and 
programming. Similar mapping exercises are planned for 
West and East Africa. 
 
4. Equipped with both leadership and practical 
tools, the next step was to sponsor a regional 
forum with the following objectives:  1) to share 
and compile country and sub regional experiences on 
policies, practices and lessons learned; 2) to 
examine key technical issues around the 
implementation of HIV/AIDS interventions in 
humanitarian planning and programming; and 3) to 
propose the establishment of an interagency 
regional/sub-regional network to mobilize, support 
and coordinate technical and financial support. 
This technical consultation took place in October 
and over sixty people attended representing U.N 
agencies, NGOs, donors and others. 
\"HIV/AIDS and Humanitarian Response in Africa: 
Putting Theory into Practice\" 
 
5. The consultation consisted of presentations and 
discussions ranging from HIV/AIDS policy 
considerations in humanitarian response, HIV/AIDS 
in humanitarian planning, HIV/AIDS interventions in 
humanitarian programming, the role of sub-regional 
and regional coordination, and the identification 
of a mechanism to implement the actions identified. 
 
6. Discussions were held on numerous issues but 
definitive answers were not always agreed upon. The 
issue of low vs. high prevalence rates was raised 
and whether the interventions should vary. For 
example, HIV/AIDS in southern Africa is considered 
by some to be \"the\" emergency. Most of the 
countries in the region have HIV prevalence rates 
of over 20%; and with HIV/AIDS further diminishing 
people\'s coping strategies, the effect has erased 
many of the developmental gains made over the last 
30 years. Participants also noted that there were 
different definitions of low and high prevalence 
being used by various donor and UN agencies, and 
that IASC Guidelines did not differentiate or 
prioritize based on prevalence rates.   Concerns 
were also expressed over the effectiveness of 
separating development and humanitarian agendas to 
respond to HIV/AIDS given the limited response 
through the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) for 
such activities. One issue that did have an answer 
was the relationship between conflict and the 
increase in HIV infections. The common assumption 
was that this was true. However, Paul Spiegel, an 
epidemiologist at UNHCR has found that the data 
does not always support this assumption. This issue 
highlighted the need for common indicators and 
methodologies when collecting and analyzing data. 
 
Consultation Conclusions and Outcomes 
 
7.  A process for information sharing on HIV/AIDS and 
emergencies including tools, best practices, etc will be 
explored through IRIN/Plus News. The IASC Task Force on 
HIV/AIDS and Emergencies is encouraged to continue its 
work and explore recommendations with regards to 
preparedness planning and assessments. It was widely 
believed that the IASC Task Force on HIV/AIDS and 
Emergencies should be merged with the IASC Task Force on 
Gender Based Violence and information sharing with 
affected countries be strengthened. 
 
8. Mobilizing resources can be accomplished by creating a 
forum for donors to share policies and approaches that 
will attempt to ensure harmonization on funding 
eligibility for HIV/AIDS interventions in emergencies. 
 
9. In conclusion, the meeting highlighted the 
critical need to engage leadership within 
governments and relevant organizations including 
the UN and NGOs to address HIV/AIDS in emergency 
settings and to refocus humanitarian response in 
view of the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS. 
Participants acknowledged the large amounts of 
money being spent for HIV/AIDS by the President\'s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the 
Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM) and 
World Bank Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP), 
as well as the need to get them involved in 
HIV/AIDS in humanitarian response.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  In October 2004, the National Department 
of Agriculture (NDA) published amendments to the current 
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Act, to bring it in 
line with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; public 
comments were requested by November 19, but it is unclear 
how quickly the NDA will follow up.  Environmental laws put 
into effect in 2004 have the potential to make the GMO 
approval process slower and more cumbersome.  Government 
officials are particularly concerned with potential 
requirements for environmental impact assessments, along 
with the prospective role of the Minister of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism and the South Africa National 
Biodiversity Institute.  On the good news front, the 
Department of Science & Technology continues to support 
biotech programs, local courts continue to uphold protection 
of business confidential information in GMO applications and 
a regional group is pursuing biotech projects as well, with 
South Africa to host its center of excellence.  End summary. 
 
Amendments to GMO Act 
--------------------- 
 
2.(SBU) Further to post\'s April biotech policy update (Ref 
D), the SAG\'s National Department of Agriculture (NDA) 
decided to amend its Genetically Modified Organisms Act 
(introduced in 1997, promulgated in 1999) directly, rather 
than make changes to the implementing regulations.  In 
October 2004, the NDA published its draft amendments to 
bring the Act in line with the Cartagena Protocol for 
Biosafety (CPB).  Public comments were requested by November 
19, 2004 and it is not clear how and when the NDA will 
respond to the comments.  Parliament eventually will have to 
approve the amended law.  The amendments appear overall to 
be reasonable, except for a few concerns noted below (paras 
3-4). 
 
3. (SBU) Under the current GMO Act, the Executive Council 
responsible for making regulatory decisions consists of 
eight members: one representative from six government 
departments (Agriculture, Science & Technology, Health, 
Environmental Affairs & Tourism, Trade & Industry, and 
Labor), the chair of the Advisory Committee that provides 
scientific and technical analysis of risk assessment data, 
and the GMO Registrar, an official from NDA responsible for 
administering the Act.  The draft amendments expand the 
Council to 10 members, adding representatives from the 
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and the Department 
of Arts and Culture.  The contribution to be made by the 
latter is not evident to us, and officials from Department 
of Science & Technology told EmbOffs on December 3 that they 
shared this concern. 
 
4. (U) The amendments also make conflicting references to 
the need for an \"environmental assessment\" and an 
\"environmental impact assessment,\" and the assessment is not 
clearly defined.  DST officials told EmbOffs they raised 
this concern and requested clarification from NDA.  An APHIS 
expert who spent 10 weeks in Pretoria as Embassy Science 
Fellow also noted that added requirements to notify the 
CPB\'s Biosafety Clearinghouse in the event of an accident 
appear to go beyond the provisions of the CPB. 
 
Various stakeholders respond 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The GMO amendments mention opportunities for public 
comment, but this did not appear to satisfy anti-GMO 
activists.  Anti-GMO lobby group BioWatch\'s 19-page 
submission of highly negative comments can be found online 
at www.biowatch.org.za/Amendment_Bill_comments_V _Final.doc. 
BioWatch calls the SAG\'s approach \"narrow, non-consultative\" 
and the proposed amendments \"poorly drafted and wholly 
inadequate.\"  The group demands that the SAG apply a 
precautionary approach and urges a new process that allows 
much greater public participation in determining GMO policy 
and redrafting the GMO Act.  It also urges public 
Parliamentary hearings and debates on GMO policy and 
legislation. 
 
6. (U) Local press reported comments on the amendments from 
the anti-GMO Centre for Biosafety director, Mariam Mayet: 
\"They do not fully implement the Biosafety Protocol, 
perpetuate the lack of transparency (in the act), will 
expedite the trade in GMOs, make it easier for the 
biotechnology industry to conduct field trials and appear to 
open up a hitherto closed door to human gene therapy.\" 
Mayet also expressed concerns about proposed amendments that 
allow the GMO registrar to \"fast-track\" permits without the 
approval of the national Executive Council.  The NDA\'s 
manager for genetic resource management, Julian Jaftha, 
clarified to the media that fast-track approvals only 
applied to the extension of previously-granted approvals. 
 
7. (SBU) Pro-biotech AfricaBio shared its comments with 
EmbOffs.  AfricaBio noted broadly that the CPB pertains only 
to Living Modified Organisms, and the amendments do not 
always adhere to the provisions, wording and scope of the 
Protocol.  AfricaBio also does not support the specific 
addition of two persons with knowledge of ecological matters 
(and a \"non-prejudiced position\" on GMOs) to the Advisory 
Committee that reviews applications and provides technical 
advice to the Executive Council members.  It notes that 
specific expertise has not been singled out for other 
members in the Advisory Committee and suggests alternative 
language that allows greater flexibility in determining 
composition of the Committee.  AfricaBio also questioned the 
addition of Department of Arts and Culture to the Executive 
Council. 
 
Environmental official\'s perspective on biosafety policy 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
8. (SBU) A seasoned official from Department of 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism told EST Officer on 
December 3 that the next six months will be critical for 
SA\'s policies on biosafety, as the amended GMO Act and 
environmental regulations are finalized and new personnel 
appointments are made.  DEAT recently advertised for a new 
Director of Biosafety to improve its extremely limited 
capacity.  The DEAT official said that this appointment 
could \"go either way\" and may be awarded to an individual 
with strong anti-GMO leanings.  Many senior DEAT officials 
are susceptible to influence by what the official termed 
\"the greens.\"  When EST Officer noted the recent statements 
of DEAT Director General Chippy Olver in support of the 
SAG\'s GMO policies (Ref C), the DEAT official termed these 
comments as \"atypical\" for Olver. 
 
9. (SBU) Recently-enacted environmental legislation may have 
negative impacts on the GMO approval process.   The National 
Biodiversity Act, which was signed into law in June 2004 and 
effective as of September 1, gives significant powers to the 
Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism on biosafety 
issues.  The law states, \"If the Minister has reason to 
believe that the release of a genetically modified organism 
into the environment under a permit applied for in terms of 
the Genetically Modified Organisms Act, 1997, may pose a 
threat to any indigenous species or the environment, no 
permit for such release may be issued in terms of that Act 
unless an environmental assessment has been conducted...\" 
under provisions of other legislation on Environmental 
Impact Assessments (EIA, see para 10 below).    The Act does 
not define \"environmental assessment.\"  In giving special 
powers to the Minister, the provision does not appear to be 
consistent with the GMO Act (which gives similar powers to 
an Executive Council on which DEAT is represented) and could 
create grounds for appeal of all GMO regulatory decisions, 
effectively slowing down-or grinding to a complete halt--the 
GMO approval process. 
 
10. (SBU) Amendments to the National Environmental 
Management Act intended to strengthen environmental 
compliance and enforcement have led to the revamping of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment process.  The DEAT official 
told EST Officer that under new EIA rules being developed, 
GMO approvals were going to be required to have full-fledged 
environmental impact assessments.  The official intervened 
personally to convince DEAT colleagues to change from the 
onerous requirement for an EIA to requiring an \"initial 
assessment\" (Note: the IA is more equivalent to the 
environmental assessment in the U.S.) for GMO approvals. 
 
11.  (SBU) Officials at DEAT as well as DST told EmbOffs 
they had concerns about the role and capacity of the 
recently-established South African National Biodiversity 
Institute (Ref B) to provide timely, science-based risk 
analysis of biodiversity impacts from GMO products.  The new 
Biodiversity Act directs SANBI to \"monitor and report 
regularly to the Minister on the impacts of any genetically 
modified organism that has been released into the 
environment, including the impact on non-target organisms 
and ecological processes, indigenous biological resources 
and the biological diversity of species used for 
agriculture.\"  However, the SAG is not providing resources 
to enable SANBI to develop the capacity to carry out this 
mandate. 
 
Positive developments on biosafety, biotech policy 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
12. (U) The Department of Science & Technology continues to 
provide strong program support for biotechnology.  In August 
2004, Minister of Science & Technology Mosibudi Mangena 
reiterated his Department\'s commitment to a platform for 
biotechnology research, development and commercialization 
(Note: this was incorrectly reported in the media as a \"new\" 
initiative; it was first time the new Minister has discussed 
his department\'s biotech programs, which have been in place 
since early 2003, see Refs E, F. End note). 
 
13. (SBU) PlantBio, South Africa\'s fourth biotechnology 
innovation center--and the first with a national scope and 
an exclusive focus on plant biotechnology--was officially 
launched in October 2004.  DST sources tells us that 
PlantBio has already received many strong project proposals, 
but current funding levels are limited to R 9 million (USD 
1.6 million at USD = R5.7).  Three biotech regional 
innovation centers in Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu 
Natal provinces are actively engaged in funding research and 
related projects to bring biotech to the market, working in 
close cooperation with government-supported biotech 
incubators that support the efforts of fledgling biotech 
companies. 
 
14. (SBU) In mid-November, New Partnership for African 
Development (NEPAD) S&T representatives held a regional 
workshop of representatives of countries from southern 
Africa (including from South Africa\'s DST) to discuss 
potential projects.  Professor Aggrey Ambali, a new NEPAD 
BioSciences advisor who hails from Malawi and will work with 
NEPAD Science & Technology Adviser John Mugabe, discussed 
biotech programs in the Southern African region with country 
representatives.  DST sources told EST Officer that the 
group decided that South Africa\'s Council on Scientific and 
Industrial Research (CSIR) will host a center of excellence 
in the NEPAD southern sub-region, to screen project 
proposals and make research awards.  The Canadian 
International Development Agency is providing financial 
support for establishing a network of excellence in 
biotechnology and genomics, including these regional centers 
of excellence.  Comment: The development of sub-regional 
program areas within NEPAD in the biosciences provide a 
positive and functional alternative to the Southern African 
Development Community, which has taken a strong 
precautionary approach to biotech and GMOs, influenced more 
by politics than science.  End comment. 
 
15. (SBU) South African courts have consistently, if slowly, 
ruled in favor of the NDA and the South African government 
in cases brought by BioWatch and other anti-GMO groups 
demanding access to business proprietary information used in 
GMO approval assessments and appealing government GMO permit 
decisions.

1. (U) Summary. Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel was the 
guest of honor at the 60th anniversary conference of the 
Bureau for Economic Research (BER), a well respected South 
African think tank.  Manuel reflected on progress made since 
the Growth, Employment, and Reconstruction (GEAR) plan was 
launched.  While the economic policies of the 1990\'s were 
\"distastefully Washingtonian,\" he said, \"in retrospect, they 
were the right ones to pursue.\"  Today, he thought that 
fiscal and monetary policy was on a stable platform, foreign 
exchange management strong, the inflation trajectory under 
control, and the government was able to focus more on skills 
development and reversing past discriminatory social policy. 
Looking to the future, Manuel explained that while public 
sector debt and investment would account for an increasing 
share of the economy, public sector leadership would also 
foster more robust economic growth.  He said that now policy 
makers should start looking qualitatively at redesigning the 
country\'s rural and urban landscape.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Introduced as the longest serving Finance Minister in 
the world, Trevor Manuel was the guest of honor at the 60th 
anniversary conference of the Bureau for Economic Research 
(BER) held in Stellenbosch on November 18.  He took the 
opportunity to reflect on how far South Africa had come in 
the nine years that he had been finance minister, and where 
the country now needed to go.  The tone of the half-day 
conference was decidedly upbeat, as the four speakers who 
preceded Manuel acknowledged newly found stability in the 
economy and strong growth indicators, but decried the ill 
effects of an overvalued currency on job creation and the 
export sector.  Had South African Reserve Bank (SARB) 
Governor Tito Mboweni participated as planned, the conference 
might have focused more on the differences between National 
Treasury and the SARB when it came to the impact that 
interest rates had on the exchange rate.  Former Monetary 
Policy Committee member and now SARB Senior Consultant for 
Research Bernie de Jager replaced Mboweni at the last minute. 
 Other speakers included BER Director Ben Smit and Rand 
Merchant Bank Chief Economist Rudolph Gouws. 
 
The Road Traveled 
----------------- 
 
3. (U) Manuel began his talk by reflecting on progress made 
since the Growth, Employment, and Reconstruction (GEAR) plan 
was launched in 1996.  The fiscal challenges that the country 
faced then included modernizing the tax system and growing 
the tax base, stabilizing the fiscal budget, deepening the 
country\'s debt markets, controlling inflation, and investing 
in growth and development.  He paused to explain that right 
when the government was making some progress in 2001, it had 
to respond to a speculative attack on the rand.  Today, he 
mused, \"A little less market confidence in the rand might be 
a welcome relief.\" 
 
4. (U) While the economic policies of the 1990\'s were 
\"distastefully Washingtonian,\" he said, \"in retrospect, they 
were the right ones to pursue.\"  Today, the country\'s fiscal 
and monetary policies were on a stable platform, foreign 
exchange management strong, the inflation trajectory under 
control, and the government is focused on skills development 
and reversing past discriminatory social policy.  He claimed 
that policy makers in OECD couldn\'t believe how quickly and 
successfully South Africa had taken decisions to open its 
market to trade and investment.  \"The hold up in WTO was 
about the reality in South Africa.\" He stressed, \"What we did 
in the 1990\'s is what is now so hard for others to accept\" in 
WTO Doha Development Agenda negotiations. 
 
Looking Toward The Future: Growth and Development 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (U) Manuel said that there was encouraging evidence of an 
increase in pace of economic growth and along with it job 
creation.  Alluding to 5.6% annualized GDP growth in Q3, 
Manuel said that \"the economy was really pumping at the 
moment\" and that finally unemployment had begun to fall. 
Referring to objectives outlined in the Mid Term Budget 
Policy Review (Ref A), Manuel declared that the government 
could now turn more of its attention toward accelerating the 
growth rate of investment in productive activities, improving 
economic participation of the marginalized population, 
raising the level of human development (e.g., skills 
training), improving the effectiveness of government, and 
entering into regional and international partnerships that 
supported South African growth and development. 
 
The Role of Public Sector Investment 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) Noting with pleasure that public sector investment had 
grown 19% in 2003 and another 21% so far in 2004, Manuel 
reaffirmed that the government intended to increase this 
further as it pursued major infrastructure projects, 
including the port, rail, power, telecommunications, and 
water projects.  Much would be funded from the bond markets 
-- good news for bond traders, said Manuel.  While public 
sector debt would grow under this scenario, so would the 
economy, and this should mitigate any rise in the debt to GDP 
ratio.  Manuel explained that while public sector debt and 
investment would account for an increasing share of the 
economy, public sector leadership should also foster robust 
economic growth. 
 
Redesigning the Urban Landscape 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) \"Still a Cape housing activist at heart,\" Manuel said 
that he had started asking questions about in which types of 
cities did South Africa want its children to live, work, and 
play.  While roads, electricity, water, sewage, and housing 
had kept pace with a changing society, he confessed that the 
quality of life in low income and poor areas was bleak -- 
littered with townships of the apartheid variety and 
formalized squatter communities that warehoused human beings 
to labor in nearby first world cities.  Manuel believed that 
South Africa had to redevelop its urban landscape, to 
reconnect these communities with commercial and industrial 
areas that surrounded them, or develop growing commercial 
zones and recreational areas where there were none to bring 
jobs closer to living areas.  Moreover, cities needed to 
provide affordable and efficient services -- such as power, 
water, transport, and banking.  The country suffered from the 
distorted spatial planning of the past, and now Manuel felt 
policy makers could start thinking more qualitatively than 
quantitatively. 
 
8. (U) Manuel confessed that the situation was not helped by 
the fact that the country had reorganized itself into 284 
wall-to-wall municipalities, sometimes creating a tremendous 
mismatch between revenue capability and budget needs.  This, 
he said, was the starting point for a new fiscal policy, but 
he did not elaborate.  He only said that the National 
Treasury was looking at ways to deepen municipal financing 
going forward. 
 
Redesigning the Rural Landscape 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Manuel said that South Africans also had to start 
thinking about their rural landscape, one that had also been 
distorted and fragmented by apartheid.  He reiterated a point 
that he made in his October budget policy statement, that the 
first order of business would be to resolve outstanding land 
restitution claims (i.e., claims by citizens who had their 
land confiscated by the state after June 19, 1913).  This 
would free up budget and bureaucratic resources to start on 
land redistribution -- \"which had broad implications,\" he 
said, \"but need not loom large.\"  Manuel said that land 
restitution and redistribution would continue for a long 
time, and new land coming into agricultural production might 
even become an important area for economic growth.  In the 
years ahead, he said that there would be a shift in both 
public and private financing of rural agriculture.  He 
thought that land redistribution needed to be more 
self-financing, but that once land had changed hands, the 
state had a crucial role to provide support through programs 
such as the Comprehensive Agriculture Support Program.  He 
also suggested that the Land Bank should diversify its client 
base and extend more credit to rural farmers for things like 
water management and irrigation, and international trade. 
 
Why not Mzansi Life and Health Insurance? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) Manuel commented that he was very pleased with the 
launch of the Mzansi bank accounts to make banking more 
affordable and more available to the poor.  He confessed that 
sometimes he did not understand how capitalists worked.  \"Why 
did it take so long for the banking community to come up with 
the idea of bringing new, low-income customers into the 
market?\" he asked, after recounting how he had just heard on 
the radio that the newly created Mzansi account had already 
attracted 100,000 new customers to the formal banking sector. 
 The government welcomed private sector contributions that 
had a social purpose, he said.  Now, he challenged, \"Why not 
Mzansi life and health insurance?\"

SUBJECT: TRI-PARTITE ALLIANCE INFIGHTING HEATS UP 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary: Recent harsh and public disagreements 
between President Mbeki and the Congress of South African 
Trade Unions (COSATU) over Zimbabwe, Black Economic 
Empowerment, and COSATU\'s political role have highlighted 
long-simmering tensions within the ruling alliance.  In the 
near term, these tensions will likely dissipate as soon as 
cooler heads prevail.  Differences will become harder to 
reconcile in the future, however, when a younger generation 
of leaders, who lack cross-cutting allegiances and memories 
of the struggle, come to the fore.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Several issues over the past two months have 
fostered rancor between COSATU and the ANC.  First was the 
late October expulsion of a COSATU delegation from Zimbabwe. 
Rather than defend COSATU and its right to observe how 
Zimbabwe\'s political and economic situation has affected its 
sister labor organizations, President Mbeki condemned 
COSATU\'s trip as unsanctioned political adventurism and 
accused the organization of meddling in the political arena. 
A second area of contention was the government\'s early 
November announcement that it was awarding a 15% stake to a 
black empowerment consortium that included ANC heavyweight 
and spokesman Smuts Ngonyama as an advisor.  COSATU blasted 
the deal both out of opposition to the principle of 
privatizing Telkom\'s services but also because it reeked of 
political cronyism. 
 
3.  (U)  Rhetoric on both sides turned even more pointed 
after Archbishop Desmond Tutu\'s late November lecture in 
which he accused the President of fostering a culture of 
political sycophancy within the ANC and attacked Black 
Economic Empowerment for helping only a small black elite. 
COSATU Secretary General Zwelinzima Vavi echoed similar 
sentiments, leading Ngonyama to call Vavi \"highly reckless 
and highly impetuous.\"  This in turn led COSATU to issue a 
public statement that the alliance is not working properly 
and assert that it has every right to participate in 
political discussions, with COSATU President Willie Madisha 
saying, \"...we are not an extension of a political party.  We 
are an independent COSATU.\"  COSATU spokesmen meanwhile told 
the Consul General in Johannesburg and Laboff that they 
believed Ngonyama\'s dual status as ANC spokesman and 
principal beneficiary of the Telkom BEE deal may have added 
to the shrillness of the ANC\'s criticism and proved their 
contention that the mixing of politics with private business 
interests was not in the public interest.  Both sides say 
they are likely to meet soon to thrash out their differences, 
although no date has been set and the public arguments 
continue. 
 
4.  (U)  The third member of the alliance, the South African 
Communist Party (SACP) has largely been quiet in this debate, 
except for calling on both sides to settle their differences 
and lending support to COSATU for its Zimbabwe visit. 
However, earlier this week SACP Deputy Secretary General 
Jeremy Cronin confirmed that the party will consider 
proposals to mount independent electoral challenges rather 
than run its candidates under an ANC banner.  Cronin noted 
that while there were no guarantees that any proposals for 
autonomy would be adopted, the issue was a legitimate one to 
discuss and that there was nothing \"dissident or inherently 
disloyal\" about it. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PROMINENT ANC ACADEMIC SEES MORE SMOKE THAN FIRE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Emboffs last week met with Raymond Suttner, an 
academic and longtime ANC insider, to discuss the latest 
cleavages in the alliance.  Suttner, a member of the SACP 
since 1971, spent nearly 10 years in prison during the 1970s 
and 1980s for his political activities as well as a 
significant portion of time underground.  After the ANC was 
unbanned, he was elected to the party\'s decisionmaking 
National Executive Committee in 1991.  He later served as a 
member of Parliament from 1994 to 1997 and then Ambassador to 
Sweden from 1997 until 2001.  Since that time he has focused 
largely on academic pursuits, publishing several articles 
about the history of the ANC and the alliance. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Although he claimed to be out of step with current 
goings-on within the alliance, Suttner brought up several 
salient points relating to the state of the alliance today. 
First and foremost, Suttner stated that while the ANC has 
always been committed to multipartyism and the concept of the 
alliance, the party (and Mbeki in particular) does not 
appreciate campaigns outside its structures, like COSATU\'s 
trip to Zimbabwe.  Such acts are viewed as politically 
undisciplined and fly in the face of the culture of 
cooperation and consensus that are key to alliance unity. 
Furthermore, while the alliance is ostensibly a partnership, 
the ANC clearly sees itself as first among equals, which 
exacerbates tensions with COSATU and the SACP. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Despite these tensions, however, Suttner thought 
the latest round of infighting, while noteworthy for its 
harsh rhetoric, was likely to be a tempest in a teapot. 
Suttner noted that senior members of the three organizations 
all have cross-cutting allegiances and identities-for 
example, a SACP member does not only view himself in those 
terms, but also takes into account relationships forged 
during the struggle while underground, in prison, or in a 
group like the United Democratic Front.  Older members who 
have these complex relationships are concerned about the 
state of the alliance and will likely work to ensure that 
this latest round of infighting does not escalate further. 
Besides, the three sides need one another-the ANC needs the 
membership base and left-wing credentials of its partners, 
while the SACP and COSATU rely on the ANC\'s political clout. 
Suttner was convinced that saner heads would prevail before 
something irreparable occurred. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Suttner\'s concern, however, was what happens once 
the older generation leaves the scene.  Many people, he said, 
are joining the ANC nowadays in large part for the internal 
connections that membership brings, such as jobs and 
contracts.  Few of these newcomers remember the struggle-era 
linkages that forged the alliance in the first place, and it 
is Suttner\'s worry that in the future, younger leaders will 
be more hesitant to compromise, potentially putting the 
alliance in grave danger.  Still, he thought such a situation 
was still a few years out in the future and that the alliance 
would in the meantime remain alive, if not as robust as it 
once was. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Comment: While COSATU is prepared to make peace 
with the ANC, it also has announced its intention of 
returning to Zimbabwe in late January to complete the 
fact-finding mission it aborted in October.  If the ANC 
decides not to support this visit, another spat is likely to 
occur.  Another disagreement may also happen within the next 
six months, when the Telkom shares currently held by the 
government workers\' pension fund are to be sold to the BEE 
consortium.  Should the shares have declined in value, both 
COSATU and other trade unions representing the government 
workers are likely to criticize the SAG and ANC.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  South Africa recognizes, supports and 
protects Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
 
REF:  A) PRETORIA 4519; B) 03 PRETORIA 1904 
 
1.  Summary.  South Africa continues to support the 
protection and development of Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems (IKS) through a variety of government and 
private efforts.  In the late 1990s, the new South 
African Government encouraged deeper investigation 
into IKS through research projects and surveys.  The 
Department of Science and Technology (DST) funds a 
variety of IKS research projects and has also 
established a unit to coordinate the programs.  DST, 
in collaboration with research institutions, 
universities, traditional healers, private companies 
and local communities formulated a national IKS 
policy, which provides IKS with legal recognition and 
protection.  Several stakeholders are establishing 
partnerships to utilize IKS for broader economic and 
social development.  Constructive and potentially 
significant partnerships have also emerged between 
western-trained scientists and traditional healers. 
End summary. 
 
Revival of IKS in South Africa 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  Indigenous knowledge (IK) is local, often 
community-based knowledge unique to traditional 
cultures and societies.  IK is used in agriculture, 
education, natural resource management, health care 
and numerous other activities.  This report reviews 
the increasing interest in Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems (IKS) in South Africa and highlights policy 
and program activities of key players in IKS.  The 
consensus among IKS experts is that the former chair 
of the parliamentary portfolio committee on Arts, 
Culture, Science, Language and Technology, Dr. Wally 
Serote, is the \"father of IKS\" in South Africa. 
During his tenure in parliament Serote called on 
government and research institutions to recognize the 
significance of IKS and challenged them to develop 
mechanisms to protect it.  Dr. Serote argued that IK 
needed to be explored further to determine its 
contribution to local development and its future 
potential.  According to Dr. Serote, appropriate 
recognition of IKS will contribute to the broader 
development of the African continent. 
 
3.  Serote urged western-trained intellectuals to 
acknowledge IKS in spite of its possibly unfamiliar 
fundamentals, references or logic.    He argued that 
science and technology is not the exclusive property 
of industrialized societies.  Partnerships are 
necessary between IK practitioners and western 
trained intellectuals to explore and unearth the 
maximum potential of the IKS. 
 
SAG\'s growing commitment to IKS development and 
advancement 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
------ 
 
4.  Government Science Councils began serious 
investigation into IKS following Parliamentary 
discussions prompted by Dr. Serote and a subsequent 
meeting of academics on IKS in mid-1996.  The Council 
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), 
National Research Foundation (NRF) and the Human 
Sciences Research Council (HSRC), in partnership with 
nine historically disadvantaged universities, 
collected data on existing IKS in local communities. 
 
5.  A research pilot project was conducted in the 
then Northern (Limpopo) Province at the end of 1997. 
The project identified students across university 
faculties and trained them on how to identify 
indigenous technologies, methods of recording them, 
as well as village protocols.  Following the 
completion of these IKS audits, the government held a 
national workshop on IKS in 1998.  Over time, 
universities and science councils supported more 
research projects in IKS.  Students collected data on 
housing and medical IKS technologies to study them 
and evaluate their possible development and 
enhancement.  This research was coordinated and 
funded through the CSIR, which cataloged the acquired 
information.  Since 2000, DST has allocated R10 
million per year to the NRF for funding IKS research 
projects.  Through June 2004, 256 grants for IKS 
activities have been awarded. 
 
6.  The newly-appointed Minister of Science and 
Technology, Dr. Mosibudi Mangena, told participants 
in a SADC IKS workshop in June 2004 that DST is 
giving IKS policy and legislation formulation top 
priority.  His department has established an inter- 
departmental IKS committee, funded research grants 
through the NRF and provided financial support to the 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems of South Africa Trust. 
The department\'s approach is designed to raise 
awareness, as well as promote development, 
partnerships, poverty alleviation and the sustainable 
use of resources.  DST is also developing a framework 
to establish a Traditional Knowledge Data Library. 
 
Policy formulation and multi-departmental cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
- 
 
7.  In an IKS briefing to Parliament in November 
2004, Dr. Mosimege spelled out the key \"drivers\" of 
IKS policy in South Africa.  First South Africa is 
affirming African cultural values in the face of 
globalization.  Development of IKS supports the 
\"African renaissance\" and helps to redress apartheid- 
era institutions and policies that equated IK with 
backwardness.  IKS policy secondly intends to develop 
services provided by traditional healers, who play a 
critical role in local communities.  The third driver 
is the potential contribution that IKS can make to 
the national economy in terms of job creation, 
poverty alleviation and technology transfer. 
Finally, IKS provides key linkages to other knowledge 
systems. 
 
8.  Dr. Mosimege told EST Assistant that since 1996 
the SAG has been developing an IKS policy framework. 
In 1999, the SAG established a Ministerial task team 
to formulate IKS policy and draft legislation. 
Because IKS involves crosscutting issues, forging a 
national IKS strategy and developing related 
legislation is a complicated task.  As a result, IKS 
has been addressed in policies and legislation of 
various other departments. 
 
9.  For example, the Department of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism drafted the Biodiversity Act, a 
chapter of which regulates the collection and use of 
indigenous plants and the equitable sharing of 
profits.  DST contributed to the IKS-related language 
in the Act.  DST is cooperating with the Department 
of Trade and Industry on Intellectual Property Rights 
(IPR) matters, including the draft Patents Amendment 
Bill of 2004.  The bill proposes to empower the 
Registrar of Patents to refuse granting of patents in 
cases where the application does not disclose the 
origin of genetic or biological resources. In cases 
involving patents based on IK, the bill would 
restrict patents unless there is disclosure of the 
origin of the traditional knowledge used in the 
patent invention, and prior informed consent of 
indigenous people possessing such knowledge. 
 
10.  DST has also worked with the Department of 
Health in drafting the Traditional Health 
Practitioners Bill (Ref A) passed in September 2004. 
The new law recognizes traditional healers as 
healthcare professionals and regulates the industry. 
Under the law, the government will support the 
educational and training needs of the practitioners, 
will provide protection for IK, and will allow 
traditional healers to participate in medical aid 
reimbursement programs. 
 
11.  DST also has policy and working relationships 
with nine other departments that constitute the multi- 
departmental committee on IKS.  The SAG has finalized 
an IKS policy document to deal with recognition, 
protection and the development of the IKS. Cabinet 
adopted the policy document, which now awaits 
promulgation. 
 
NRF and IKS - Project support 
------------------------------ 
 
12.  Sekamotho Mthembu, an NRF official, told EST 
Assistant that DST provides funding for IKS projects 
and NRF administers the funding and solicits 
proposals for projects.  The approved proposals 
comply with specific guidelines on production, 
transmission, and utilization of Indigenous Knowledge 
and technologies.  The proposals have to be 
consistent with the Poverty Relief Program of the 
DST, which aims to empower rural communities and add 
value to available local resources. The research 
themes include traditional medicine and health, food 
systems, socio-cultural systems, arts, crafts and 
materials.  Mthembu said that although the NRF does 
not direct the subject of research, it sets high 
research standards.  The quality and excellence of 
the proposals and the researchers\' expertise are the 
determining factors for project selection.  The NRF 
received 57 proposals by July in 2004. 
 
CSIR and IKS: Bio-prospecting, poverty alleviation 
and partnerships 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
-- 
 
13.  Dr. Marthinus Horak is the head of the Bio- 
prospecting unit at the CSIR.  He stressed to EST 
Assistant that South Africa is endowed with a robust 
biodiversity of over 23,000 plant species, 
representing 10 percent of the entire plant world. 
There are also approximately 200,000 traditional 
healers in South Africa, many of whom possess strong 
indigenous knowledge and skills.  The country also 
has a fast-developing science and technology sector. 
The CSIR intends to coordinate among stakeholders, 
including researchers, private sector, traditional 
healers and local communities, so that all can derive 
optimum benefits from the resources and share them 
equitably. 
 
14.  According to Dr. Horak, traditional healers 
approached the CSIR in 1997 seeking assistance to 
bring modern technology into traditional healing and 
to add value to traditional knowledge through 
scientific evaluation of medicines.  The parties 
established collaborations in 1998.  CSIR has worked 
with about 200 traditional healers through a ten- 
member committee representing the country\'s nine 
provinces.  Dr. Horak considers these traditional 
healers to be forward-looking and working to rectify 
the misconception that all traditional healers are 
\"witch doctors.\"  Healers also want to raise 
awareness about their contribution in keeping South 
Africans healthy, and seek valid recognition from the 
government and the public. 
 
15.  CSIR\'s partnerships combine scientific know-how 
and Indigenous Knowledge in an effort to develop 
products for various uses, including fragrances, 
pharmaceuticals and pesticides.  For example, reftel 
B reported on development of an appetite suppressant 
from a desert plant hoodia, used by the San tribes. 
Although multinational drug company Pfizer pulled out 
of the effort due to corporate reprioritization, CSIR 
continues to develop this project, and the San people 
will receive benefits from the royalties. 
 
16.  The Bio-prospecting unit is also pursuing 
development of eight other plant products including a 
mosquito repellent.  Dr. Horak reports that if all 
goes well, the products could offer up to 100% 
effectiveness, well above existing competing 
products.  The CSIR is also working with communities 
in agro-processing programs, establishing organic 
farms and medicinal farms for poverty alleviation. 
CSIR first helps ensure a market for a product and 
then establishes a company.  CSIR also provides 
mentoring in technical and managerial skills for the 
community, and then exits once the community members 
are able to manage the venture on their own. 
 
17.  Local studies show that 80 percent of South 
Africans, especially in the rural areas, rely on 
relatively inexpensive and easily accessible 
traditional medicine as primary health care.  The SAG 
hopes for joint development with western scientists 
of traditional medicines into drugs that can 
contribute to treatment of HIV/AIDS and malaria.  The 
Medical Research Council (MRC), CSIR and the 
University of Pretoria are working in partnership 
with traditional healers to draw active compounds 
from medicinal plants.  They will establish the 
scientific basis and provide clinical validation of 
the traditional remedies. 
 
National body promotes IKS development 
--------------------------------------- 
 
18.  Indigenous Knowledge Systems of South Africa 
(IKSSA) is an independent, DST-funded non- 
governmental organization established in 2002. 
Representing over 800 traditional healers, IKSSA 
advocates for IKS, and protects and promotes 
intellectual property for IKS.  Dr. Mogomme Masoga, 
Research Manager at IKSSA, told EST Assistant that 
his institution seeks to raise awareness about IKS 
and engage willing partners in projects.  IKSSA wants 
to be seen as a link between African development and 
NEPAD structures on IKS.  IKSSA has a resource center 
housing IKS materials in the form of research 
articles, books, newspaper clips and visual tapes. 
IK practitioners, researchers and the public have 
access to the materials. 
 
Regional cooperation - NEPAD conference 
---------------------------------------- 
 
19.  IKS is receiving greater attention at regional 
and continental levels.  The Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) and New Partnership for 
African Development (NEPAD) science and technology 
conference held in Maputo in June 2004, allocated one 
day to discuss IKS issues, and the discussions 
recommended possible workshops in Tanzania or Zambia 
in 2005. Tanzania has reportedly approached the World 
Bank to discuss potential funding for IKS projects 
for the benefit of the region. 
 
Conclusion 
----------- 
 
20.  The South African Government takes IKS very 
seriously.  IKS projects involving partnerships 
between western trained scientist and IK users have 
significant potential to contribute to innovative 
research, poverty reduction at the community level, 
and more effective drugs to combat widespread 
diseases.

SUBJECT: MOELETSI MBEKI CALLS ZIMBABWE A \"LONG-TERM 
PROJECT\"; URGES SUPPORT FOR MDC 
 
REF: JOHANNESBURG 527 
 
Classified By: Amb. Jendayi E. Frazer 
Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Moeletsi Mbeki, South African political 
commentator and brother of President Thabo Mbeki, urged the 
international community to stop \"chasing\" Mugabe\'s retirement 
and view Zimbabwe as a \"long-term project.\"  He called for 
increased international support for the MDC and Zimbabwean 
civil society.  In his view, the MDC represents a new type of 
political party in Africa -- non-racial, non-ethnic -- and 
thus is a threat to the old style African political parties 
and also a valuable asset in rebuilding sub-Saharan Africa. 
Mbeki suggested that the recent election of Joyce Mujuru as 
Vice President is a positive sign that could lead to 
Mugabe,s retirement in the future since Mugabe trusts her 
and her husband.  Mugabe made a big mistake by deporting 
COSATU, Mbeki argued, because its two million members are now 
energized, although he did not believe this would alter South 
African policy in the short-term.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On December 7, 2004, U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe, 
Christopher Dell, and PolOff met with Moeletsi Mbeki, brother 
of President Thabo Mbeki and Executive Chairman of Endemol 
South Africa, a television production company.  Mbeki is also 
Deputy Chairperson of the South African Institute for 
International Affairs, a well-respected foreign policy think 
tank.  A prominent political commentator in his own right, 
Mbeki has been publicly and sharply critical of the 
Government of Zimbabwe in recent years.  Mbeki worked as a 
journalist in Zimbabwe from 1982-1990.  (Comment:  Mbeki is 
reportedly not particularly close to his brother the 
President.) 
 
------------------------------- 
Observations on Zimbabwe Crisis 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Discussing the political crisis in Zimbabwe, Mbeki 
suggested that the international community needs to view the 
country as a \"long-term project.\"  He urged focus on building 
processes now to produce results in 10-15 years, not 
\"chasing\" Mugabe,s retirement. 
 
4. (C) Mbeki observed that civil society in Zimbabwe is quite 
weak and urged increased support for building a more robust 
civil society sector.  He noted that the MDC emerged so fast 
as a political force that it never engaged in the difficult 
and time-consuming work of organizing for a long-term 
struggle.  Comparing Zimbabwe to South Africa, Mbeki observed 
that the roots of civil society in South Africa go back to 
the early 19th century, particularly the black churches. 
During the anti-apartheid struggle, the entire society played 
a role -- the political parties, business, churches, 
academics and unions.  Zimbabwe does not have the same 
tradition.  The liberation in Zimbabwe resulted from the 
military actions of two armies, ZANLA and ZIPRA, not a 
broad-based movement.  (Comment: This interpretation 
seemingly exaggerates the significance of the military might 
of the liberation movements and underestimates the role of 
neighboring countries like Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique, 
the international community, and Zimbabwean churches, in 
pushing for a negotiated settlement.) 
 
--------------------------------- 
MDC Represents Future of Zimbabwe 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Mbeki painted a positive picture of the Zimbabwe,s 
main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC).  Mbeki claimed that the MDC represented the future of 
Zimbabwe; ZANU-PF is a \"spent force.\"  In his view, the 
international community needs to focus on supporting the MDC. 
 (Comment: most South African commentators emphasize the 
weaknesses of the MDC and do not/not share Mbeki,s upbeat 
assessment.)  What MDC needs, Mbeki said, is state patron, 
just as the Soviet Union supported the ANC.  Mbeki suggested 
that the United Kingdom would be the most natural ally, 
despite the fact that Mugabe would use this against the MDC. 
Mbeki pointed out that Mugabe already labels the MDC a tool 
of imperialist Britain, so would have little to lose by an 
open identification with the U.K. 
 
6. (C) In Mbeki,s view, the MDC represented a new type of 
party in political Africa -- non-ethnic, non-racial -- a 
\"mega-achievement.\"  The MDC is thus a valuable asset in 
rebuilding sub-Saharan Africa.  It also represents a threat 
to the old style, ethnic parties around the continent, 
including even the ANC.  In this vein, Mbeki observed that, 
for political reasons, the ANC likes having an opposition 
party, the Democratic Alliance, headed by a white person. 
 
7. (C) Mbeki pointed out several weaknesses in the MDC. 
First, they do not know how to ask for help, even from 
sympathetic African governments like Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya. 
 Second, the MDC should make private property rights a key 
part of their political platform, essentially using the land 
issue against Mugabe.  The MDC is afraid to do so because 
they fear being labeled defenders of white farmers.  Mbeki 
suggested this is short-sighted since Mugabe,s land policy 
also resulted in massive job losses for commercial 
farmworkers, a key core constituency for the MDC.  Finally, 
the MDC needs to mobilize the talented and huge constituency 
living in South Africa. 
 
----------------------- 
Recent ZANU-PF Congress 
----------------------- 
 
8. (C) Mbeki viewed the recent ZANU-PF party congress 
positively.  He said that the \"Mujurus,\" Vice President Joyce 
Mujuru and her husband Solomon Mujuru, were not \"Shona 
tribalists\" like Mugabe or Parliamentary Speaker Mnangagwa. 
Mujuru,s election as Vice President might even encourage 
Mugabe to step down at some point in the future.  Mbeki 
speculated that Mugabe would retire only if he had total 
confidence that his successor would not turn on him.  The 
Mujurus have been loyal to Mugabe from the beginning, and he 
trusts them completely. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Expulsion of COSATU Mugabe\'s Big Mistake 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Mbeki claimed that the expulsion of COSATU from 
Zimbabwe (see reftel) was Mugabe,s \"biggest error.\"  The 
SAG,s reaction to the deportation -- suggesting that COSATU 
\"got what it deserved\" -- was upsetting to COSATU\'s two 
million members and will resonate politically in the future. 
However, Mbeki thought it unlikely that the SAG would change 
its Zimbabwe policy, even if pressure from COSATU grew. 
Mbeki speculated that the ANC political strategists believed 
(wrongly in his opinion) that they did not need active labor 
support to win future elections. 
 
10. (C) Mbeki also observed that most South Africans are not 
interested in foreign policy.  To them, Africa is a big 
headache, a source of illegal immigration and crime.  They 
see President Mbeki,s activities in Cote d,Ivoire, DRC and 
Burundi as nothing more than a \"presidential hobby.\" 
 
11. (U) Ambassador Dell cleared on this message.

THIRD QUARTER BULLETIN RELEASED 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) released the 
third quarter 2004 Quarterly Bulletin, which gives a 
comprehensive picture of the economy by focusing on demand 
determinants of gross domestic product (GDP) as well as 
financial indicators.  From a demand perspective, the 
composition of GDP and economic growth indicate strong 
growth in the local economy.  In the third quarter, GDP 
increased by 5.6 percent (annualized, q/q), helped by 
strong growth in consumption and the export sector.  Gross 
domestic expenditures, which exclude the foreign trade 
sector, increased by 2.3 percent as household consumption 
and investment continues to show strong growth at 6.7 and 
2.4 percent, respectively.  Investment growth slowed 
substantially in the third quarter compared to 10.4 and 
5.5 percent growth in the first two quarters of 2004.  The 
deceleration in total fixed investment is largely 
attributable to transactions by South Africa Airlines, in 
which aircraft acquired on financial lease contracts 
during the first half of the year were changed into 
operational leases with a non-South African entity.  The 
aircraft had to be recorded as exports and negative 
capital formation in the third quarter after initially 
being recorded as imports and capital formation.  Private 
sector investment increased 13 percent in the third 
quarter, reflecting optimism as shown by recent business 
confidence indices.  Government consumption showed 
stagnant quarterly growth of 0.1 percent, due to large 
government purchases of ships in the second quarter. 
Exports and imports increased 13.9 and 0.7 percent 
respectively, explaining the much higher growth of GDP. 
Most analysts expect GDP to grow above 3.5 percent this 
year, with above 4 percent growth expected for 2005. 
Apart from expenditure data, the Quarterly Bulletin 
provides income, savings and inflation information.  The 
savings data was revised substantially, incorporating 
additional information from a wider variety of sources. 
Over the past three quarters, gross savings as a percent 
of GDP has increased, although household debt increased 
and savings to disposable income has declined, reflecting 
the rise in consumer spending.  South African savings was 
14.7 percent of GDP during the third quarter is 
substantially less than many of its peer countries 
(Malaysia at 42 percent, Thailand at 31 percent, Chile at 
27 percent and Singapore at 45 percent).  The ratio of 
household savings to disposable income has also declined 
from 1.2 in the first quarter 2004 to 0.9 in the third 
quarter.  Inflation expectations continue to remain within 
the targeted range of 3-6 percent for the next two years, 
even though unit labor costs increased for the third 
consecutive quarter.  Source:  Standard Bank QB Crux, 
Investec SARB Quarterly Update, December 10; SARB 
Quarterly Bulletin December 2004; Business Report, 
December 13. 
 
3.  Comment.  Two weeks ago, Stats SA released revised and 
rebased GDP figures from the production side.  SARB 
provides GDP composition from the demand side, showing 
consumption growing faster than previously thought. 
Revised household consumption increased 6.1 and 6.3 
percent in the first and second quarters compared to 
previous growth of 4.9 and 4.3 percent, respectively.  At 
least part of this increased consumer spending was funded 
by credit as reflected by increasing household debt to 
disposable income.  End comment. 
 
AMCHAM SURVEY SHOWS EMPOWERMENT RISKS 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  A survey of US firms belonging to the American Chamber 
of Commerce in South Africa (AmCham) shows that 74 percent 
of US companies views selling equity as part of black 
empowerment strategy as a negative factor in their 
investment decisions in South Africa.  The survey also 
shows that 50 percent of US firms plan to invest more in 
South Africa next year, while 62 percent said the business 
environment was either good or excellent, up from 50 
percent last year.  Thirty-four percent of AmCham\'s 177 
members responded to the survey.  Trade and Industry 
Director General Lionel October said the survey reflected 
\"a lack of understanding about the implementation of 
empowerment\" and acknowledged that the government has to 
explain the empowerment strategy more clearly.  October 
also stated that if a foreign company has a policy not to 
sell shares in its overseas subsidiaries, the government 
would accommodate that company.  Source:  Business Day, 
December 14. 
 
5.  Comment.  Last week, the Department of Trade and 
Industry released drafts of three codes of good practice 
providing guidelines on Black Economic Empowerment 
Framework, Equity Ownership and Management.   The Black 
Economic Empowerment Framework introduces a new generic 
scorecard recommending that companies achieve 25.1 percent 
BEE equity levels, 40 percent black management, 50 percent 
procurement from black-owned firms, and 50 percent 
equality in employment.  The Equity Ownership provides 
guidance on different types of ownership and voting rights 
and the Minister will include a Statement on equity 
ownership for multinationals.  A Statement is a formal 
clarifying principle within a Code.  Public comments on 
these codes will be accepted for the next 60 days.  It is 
not known when the Statement on equity ownership for 
multinationals will be released.  End comment. 
 
ELECTRICITY REGULATOR LIMITS PRICE INCREASE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  The National Electricity Regulator (NER) approved an 
average electricity price increase of 4.1 percent for 
2005, lower than the initial 6.4 percent increase it 
initially approved in October, effective January 1.  NER 
spokesman said one of the key determinants of the approved 
tariff increase was the fact that Eskom would be required 
to repay the large returns earned when Eskom sold more 
electricity than expected when the price increases of 8.5 
percent increases were approved.  In 2003, Eskom earned a 
profit of R3.5 billion ($463 million, using 7.56, the 
average exchange rate in 2003) on R32.8 billion ($4.34 
billion) in revenues.  Source:  Business Day, December 14. 
 
NEW MICRO FINANCE FUND STARTED 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  The Department of Trade and Industry announced the 
launch of the South African Micro Finance Apex Fund, which 
will provide small loans to individuals and small 
businesses.  Loans up to R10,000 ($1,750, using 5.7 rands 
per dollar) are available through intermediaries as well 
as financing advice and support, working with cooperatives 
and savings groups.  The fund hopes to improve 
entrepreneurial and financial skills and experience so 
that small enterprises can begin to improve employment and 
income levels.  Source:  Business Day, December 13. 
 
FRAUDULENT GRANT RECIPIENTS CAN RECEIVE INDEMNITY UNTIL MARCH 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
8.  People receiving social grants fraudulently have until 
the end of March to apply for indemnity or face possible 
imprisonment.  About 37,000 people are suspected to be 
enjoying state benefits illegally.  Examples include about 
1000 foster-care parents receiving grants for children 
older than the eligible age, and more than 10,000 others 
who are under investigation for receiving old age grants 
before the official retirement age.  \"The home affairs 
department has also informed us that there are over 14,400 
cases of children who, according to the (department\'s) 
records, are indicated as deceased, but people continue to 
collect the child support grant,\" said Justice Department 
Director General Vusi Pikoli.  Social Development Minister 
Zola Skweyiya said untested information had recently 
revealed that about 50,500 government employees or 
beneficiaries of the government pension fund were also 
receiving social grants.   Government spends about R50 
billion on providing social security to more than 9 
million beneficiaries every year.  Source:  Business Day, 
December 14. 
EMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS CONTINUE GROWING 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  The September Survey of Employment and Earnings (SEE) 
shows the average earnings growth per employee in the 
formal non-agricultural business sector reached 5.4 
percent between the quarter ended September 2003 and 
September 2004 compared to 7.9 percent between the quarter 
ended June 2003 and June 2004.  Employment increased 3.7 
percent in September, showing an increase of 234,000 jobs 
compared to September 2003 and a gain of 112,000 over June 
2004\'s jobs.  June\'s survey showed a 2.5 percent increase 
in employment.  The gross earnings paid to employees 
during the quarter ended September 2004 amounted to 136.76 
billion rand, which is an annual increase of 9.3 percent 
compared with the June 2004 quarter\'s annual increase in 
gross earnings of 10.6 percent.  Since June 2004, the 
highest number of jobs created occurred in the personal 
services sector (66,000 new jobs), followed by wholesale 
and retail trade (15,000), manufacturing (14,000), 
construction (11,000) and the financial sector (7,000). 
Growth in consumption of services, motor vehicles, 
property and durable and non-durable goods have exceeded 
GDP growth over the past year.  Source:  I-Net Bridge, 
Standard Bank, SEE, December 14; Business Day, Business 
Report, December 15. 
 
10.  Comment.  South Africa has three official ways of 
measuring employment statistics:  the population census, 
which surveys all households, completed every five years; 
the labor force survey of a sample of households published 
twice a year; and the Survey of Employment and Earnings, 
which is a sample of firms in the non-agricultural formal 
sector (those firms registered for value-added taxes) and 
published every quarter.  Firm-based surveys, like the 
SEE, generally do not keep up with the changing structure 
of employment without frequent sample revision.  For 
example, the growth of the information technology sector 
in the 1980s and 1990s was not included in the SEE sample 
until 2002.  The SEE has reported employment gains for the 
past two quarters, although some argue that the amount of 
jobs created comes short of halving the current 
unemployment rate of 27.8 percent by 2014.  Roughly 
500,000 additional jobs per year are needed to reach the 
government\'s goal.  End comment.

SOUTH AFRICA 
 
TRADE SUMMARY 
 
The U.S. trade deficit with South Africa was $1.8 billion 
in 2003, an increase of $308 million from 2002.  U.S. goods 
exports in 2003 were $2.8 billion, up 11.7 percent from the 
previous year.  Corresponding U.S. imports from South 
Africa were $4.6 billion, up 15.0 percent.  South Africa is 
currently the 34th largest export market for U.S. goods. 
U.S. exports of private commercial services (i.e., 
excluding military and government) to South Africa were 
$1.1 billion in 2002 (latest data available), and U.S. 
imports were $782 million.  The stock of U.S. foreign 
direct investment (FDI) in South Africa in 2002 was $3.4 
billion, up from $3.1 billion in 2001.  U.S. FDI in South 
Africa is concentrated largely in manufacturing, services, 
and wholesale sectors. 
 
South Africa has increasingly opened its market since 1994 
by reducing tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.  The 
South African government has stated its aim to open the 
market further in order to increase trade and to develop 
more competitive domestic industries.  As a member of the 
Southern African Customs Union (SACU), South Africa began 
negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the 
United States in June 2003.  The FTA negotiations provide 
an unprecedented opportunity for addressing trade 
constraints on U.S. exports to South Africa, including 
relatively high tariffs and import restrictions on certain 
U.S. exports; inadequate copyright protection for software, 
films, and music; and barriers in telecommunications and 
other key service sectors. South Africa aims to conclude 
free trade agreements in 2005 with Mercosur and the 
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and to begin 
negotiations with India.  It continues to explore a 
possible free trade agreement with China.  Along with India 
and Brazil, South Africa was a founding member of the G-20 
coalition of countries formed prior to the September 2003 
WTO Ministerial in Cancun. 
 
IMPORT POLICIES 
 
The South African International Trade Administration 
Commission (ITAC) came into operation in June 2003. ITAC, 
which replaced the Board on Tariffs and Trade, was 
established under Section 7 of the International Trade 
Administration Act of 2002. It has been tasked to establish 
an efficient and effective system for the administration of 
trade. ITAC\'s responsibilities include: 
 
  TARIFF INVESTIGATIONS - The ITAC administers tariff- 
related programs, including the Motor Industry Development 
Program (MIDP) and the Duty Credit Certificate System 
(DCCS). Interested parties are entitled to approach ITAC 
with specific requests for tariff assistance. 
 
  TRADE REMEDIES - The ITAC deals with antidumping and 
subsidized exports as well as safeguards.   The safeguards 
procedures were introduced in August 27, 2004, but have not 
yet been applied. 
 
  IMPORT AND EXPORT CONTROL - The ITAC issues import and 
export permits for certain items designated by the Minister 
under the authority of the International Trade 
Administration Act of 2002, which repealed the Import and 
Export Control Act of 1963. 
 
Import Control 
 
The Minister of Trade and Industry may, by notice in the 
Government Gazette, prescribe that no goods of a specified 
class or kind be imported into South Africa, except under 
the authority of, and in accordance with, the conditions 
ns 
stated in a permit issued by ITAC. The main categories of 
controlled imports and the objectives of control are as 
follows: 
 
-- Secondhand goods: Import permits are granted only if 
such goods or substitutes are not manufactured 
domestically, constituting a de facto ban on such goods. 
These restrictions are designed to protect domestic 
industries such as clothing, motors, machinery and 
plastics, but also serve to discriminate against low-cost 
secondhand goods from the United States. 
 
  Waste, scrap, ashes, and residues (Basel Convention): 
The objective of import controls of these goods is to 
protect human health and the environment. 
 
  Other harmful substances: Imports of substances such as 
ozone depleting chemicals (Montreal Convention) and 
chemicals used in illegal drug manufacturing (1988 United 
Nations Convention) are controlled for environmental, 
health and social reasons. 
 
  Goods subject to quality specifications, such as tires: 
This restriction permits monitoring of manufacturer 
er 
adherence to specifications that enhance vehicle safety or 
protect human life. 
 
Tariffs 
 
To comply with its WTO commitments, since 1994 South Africa 
has reformed and simplified its tariff structure. It has 
reduced tariff rates from an import-weighted average tariff 
rate of more than 20 percent to 7 percent. Notwithstanding 
these reforms, importers have complained that South 
Africa\'s tariff schedule remains complex and can create 
uncertainty. The U.S.-SACU free trade agreement 
negotiations provide an opportunity to work with the South 
African government to lower these relatively high tariff 
rates. Tariff rates mostly fall within eight levels ranging 
from 0 percent to 30 percent, but some are higher, such as 
for specific textile and apparel items. In the Uruguay 
Round, South Africa agreed to a twelve-year phase-down of 
duties on textiles and apparel, but since then has 
unilaterally moved to a seven-year phase-down process. As 
of September 1, 2002, the following rates, which are also 
the end rates, apply: 
 
Apparel                 40 percent 
Yarns                    15 percent 
Fabrics                  22 percent 
Finished goods     30 percent 
Fibers                   7.5 percent 
 
Duty rates on cars, light goods, vehicles and minibuses are 
still at the high level of 36 percent, while the rate of 
duty on original motor parts is 28 percent. Under the terms 
of the Motor Industry Development Plan (MIDP), 
international companies that both import and export motor 
vehicles and parts are able to use export credits to reduce 
the import duties. 
 
ITAC continued to receive requests for tariff protection 
from industries, especially since the South African rand\'s 
appreciation curve started in late 2002. The appreciation 
of the rand resulted in increased competition from imports 
that hurt the competitiveness of many South African 
companies. U.S. companies have cited tariffs as a barrier 
to trade in South Africa, along with port delays and 
congestion, customs valuation above invoice prices, theft 
of goods, import permits, antidumping measures, IPR crime, 
an inefficient bureaucracy and excessive regulation. 
 
Dumping 
 
Twelve new antidumping petitions were filed in South Africa 
during 2003-2004, the majority against Chinese products. 
While no new antidumping investigations against imports 
from the United States were instituted in 2004, antidumping 
duties on U.S. chicken meat portions, suspension PVC, 
roller bearings, lysine and acetaminophenol remain in 
force. In early 2004, ITAC also increased the MFN applied 
duty on imports of poultry offal, as requested by the 
domestic industry. In an important step to increase 
transparency and clarity on the dumping investigation 
processes, anti-dumping regulations were promulgated on 
November 14, 2003. 
 
Free Trade Agreement with the European Union 
 
In 2000, South Africa and the European Union (EU) began to 
implement the development co-operation and financial co- 
operation provisions of their Agreement on Trade, 
Development and Cooperation, a free trade agreement (FTA). 
Under the agreement, South Africa and the EU will establish 
a free trade area over a transitional period of up to 
twelve years for South Africa, and up to ten years for the 
EU. The FTA provides for the reduction and eventual 
elimination of duties for approximately 85 percent of the 
products imported by SA from the EU and 95 percent of the 
products exported by South Africa to the EU. Certain 
agricultural products were exempted from liberalization 
under the agreement. South African and EU negotiators 
announced at the end of 2003 that they would seek to 
accelerate the process of negotiation towards freer trade 
in automobiles. U.S. firms exporting to South Africa are 
concerned that their products will be less competitive 
because of the preferences given to the EU. For example, 
there is a five percent differential between the duties on 
EU and U.S. trucks. U.S. companies are divided on whether 
they have been disadvantaged by the EU FTA. 
 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
 
Biotechnology 
 
There has been an active debate in South Africa about 
products produced using agricultural biotechnology. The 
Genetically Modified Organisms Act (\"the GMO Act\"), which 
entered into force on December 1, 1999, aims to ensure that 
all activities involving the use of agricultural 
biotechnology (including production, import, release and 
distribution) will be carried out in such a way as to limit 
possible harmful consequences to the environment. Since 
1999, some stores have promoted claims of selling a limited 
range of biotechnology-free products, while a few consumer 
groups have urged the Department of Health to introduce 
compulsory labeling of biotechnology products. 
 
Under the leadership of the Department of Health, 
Directorate of Food Control, the South African government 
issued regulations on the labeling of biotechnology 
products in early 2004 The regulations mandate labeling of 
genetically modified (GM) foods only in certain cases, 
including when allergens or human/animal proteins are 
present, and when a GM food product differs significantly 
from a non-GM equivalent.  The rules also require 
validation of enhanced-characteristic claims for GM food 
products.  The regulations do not address labeling claims 
that products are GM-free.  Biotech advocates are concerned 
about this omission, noting it could lead to many 
fraudulent claims.  Trade organizations seem satisfied with 
the regulations, which follow internationally recognized, 
scientific (CODEX) guidelines.   South Africa\'s CODEX 
representative comes from the Directorate of Food Control. 
 
In November 2004 the government published draft changes to 
the GMO Act to bring it into compliance with the Cartagena 
Biosafety Protocol.  The government solicited public 
comments on the draft changes through November 2004 and is 
currently evaluating those comments. 
 
 
In June 2001, the South African government published the 
National Biotechnology Strategy for South Africa, a 
document that shows the South African government\'s intent 
to stimulate the growth of biotechnology industries. The 
document states that biotechnology can make an important 
contribution to national priorities, particularly in the 
areas of human health, food security and environmental 
sustainability. Environmental groups continued to exert 
pressure on the South African government in 2004 to examine 
the safety of foods derived from agricultural 
biotechnology. 
 
 South Africa has approved for commercial production [begun 
to grow] genetically modified soybeans that are tolerant to 
herbicides, and cotton and yellow and white maize that are 
resistant to insects.  Farmers are enthusiastically 
adopting the new technology, and they are expected to plant 
up to 1 million hectares of genetically engineered 
varieties in South Africa in 2004, up from about 400,000 
hectares in 2003.  The use of these products is widespread 
in the food processing industry. 
 
U.S. grain producers have raised concerns about South 
Africa\'s treatment of genetically modified \"stacked 
events.\" Although the U.S. Government considers products 
containing a combination of two previously approved genetic 
modifications (such as for insect resistance and herbicide 
tolerance) as \"conventional\" and encourages producers to 
notify the USG of such stacked events, South Africa -- like 
the EU -- considers the combined \"stacked events\" as a new 
event, and requires a complete, de novo review for 
registration purposes. This requirement creates significant 
delays in registering products, causing U.S. exporters to 
lose export opportunities. At present, U.S. yellow corn is 
not approved for import by the government of South Africa 
due to delays in registering stacked events and other new 
events. As a result, if yellow corn were in short supply in 
South Africa in 2005, importers would have to apply to the 
government for a special waiver in order to import U.S. 
yellow corn, with the guarantee that the U.S. yellow corn 
would be milled near the port to ensure that it cannot be 
planted. 
In 2003 and 2004, Biowatch, an environmental lobby group, 
took legal action against the National Department of 
Agriculture in order to obtain information on how it made 
decisions on issuing licenses for modified crops.  The 
local courts ruled in favor of NDA, which protects certain 
information on a business proprietary basis. 
 
In September 2003, countries of the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC), including South Africa, 
developed common guidelines on the regulation of products 
resulting from biotechnology. The guidelines assert that 
the region should develop common policy and regulatory 
systems that are based on either the Cartagena Protocol or 
the African Model Law on Biosafety. The heads of SADC 
member states also agreed to develop national biotechnology 
policies and strategies and to increase their efforts to 
establish national biosafety regulatory systems. Member 
states were also urged to commission studies on the 
implications of biotechnology for agriculture, the 
environment, public health and socio-economics. 
 
Agricultural Standards 
 
The Directorate of Plant Health and Quality of the National 
Department of Agriculture is responsible for setting 
standards for certain agricultural and agricultural-related 
products. These standards include composition, quality, 
packaging, marketing, and labeling, as well as physical, 
physiological, chemical, and microbiological analyses. 
These standards, published in to the Agricultural Product 
Standards Amendment Act of 1998 and the Liquor Products Act 
of 1989, set the regulations for products to be sold on 
both the local and export markets. U.S. distilled spirits 
producers have complained that South African regulations 
that require a minimum alcohol content by volume (a.b.v.) 
for whisky, rum, and other products limit the marketing of 
U.S.-origin spirits that meet the international standard of 
40 percent a.b.v. 
 
The South African government requires prospective importers 
to apply for an import permit for certain controlled 
products. The import of irradiated meat from any source is 
still banned by public health officials. U.S. horticultural 
producers have complained about various South African 
phytosanitary barriers on the importation of apples, 
cherries, and pears from the United States. They estimate 
that, if these barriers were removed, U.S. exports of each 
of these fruits could increase by $5 million to $25 million 
in annual sales to South Africa. U.S. producers have also 
expressed concern about unnecessary SPS requirements for 
some grains, pork, poultry, and horticultural products. 
 
In order to fulfill South Africa\'s commitment under the WTO 
Marrakesh Agreement on market access, the National 
Department of Agriculture published the rules and 
procedures regarding the application for market access 
permits for agricultural products on October 24, 2003. The 
permits will be issued to importers registered with the 
South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Department of 
Trade and Industry (DTI) for importation of the 
agricultural products listed in the Table of Import 
Arrangements. 
Permits will be allocated as follows: 
 
?    10 percent to importers who have not imported over the 
past 3 years (\"new importers\"), 
 
?    10 percent to Small, Medium, and Micro Enterprise 
importers (\"SMME Importers\"), 
 
?    80 percent to importers who have imported the products 
over the past 3 years (\"historical 
importers\"). 
 
In response to the BSE case in Washington State announced 
on December 23, 2003, South Africa placed a ban on all 
ruminant animals and products originating in the United 
States effective December 24, 2003.  By January 15, 2004 
South Africa, in accordance with OIE standards, exempted 
non-risk products such as hides, skins, wool and mohair 
from the ban.  At this time a ban is still in place on 
ruminant meat products.  The South African Department of 
Agriculture is impressed with USDA\'s surveillance program 
but wants to see a full report with data from the 
surveillance program before considering lifting the ban. 
 
During 2004 South African grain, pork and poultry producers 
petitioned the government to raise tariffs with little 
success except for poultry offal.  The Government of South 
Africa does not have an effective safety net to support 
farmers financially during times of drought or strong 
currency.  Therefore, farmers\' groups will likely continue 
to pressure the government to try to reduce imports or make 
them more expensive. 
 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
 
Government purchases are by competitive tender for project, 
supply, and other contracts. The South African government 
uses its position as both buyer and lawmaker, however, to 
promote the economic empowerment of historically 
disadvantaged individuals (HDIs) through its Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) policy.  In January 2004, President Mbeki 
signed into law the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment 
(BBBEE) Act of 2003, the legislation enacting the BEE 
strategy. The Act directs the Minister of Trade and 
Industry to develop a national strategy for BEE, issue BEE 
implementing guidelines in the form of Codes of Good 
Practice, encourage the development of industry specific 
charters, and establish a National BEE Advisory Council to 
review progress in achieving BEE objectives. 
 
The Minister released three Codes in December 2004 with 
seven more due in early 2005.  The recently released Codes 
address specific issues pertaining to the BEE Framework, 
Equity Ownership, and Management and include a new generic 
scorecard with suggested targets for areas such as equity 
ownership, management, procurement, and equality in 
employment.  The Codes are intended to harmonize existing 
and future industry empowerment charters.  Sectors that 
have completed or are close to finalizing empowerment 
charters for their respective industries include: 
accounting, agriculture, chemical, cosmetics, clothing and 
footwear, construction, engineering services, financial 
services, forestry, health, information and communications 
technology (ICT), liquid fuels, liquor, marketing, mining, 
property, tourism, transport, and wine.  The Minister is 
expected to establish the National BEE Advisory Council 
early in 2005. 
 
While many U.S. companies operating in South Africa have 
significant programs that support HDIs, they have concerns 
about the lack of clarity and consistency in the BEE rules. 
A major concern is whether HDI equity ownership will become 
mandatory and a cost of doing business with the South 
African government.  The Minister of Trade and Industry is 
developing a statement on equity ownership for 
multinationals to be included in the Code of Good Practice 
on Equity Ownership, which is expected to address the 
concerns of U.S. companies. 
 
South Africa\'s Preferential Procurement Policy Framework 
Act of 2000 and its implementing regulations set a legal 
framework and formula for evaluating bidders of government 
contracts by price and the advancement of socio-economic 
priorities.  Revised draft regulations were released in 
November 2004 to take into consideration the BBBEE Act. 
The new regulations give greater preference to bidders of 
government contracts who more effectively comply with BEE 
objectives.  In addition, the draft regulations raise 
tender thresholds.  Previously, companies bidding on 
tenders worth up to R500, 000 earned 80 percent of their 
points from their bid price and 20 percent on their 
commitment to social objectives (80-20 preference point 
system).  Now, the 80-20 point system is applied to tenders 
valued up to R1 million and firms are evaluated on their 
compliance with their respective industry BEE scorecards. 
Similarly, a 90-10-preference point system is applied to 
tenders valued at over R1 million. The National Treasury is 
expected to approve and gazette the new Preferential 
Procurement regulations by mid-2005. 
 
South Africa\'s Industrial Participation (IP) program, 
introduced in 1996, subjects all government and parastatal 
purchases or lease contracts (goods, equipment or services) 
with an imported content equal to or exceeding $10 million 
(or the rand equivalent thereof) to an IP obligation.  This 
obligation requires the seller/supplier to engage in 
commercial or industrial activity equaling or exceeding 30 
percent of the imported content of total goods purchased 
under government tender.  The program is intended to 
benefit South African industry by generating new or 
additional business. 
 
In August 2004, the Minister of Finance issued the Code of 
Good Practice for BEE in Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) 
that had been released as a draft document in December 
2003.  The Code of Good Practice sets out the targets for 
BEE to be achieved in PPPs and provides clarity to bidding 
private parties. 
South Africa is not a signatory to the WTO Agreement on 
Government Procurement. 
 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
 
Under the Duty Credit Certificate Scheme, the government of 
South Africa offers duty credit certificates to South 
African exporters of textiles and clothing. Other 
incentives are available for the promotion of manufactured 
exports. SACU also has several duty drawback regimes for 
agricultural and nonagricultural products. 
 
In September 1995 the South African government established 
the Motor Industry Development Program (MIDP) in order to 
assist the South African auto industry. This program 
includes measures to promote exports and introduces a 
phased reduction in import tariffs. The MIDP allows vehicle 
assemblers and component manufacturers to offset vehicle 
and component exports against similar imports. The ability 
to rebate import duties by exporting allows importers to 
bring in vehicles at lower effective rates of duty. It also 
enables assemblers to use import credits to source 
components at close-to international prices. In late 2002, 
the government extended the program from 2007 to 2012. 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
 
Legal Regime 
 
Property rights, including intellectual property rights, 
are protected under a variety of laws and 
regulations. The South African parliament passed two IPR- 
related laws at the end of 1997 -- the 
Counterfeit Goods Act and the Intellectual Property Laws 
Amendment Acts -- in order to enhance IPR protection. The 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) administers these 
acts. Although South Africa\'s intellectual property laws 
and practices are generally in conformity with those of the 
industrialized nations, there are deficiencies in 
enforcement and in guaranteeing the protections afforded 
under these laws. The U.S.-SACU free trade agreement 
negotiations will seek to address some of the shortcomings 
in South Africa\'s IPR protection regime. 
 
The U.S. software industry has cited three principal 
deficiencies in the 1978 Copyright Act: 
 
-- Lack of criminal penalties for end user piracy. South 
African law currently provides that the sale of infringing 
software is a criminal offence, but there is no criminal 
penalty for end users. 
 
-- Lack of presumptions relating to copyright subsistence 
and ownership. Amending the law to add subsistence 
presumptions would reduce the procedural burden on rights 
holders in proving their cases. 
 
-- Non-deterrent civil damages. Amending the law to 
introduce statutory damages to cover end users and to 
ensure that compensatory damages serve as a deterrent would 
improve IPR protection. The current statutory provisions on 
damages are not considered to be sufficient to serve as a 
deterrent. 
 
Until these changes are made in the law, the enforcement of 
individual copyright claims is complicated by the lack of 
evidentiary presumptions in the law, requiring use of an 
expensive registration system or submission of extensive 
proof of copyright subsistence and ownership. Amendments 
have been considered for years, but relatively little has 
been done in this area. 
 
In 2001, South Africa introduced measures to enhance 
enforcement of the Counterfeit Goods Act. The South African 
government appointed more inspectors, designated more 
warehouses for counterfeit goods, destroyed counterfeit 
goods, and improved the training of customs, border police, 
and police officials. In 2004, there were 100 convictions 
for people arrested with counterfeit DVDs and computer 
games compared to 14 in 2003. Despite these efforts, the 
International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates 
total losses from copyright piracy in South Africa in 2002 
at over $84 million, including $39 million in business 
software applications and $30 million in motion pictures. 
Although law enforcement authorities often cooperate with 
the private sector in investigating allegations of 
counterfeit trade, there are concerns about laxity in 
enforcement of IPR laws against imports of pirated goods. 
Complainants can take both civil and criminal action 
against offenders. 
 
U.S. firms have complained that South Africa does not 
adequately protect the safety and efficacy studies (also 
called \"registration data\") filed before national 
authorities for approval of agrochemical products.  These 
data are unfairly \"referenced\" by competitors in order to 
register their products. 
 
South Africa is a member of the Paris Union and acceded to 
the Stockholm Text of the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Intellectual Property. South Africa is also a 
member of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) but has yet to ratify the WIPO Copyright Treaty and 
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. 
Software/Audio Visual IPR Issues 
 
Software piracy still occurs frequently in South Africa. 
Between February and March 2001, the Business Software 
Alliance (BSA) gave South African organizations a one-time 
opportunity to legalize their software by registering. The 
campaign received 608 registrations to legalize pirated or 
illegally installed software, representing over 60,000 
desktop personal computers. An independent research firm, 
International Planning and Research Corporation, conducted 
a survey for the BSA during 2001. It found that the local 
piracy rate dropped from 45 percent to 38 percent. Piracy 
in the video and sound industry also continues to be a 
concern. The Motion Picture Association estimated video 
piracy at 10 percent and optical disk piracy at 40 percent 
in 2003. 
 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
 
Telecommunications 
 
South Africa has made a series of WTO commitments on value- 
added telecommunications and basic telecommunications 
services and has adopted the WTO reference paper on pro- 
competitive regulatory principles. The South African 
government also committed to license a second supplier no 
later than January 1, 2004, to compete against the current 
monopoly supplier, Telkom, in long-distance, data, telex, 
fax, and private leased circuits services. Despite the end 
of Telkom\'s exclusivity period in May 2002, Telkom has been 
able to continue its monopoly because of the government\'s 
unsuccessful attempts to license a second network operator 
(SNO). 
 
Although the Minister of Communications conditionally 
approved a license for the SNO in December 2003, 19 percent 
empowerment shareholder Nexus Connexion sued the Minister 
over the inclusion of equity partners who were previously 
considered unqualified by the regulator.  Nexus called for 
a review of the Minister\'s actions and asked the Court to 
prevent her from implementing her decision to license the 
SNO.  Consequently, the Minister restructured the 51 
percent strategic equity portion of the SNO (SepCo) and is 
in the process of awarding the controlling stake in SepCo 
to a third equity partner.  Thirty percent of the SNO is 
held by the telecommunications divisions of Eskom (the 
state energy utility) and Transnet (the transport 
parastatal).  Twenty five percent is held by equity 
partners Two Consortium and CommuniTel with the remaining 
26 percent soon to be awarded. 
 
In September 2004, the Minister of Communications announced 
a sweeping liberalization of the telecom sector, effective 
February 1, 2005.  Among other things, the Minister 
indicated that mobile operators would be allowed to use any 
fixed lines for the provision of their service, value-added 
network services (VANS) could be provided by facilities 
other than those owned by Telkom and the Second National 
Operator, VANS providers would be allowed to carry voice 
using any protocol, and private telecommunications network 
operators could resell their spare capacity.  The 
Independent Communications Authority of South Africa 
(ICASA) is developing regulations to take into account the 
Minister\'s announcement.   The new regulations are expected 
to resolve past complaints by Internet Service Providers 
(ISPs) and value-added network services (VANS), which have 
previously cited problems in acquiring new facilities from 
Telkom. 
 
The Department of Communications (DOC) released a Draft 
Convergence Bill in December 2003, which industry analysts 
hoped would simplify the existing legislative framework, 
empower the regulator, and open the telecoms industry to 
greater competition.  Following a highly critical public 
comment period, the DOC undertook to revise the Bill.  It 
is expected to be released in early 2005. 
 
Telecommunications is one of the areas being addressed in 
the U.S.-SACU free trade agreement negotiations. South 
Africa\'s telecommunications regulatory authority, ICASA, 
has sole authority to determine whether these services are 
illegal. In the past, service providers have complained 
about ICASA ineffectiveness in asserting its authority over 
Telkom and have pursued remedies in the Pretoria High 
Court. Telkom also often challenges decisions taken by 
ICASA, leading to delays in implementing rulings. The 
Amended Telecommunications Act of 2001 allows only Telkom 
and the SNO to provide voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) 
services, and it appears to expand the definition of a 
public switched telecommunications service (PSTS) to 
include the provision, repair, and maintenance of any other 
telecommunicationsapparatus. Interested parties continue to 
raise questions concerning the consistency of these and 
other provisions of the Amended Telecommunications Act with 
South Africa\'s WTO obligations. The United States continues 
to monitor South Africa pursuant to section 1377 of the 
Trade Act of 1988 for compliance with its WTO commitments. 
 
Other Services 
 
The United States has in the past shown interest in 
reaching an open skies air transport agreement with South 
Africa. During negotiations in May 2001, however, South 
Africa indicated that it would not agree to open skies, 
preferring instead incremental liberalization of the 
existing air transport agreement. Open skies agreements 
provide for open route rights, capacity, frequencies, 
designations, and pricing, as well as opportunities for 
cooperative marketing arrangements, including code-sharing 
and airline alliances. South African Airways (SAA), the 
national airline wholly-owned by the transport parastatal 
Transnet, had previously noted concerns about U.S. airlines 
exercising fifth-freedom rights in Africa and thereby 
impinging on one of SAA\'s strategic markets. 
 
ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES 
 
Ownership Patterns 
 
There is an historical legacy of concentrated ownership in 
some sectors of the South African economy. During the 
apartheid years, a large portion of the South African 
population was entirely excluded from ownership of business 
enterprises. Moreover, government policies from 1961 to 
1994 prohibited some successful companies such as South 
African Breweries, Anglo American (including DeBeers) and 
SASOL from investing abroad. They therefore expanded their 
activities locally. As a result, conglomerates with 
considerable market power developed in the South African 
marketplace. Thissituation has been changing, as many of 
the major players have been expanding internationally and 
have listed on foreign stock exchanges. Together with the 
more effective competition authority and strong sectoral 
initiatives to enlarge the share of black participation in 
the economy, South Africa\'s business environment is 
becoming more competitive and more open to new entrants 
(including U.S. companies). Sectors such as energy, 
transport and telecommunications have also historically 
been controlled or dominated by parastatals. These sectors 
are gradually restructuring and opening up for competition 
from the private sector. The privatization program of the 
South African government, although moving slowly, is also 
starting to bring a change in ownership patterns. 
 
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
 
Effective July 31, 2002, all companies that conduct 
business in South Africa via electronic commerce must 
comply with the new Electronic Communications and 
Transactions Law. The new law was designed to facilitate 
electronic commerce but may increase regulatory burdens and 
introduce uncertainty into the future of electronic 
commerce in the country. The law requires government 
accreditation for certain electronic signatures, takes 
government control of the \".za\" domain name, and requires a 
long list of disclosures for web sites that sell via the 
Internet. 
 
 
OTHER BARRIERS 
 
Transparency, Corruption and Crime 
 
South African law provides for prosecution of government 
officials who solicit or accept bribes. Penalties for 
offering or accepting a bribe may include criminal 
prosecution, monetary fines, and dismissal for government 
employees, or deportation for foreign citizens. South 
Africa boasts no fewer than ten agencies engaged in anti- 
corruption activities. Some, like the Public Service 
Commission (PSC), Office of the Public Protector (OPP), and 
Office of the Auditor-General (OAG), are constitutionally 
mandated and address corruption as only part of their 
responsibilities. Others, like the South African Police 
Anti-Corruption Unit and the Directorate for Special 
Operations (more popularly known as \"the Scorpions\"), are 
dedicated to combating crime and corruption. High rates of 
violent crime, however, are a strain on capacity and make 
it difficult for South African criminal and judicial 
entities to dedicate adequate resources to anti-corruption 
efforts. 
During the last few years, crime has been a far more 
serious problem than either corruption or political 
violence and an impediment to, and a cost of, doing 
business in South Africa. The South African police forces 
have not been effective or well accepted in many 
communities because of their historical role in enforcing 
minority rule, their lack of training, and internal crime 
and corruption within the forces. The levels of crime, 
especially violent crime, are a deterrent to attracting 
U.S. companies to South Africa. 
 
New laws, such as the Promotion of Access to Information 
Act signed into law in February 2000, have helped to 
increase transparency in government in the last few years. 
The Public Finance Management Act, which became effective 
on April 1, 2000, helped to raise the level of oversight 
and control over public funds and improved the transparency 
of government spending, especially with regard to off- 
budget agencies and parastatals. Notwithstanding these 
efforts, businesses complain about the lack of certainty 
and consistency in interpreting and implementing some 
government policies. 
 
 
President Mbeki signed \"The South African Prevention and 
Combating of Corrupt Activities Act\" (PCCAA) into law on 
April 28, 2004.  The PCCAA makes it more clear which 
activities are considered graft.  The act: 
 
?    Includes a list of codified corruption offenses 
related to specific persons. 
 
?    Clearly defines that graft occurs between a 
\"corruptor\" and a \"corruptee.\" 
 
?    Declares that a bribe need not be monetary in nature, 
nor need it be paid directly to the person who will be 
undertaking the corrupt act. 
 
?    Bars the payment of bribes to foreign public officials 
by South African citizens and firms. 
 
?    Provides a list of corruption-related offenses 
relating to specific matters in the public and private 
sectors. 
 
?    Allows for the investigation and seizure of 
\"unexplained wealth.\" 
 
?    Tasks the National Treasury to establish a register of 
tender defaulters for corrupt individuals and firms. 
 
?    Obliges public officials to report any corrupt 
activities. 
 
?    Prescribes strict penalties, including the possibility 
of life imprisonment. 
 
One shortcoming of the act is the failure to protect 
whistleblowers against recrimination or defamation claims. 
 
 
Immigration Laws 
 
For a number of years, U.S. and other foreign companies 
have complained that South African immigration legislation 
and the application of the law made it extremely difficult 
to get work permits for their foreign employees. 
Previously, South Africa relied on the apartheid-era Aliens 
Control Act, which did not take into account international 
developments and the opening up of the South African 
market. A new immigration law entered into force on May 31, 
2002. The legislation establishes yearly quotas for 
granting work permits to foreigners. Local businesses have 
criticized the new law for creating uncertainty because the 
quota system sets limits on the number of skilled people in 
particular categories that may enter the country, and 
because corporate permits allow investors to make blanket 
applications for the people they need. It is not clear 
whether these corporate permits fall in or out of the quota 
system. The Trade and Industry Minister has suggested that 
the South African government may need to revise the law to 
acquire critically needed skills in South Africa. Home 
Affairs officials oppose moving away from quotas because it 
might mean reverting to the Aliens Control Act, wherein an 
employer had to establish 
the clear need for a skill. The Minister of Home Affairs 
has said that the new law is an enormous improvement over 
the previous legislation and places South Africa on a par 
with other countries, especially with respect to investors 
and intra-company transfer permits. 
Southern African Customs Union 
South Africa has been a member of the Southern African 
Customs Union (SACU) since its inception in 1910. The SACU 
Agreement was renegotiated in 1969 following the 
independence of Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho. Namibia 
joined SACU in 1990. SACU aims to promote free trade and 
cooperation on customs matters among its five member 
states. There are currently no internal tariff barriers 
between SACU members but because of different tax regimes, 
there are some tax adjustments that occur at the borders. 
All SACU members except Botswana share a common currency as 
members of the Common Monetary Area. Imports from outside 
SACU are subject to a common external tariff. The SACU 
governments signed a new agreement in October 2002 setting 
out the responsibilities of the Council of Ministers, the 
Customs Union Commission, and the Secretariat. SACU began 
negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United 
States in June 2003. SACU has also concluded a revised 
trade agreement with the SADC countries that would 
eliminate almost all duties on SACU-SADC trade. 
 
Because of SACU, products from Botswana, Lesotho, 
Swaziland, and Namibia enter South Africa duty-free. In a 
few cases, products from these countries compete directly 
with U.S. goods that are subject to duties. For example, 
soda ash from Botswana comes into South Africa at a zero 
percent duty, whereas, soda ash from the U.S. faces a 5.5 
percent duty. South Africa does not produce soda ash, but 
the duty on imported soda ash was introduced for the 
benefit of Botswana. Moreover, a legal complaint from 
Botswana\'s soda ash producer under South Africa\'s 
competition law threatens to block U.S. exports. The South 
African Competition Commission has pursued the claim as a 
\"per se\" offense, without making any judgment on the U.S. 
soda ash producer\'s impact on competition or consumers. If 
the South African Supreme Court does not grant an appeal so 
that the legal merits of the case can be argued, U.S. soda 
ash exports would be adversely affected. If the tariffs on 
U.S. soda ash were eliminated, U.S. exports of soda ash to 
South Africa could increase from less than $8 million to 
$25 million, closer to its historical level.

SUBJECT: CLOUD CUCKOO-LAND\'S LAST REDOUBT: A VISIT TO ORANIA 
 
 
1.  Summary: A dusty little Karoo farm town situated an hour 
and a half south of Kimberly, Orania would be unexceptional 
except for one thing: all of its 600 residents are white 
Afrikaners.  Founded on the principles of self-reliance and 
preservation of Afrikaner culture, non-whites are not allowed 
to live or work in the town, which is privately owned.  The 
town even issues its own currency, the ora.  Town leaders and 
politicians hope that Orania will be the start of a new 
\"volkstaat\" (people\'s state) for Afrikaners.  Nonetheless, it 
was clear to Emboffs who visited recently that the town, with 
no discernible industry or new construction, is an entity of 
South Africa\'s past, not its future.  (Note on the title: 
Taken from an Aristophanes play, \"cloud cuckoo-land\" refers 
to a system or entity that is wildly impractical and was 
widely applied to apartheid South Africa and white-ruled 
Rhodesia in the 1970s and 1980s.)  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
BACKGROUND AND HISTORY 
---------------------- 
 
2.  Orania was originally built in 1964 by the Department of 
Water Affairs for workers on a dam on the Orange River.  The 
housing was mostly pre-fabricated but the village itself was 
quite well developed, with a church, school, post office, and 
many recreation facilities.  However, when work on the dam 
was completed in the mid-1980s, the town was almost 
completely abandoned and quickly deteriorated.  In 1990, the 
government decided to sell the town as a single entity and a 
group called the Afrikaner Freedom Movement purchased it for 
R1.5 million (at the time about $500,000).  The town 
officially opened in 1991, and soon purchased a large 
commercial farm nearby for agricultural development. 
 
3.  The stated aim of Orania is to provide a haven for 
Afrikaans and Afrikaner culture, which the town\'s leaders 
claim is threatened by demographics and the loss of political 
power in the new South Africa.  Conservative Afrikaners view 
the \"volkstaat,\" in which Afrikaners do not rely on outside 
labor or assistance, as the only means by which their 
community can survive and thrive in the 21st century. 
Orania, which has about 600 residents, applies these 
principles to everyday life.  All jobs, even the most menial, 
are held by Afrikaners, and the town operates its own school, 
medical clinic, library, and postal agency.  The economic 
base is agricultural, with town-owned farms that grow pecans, 
almonds, and olives. 
 
4.  The Freedom Front, a conservative Afrikaner party that 
holds 6 seats in the National Assembly, firmly supports the 
ideals of the \"volkstaat.\"  Poloff spoke with Jaco Mulder, 
the party\'s provincial leader in Gauteng, about Orania and 
how it fits with the party\'s aims.  Mulder said that while 
the Freedom Front does not fund Orania, he described the 
progress made there as \"excellent\" and thought that it could 
be the basis to show Afrikaners that the idea was 
sustainable.  He noted, however, that he did not expect the 
vast majority of Afrikaners to pick up stakes and move there, 
but that he would be happy if he could get well-to-do 
Afrikaners to financially support the community, \"as Jews 
abroad have long done for Israel.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
AN UNIMPRESSIVE PLACE TO VISIT 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  Emboffs visiting Kimberly decided to take a day trip to 
Orania on December 16, currently the Day of Reconciliation 
holiday but previously known as the Day of the Vow.  The Day 
of the Vow commemorated the 1838 Battle of Blood River, in 
which a small group of Afrikaner \"voortrekkers\" armed with 
rifles defeated a far larger Zulu army, in the process 
killing several thousand Zulus but with no loss of Afrikaner 
life.  The victors viewed this as a sign that they were 
blessed by God, and the Day of the Vow was long considered 
one of the most sacred holidays in the Afrikaner community. 
Given that this marks the 10th year since the holiday was 
changed to its present nomenclature, Emboffs suspected that 
there might be some sort of rally or event going on in the 
town.  Upon arriving, Emboffs saw that the town was 
practically deserted.  All shops save a bakery were closed, 
and there were few people in sight.  There were a few people 
at the town pool, and Emboffs witnessed a few backyard 
picnics despite temperatures that hovered around 100 degrees, 
but most residents appeared to be out of town for the 
holidays. 
 
6.  Emboffs spent a few hours driving around the town and 
observed a sleepy country town with few signs of growth or 
vitality.  While there were a handful of relatively new 
houses, most of the approximately 150 homes were clearly 
refurbished from the original town.  Most were well-kept, but 
quite small.  The roads, although in good condition, appeared 
to have not been retarred since they were built in the 1960s. 
 Upon driving into town, there were several signs (all in 
Afrikaans) for guesthouses, coffee shops, and other 
attractions, but nearly all were run out of private homes and 
not stand-alone businesses.  The two major attractions were 
the small museum and the home in which the widow of former 
Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, considered the primary 
architect of apartheid, spent her last years.  The yard is 
strewn with busts of the Prime Minister. 
 
7.  Immediately outside the town center is a small shopping 
center with about 8 stores and a garage.  Although closed, 
the town bookseller let Emboffs in her shop when she saw them 
looking through the window.  The shop was unexceptional, but 
she was able to change our rands into ora, the local 
currency.  The ora, which has the appearance of glossy 
Monopoly money, has pictures of plants, animals, and children 
on the front of the bills and advertisements for local 
businesses on the back.  The shopkeeper said the bills are 
printed in Kimberly.  She claimed that they are proving 
popular in other local towns, which also want to use the ora. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
NOT A TOWN WITH A PROMISING FUTURE 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  Although Emboffs were unable to interact with many local 
residents and hear their perspectives, it was clear that 
Orania is not a town on the rise.  While clean and orderly, 
there was no sign of expansion or new construction in the 
town, and even the town\'s website (www.orania.co.za) notes 
that growth is slow.  Simply put, Orania is in the middle of 
nowhere, and except for, as one resident told a reporter, 
\"old people running away from the blacks, and young people 
desperate to get jobs,\" there is nothing to draw people to 
this hot, dusty Karoo town.  Even Carel Boshoff, the town\'s 
founder and a son-in-law of Verwoerd, has told the press, \"If 
South Africa stays peaceful...then I do not think I will see 
the realization of a \'volkstaat\' in my lifetime.\"  Given the 
country\'s stability since 1994, and the unwillingness of 
urban Afrikaners to give up their comfortable lives to move 
to the bush, Emboffs saw no reason to disagree.

TAGS: SF, PGOV 
SUBJECT: ON A CLEAR DAY THEY CAN SEE 5 PERCENT-LIFE AMONG 
SOUTH AFRICA\'S MICRO-OPPOSITION 
 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Scott I. Hamilton 
Reason 1.4d 
 
1.  (C)  Summary: The ANC\'s dominance in the April national 
election has raised questions about the future viability of 
South Africa\'s opposition.  While the Democratic Alliance and 
Inkatha Freedom Party-which garnered 12 and 7 percent of the 
vote respectively-are probably too large and well-established 
to either fold or consolidate in the near to medium term, 
questions linger about the survival of South Africa\'s smaller 
opposition parties.  Currently, eight parties, which garnered 
between 0.25 and 2.28 percent of the vote, are represented in 
Parliament, and Poloffs over the past few months have been 
able to meet with representatives of five of them.  Their 
insights were extremely valuable, both on their own parties 
and the political spectrum writ large.  What Poloffs gathered 
was that although most small parties are nearly broke and 
recognize that their prospects for growth are limited, a 
combination of ideological zeal and personality politics will 
likely keep most of these parties going for the foreseeable 
future.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
ACDP: THE COMMITTED MORAL WATCHDOG 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Kenneth Meshoe\'s African Christian Democratic Party 
(ACDP) has been in existence since 1994 and garnered 1.6 
percent of the vote, and seven parliamentary seats, in the 
2004 election.  Bruce Harbour, the party\'s national chairman, 
told Poloff that while the ACDP\'s steady growth is 
encouraging (it garnered two seats in 1994 and six in 1999), 
many party leaders were disappointed in the result, as the 
party had campaigned far more extensively this year than it 
had in the past.  Harbour attributed this to the party\'s 
inability to capitalize on bread and butter issues.  While 
the party has been outspoken on such issues as corruption and 
age of consent laws, it has yet to enunciate clear plans on 
topics like housing and jobs.  Furthermore, Harbour said the 
ACDP is stuck between a rock and a hard place on cooperation 
with the ANC.  Relations with the ruling party are generally 
good-the ANC-dominated National Assembly even voted to send 
an ACDP member as one of South Africa\'s five Pan-African 
Parliament (PAP) representatives-and the ACDP generally 
supports ANC service delivery efforts.  However, this 
cooperation prevents the party from establishing a distinct, 
independent identity. 
 
3.  (C)  Asked about the possibility of amalgamation, Harbour 
said he did not see it in the cards for the ACDP.  While 
small, the party has a national presence, is demographically 
diverse, and its members are extremely committed (Harbour 
himself draws no salary).  He said that the party refused to 
compromise its stances on moral issues and would only 
consider merging with another party if it shared the same 
positions.  Harbour said that relations with the DA were not 
good, as the DA tried to block the election of the ACDP 
candidate to the PAP in favor of one of its own.  When asked 
about relations with the United Christian Democratic Party, 
which at least on paper the ACDP appears to share many 
values, Harbour said they were touchy, noting dryly that UCDP 
were not very focused on morality issues. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
UCDP: A HOMELAND PARTY IN A CHRISTIAN GUISE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The United Christian Democratic Party was formed in 
1994 from the remains of old Bophuthatswana National Party. 
The BNP, under strongman Lucas Mangope, governed the 
Bophuthatswana homeland from its establishment in 1971 until 
1994 and was widely known for its rampant corruption and 
toadiness toward the apartheid regime.  After the homeland\'s 
dissolution, the party reformed under its new name, with 
Mangope still at its head.  Although the party boycotted the 
1994 poll, it contested in 1999 and won 0.78 percent of the 
vote and in 2004, when it garnered 0.75 percent 
(approximately 118,000 votes).  The party has three 
parliamentarians-UCDP Deputy President Kgomotso Ditshetelo, 
Chairman Isaac Mfundisi, and Deputy Chairman Bafithile 
Pule-all of whom flew to Pretoria to have lunch with Emboffs 
in November.  (Note: Mangope represents the party in the 
Northwest Province provincial legislature, but Emboffs 
learned on a visit to the provincial parliament that Mangope 
has not been seen in the chambers since Feb 
ruary.  The MPs said that the party president is 
\"indisposed,\" a likely synonym for \"very ill.\"  End note.) 
 
5.  (C)  The MPs, who adhered to a very strict hierarchy when 
speaking, described the UCDP as a small provincial party that 
is severely short of funds.  Although the party had a 
relatively solid base in Northwest Province (which 
encapsulates much of the old homeland), it had only shell 
structures outside the province.  Hence, Ditshetelo said that 
the party\'s first order of business is to win control of 
Northwest Province so that the party could show that it can 
deliver services.  However, as with the ACDP, the UCDP 
described a relationship with the ANC in which they work 
together closely on delivery issues, particularly on 
parliamentary committees, but have a hard time establishing 
themselves as distinct.  Mfundisi said that since the 
election ANC MPs have been telling them that they need to 
talk about working together more closely.  When asked whether 
he thought such overtures might be designed to swallow up the 
UCDP, Mfundisi readily acknowledged the possibility. 
 
6.  (C)  When asked about the possibility of amalgamation, 
Ditshetelo said that no other party shared the UCDP\'s 
Christian, moral outlook and therefore he saw little 
opportunity for greater unity.  Ditshetelo went on to speak 
of the origin of the party\'s name, saying that when party 
leaders looked at the \"prosperity\" and \"great strides\" made 
by Bophuthatswana during its lifespan, they decided that only 
Jesus Christ could have been responsible.  (Comment: They may 
have confused Jesus with casino owner Sol Kerzner, whose Sun 
City resort was almost solely responsible for the homeland\'s 
limited development.  End comment.)  When asked about the 
ACDP, Ditshetelo said with disdain that the UCDP did not 
share the ACDP\'s fundamentalist, born-again approach.  He 
claimed that only born-again Christians could rise to the top 
of the ACDP, while the UCDP was more broadly based. 
 
------------------------------------ 
THE FREEDOM FRONT: A ONE-ISSUE PARTY 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Formed by General Constand Viljoen in 1994, the 
Freedom Front has since its inception sought to be the 
defenders of the Afrikaans language and Afrikaner culture. 
Although it finished fourth in the 1994 poll, with 2.2 
percent of the vote and 9 seats in Parliament, it has 
stagnated since, gaining just 0.80 percent in 1999 and 0.89 
this year.  It has six seats in Parliament.  Poloff met with 
Jaco Mulder, the party\'s Gauteng leader, who said that the 
party is almost solely devoted to the preservation of 
Afrikaans language rights, particularly in schools.  Mulder 
said that the government\'s commitment to multilingualism not 
only is hampering students\' ability to learn, but also made 
Afrikaners feel like strangers in their own land.  Hence, the 
party\'s modest goal was to convince Afrikaans-speakers that 
the Freedom Front was the only party that speaks for them. 
The problem, however, is that Afrikaners are increasingly 
voting for the DA because they view the DA as the only viable 
opposition party.  Overcoming this perception is a major 
obstacle, although he hoped the party\'s defense of Afrikaans 
language rights in Parliament would bolster its support. 
Except for a few very small Afrikaner parties, Mulder saw 
little possibility for consolidation. 
 
------------------------------------- 
ID: HIGH HOPES FOR THE NEWEST ARRIVAL 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  South Africa\'s newest opposition party, the 
Independent Democrats, was formed in 2003 by former 
Pan-African Congress Whip Patricia de Lille.  Widely admired 
for her independence and outspokenness, de Lille\'s personal 
popularity helped the party garner 1.7 percent of the vote 
and seven seats in Parliament.  Ideologically, the party can 
best be described as pragmatic populists, with a special 
emphasis on tackling unemployment, although the development 
of clear policies is still at an early stage.  Darryl 
Sutcliffe, an ID staffer in the Gauteng Legislature, told 
Poloffs that the party\'s goal is to develop clear policies on 
the bread and butter issues and move the focus away from 
Patricia de Lille.  Such a move is necessary if the party 
wants to grow into a national force, with Sutcliffe noting 
that the party has only nominal structures outside of 
Gauteng, Western Cape, and Northern Cape provinces. 
Sutcliffe also said it is important for the party to be seen 
as a constructive force and not consistently 
criticize the ANC.  He blasted the DA for going this route, 
saying its consistently negative statements earned it few 
friends among the majority of the populace.  Sutcliffe said 
he envisioned the ID working with other parties on select 
issues in the national and provincial legislatures, but that 
no party shared sufficiently similar outlooks to consider a 
closer overall relationship. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
PAC AND AZAPO: BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS PARTIES ON LIFE SUPPORT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Significant ideological players during the 
anti-apartheid struggle, both the Pan-African Congress and 
Azanian People\'s Organization have fallen on hard times since 
1994.  The PAC, which garnered just over 1 percent of the 
vote in 1994, garnered just 0.71 percent in 1999 and 0.73 
percent (and three seats) this year.  AZAPO, which did not 
contest the 1994 election, garnered a miniscule 0.17 percent 
in 1999 and 0.25 percent (and two seats) this year.  The PAC 
since the election has been riven by intense infighting, 
particularly between the national executive and the youth 
league.  Poloff was unable to meet with PAC President Motsoko 
Pheko to discuss party prospects, despite promises by his 
secretary to the contrary.  (Note: Numerous interactions with 
 
SIPDIS 
the PAC have shown them to be highly disorganized and 
difficult to contact.  They are the only major South African 
party to not maintain a website.  End note.) 
 
10.  (C)  Poloff was, however, able to meet with Strike 
Thokoane, AZAPO\'s Secretary of National Projects.  Thokoane, 
who was inspired to join the Black Consciousness movement by 
his friend Steve Biko, said that while the party\'s aims are 
similar to that of the ANC, AZAPO was still critical of the 
government\'s handling of the economy.  Despite the fact that 
party president Mosibudi Mangena serves as Minister for 
Science and Technology, the party had no plans to merge with 
the ANC.  Similarly, while AZAPO and PAC were discussing a 
unity pact, there were no plans to merge.  While 
acknowledging AZAPO\'s limited prospects, Thokoane said the 
party had always operated on a shoestring, and would continue 
to do so if need be. 
 
------------------------------- 
UDM: LOOKING LIKE A SPENT FORCE 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  Founded in 1997 by former Transkei homeland leader 
Bantu Holomisa and former National Party Cabinet Minister 
Roelf Meyer, the United Democratic Movement was meant to be 
the party that bridged racial and ethnic divides and mount a 
real challenge to the ANC.  Today, it finds itself reeling, 
unable to expand outside its Eastern Cape base or pronounce 
coherent policy.  Furthermore, it was the biggest loser in 
the September municipal floor-crossing, having lost 53 seats. 
 Its share of the vote in the national poll declined to 2.3 
percent from the 3.4 percent the party earned in 1999, and 
they hold just 9 seats in the National Assembly.  Poloffs 
were unable to meet with the party\'s national chairman 
despite repeated attempts.  Also curiously, the party\'s 
website has not been updated since August.  Something appears 
to be going on within the UDM, although what is not quite 
clear.  Whatever the case, Holomisa\'s previous ANC 
affiliation and the party\'s Eastern Cape base make it the 
prime candidate for a merger with the ruling party. 
 
------------------------------- 
MONEY TROUBLES ACROSS THE BOARD 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  One universal mentioned by every party 
representative is that they all have severe funding 
difficulties.  The ACDP\'s Harbour said that while the party\'s 
representation in Parliament entitled it to approximately R2 
million ($330,000) a year in state funding (he said the ANC 
gets approximately R30 million), he reckoned that a party 
needs upwards of R10 million a year to operate and grow 
beyond a marginal status.  Everyone noted the difficulty in 
raising money from private contributions-as Harbour put it, 
most private citizens regard politics as \"dirty business\" and 
do not want to contribute.  Contributions from overseas were 
almost non-existent, even from South Africans abroad.  Even 
more difficult was raising funds from the business community. 
 As the ANC controls every provincial government along with 
the national government, there is no incentive for private 
business to donate to small parties.  Several contacts said 
they knew of business leaders who are privately supportive of 
their parties, but that they were all scared that they would 
lose government contracts if they were known to contribute to 
anyone but the ANC. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
OUTLOOK: NO IMPETUS FOR CONSOLIDATION AT THE MOMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
13.  (C)  Overall, South Africa\'s micro-opposition is 
struggling both in terms of finances and members, but the 
parties will likely survive as long as the political will is 
there.  ANC dominance, especially after the merger of the New 
National Party, means that it does not need to spend its 
money and influence to induce any new coalition partners. 
Furthermore, while running on a shoestring, most contacts 
said their parties are careful about not spending more money 
than they have.  Looking at the parties individually, the 
ACDP and Freedom Front appear too ideologically driven to 
fold, while the ID\'s encouraging early results and enthusiasm 
will likely keep it running in the medium term.  The Minority 
Front, a Durban-based party with a large Indian constituency 
and two MPs, has a lock on a niche constituency and no 
apparent reason to give it up.  PAC and AZAPO are already, in 
essence, ANC partners, and PAC in particular would have to 
sort out its internal mess before the ANC would consider 
gobbling it up.  The UCDP is an ego vehicle for Mangope, and 
while his death could set off a push to join the ANC, 
Ditshetelo definitely seems to have his eyes on the reins. 
This leaves the UDM, which strikes Poloff as the most 
vulnerable to being subsumed by the ruling party.  Such a 
deal, however, would likely be contingent on a Cabinet slot 
for Holomisa, and it does not appear that the ANC, already 
dominant in Eastern Cape, needs the UDM enough to submit to 
such a demand.

           DECEMBER 23, 2004 ISSUE 
 
 
 1. Summary.  Each week, AMEmbassy Pretoria publishes an 
 economic newsletter based on South African press reports. 
 Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect the 
 opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
 newsletter are: 
 -  Consumer Prices Increase Slightly Above Expectations; 
 -  Western Cape Looks at Increasing Taxes; 
 -  ICASA Proposes New Price Cap; 
 -  Strong Rand May Subdue Inflation; 
 -  Court Rules Against Pharmaceutical Pricing Regulations; 
 and 
 -  South Africa\'s Leading Business Indicator Still 
 Increasing. 
 End Summary. 
 
 CONSUMER PRICES INCREASE SLIGHTLY ABOVE EXPECTATIONS 
 --------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 2.  In November, both overall consumer prices (CPI) and 
 targeted inflation (CPIX, consumer prices less mortgages) 
 increased above market expectations and above last month\'s 
 inflation.  CPI and CPIX increased 3.7 percent (y/y) and 
 4.6 percent, slightly above the market expectations of 3.6 
 and 4.4 percent, and above October\'s increases of 2.4 and 
 4.2 percent, respectively.  Targeted inflation (CPIX) is 
 expected to slow to 4 percent over the next three months 
 as relatively lower expected fuel costs and the strong 
 rand keep inflation under control.  Major reasons for the 
 4.6 percent increase in CPIX include:  (1) annual 
 increases in the price indices for transport (+1.1 
 percentage points); (2) housing (+0.8 of a percentage 
 point); (3) medical care and health expenses (+0.7 of a 
 percentage point); (4) food (+0.5 of a percentage point); 
 (5) education (+0.4 of a percentage point); (6) fuel and 
 power (+0.3 of a percentage point); and (7) household 
 operation (+0.3 of a percentage point).  Source:  Nedbank, 
 Economic Research; I-Net Bridge, December 22. 
 
 3.  Comment.  While November inflation figures were 
 slightly higher than expected, the strong rand will 
 support a favorable short-term inflation outlook.  Recent 
 lower oil prices will also lead to further expectations of 
 interest rate reductions during the next Monetary Policy 
 Committee meeting in February.  End comment. 
 
 WESTERN CAPE LOOKS AT INCREASING TAXES 
 -------------------------------------- 
 
 4.  Western Cape is considering increasing hospitality and 
 commercial property development taxes as a way of 
 generating development funds for the province.  The 
 additional income is expected to offset the pressures 
 escalating social spending is placing on the provincial 
 economic development budget.   The studies investigating 
 the feasibility of these new taxes should be completed by 
 next year for the national government\'s approval.  The 
 province has applied to the National Treasury for the 
 approval to charge a fuel levy of 10 rand cents/liter on 
 motorists, which will raise about R300 million ($53 
 million, using 5.7 rands per dollar) for road, rail and 
 other economic infrastructure maintenance.  If the 
 province gets approval, the taxes may be imposed by the 
 end of next year.  A 10 percent tax on commercial property 
 development would raise about R250 million ($44 million) 
 annually on this year\'s provincial development projects of 
 about R2.5 billion ($440 million) for social housing and 
 property development in low-income areas, while a 
 hospitality tax could raise about R100 million ($17 
 million) annually for use in training and marketing of 
 Western Cape\'s tourism industry.  Source:  Business Day,

 ICASA PROPOSES NEW PRICE CAP 
 ---------------------------- 
 
 5.   The Independent Communications Authority of South 
 Africa (ICASA) is proposing that future price increases of 
 Telkom (the telecommunication parastatal) be limited to 
 four percentage points below the rate of the CPIX 
 (consumer inflation less mortgages), used as the inflation 
 target by the South African monetary authorities. 
 Currently, the regulations state that Telkom caps its 
 annual price increase to 1.5 percentage points below 
 targeted inflation.  According to Telkom, the company\'s 
 revenue would fall by R625 million ($110 million) if the 
 new price-capping regulations were approved.  (Telkom 
 stated that a percentage point price increase translated 
 into an increase in revenue of R250 million ($44 
 million)).  Telkom itself proposed a cap of two percentage 
 points below inflation.   In 2003, Telkom received R40.6 
 billion ($5.4 billion, using 7.56, the average 2003 rand 
 per dollar exchange rate) in revenues and an operating 
 profit of R9.2 billion ($1.2 billion).  Telkom has already 
 filed a new price list for January 1 that lifts the cost 
 of local calls by 5.5 percent and raises the cost of an 
 overall basket of services by 0.15 percent. However, those 
 price changes would have to be amended under the new 
 rules.  ICASA hopes Communications Department Minister 
 Matsepe-Casaburri will approve its new regime in January, 
 and it would ask Telkom to file new tariffs within 30 
 days.  Telkom said if it must alter its tariffs again, it 
 should have until August 1, which would be less 
 \"confusing,\" and would let its new prices be calculated on 
 its financial figures for the year to next March.  Source:

 STRONG RAND MAY SUBDUE INFLATION 
 -------------------------------- 
 
 6.  The rand\'s renewed surge in the past two months has 
 improved the inflation outlook for 2005 despite strong 
 domestic spending, surging credit demand and rising unit 
 labor costs.   The rand has gained about 12 percent 
 against a basket of trade-weighted currencies since the 
 beginning of the year, and is expected to remain firm next 
 year on the back of dollar weakness.  According to Nedcor 
 bank economists, the rand strength will hold into 2005 
 because of expected high commodity prices, positive 
 investment sentiment due to potential sovereign risk 
 rating upgrades, lower interest rates and stronger local 
 growth.  According to a group of economists surveyed by I- 
 Net Bridge, CPIX is expected to edge up to 4.3 percent 
 year on year in November, while producer price inflation 
 should increase 2.3 percent year on year from 1.9 percent 
 in October.  According to Nedcor bank, the rand is 
 expected to gain a further 10 percent against the dollar 
 in 2005.  Source:  December 20, Business Day. 
 
 COURT RULES AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING REGULATIONS 
 --------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 7.  The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled against the 
 Department of Health\'s pharmaceutical pricing regulations 
 by stating that the proposed dispensing fees were not 
 appropriate.  According to the court, the regulations did 
 not consider the viability of the dispensing industry and 
 the single exit price introduced a price control 
 mechanism, which the Medicines and Related Substances Act 
 had not intended.  The Department of Health raised 
 jurisdictional issues since the Cape High Court denied the 
 industry a chance of appeal.  The Supreme Court of Appeal 
 dismissed these issues of jurisdiction by ruling that the 
 Cape High Court\'s delay in granting leave to appeal was so 
 unreasonable as to breach the constitutional right to a 
 fair hearing.  The regulations provided for a pricing 
 system that defined a single exit price of manufacturers 
 and a dispensing fee, which, for pharmacists, amounted to 
 R16 without a medical prescription and R26 with a 
 prescription.  The court did not challenge government\'s 
 right to administer prices but stated that the lack of any 
 document describing how dispensing fees were calculated 
 meant that the government did not consider the long-term 
 viability of the retail drug sector. The Health Department 
 was ordered to pay the court costs.  Source:  Independent 
 Foreign Service, December 20; Business Day, December 21. 
 
 8.  Comment.  The Health Department plans to file an 
 appeal against this court judgment in the Constitutional 
 Court (equivalent to the U.S. Supreme Court), stating that 
 international experts regarded the pricing regulations as 
 reasonable and beneficial to consumers.  According to the 
 department, the single exit price set by drug 
 manufacturers since June 2004 reduced the price of 
 medicines by 19 percent.  Drug retailers have long argued 
 that the dispensing fee set by the government was so low 
 that many retailers would be forced to close.  Until the 
 Constitutional Court rules, the existing price regulations 
 have been rescinded and pharmacists are again entitled to 
 charge varied dispensing fees, while manufacturers can 
 charge different prices to different buyers.  End comment. 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA\'S LEADING BUSINESS INDICATOR STILL INCREASING 
 --------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 9.  South Africa\'s leading business cycle indicator is 
 still showing growth, increasing to 115.5 in October, 
 after September\'s rise to 115.1.  The business cycle 
 indicator has been rising since May 2003, as the economy 
 is experiencing economic growth above inflation.  The 
 third quarter GDP growth of 5.6 percent is significantly 
 higher than October\'s 4.2 percent CPIX\'s (consumer prices 
 less mortgage costs) increase.  Economic data and business 
 confidence over the past few months point to a 
 continuation of strong economic growth.  The export sector 
 has shown growth, but strong domestic demand has supported 
 continued manufacturing growth.  The leading indicator 
 signals possible changes in the business cycle by six to 
 twelve months and uses information on value of orders, job 
 advertisements, productivity and average hours worked per 
 factor worker as its components.  Source:  Business Day,

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  Summary.  Every two weeks, USEmbassy Pretoria publishes a 
public health newsletter highlighting South African health 
issues based on press reports and studies of South African 
researchers.  Comments and analysis do not necessarily reflect 
the opinion of the U.S. Government.  Topics of this week\'s 
newsletter cover:  Blood Bank Drops Race as a Risk Factor; 
Genetic Discovery Brings AIDS Vaccines Closer; South African 
Vaccine Search; Study Focuses on Human Cost of AIDS; AIDS 
Infections Peaking in KZN; South African Children Victim of 
Fire; and Court Rules Against Pharmaceutical Pricing 
Regulations.  End Summary. 
 
Blood Bank Drops Race as a Risk Factor 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  The South African National Blood Service said that it would 
revise its controversial profiling system to enable it to risk- 
rate donors without using race.  To ensure patient safety, the 
current system would remain in place until the new model was 
developed, said the organization\'s CEO, Prof Anthon Heyns.  The 
developments follow a politicized row that the organization 
found itself embroiled in last week, after it emerged that it 
used race as one factor to risk-rate blood donors for possible 
HIV infection.  It was reported that blood donated by black and 
coloured donors was routinely discarded; although it later 
emerged that the organization destroyed only some of the blood 
products from those donors. The organization used low-risk 
blood products such as plasma, which can be treated to destroy 
HIV and discarded high-risk components such as red cells, from 
which the virus cannot be eradicated.  It said race-based risk 
rating was necessary as there was a higher incidence of HIV 
among blacks than other races in SA.  Although all donated 
blood is screened for HIV, the tests are unable to detect it in 
someone who has been recently infected.  Following a meeting 
with officials from the Health Department on Friday, the 
organization issued a statement saying it had agreed that it 
was unacceptable to use race as a risk-determinant.  It said 
its risk model was flawed because it was too heavily weighted 
for race, and would be \"appropriately modified to identify the 
profile of a safe donor without taking race into account\".  The 
new risk model would be developed by a committee of experts 
from the SA Blood Service, the Health Department, the Medical 
Research Council, the Council for Scientific and Industrial 
Research, and National Health Laboratory Services.  The 
committee has been given until the end of January to devise the 
new risk-rating system.  Source:  Business Day, December 14. 
 
Genetic Discover Brings AIDS Vaccines Closer 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  An international study, involving South African scientists 
published in Nature shows which category of immune cells are 
actually fighting the HIV virus, which may be the first step 
towards finding ways of circumventing the virus\'s ability to 
avoid vaccines by rapid mutation.  Professor Coovadia and Dr. 
Kiepiela from the University of KwaZulu-Natal worked with the 
Partners Aids Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital 
on the study.  The researchers found that the human leukocyte 
antigen B molecules (HLA-B), which send an alarm to the T cells 
when a virus or foreign body is present, were important in 
fighting the HIV virus, while the HLA-A and HLA-C were 
ineffective.  Patients who had particular HLA-B molecules coped 
better with HIV infection and had a lower viral load.  Infected 
pregnant mothers with a protective version of HLA-B were more 
likely to survive and less likely to pass the infection to 
their infant at birth.  The three-year research program was 
conducted in communities hardest hit by the HIV epidemic, most 
of which are in Africa.  Source:  The Sunday Independent, 
Sunday Times, December 12. 
 
South African Vaccine Search 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  In South Africa, efforts to find a HIV/AIDS vaccine are led 
by the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI), operating 
with a budget of $15 million per year, focusing on molecular 
biology engineering.  SAAVI was formed in 1999 by the 
government and Eskom (an electricity parastatal) in a public- 
private partnership to coordinate the research, development and 
testing of a HIV/AIDS vaccine in South Africa.  The Departments 
of Health and Science and Technology along with Eskom, Transnet 
(a transportation parastatal) and Impala Platinum have 
contributed its major funding.  SAAVI focuses on the 
development of subtype C HIV/AIDS vaccines, as this subtype 
accounts for more than 90 percent of infections in Southern 
Africa.  Globally, most HIV vaccines that have been tested to 
date have been developed for the subtype B virus.  There is no 
conclusive evidence as yet showing that a vaccine based on one 
subtype of HIV will or will not protect against infection with 
another HIV subtype.  There are two phase-one trials of 
possible HIV/AIDS vaccines started in South Africa last year. 
There are another two products that are in the ethics and 
regulatory approval processes preceding phase one and could 
possible go into trials soon.  Estimates are that there are 
more than two dozen different designs for a preventive AIDS 
vaccine currently on trial internationally.  The two current 
South African trial sites, enrolling only volunteers, are at 
the University of the Witwatersrand HIV/AIDS Vaccine Division 
of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at the Chris Hani 
Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg, and the SAAVI Clinical 
Trial Unit at the Medical Research Council in Durban.  Two 
additional trial locations in Cape Town and Orkney (North West 
Province) will be added to future sites.  Source:  Engineering

Study Focuses on Human Cost of AIDS 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  \"The Demographic Impact of HIV/AIDS in South Africa: 
National Indicators for 2004\", compiled by the Medical Research 
Council\'s Burden of Disease Research Unit, the Center for 
Actuarial Research and the Actuarial Society of South Africa, 
highlights on the human costs of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  The 
study was based on the latest antenatal clinic results, death 
register information and data on HIV/AIDS interventions.  In 
2004, HIV/AIDS related diseases have killed 311,000 people and 
5 million out of 46 million South Africans were HIV-positive. 
By the end of 2004, 600,000 children under 18 will have lost 
their mothers to AIDS, and by 2015, 2 million children will be 
maternal orphans.  The estimate of 5 million infected people 
was about a third lower than previous estimates, because 
condoms, voluntary testing and ARV treatment are starting to 
impact infections.  The incidence of HIV infections passed its 
peak in all age and gender groups between 1997 and 2001, except 
for males in the 15-24 age group, which is projected to peak 
around 90,000 new infections in 2006.  According to the 2004 
ASSA model, the national average life expectancy is just under 
50 years old.  The model also suggests that in 2005, around 
500,000 people need ARV treatment.  Currently 19,500 HIV- 
positive people are on public sector provided treatment and 
45,000 are on private sector dispensed treatment.  Women from 
the ages of 15-49 account for 2.55 million of all HIV 
infections to date, while HIV prevalence peaks between the ages 
of 25-29 for females and 30-34 for males.  The HIV virus is 
responsible for a declining annual population growth rate, from 
a high of 2.7 percent in 1994-96 to 0.8 percent in 2004; and a 
projected 0.3 percent by 2015.  The most economically active 
segment of the population, aged 35 to 49 will not grow by 2015. 
By 2015, 743,000 South Africans will need ARV treatment.

AIDS Infections Peaking in KZN 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  The rate of new HIV and Aids infections appears to have 
peaked in KwaZulu-Natal, according to Professor Alan Whiteside, 
the head of the Health, Economics and HIV and Aids Division at 
the University of KwaZulu-Natal.  The latest research showed an 
increase in the number of orphans, and a greater burden on 
provincial health care.  Whiteside\'s department had been 
conducting a four-year study into the effects of HIV and Aids 
on orphans in the Newcastle area.  He said that while the 
incidence of orphans in the area was growing, research had 
shown that the community was coping with the problem.  He 
commended the quality of the care given to HIV/AIDS patients in 
KZN provincial hospitals.  Whiteside said the South African 
authorities would have to formulate a \"new agenda\" to deal with 
the effects of HIV/Aids by the time of the next election in 
2009.  By then, the government would have a better idea of the 
impact of HIV/Aids.  Source:  The Mercury, December 13. 
 
South African Children Victim of Fire 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  An estimated 1,100 children younger than five are burnt to 
death each year, most dying in their own homes.  A Medical 
Research Council study found fires account for about two 
percent of deaths in children aged one and four.  In the five 
to nine age group, fire accounts for four percent of all 
deaths.  The Fire Protection Association of SA reports that 
more than 10 percent of fire emergency calls involve homes. 
Open flames, electrical faults and cooking are the most common 
causes, says the association.  Burns specialist Dr Ian Thompson 
says most child-burn patients are injured at home due to not 
being supervised. Often, in the case of informal dwellings, a 
sleeping child is burnt when the structure catches fire. 
Sepsis, or the infection of burn wounds, causes up to 85 
percent of deaths.  Serious burn injuries not only result in 
physical trauma but in severe psychological trauma.  Source: 
Cape Argus, December 11. 
 
Court Rules Against Pharmaceutical Pricing Regulations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8.  The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled against the Department of 
Health\'s pharmaceutical pricing regulations by stating that the 
dispensing fees proposed by the regulations were not 
appropriate because they did not consider the viability of the 
dispensing industry and that the regulations relating to the 
single exit price introduced a price control mechanism, which 
the Act had not intended.  The Department of Health raised 
jurisdictional issues since the Cape High Court denied the 
industry a chance of appeal.  The Court of Appeal dismissed 
these issues of jurisdiction by ruling that the Cape High 
Court\'s delay in granting leave to appeal was so unreasonable 
as to breach the constitutional right to a fair hearing.  The 
regulations provided for a pricing system that defined a single 
exit price of manufacturers and a dispensing fee, which, for 
pharmacists, amounted to R16 without a medical prescription and 
R26 with a prescription.  The court did not challenge 
government\'s right to administer prices but stated that the 
lack of any document describing how dispensing fees were 
calculated meant that the government did not consider the long- 
term viability of the retail drug sector. The Health Department 
was ordered to pay the court costs.  Source:  Independent 
Foreign Service, December 20. 
 
9.  Comment.  The Health Department has signaled that it would 
file an appeal against this court judgment in the 
Constitutional Court (equivalent to the U.S. Supreme Court), 
stating that international experts regarded the pricing 
regulations as reasonable and beneficial to consumers. 
According to the department, the single exit price set by drug 
manufacturers since June 2004 reduced the price of medicines by 
19 percent.  Drug retailers have long argued that the 
dispensing fee set by the government was so low that many 
retailers would be forced to close.  Until the Constitutional 
Court rules, the existing price regulations have been rescinded 
and pharmacists are again entitled to charge varied dispensing 
fees, while manufacturers can charge different prices to 
different buyers. End comment.

1. (U) SUMMARY.  A series of Ministerial decisions to 
liberalize South Africa\'s telecommunications sector by 
February 2005 led to an industry-wide colloquium to discuss 
the intent behind the determinations.  The Independent 
Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) considered 
feedback from the colloquium in releasing proposed 
regulations for value-added network service (VANS) 
providers.  The proposed VANS regulations would allow self- 
provisioning, the resale of spare capacity, voice over 
Internet Protocol, and access to standard telecommunications 
numbering.  The regulations also propose that VANS sell 30 
percent of their firms to historically disadvantaged 
individuals (HDIs).  Public comments on the proposed 
regulations may be submitted until January 7, 2005.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) In September 2004, Minister of Communications Ivy 
Matsepe-Casaburri announced a series of policy decisions to 
liberalize South Africa\'s telecommunications sector by 
February 2005.  In addition to removing a number of 
legislative restrictions and requirements placed on various 
operators and service providers, the measures (\"Ministerial 
Determinations\") are intended to facilitate growth and 
competition in the communications sector; create greater 
choice for operators and service providers in acquiring 
facilities and managing spare capacity on their networks; 
liberalise the public payphone market segment and enhance 
Internet connectivity in schools and tertiary educations 
across South Africa by mandating a discounted fee for 
service and connectivity. 
 
3.  (U) In October 2004, the Independent Communications 
Authority of South Africa (ICASA) hosted a two-day public 
colloquium to solicit industry feedback on the Minister\'s 
determinations.  Entrenched industry players such as Sentech 
and Telkom argued that it was a misinterpretation of the 
Ministerial Determinations to say that VANS would be allowed 
to self-provide their own infrastructure.  Others from the 
industry said that the Minister made the announcement in the 
context of promoting greater competition and liberalization 
within the telecommunication sector.  Consequently, they 
said, the determinations should be interpreted in the most 
liberal way possible. 
 
4.  (SBU) Following the colloquium, a senior ICASA official 
told Econoff that the regulator intended to interpret the 
Ministerial Determinations in the most liberal way possible 
within the framework of the Telecommunications Act.  He also 
said that the Determinations highlighted the need for well- 
developed interconnection agreements and numbering plans and 
that ICASA would be working on those as well. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
PROPOSED VANS REGULATIONS - SELF PROVISION, EMPOWERMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  (SBU) In somewhat ambiguous language, the regulations 
propose to allow VANS to self-provide their own facilities. 
A senior ICASA official told Econoff that the regulations\' 
definition for \"self-provision\" means: a) VANS can purchase 
approved telecommunications equipment from a registered 
equipment supplier to build their own infrastructure; OR b) 
VANS can procure their facilities from a telecommunications 
service licensee including mobile operators, private 
telecommunications network providers (e.g., Transnet, 
Eskom), other VANS with spare capacity, Telkom, the Second 
National Operator (SNO), and potentially Sentech. 
 
6.  (SBU) Econoff also questioned the official about 
proposed empowerment targets in the regulations.  The 
official responded that ICASA\'s mandate includes evaluating 
potential licensees on their inclusion of historically 
disadvantaged individuals (HDIs).  Econoff suggested that 
the regulator defer to industry empowerment targets and 
Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) Codes of Good Practice 
to prevent potential conflicts.  For example, it\'s 
conceivable that a VAN is awarded an exemption from the 
equity ownership requirement by its industry Charter council 
only to find that the regulator requires it to have 30 
percent in the hands of HDIs.  It\'s reasonable that in such 
a case, DTI-approved industry charters would prevail given 
DTI\'s legislative mandate over all things pertaining to 
black economic empowerment (BEE). 
 
7.  (U) Another point of concern is a proposed increase in 
the application fee from R6000 ($1000) to R30,000 ($5000). 
Critics say the proposed hike in the application fee creates 
an added barrier to entry for smaller players, limiting 
competition.  Andries Matthysen, ICASA\'s senior manager for 
licensing enforcement, numbering and administration, says, 
however, that the recommended increase in the application 
fee is justified because of the proposed new license rights 
for VANS such as carrying voice over Internet Protocol, self- 
provisioning, reselling spare capacity, and access to 
standard telecommunications numbering (allowing VANS to 
interconnect with the Telkom network). 
 
8.  (U) A copy of the proposed regulations will be emailed 
to AF/S.

SUBJECT: Poverty in South Africa: Two New Studies 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified; Protect Accordingly.  Not 
for Internet Distribution. 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Two new studies provide 
additional insight on poverty in South Africa.  A 
report by the Development Policy Research Unit at the 
University of Cape Town provides additional evidence 
that South Africa has made progress in the provision 
of socio-economic services and infrastructure such as 
education and access to electricity, water and 
sanitation.  A new study by the Human Sciences 
Resource Council, a government research institution, 
found that in income terms poverty has not changed 
significantly between 1996 and 2001.  In fact, 
households living in poverty have sunk deeper into 
poverty, and the gap between rich and poor, 
regardless of race, has widened.  The findings 
themselves are not new, but rather provide further 
evidence of South Africa\'s mixed record on economic 
development over the last ten years.  Government 
poverty alleviation initiatives mitigate some of this 
disparity, but recent large increases in the number 
of beneficiaries are straining both national and 
provincial budgets.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Access to Social Services and Infrastructure Improves 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (U)  The Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU) 
at the University of Cape Town studied poverty based 
on access to assets and services. It did not analyze 
poverty based on income.  Using their access to 
assets or services approach, the DPRU report found 
that 68.5 percent of households lived in formal 
dwellings in 2001, up from 64 percent in 1996. 
Access to clean water also improved, increasing from 
80 percent of households to 84.5 percent of 
households.  Sanitation improved with 59.1 percent of 
households having a flush or chemical toilets 
compared to 50.3 percent in 1996.  Households with 
electricity for lighting increased from 58 percent to 
70 percent between 1996 and 2001; electricity for 
cooking, however, rose only from 47.1 percent to 51.4 
percent.  Households receiving refuse removal at 
least one a week from a government organization 
institution grew from 51 percent to 55 percent. 
 
3.  (U)  The DPRU report found that there had been a 
marked improvement in education attainment since 1996 
with the proportion of the population with a high 
school or higher education climbing from 22.6 percent 
to 28.8 percent.  The proportion of the population 
with no schooling dropped slightly from 19.3 percent 
to 17.9 percent.  The report notes that these figures 
reflect quantitative increases but not necessarily 
qualitative improvements.  In fact, a study early 
this year by Stellenbosch University found that while 
the SAG had equalized spending across racial lines 
the quality of education had declined. 
 
4. (SBU)  Comment: The increases in access to 
services and the improvements in housing support data 
published last year in the Government of South 
Africa\'s review of ten years of democracy.  The 
government and many commentators have noted the 
successes of government in improving housing and 
access to basic services.  To help make the figures 
more understandable, in order to improve the percent 
of households in formal dwellings from 64 percent to 
68.5 percent in five years, government had to provide 
housing to an additional 190,000 formal houses or 
nearly a million homes during this period. 
Electricity was supplied to an additional 1.7 million 
households or 335,000 per year. 
 
----------------------- 
Income Inequality Grows 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  The Human Sciences Resource Council (HSRC) 
study looked at poverty in terms of income.  Income 
was defined using household budget surveys and thus 
reflects only formal income, not the value of items 
produced and grown by the household or transfers the 
household received from government or members of the 
family resident elsewhere.  HSRC found that 
approximately 57 percent of South Africans were 
living below the poverty income line in 2001, 
unchanged from 1996.  Limpopo and Eastern Cape 
provinces had the highest proportions of poor with 77 
percent and 72 percent of their populations living 
below the poverty income respectively.  Western Cape 
and Gauteng had the lowest proportion in poverty, 32 
percent and 42 percent respectively. 
 
6.  (U)  To measure the depth of poverty, the HSRC 
study calculated the \"poverty gap,\" the annual income 
transfer to all poor households required to bring 
them out of poverty.  HSRC found that the poverty gap 
has grown from R56 billion in 1996 to R81 million in 
2001, indicating that poor households had fallen 
deeper into poverty.  The poverty gap has also grown 
faster than the economy.  In 1996, the total poverty 
gap was equivalent to 6.7 percent of the GDP; by 2001 
it had risen to 8.3 percent. 
 
7.  (U)  This growth in poverty is reflected in a 
rise in inequality between rich and poor.  According 
to the study, South Africa\'s Gini coefficient (a 
measure of income inequality where zero equals 
perfect equality and one equals perfect inequality) 
had grown from 0.69 in 1996 to 0.77 in 2001.  In the 
past inequality in South Africa was largely defined 
along racial lines.  The HSRC report, however, 
indicates that inequality within each of South Africa 
four racial groups has grown substantially.  For 
African South Africans the Gini coefficient rose for 
0.66 to 0.72, for Whites from 0.50 to 0.60, for 
\"colored\" South Africans from 0.56 to 0.64 and for 
Asian South Africans from 0.52 to 0.60. 
 
8.  (SBU)  The HSRC study used a poverty line 
developed by the South African Advertising Research 
Foundation (SAARF), which is toward the lower end of 
most poverty lines.  Choosing a different poverty 
line would affect the quantitative results but is 
unlikely to alter the conclusion that poverty has 
increased.  Government disputes the HSRC figures 
because they do not include government transfers or 
private remittances.  HSRC\'s Gini coefficient is 
higher than other recent studies.  For example, the 
SAG in its \"Toward Ten Years of Freedom\" report 
calculated a coefficient of 0.57 in 2000, and recent 
University of Cape Town report estimated 0.60 in 
2003.  Whichever figure one uses, income inequality 
in South Africa remains among the highest in the 
world. 
 
9. (SBU)  Comment: There is no government-accepted 
poverty line in South Africa.  Most studies have 
worked on the international definitions of either 
US$1 or US$2 per day.  The World Bank estimated 
poverty using $2 per day at 36 percent in 2001 
compared to 34 percent in 1995.  The US dollar based 
definitions have unfortunate consequences in an era 
of volatile exchange rates.  In South Africa the rand 
has doubled in value against the US dollar in the 
last three years.  This means a poverty line of one 
dollar a day was R12.15 in the beginning of 2002, but 
is R5.65 now; some people whose income halved during 
this period might have actually moved from being poor 
to being non-poor by the usual international 
definition.  A major study in 2002 found that 46 
percent of South Africans were poor based on SA\'s 
minimum living standards survey (equal to US$1.60 per 
person per day).  The SAARF definition used by the 
HSRC, by being based in assets and rands, does not 
have the problem of being based in US dollars. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Poverty Alleviation Stains Budget 
--------------------------------- 
 
10.  (U)  Government programs that provide grants to 
children, disabled and elderly South Africans are one 
of several government poverty alleviation 
initiatives, although given recent large increases in 
the number of grant beneficiaries, these initiatives 
are straining both national and provincial budgets. 
Two million people joined the list of grant 
beneficiaries between April and September alone, 
pushing the total number of beneficiaries to nine 
million - or one out of every five South Africans. 
Welfare and social security spending constitute the 
fastest growing share of overall expenditures, 
increasing from 18.6 percent of total government 
expenditures in FY2004 to 20 percent by FY2007.  The 
government now spends R50 billion on social grants 
and current estimates suggest that welfare grants 
will comprise over 40 percent of the government\'s 
expenditure increases over the next three years.  As 
evidence of the its concern over escalating welfare 
costs, government recently granted extensions for 
indemnity to fraudulent grant recipients and began to 
investigate more systematically instances of welfare 
fraud.

1.  On Thursday January 6, Nelson Mandela told reporters at 
his home in Houghton that his son Makgatho, who had been 
hospitalized since late November, had died of AIDS.  Mandela 
noted that talking about such diseases was the only way to 
stop people from \"regarding it as extraordinary and for 
which people will go to hell and not to heaven.\" 
 
2.  The acknowledgement from Mandela, given his stature and 
influence, is a courageous and critical contribution to 
reducing the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in South Africa. 
For this reason, and in support of our strong partnerships 
in addressing AIDS in South Africa through the President\'s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, we recommend that President 
Bush send a brief letter of condolence to former President 
Mandela.  A suggested text is provided below. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Dear President Mandela, 
 
I write to convey my heartfelt condolences on the death of 
your son and eldest child Makgotho. 
 
Also, I commend your forthrightness in publicly announcing 
that the cause of Makgotho\'s death was HIV/AIDS.  Your 
disclosure will go a long way to destigmatizing AIDS, adding 
to your many contributions in addressing the challenges of 
AIDS. 
 
My government remains committed to working in partnership 
with the South African government and private sector in 
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care through the 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 
 
Laura and I send our personal condolences to you and your 
family and we will hold you in our prayers during this time 
of great sorrow. 
 
With deepest sympathy,

 IMF REPORT ON SOUTH AFRICAN INVESTMENT 
 -------------------------------------- 
 
 2.  A recent study by the International Monetary Fund 
 (IMF) highlights South Africa\'s foreign investment profile 
 from 1994 to 2002.  South Africa has had no problem 
 attracting foreign investment, however, the type of 
 investment that it attracts is worrying from an economic 
 growth perspective.  South Africa attracts far less 
 foreign direct investment (FDI) compared to emerging peer 
 countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and 
 South Korea.  However, South Africa surpasses other 
 emerging market economies in attracting portfolio 
 investment.  According to the IMF study, during the period 
 1994 to 2002, average net inflows of FDI into SA amounted 
 to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared 
 with just 3 percent of GDP in 16 other emerging markets. 
 Excluding the large FDI transactions, such as Telkom\'s 
 partial privatization in 1997 and the Anglo American 
 takeover of De Beers in 2001, FDI fell to an average of 
 0.7 percent of GDP over the eight-year period.  During 
 1994 to 2002, the share of foreign investment in capital 
 flows was 88 percent in other peer countries, while the 
 FDI share amounted to only 30 percent in South Africa. 
 Although the FDI share in SA has increased to 50 percent 
 during the 2000 to 2002 period, mostly due to the slowdown 
 in equity flows, it remains well below that in other 
 emerging market countries.  Because of its long -term 
 horizon, FDI is more conducive to economic growth and job 
 creation by helping the transfer of technology and 
 improving the skill levels of the labor force.  The study 
 shows that South Africa attracts far more portfolio 
 investment than its peers, with inflows as a proportion of 
 GDP amounting to almost double that of other emerging 
 markets.  During the period 1997 to 2000, portfolio 
 inflows into South Africa averaged 5 percent of GDP, with 
 South Africa benefiting from an exodus of capital from 
 Asia during that period.  According the study, more than 
 70 percent of portfolio inflows during the period 1994 to 
 2002 went into the equity market, with SA attracting more 
 equity flows than other emerging markets.   The IMF study 
 shows that South Africa\'s trade openness is far lower than 
 other emerging markets.   Other factors where South Africa 
 ranks low are its economic growth performance, 
 infrastructure and crime levels.  The study also shows 
 that exchange rate volatility has a crucial role to play, 
 with lower volatility likely to boost FDI, but probably 
 reduce portfolio investment.  The rand is one of the most 
 volatile currencies in the world. The currency has doubled 
 in value against the dollar after reaching a record low of 
 R13.85/$1 in December 2001.  The IMF says the South 
 African Reserve Bank\'s (SARB) steady build-up of foreign 
 exchange reserves will help reduce exchange rate 
 volatility.   In 2004, SARB eliminated its foreign 
 exchange debt leading to recent increases in its gross 
 reserves, although the level of reserves remain low 
 compared to other emerging markets.  Source:  Business 
 Day, January 5; IMF Country Report No. 04/379. 
 
 GOVERNMENT SET TO MEET 3.2 PERCENT BUDGET DEFICIT TARGET 
 --------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 3.  The government expects to meet its revised deficit 
 target of 3.2 percent of gross domestic product this 
 fiscal year, according to consultancy Econometrix. 
 Government revenue grew 17.9 percent in November, 
 substantially higher than the full year budgeted revenue 
 growth of 9.6 percent.  November\'s revenue growth meant 
 that revenue for the first eight months of the 2004/05 
 fiscal year increased 11.7 percent.  Company tax revenue 
 fell sharply, but growth in personal tax revenue, transfer 
 duties, excise duties and the fuel levy more than made up 
 for low corporate tax growth.  Government expenditure in 
 November increased 16.1 percent y/y, above the full year 
 budgeted growth of 13.1 percent.  Growth in expenditure 
 for the first eight months was 11.2 percent, less than the 
 budgeted growth rate.  Econometrix predicts little problem 
 in financing its increased infrastructural spending in the 
 current fiscal year, although future infrastructural 
 spending needs are significant.  Source:  Business Report, 
 January 4. 
 
 GASOLINE PRICES TO DECLINE IN FEBRUARY 
 -------------------------------------- 
 
 4.  The Department of Minerals and Energy announced that 
 the retail price of 97 octane unleaded petrol is 
 anticipated to drop by 52 rand cents a liter, and the 
 wholesale price of diesel containing 0.05 percent sulphur 
 to decrease by 39 rand cents a liter in February. 
 Unleaded and leaded 93-octane petrol should decrease by 44 
 rand cents a liter.  Even though fuel prices should 
 significantly decline in February, corresponding decreases 
 in transport and food prices are not expected because of 
 sustained consumer spending and fuel costs being a small 
 percentage of input costs.  Expectations for food prices 
 and transport costs remain constant due to increased 
 maintenance costs and wage pressures.  Source:  Pretoria 
 News, January 4. 
 
 ECONOMIC FORECASTS FOR 2005 
 --------------------------- 
 
 5.   Many economists and analysts did not predict the 
 rand\'s crash at the end of 2001, and most did not foresee 
 the rand\'s subsequent strength.  But after three 
 successive years of gains, analysts have come around to 
 the view that the rand\'s strength may continue.   ABSA 
 bank economist Karen Smith-Ford says the rand could end 
 the year at about R5.63 to the dollar, similar to its 
 current trading levels.  The dollar will be the wild card 
 this year with more weakness expected because of the U.S. 
 economy\'s current account and fiscal deficits.  A sharp 
 move in the dollar poses the risk of boosting the rand 
 further into overvalued territory, and putting more strain 
 on the export sector as exports become less uncompetitive. 
 The strong rand, however, will continue to be good news 
 for inflation, as import prices remain low and domestic 
 producers restrict price increases in order to remain 
 competitive against cheap imports.  Economists expect that 
 the targeted inflation measure CPIX (consumer inflation 
 excluding mortgage costs) will remain comfortably within 
 the 3 to 6 percent target range for this year.  Standard 
 Bank economist Elna Moolman says CPIX will probably remain 
 at the bottom half of the target range for most of the 
 year, peaking at 4.4 percent and averaging 3.9 percent for 
 the full year.  The low inflation numbers could leave 
 enough room for the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to 
 lower interest rates again this year, economists say. 
 Efficient Group economist Nico Kelder says rates could be 
 cut by about 0.5 percentage points next month, and 
 possibly again in April.  The SARB kept its repurchase 
 rate unchanged at 7.5 percent in December, citing high 
 domestic spending and uncertainty about the rand\'s 
 strength as potential inflation risks.  Domestic spending 
 gave a boost to economic growth last year, lifting it to 
 an eight-year high of 5.6 percent in the third quarter (on 
 a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis).  Efficient 
 Group\'s growth forecasts are higher than most, with gross 
 domestic product (GDP) estimated to rise 5.7 percent this 
 year, up from an expected 3.8 percent in 2004.  Kelder 
 says domestic demand will continue to drive the local 
 economy, but exports are likely to show more substantial 
 growth in the face of a fairly stable exchange rate. 
 Despite the higher growth rates, economists concur that 
 this is unlikely to make a significant dent into the 
 unemployment numbers. South Africa\'s official unemployment 
 rate, counting only those who are actively looking for 
 work stands at 27.8 percent, or 4.6 million people. The 
 unemployment rate increases to 41.2 percent, or 8.4 
 million people, when discouraged job seekers are included. 
 The Efficient Group expects the current account deficit to 
 increase, reaching R45 billion ($7.9 billion using 5.7 
 rands per dollar), or 3.2 percent of GDP in 2005, slightly 
 worse than last year\'s estimated deficit of R40 billion, 
 or 3 percent of GDP.  Source:  Business Day, January 4. 
 
 SERVICE SECTOR SETA FACES FUNDING CRISIS 
 ---------------------------------------- 
 
 6.  The Services Sector Education and Training Authority 
 (SETA) has declared a moratorium on new learnerships 
 (apprenticeships) until at least July.  The SETA said 
 resumption of its primary activity of starting 
 learnerships in the services sector would be \"subject to 
 sufficient discretionary funding availability and 
 satisfactory conclusion of quality assurance issues.\"  The 
 90,000 companies registered with the SETA will continue 
 paying their skills development levies a total of about 
 R40 million ($7 million using 5.7 rands per dollar) a 
 month to the South African Revenue Service without being 
 able to obtain the benefits for which they are paying. 
 About 80 percent of the fees revert to the SETA, which 
 means that, for at least six months, more than R190 
 million ($33 million) will be used either to pay the 
 authority\'s debts or to maintain its infrastructure. 
 Dozens of companies have disputed comments made recently 
 by a SETA spokesperson that claimed that creditors had 
 been paid just before the SETA closed on December 15 for 
 the holiday season.  Numerous organizations, including the 
 South African Chamber of Business (SACOB), said they had 
 received no money despite promises of payment.  According 
 to SACOB\'s CEO James Lennox, the Labor Department as well 
 as the SETAs have repeatedly asserted that the skills 
 development levy (which amounts to 1 percent of a 
 company\'s payroll) is not a tax.  The impact of the 
 service sector SETA\'s actions might be that companies that 
 are participating in learnerships and sponsored skills 
 programs will refuse to participate in the government\'s 
 job creation initiatives, especially the smaller companies 
 not having enough cash flow to pay the SETA without 
 receiving any benefits.  One creditor, the X-Pert project 
 management group, is owed nearly R10 million ($1.7 
 million) with the amount increasing by more than R700,000 
 a month because it is carrying the costs for more than 400 
 apprentices, 55 of whom have physical or other 
 disabilities for which the SETA is responsible.  Source:

SUBJECT: RESTRUCTURING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTRICITY 
INDUSTRY -- THE SUPPLY SECTOR 
 
 
    1. (U) Introduction:  In light of recent government 
    initiatives to restructure the South African energy industry, 
    post will submit separate reports on the supply, distribution 
    and transmission sectors.  Each cable will serve as a general 
    review of that sector, and be the launch-pad from which 
    subsequent cables on specific topics are prepared, as 
    developments take place in each sector.  The first, dealing 
    with the supply sector, follows.  The purpose of these cables 
    is to indicate the potential opportunities for investment, 
    technology and service providers created by the energy- 
    restructuring program.  End introduction. 
 
    --------------------------------- 
    Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) 
    --------------------------------- 
 
    2. (U) Summary: At the beginning of this decade, in the 
    absence of new supply, the South African Government concluded 
    that demand for electricity would soon overtake existing 
    generation capacity.  Government tasked the National Energy 
    Regulator (NER) to develop a National Integrated Resource 
    Plan (NIRP) for insuring security of future supply.  The 
    first NIRP was completed and published in March 2002.  At the 
    beginning of 2003, the NER established an Advisory and Review 
    Committee (ARC) to solicit stakeholder contributions to the 
    NIRP process.  The updated study (October 2003), generated 
    under the guidance and approval of the NER, was carried out 
    by a NIRP team comprising the Eskom Resources and Strategy 
    Group (headed by their Managing Director, Dr Steve Lennon), 
    the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of the University of Cape 
    Town, and the NER. 
 
    3. (U) In the early seventies Eskom forecast an electricity 
    growth rate of 8%, and consequently built and commissioned a 
    number of six-pack (six generation units per station) coal- 
    fired stations.  In the middle of the construction program, 
    the demand growth rate dropped as low as minus 0.4%, causing 
    a serious over capacity, and three of the stations - Camden, 
    Komati and Grootvlei - were \"mothballed\".  Decommissioning 
    ended in about 1990.  The excess capacity allowed Eskom to 
    become the lowest cost producer of electricity in the world. 
    Eskom\'s tracking of electricity consumption identified a 
    significant increase in demand (from about 2000), and they 
    forecast that new peaking capacity would be required by 2007, 
    and new base load capacity by 2011.  In October 2003, the 
    NIRP-team updated the 20-year energy supply plan based on the 
    new demand projections, and estimated capital expenditure of 
    some $17 billion to 2010.  The main purpose of the plan was 
    to identify the most cost-effective and environmentally 
    friendly combination of options and technologies available to 
    ensure South Africa of a timely, reliable and quality supply 
    of electricity in the future.  Schedules and technologies 
    will inevitably change over time as new developments occur. 
    End summary. 
 
    Current Capacity and Technology Mix 
    ----------------------------------- 
 
    4. (U) South Africa\'s total licensed generation capacity is 
    about 44,000 MW of which Eskom (state-owned electricity 
    utility) owns 42,000 MW.  Eskom mothballed 3,600 MW of 
    capacity in 1990 and their total net operating capacity (NOC) 
    at December 31, 2003 was 36,200 MW.  Coal-fired stations 
    generate 86% of the electricity, nuclear 5%, pumped-storage 
    4%, hydro 2%, emergency gas turbines 1%, and 2% is imported 
    from the Cahora Bassa hydro station in Mozambique. 
 
    5. (U) Eskom currently operates 10 large coal-fired power 
    stations, a two-reactor 1,800 MW nuclear station (Koeberg 
    located 30 kilometers north of Cape Town), six small hydro 
    stations, and two pumped-storage schemes that play a critical 
    role in meeting peak demand.  Municipalities own 22 small 
    power stations and back-up gas turbines, but these total only 
    5% of national generation capacity and generally run at low 
    load factors.  Municipalities also own the transmission lines 
    and the transformers located within their boundaries. 
    Private generators comprise the remaining 2% of capacity.  In 
    2003, the peak demand was 32,000 MW, equal to 89% of NOC. 
    Estimated demand growth is at least 1,000 MW per annum, and 
    the current growth rate stands at around 4.6%. 
 
    6. (U) According to Mike Cary, Managing Director of Rotek 
    Engineering an Eskom group engineering company, a 
    complicating factor to the capacity problem is that the power 
    stations are ageing.  The ages of the newest stations vary 
    between 10 and 24 years, and the equipment on these stations 
    can be as old as 30 years.  Although Eskom has a 
    comprehensive maintenance program, the old equipment is more 
    prone to failure.  Part of the risk-management strategy is to 
    carry spares, but financial constraints limit this option. 
    Over the past 12 months, Eskom has experienced an abnormally 
    high failure rate (14 major supply disruptions in the 
    Johannesburg area alone) and some of the plant transformers 
    have failed to such an extent that some critical spares are 
    no longer available. 
 
    ----------------------- 
    Eskom\'s Expansion Plans 
    ----------------------- 
 
    7. (U) Government decided in 1998 to restructure Eskom and to 
    establish a multi-market model (MMM) for electricity trade in 
    South Africa.  During the four-year model planning process, 
    Eskom submitted its investment program for new electricity 
    capacity (as its contribution to the NIRP) on an annual 
    basis.  The estimated cost of the expansion program was about 
    $32 billion (over 20 years), and aimed to ensure that South 
    Africa had enough electricity to power its growing economy. 
 
    8. (U) However, during this time Eskom became a virtual \"on- 
    looker\" as government decided that Eskom would not be allowed 
    to build any new generation capacity as the government wanted 
    to have the MMM in place before the excess capacity ran out. 
    Eskom, however, remained the supplier of last resort and 
    obligated to ensure sufficient supply to the country.  Part 
    of the plan to restructure Eskom was to sell 30% of their 
    generation capacity, valued at more than $4 billion, to 
    foreign power utilities.  Due to a policy shift, this process 
    remained in limbo.  Eskom and Government now face crucial 
    decisions about new power plants, and the balancing of 
    financial, operational and environmental criteria in 
    selecting the type and mix of energy projects it should 
    develop. 
 
    9. (U) Following the April 2004 elections, new Public 
    Enterprise Minister Alec Erwin (Eskom\'s shareholder 
    department) rescinded the \"restructuring\" of Eskom.  This was 
    part of a general policy shift aimed at strengthening State 
    Owned Enterprises to ensure that the social objectives of 
    government would be met first.  Erwin fast-tracked the go- 
    ahead for new investment in electricity supply, as outlined 
    in the NIRP.  On October 20, the Cabinet approved $13.5 
    billion in capital expenditure for Eskom to return to service 
    the mothballed stations, build 70% of new capacity, and 
    upgrade existing stations, transmission lines, and 
    distribution networks.  Government expects Eskom to source 
    much of this capital from the markets.  Erwin also \"offered\" 
    independent power producers (IPP\'s), particularly foreign 
    utilities, a 30% slice of the proposed new generation 
    capacity.  In this way, he hopes to ensure healthy 
    competition for Eskom and to attract foreign direct 
    investment into the infrastructure sector of the country 
    without damaging Eskom\'s ability to lead the expansion drive. 
    Steve Lennon, Eskom\'s Managing Director for Resources and 
    Strategy, has stated that the investment decision was in time 
    to avoid early supply disruptions in 2006 and 2010. 
 
    Short-Term Expansions to 2010 
    ----------------------------- 
 
    10. (U) The latest update of the NIRP\'s power expansion 
    strategy (October 2003) deals with expansions envisaged up to 
    2022.  The first phase deals with immediate electricity needs 
    over the next five years.  This requires Eskom and IPP\'s to 
    add at least 1,000 MW of capacity every year, from 2005 to 
    2010, to avoid shortages during peak usage time.  The 
    investment package portions the $13.5 billion as $9.7 billion 
    for generation, $2.2 billion for distribution, and $1.6 
    billion for transmission.  The plan is for Eskom to return to 
    service three coal-fired stations between 2005 and 2011 -- 
    total base-load capacity of 3,600 MW.  In addition, Eskom is 
    to build a new 1,000 MW open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) plant 
    by 2007 (location not specified), and by mid 2005 the DME 
    plans to request the private sector to tender for a 1,000 MW 
    OCGT plant (location not specified), fueled by a light diesel 
    distillate, to be operational by 2008. 
 
    Longer-Term Expansions - 2011-2022 
    ---------------------------------- 
 
    11. (U) By 2010 Eskom will have to start commissioning power 
    plants that will add to the base load for which planning will 
    start in 2005.  According to Lennon, the program was based on 
    the forecast of an increase in demand of 1.5%-4% per year 
    over the next 20 years.  However, there are contingency plans 
    for an uptake of 5% should demand exceed estimates.  The long- 
    term base load capacity would include a combination of new 
    power plants and imports of electricity from a number of 
    African projects.  Capacity increases include: 
    -- a $0.7 billion, 1,330 MW pumped-storage scheme at 
    Braamhoek in KwaZulu/Natal Province, by 2013, 
    -- a $0.8 billion, 1,000 MW pumped-storage scheme at 
    Steelpoort in Mpumalanga province, by 2014, 
    -- a third 1,000 MW pumped-storage facility at Monontsa in 
    the Free State province, and planned for 2019, 
    -- a $1.4 billion, 1,500 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) 
    facility, possibly located near Coega (new deep water port 
    under construction) in the Eastern Cape Province, by 2013, 
    -- three generation units (total rated capacity of nearly 
    2,000 MW) added to the six already operating at the Mathimba 
    power station in Limpopo Province, at a cost of $3.2 billion, 
    -- a 4,000 MW greenfields coal-fired power station, at an 
    estimated cost of almost $6.4 billion, near coal reserves in 
    either Limpopo or Mpumalanga provinces, or in neighboring 
    Botswana or Mozambique. 
    Summary of Capacity Expansions to 2022 
    -------------------------------------- 
 
    12. (U) Some electricity expansion options considered by the 
    NIRP team extend beyond the 2022 time-period, but are shown 
    for information completeness.  Obviously, these technologies 
    and time schedules will change over time as energy demand, 
    innovations and other developments occur.

    Total possible new capacity                       9,570 
 
    PBMR 
    ---- 
 
    13. (U) According to Lennon, environmental criteria are 
    critically important in deciding the combination of new power 
    plants to be developed.  This could benefit non-coal 
    projects, as Eskom\'s coal-fired plants are the chief emitters 
    of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.  Environmental 
    considerations could also provide a boost to development of 
    South Africa\'s fourth-generation nuclear-based pebble bed 
    modular reactor (PBMR), which could be ready for commercial 
    launch by 2013, and features in Eskom\'s long-term expansion 
    plans, from about 2015 onwards.  The capacity of a single 
    PBMR reactor unit is 165 MW, and that of an 8-pack cluster, 
    1,320 MW.  Johan Kriek, CEO of PBMR Ltd, plans to start 
    construction of a PBMR demonstration unit in the second 
    quarter of 2007, the first commercial unit by 2013, and to 
    supply Eskom with 24 units (three clusters) between 2013 and 
    2023.  Lennon said that negotiations have started in the 
    process to develop a PBMR supply agreement between PBMR Ltd 
    and Eskom. 
 
    Imports 
    ------- 
 
    14. (U) The African electricity import projects on the Eskom 
    drawing board include Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, the 
    proposed Inga3 hydro-electric project in the DRC, and buying 
    surplus power from the Southern African Power Pool, as 
    available.  Lennon said that part of Eskom\'s strategy could 
    be to put equity into Cahora Bassa, depending on the 
    financial details of such a deal.  In addition, in November 
    2004, the South African utility was one of five Southern 
    African utilities that bought equal equity stakes in Westcor, 
    the company earmarked to build the $5 billion power station 
    at Inga3, and the associated transmission and interconnect 
    supply lines.  The project has the potential to supply 3,500 
    MW of electricity by 2011, but many experts believe this to 
    be an unrealistic target, given the political (and 
    investment) uncertainties in the DRC. 
 
    Status of the Expansion Plan 
    ---------------------------- 
 
    15. (U) The first phase of the expansion, dealing with 
    new capacity over the next five years, is well under 
    way.  Eskom has commissioned the return to service of 
    three mothballed power stations at a total cost of $1.9 
    billion.  These three facilities, when refurbished, 
    should supply 3,600 MW to the grid.  The largest of the 
    three, Camden, is set to return to service in 2005.  The 
    DME has also authorized Eskom to build a new 1,000 MW 
    open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) plant by 2007 (location 
    not specified), and a 1330 MW pumped-storage station 
    (Braamhoek) by 2013, as part of a $13.5 billion 
    investment.  In December, the DME issued an IPP 
    \"Expression of Interest\" document for a 1,000 MW OCGT 
    facility (location not specified), fueled by a light 
    diesel distillate, to be operational by 2008.  The 
    tender document should be available by August 2005, and 
    Eskom, as the purchaser of the electricity, cannot bid 
    for the project.  The final leg of Eskom\'s short-term 
    revamp will be to upgrade a number of its older base- 
    load stations, including a $160 million upgrade of the 
    2,100 MW Arnot station.  Through demand and supply side 
    efficiency-improvement strategies, Eskom management 
    plans to take 4,000 MW out of the system by 2013. 
 
    Financing the Expansions 
    ------------------------ 
 
    16. (U) Eskom spokesman, Fani Zulu, has indicated that Eskom 
    would finance the $13.5 billion expansion for the first three 
    years through a combination of cash flows and loan financing. 
    After that, Eskom is likely to revert to the local and 
    offshore capital markets.  Eskom, has a relatively low 30% 
    gearing, and has some room on its balance sheet to raise its 
    debt level.  A crucial part of the financing would be the 
    electricity price, which the NER determines.  The regulator 
    has recently granted Eskom below-inflation tariff increases, 
    but Minister Erwin has backed Eskom\'s call for more realistic 
    prices to enable the huge capital expenditure requirement. 
 
    17. (U) In summary, the main conclusions drawn from the 
    latest NIRP study by energy experts, are that: 
    -- Options for diversifying away from coal-fired plants are 
    insufficient to meet forecast electricity demand over the 
    next 20-years, 
    -- Economic justification for diversification plants would 
    prove difficult in the absence of persuasive measures such as 
    penalties and subsidies for non-use or use, 
    -- Clean coal technologies and demand side efficiency 
    strategies are required to meet environmental standards, 
    -- Base load plants would be required for commercial 
    operation after 2010, 
    -- At assumed future costs, and after returning the Eskom 
    mothballed plants to service, fluidized bed combustion (FBC) 
    technology offers the most economical option, followed by 
    coal-fired plants, and then CCGT plants (in the western 
    Cape), using imported gas/LNG, 
    -- NIRP plans indicate that 920 MW OCGT peak load plants must 
    begin commissioning from 2008, 
    -- NIRP plans assume the attainment and sustainability of 
    demand side management targets, power plant availability, 
    imports, and interruptible supply strategies, 
    -- short-term peak-load requirements can be facilitated using 
    single cycle gas turbines fueled by locally-produced 
    synthetic gas.

PURPOSES 
 
1. (U) Introduction:  In light of recent government 
initiatives to restructure the South African energy 
industry, post will submit separate reports on the 
supply, distribution and transmission sectors.  Each 
cable will serve as a general review of that sector, and 
be the launch-pad from which subsequent cables on 
specific topics are prepared, as developments take place 
in each sector.  The first, dealing with the supply 
sector, follows.  The purpose of these cables is to 
indicate the potential opportunities for investment, 
technology and service providers created by the energy- 
restructuring program.  End introduction. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Summary: At the beginning of this decade, in the 
absence of new supply, the South African Government 
concluded that demand for electricity would soon overtake 
existing generation capacity.  Government tasked the 
National Energy Regulator (NER) to develop a National 
Integrated Resource Plan (NIRP) for insuring security of 
future supply.  The first NIRP was completed and 
published in March 2002.  At the beginning of 2003, the 
NER established an Advisory and Review Committee (ARC) to 
solicit stakeholder contributions to the NIRP process. 
The updated study (October 2003), generated under the 
guidance and approval of the NER, was carried out by a 
NIRP team comprising the Eskom Resources and Strategy 
Group (headed by their Managing Director, Dr Steve 
Lennon), the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of the 
University of Cape Town, and the NER. 
 
3. (U) In the early seventies Eskom forecast an 
electricity growth rate of 8%, and consequently built and 
commissioned a number of six-pack (six generation units 
per station) coal-fired stations.  In the middle of the 
construction program, the demand growth rate dropped as 
low as minus 0.4%, causing a serious over capacity, and 
three of the stations - Camden, Komati and Grootvlei - 
were \"mothballed\".  Decommissioning ended in about 1990. 
The excess capacity allowed Eskom to become the lowest 
cost producer of electricity in the world.  Eskom\'s 
tracking of electricity consumption identified a 
significant increase in demand (from about 2000), and 
they forecast that new peaking capacity would be required 
by 2007, and new base load capacity by 2011.  In October 
2003, the NIRP-team updated the 20-year energy supply 
plan based on the new demand projections, and estimated 
capital expenditure of some $17 billion to 2010.  The 
main purpose of the plan was to identify the most cost- 
effective and environmentally friendly combination of 
options and technologies available to ensure South Africa 
of a timely, reliable and quality supply of electricity 
in the future.  Schedules and technologies will 
inevitably change over time as new developments occur. 
End summary. 
 
Current Capacity and Technology Mix 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) South Africa\'s total licensed generation capacity 
is about 44,000 MW of which Eskom (state-owned 
electricity utility) owns 42,000 MW.  Eskom mothballed 
3,600 MW of capacity in 1990 and their total net 
operating capacity (NOC) at December 31, 2003 was 36,200 
MW.  Coal-fired stations generate 86% of the electricity, 
nuclear 5%, pumped-storage 4%, hydro 2%, emergency gas 
turbines 1%, and 2% is imported from the Cahora Bassa 
hydro station in Mozambique. 
 
5. (U) Eskom currently operates 10 large coal-fired power 
stations, a two-reactor 1,800 MW nuclear station (Koeberg 
located 30 kilometers north of Cape Town), six small 
hydro stations, and two pumped-storage schemes that play 
a critical role in meeting peak demand.  Municipalities 
own 22 small power stations and back-up gas turbines, but 
these total only 5% of national generation capacity and 
generally run at low load factors.  Municipalities also 
own the transmission lines and the transformers located 
within their boundaries.  Private generators comprise the 
remaining 2% of capacity.  In 2003, the peak demand was 
32,000 MW, equal to 89% of NOC.  Estimated demand growth 
is at least 1,000 MW per annum, and the current growth 
rate stands at around 4.6%. 
6. (U) According to Mike Cary, Managing Director of Rotek 
Engineering an Eskom group engineering company, a 
complicating factor to the capacity problem is that the 
power stations are ageing.  The ages of the newest 
stations vary between 10 and 24 years, and the equipment 
on these stations can be as old as 30 years.  Although 
Eskom has a comprehensive maintenance program, the old 
equipment is more prone to failure.  Part of the risk- 
management strategy is to carry spares, but financial 
constraints limit this option.  Over the past 12 months, 
Eskom has experienced an abnormally high failure rate (14 
major supply disruptions in the Johannesburg area alone) 
and some of the plant transformers have failed to such an 
extent that some critical spares are no longer available. 
 
----------------------- 
Eskom\'s Expansion Plans 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) Government decided in 1998 to restructure Eskom 
and to establish a multi-market model (MMM) for 
electricity trade in South Africa.  During the four-year 
model planning process, Eskom submitted its investment 
program for new electricity capacity (as its contribution 
to the NIRP) on an annual basis.  The estimated cost of 
the expansion program was about $32 billion (over 20 
years), and aimed to ensure that South Africa had enough 
electricity to power its growing economy. 
 
8. (U) However, during this time Eskom became a virtual 
\"on-looker\" as government decided that Eskom would not be 
allowed to build any new generation capacity as the 
government wanted to have the MMM in place before the 
excess capacity ran out.  Eskom, however, remained the 
supplier of last resort and obligated to ensure 
sufficient supply to the country.  Part of the plan to 
restructure Eskom was to sell 30% of their generation 
capacity, valued at more than $4 billion, to foreign 
power utilities.  Due to a policy shift, this process 
remained in limbo.  Eskom and Government now face crucial 
decisions about new power plants, and the balancing of 
financial, operational and environmental criteria in 
selecting the type and mix of energy projects it should 
develop. 
 
9. (U) Following the April 2004 elections, new Public 
Enterprise Minister Alec Erwin (Eskom\'s shareholder 
department) rescinded the \"restructuring\" of Eskom.  This 
was part of a general policy shift aimed at strengthening 
State Owned Enterprises to ensure that the social 
objectives of government would be met first.  Erwin fast- 
tracked the go-ahead for new investment in electricity 
supply, as outlined in the NIRP.  On October 20, the 
Cabinet approved $13.5 billion in capital expenditure for 
Eskom to return to service the mothballed stations, build 
70% of new capacity, and upgrade existing stations, 
transmission lines, and distribution networks. 
Government expects Eskom to source much of this capital 
from the markets.  Erwin also \"offered\" independent power 
producers (IPP\'s), particularly foreign utilities, a 30% 
slice of the proposed new generation capacity.  In this 
way, he hopes to ensure healthy competition for Eskom and 
to attract foreign direct investment into the 
infrastructure sector of the country without damaging 
Eskom\'s ability to lead the expansion drive.  Steve 
Lennon, Eskom\'s Managing Director for Resources and 
Strategy, has stated that the investment decision was in 
time to avoid early supply disruptions in 2006 and 2010. 
 
Short-Term Expansions to 2010 
----------------------------- 
 
10. (U) The latest update of the NIRP\'s power expansion 
strategy (October 2003) deals with expansions envisaged 
up to 2022.  The first phase deals with immediate 
electricity needs over the next five years.  This 
requires Eskom and IPP\'s to add at least 1,000 MW of 
capacity every year, from 2005 to 2010, to avoid 
shortages during peak usage time.  The investment package 
portions the $13.5 billion as $9.7 billion for 
generation, $2.2 billion for distribution, and $1.6 
billion for transmission.  The plan is for Eskom to 
return to service three coal-fired stations between 2005 
and 2011 -- total base-load capacity of 3,600 MW.  In 
addition, Eskom is to build a new 1,000 MW open cycle gas 
turbine (OCGT) plant by 2007 (location not specified), 
and by mid 2005 the DME plans to request the private 
sector to tender for a 1,000 MW OCGT plant (location not 
specified), fueled by a light diesel distillate, to be 
operational by 2008. 
 
Longer-Term Expansions - 2011-2022 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) By 2010 Eskom will have to start commissioning 
power plants that will add to the base load for which 
planning will start in 2005.  According to Lennon, the 
program was based on the forecast of an increase in 
demand of 1.5%-4% per year over the next 20 years. 
However, there are contingency plans for an uptake of 5% 
should demand exceed estimates.  The long-term base load 
capacity would include a combination of new power plants 
and imports of electricity from a number of African 
projects.  Capacity increases include: 
-- a $0.7 billion, 1,330 MW pumped-storage scheme at 
Braamhoek in KwaZulu/Natal Province, by 2013,

Summary of Capacity Expansions to 2022 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12. (U) Some electricity expansion options considered by 
the NIRP team extend beyond the 2022 time-period, but are 
shown for information completeness.  Obviously, these 
technologies and time schedules will change over time as 
energy demand, innovations and other developments occur.

1 Nuclear Pebble Bed cluster of 8 reactor units 1,320 
1 Coal-fired                                    3,780 
1 Pumped-storage                                1,000 
Total possible new capacity                     9,570 
 
PBMR 
---- 
 
13. (U) According to Lennon, environmental criteria are 
critically important in deciding the combination of new 
power plants to be developed.  This could benefit non- 
coal projects, as Eskom\'s coal-fired plants are the chief 
emitters of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. 
Environmental considerations could also provide a boost 
to development of South Africa\'s fourth-generation 
nuclear-based pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR), which 
could be ready for commercial launch by 2013, and 
features in Eskom\'s long-term expansion plans, from about 
2015 onwards.  The capacity of a single PBMR reactor unit 
is 165 MW, and that of an 8-pack cluster, 1,320 MW. 
Johan Kriek, CEO of PBMR Ltd, plans to start construction 
of a PBMR demonstration unit in the second quarter of 
2007, the first commercial unit by 2013, and to supply 
Eskom with 24 units (three clusters) between 2013 and 
2023.  Lennon said that negotiations have started in the 
process to develop a PBMR supply agreement between PBMR 
Ltd and Eskom. 
 
Imports 
------- 
 
14. (U) The African electricity import projects on the 
Eskom drawing board include Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, 
the proposed Inga3 hydro-electric project in the DRC, and 
buying surplus power from the Southern African Power 
Pool, as available.  Lennon said that part of Eskom\'s 
strategy could be to put equity into Cahora Bassa, 
depending on the financial details of such a deal.  In 
addition, in November 2004, the South African utility was 
one of five Southern African utilities that bought equal 
equity stakes in Westcor, the company earmarked to build 
the $5 billion power station at Inga3, and the associated 
transmission and interconnect supply lines.  The project 
has the potential to supply 3,500 MW of electricity by 
2011, but many experts believe this to be an unrealistic 
target, given the political (and investment) 
uncertainties in the DRC. 
Status of the Expansion Plan 
---------------------------- 
 
15. (U) The first phase of the expansion, dealing with 
new capacity over the next five years, is well under way. 
Eskom has commissioned the return to service of three 
mothballed power stations at a total cost of $1.9 
billion.  These three facilities, when refurbished, 
should supply 3,600 MW to the grid.  The largest of the 
three, Camden, is set to return to service in 2005.  The 
DME has also authorized Eskom to build a new 1,000 MW 
open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) plant by 2007 (location not 
specified), and a 1330 MW pumped-storage station 
(Braamhoek) by 2013, as part of a $13.5 billion 
investment.  In December, the DME issued an IPP 
\"Expression of Interest\" document for a 1,000 MW OCGT 
facility (location not specified), fueled by a light 
diesel distillate, to be operational by 2008.  The tender 
document should be available by August 2005, and Eskom, 
as the purchaser of the electricity, cannot bid for the 
project.  The final leg of Eskom\'s short-term revamp will 
be to upgrade a number of its older base-load stations, 
including a $160 million upgrade of the 2,100 MW Arnot 
station.  Through demand and supply side efficiency- 
improvement strategies, Eskom management plans to take 
4,000 MW out of the system by 2013. 
 
Financing the Expansions 
------------------------ 
 
16. (U) Eskom spokesman, Fani Zulu, has indicated that 
Eskom would finance the $13.5 billion expansion for the 
first three years through a combination of cash flows and 
loan financing.  After that, Eskom is likely to revert to 
the local and offshore capital markets.  Eskom, has a 
relatively low 30% gearing, and has some room on its 
balance sheet to raise its debt level.  A crucial part of 
the financing would be the electricity price, which the 
NER determines.  The regulator has recently granted Eskom 
below-inflation tariff increases, but Minister Erwin has 
backed Eskom\'s call for more realistic prices to enable 
the huge capital expenditure requirement. 
 
17. (U) In summary, the main conclusions drawn from the 
latest NIRP study by energy experts, are that: 
-- Options for diversifying away from coal-fired plants 
are insufficient to meet forecast electricity demand over 
the next 20-years, 
-- Economic justification for diversification plants 
would prove difficult in the absence of persuasive 
measures such as penalties and subsidies for non-use or 
use, 
-- Clean coal technologies and demand side efficiency 
strategies are required to meet environmental standards, 
-- Base load plants would be required for commercial 
operation after 2010, 
-- At assumed future costs, and after returning the Eskom 
mothballed plants to service, fluidized bed combustion 
(FBC) technology offers the most economical option, 
followed by coal-fired plants, and then CCGT plants (in 
the western Cape), using imported gas/LNG, 
-- NIRP plans indicate that 920 MW OCGT peak load plants 
must begin commissioning from 2008, 
-- NIRP plans assume the attainment and sustainability of 
demand side management targets, power plant availability, 
imports, and interruptible supply strategies, 
-- short-term peak-load requirements can be facilitated 
using single cycle gas turbines fueled by locally- 
produced synthetic gas.

1. (U) Post welcomes the proposed Science & Technology 
Advisory Capacity Building Partnership and is pleased to 
provide feedback regarding appropriate representation from 
South Africa.  We also support the proposed use of the 
Voluntary Visitor program for a follow-on week of meetings 
and activities in Washington, DC.  We look forward to 
working with OES to implement this program. 
 
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATION 
 
2. (SBU) Contacts at the Department of Science and 
Technology recently advised EST Officer that the department 
will undergo a restructuring over the next several months, 
to more clearly define its primary missions in frontier 
science and other areas of science activity and cooperation. 
Rather than single out a specific official from the 
department to participate in the capacity building activity, 
we strongly urge OES to send a letter of invitation to the 
Director-General of Science and Technology, Dr. Rob Adam, 
asking him to identify an appropriate representative from 
his Department to represent the South African government. 
The Department has a number of potentially strong candidates 
for participation, and working with Dr. Adam\'s office to 
identify a candidate will lead to stronger buy-in from the 
top levels of the Department. 
 
UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATION 
 
3. (U) The National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) is 
appointed by the Minister of Science and Technology to 
advise him (and through him, South Africa\'s Cabinet) on the 
role and contribution of innovation (including science and 
technology) in promoting and achieving national objectives, 
such as 1) improving and sustaining the quality of life of 
all South Africans; 2) developing human resources for 
science and technology; 3) building the economy; and 4) 
strengthening the South Africa\'s international 
competitiveness.
