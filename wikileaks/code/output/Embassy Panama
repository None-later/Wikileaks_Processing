E.O.12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, PM, US 
SUBJECT:  PANAMANIANS HOPE FOR A SUCCESSFUL COUP 
          -- NORIEGA PLANS FOR A NEW YEAR IN POWER 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUMMARY 
-------------------------------- 
2.  THROUGHOUT 1989, RAPIDLY UNFOLDING POLITICAL 
DEVELOPMENTS HELD OUT HOPE TO MANY PANAMANIANS FOR 
A RESOLUTION TO PANAMA\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
CRISIS:  THE ELECTION OF MAY 7, THE SUBSEQUENT OAS 
NEGOTIATIONS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF 
SEPTEMBER 1, THE COUP ATTEMPT OF OCTOBER 3, AND 
THE TREATY DEADLINE OF JANUARY 1, 1990. 
PROJECTING INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 1990, NO SUCH 
HOPEFUL EVENTS AND DATES ARE READILY APPARENT. 
THE OPPOSITION\'S MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SURVIVE 
POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND LITERALLY UNTIL THE 
NEXT COUP.  NORIEGA WILL HAVE TO TRY AND 
CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL OVER THE PANAMA DEFENSE 
FORCES (FDP) AND AVOID ANOTHER UPRISING. 
 
3.  PRESSURES ON NORIEGA HAVE INCREASED ACROSS THE 
BOARD, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE DETERMINED THAT HE CAN 
MANAGE THEM.  DESPITE NEW U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, 
THE MOST PRECIPITOUS ECONOMIC DROP IS OVER FOR 
NOW, FOLLOWING A TWO-YEAR, 25 PERCENT DROP IN 
GDP.  INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION REMAINS AN IRRITANT 
TO THE REGIME, BUT IT IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR 
NORIEGA\'S STABILITY.  U.S. ACTIONS, FROM THE 
APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CANAL ADMINISTRATOR TO 
RUMORED COVERT PLANS AGAINST NORIEGA AS WELL AS 
NEW ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, ALLOW NORIEGA TO BEAT THE 
NATIONALISTIC DRUM AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF 
DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR HIM IS GROWING. 
 
4.  NORIEGA\'S WEAKEST POINT REMAINS HIS OWN 
INSTITUTION.  WHISPERS THAT \"THE OCTOBER 3 COUP IS 
NOT OVER\" CONTINUE AND NORIEGA CONTINUES TO HOLD 
ON MAINLY BY BRUTAL REPRESSION OF ANY POTENTIAL 
NEW INSIDE OPPONENTS.  WHEN ANOTHER ACTION TO 
REMOVE NORIEGA WILL TAKE PLACE IS UNCERTAIN, BUT 
WAITING FOR THAT POSSIBILITY IS THE MAIN PROSPECT 
FOR PANAMA IN 1990.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THE CRISIS GRINDS ON 
--------------------------------------- 
5.  THE PANAMA CRISIS CONTINUES TO GRIND ON WITH 
NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT.  NORIEGA TENACIOUSLY HOLDS 
ON TO POWER, INTIMIDATING HIS OPPONENTS AND FIRING 
UP HIS SUPPORTERS WITH SLOGANS CALLING FOR 
RETRIBUTION AGAINST \"PANAMANIAN TRAITORS AND THEIR 
U.S. MASTERS,\" SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM. 
NORIEGA IS WEAKER THAN HE WAS AT THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT SET OF 
PRESSURES HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO EJECT HIM FROM 
OFFICE. 
 
6.  NEVERTHELESS, RECENT PRESS REPORTS OF AN 
ALLEGED U.S. COVERT ACTION PLAN AGAINST NORIEGA 
HAVE ONCE AGAIN RAISED HOPES OF SOME PANAMANIANS 
THAT THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF HIS END. 
NORIEGA HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY ATTACHING SOME 
CREDIBILITY TO THE PRESS REPORTS.  HE HAS REACTED 
NERVOUSLY BY STEPPING UP HARASSMENT OF THE 
OPPOSITION AND INCREASING THE SIZE, TRAINING, 
ACTIVITY, AND ARMAMENT OF HIS \"DIGNITY 
BATTALIONS.\"  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP IS 
CONCERNED OVER THE NEW \"EYE FOR AN EYE\" 
PARA-MILITARY CAMPAIGN, WHICH NORIEGA HAS USED TO 
REMIND THE OPPOSITION OF ITS VULNERABILITY. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
REGIME POLITICAL ACTIVITY 
--------------------------------------- 
7.  THE RODRIGUEZ ADMINISTRATION, UNSURPRISINGLY, 
REMAINS INEFFECTUAL, BUT CONTINUES TO LIMP ALONG. 
REGIME SOURCES INDICATE WITH SOME DEGREE OF 
CERTITUDE THAT NORIEGA IS UNHAPPY WITH HIS 
CIVILIAN PUPPETS, THAT HE MAY EVEN FIRE RODRIGUEZ, 
AND PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE FORMAL REIGNS OF 
GOVERNMENT SOON.  THE ASSEMBLY OF 510 LOCAL 
DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES (ANRC) CONFIRMED HIM AS 
\"NATIONAL COORDINATOR\" ON NOVEMBER 22.  THIS 
BRINGS HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING NAMED \"HEAD OF 
GOVERNMENT\", WHICH HE AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE 
HINTED AT FOR SOME TIME. 
 
8.  MANY VIEW THIS NORIEGA MOVE AS THE FINAL STEP 
TOWARD A TOTALITARIAN REGIME AND FURTHER SEVERE 
REPRESSION.  SOME SEE THIS AS A PENDING NORIEGA 
MISTAKE.  AS \"HEAD OF GOVERNMENT\", HE WOULD HAVE 
TO BEAR FULL OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIME 
ACTIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, BY INTRODUCING A NEW 
ELEMENT -- HIS GOVERNMENTAL ROLE -- INTO THE STALE 
POLITICAL SITUATION, NORIEGA MAY BE ABLE TO USE 
HIS USUAL MIXTURE OF OBFUSCATION AND INTIMIDATION 
TO BUY HIMSELF MORE TIME AND POLITICAL BREATHING 
SPACE. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
THE OPPOSITION 
------------------------------------------ 
9.  NORIEGA\'S MOST RECENT PARA-MILITARY SHOW OF 
FORCE FURTHER CONVINCED THE OPPOSITION THAT 
POLITICAL ACTION WILL RESULT ONLY IN GREATER 
REGIME BRUTALITY AGAINST THEM, NOT NORIEGA\'S 
DEPARTURE.  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP QUIETLY 
HOPES THAT CLANDESTINE (AND OTHER) U.S. ACTION, 
POSSIBLY COUPLED WITH ANOTHER COUP WILL REMOVE 
NORIEGA.  THE LEADERS SEE THEMSELVES PLAYING A 
ROLE IN THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT AND THEIR CURRENT 
PREPARATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN 
TO FILL THE GOVERNMENT VACUUM IF THE NEXT EFFORT 
SHOULD SUCCEED.  THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION 
RECOGNIZES THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT THE MILITARY 
IS THE MAIN POLITICAL FORCE IN PANAMA. 
 
10.  AS THE MEMORY -- AND TO SOME EXTENT THE 
LEGITIMACY -- OF THE MAY ELECTION RECEDES, THE 
PRESSURE ON THE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE 
OPPOSITION RANKS \"TO DO SOMETHING\" TO MAINTAIN 
POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IS GROWING, HOWEVER. 
OPPOSITION ABILITY TO CULTIVATE POLITICAL SUPPORT 
AND TRUST IN THE ADOC LEADERSHIP ARE HAMPERED BY 
EFFECTIVE NORIEGA INTIMIDATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS 
LEVEL.  MEANWHILE, U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE 
CONTINUING TO HURT AND NEW MEASURES ARE 
UNPOPULAR.  THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP FEARS THAT 
MANY PANAMANIANS -- INCLUDING THEIR FOLLOWERS -- 
WILL INCREASINGLY DEMAND THAT THE AMERICANS GET 
OFF THEIR BACKS, IF NORIEGA WON\'T. 
 
11.  PANAMA\'S OPPOSITION AND PANAMANIANS IN 
GENERAL RAN UP MANY SHORT TERM HILLS IN 1989 - 
WITH THE END ALWAYS JUST OVER THE HORIZON.  MAY 
ELECTIONS, THE OAS NEGOTIATIONS, SEPTEMBER 1, 
OCTOBER 3, AND NOW JANUARY 1, 1990 HAVE ALL TOO 
EASILY BEEN ACCEPTED AS TARGETS FOR WHEN THE 
PANAMA CRISIS WOULD \"HAVE TO\" BE SOLVED.  ALREADY 
ADOC LEADER GUILLERMO \"BILLY\" FORD IS TALKING OF 
FEBRUARY 25 (NICARAGUAN ELECTION DAY) AS A DATE 
BEFORE WHICH NORIEGA MUST FALL IF THE U.S. DOES 
NOT WISH TO HAVE THE PRECEDENT OF AN ANNULLED 
ELECTION REPEATED IN NICARAGUA .  OVERALL, 
HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITION HAS LITTLE ENERGY LEFT TO 
CHARGE UP ANOTHER HILL UNLESS CONVINCED IT IS THE 
LAST ONE.  ONLY ANOTHER COUP HOLDS OUT SUCH A 
PROMISE, BUT THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABLE TO 
INFLUENCE THAT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT 
--------------------------------------- 
12.  THE MOST (AND MAYBE ONLY) HOPEFUL SIGN FOR 
NORIEGA\'S OPPONENTS IN 1990 IS THAT TROUBLES 
INSIDE THE FDP ARE WORSE THAN THEY HAVE EVER 
BEEN.  REASSIGNMENTS AND PROMOTIONS FLOWING FROM 
THE POST-COUP PURGE ARE JUST NOW BEING MADE -- 
MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EVENT.  MANY OF THE 
MORE \"PROFESSIONAL\" FDP OFFICERS AND NCO\'S WERE 
KILLED, TORTURED, OR DISMISSED AFTER OCTOBER 3. 
THE SUCCESSOR CROP OF TRUE BELIEVERS HAS NEITHER 
THE EXPERIENCE, TRAINING OR INTELLIGENCE TO FILL 
THE SHOES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS.  NORIEGA HAS HAD 
TO RELY MAINLY ON HIMSELF OR THE SUPPORT OF THIS 
SMALL CLIQUE OF LOYALISTS SINCE THE COUP ATTEMPT. 
HIS INCREASED USE OF DIGNITY BATTALIONS IS ALSO 
WEARING ON THE CAREER SOLDIERS.  WHAT LITTLE 
MILITARY PRIDE THEY HAVE LEFT HAS BEEN INJURED BY 
THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS PARA-MILITARY RABBLE WHICH 
THEY FEAR WILL GET OUT OF CONTROL AND ULTIMATELY 
HURT THE INSTITUTION.  WITH THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS 
AND OTHER IRREGULARS OVER 2000 IN NUMBER THE IMAGE 
OF A COMPETING PARA-MILITARY FORCE IS BEGINNING TO 
ARISE. 
 
13.  DISCONTENT AND FEELINGS OF REVENGE CONTINUE 
TO FESTER INSIDE THE FDP AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
REPORTS THAT THERE ARE \"INDIVIDUALS\" WHO ARE 
PREPARED TO ACT ON THESE EMOTIONS.  ONE REGIME 
INSIDER RECENTLY CLAIMED THAT NORIEGA\'S NOMINAL 
NUMBER 2, COLONEL MARCO JUSTINES, IS HIMSELF 
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCH OUT HIS BOSS.  MEANWHILE, 
NOTORIOUS CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF NORIEGA, SUCH AS 
MARIO ROGNONI AND ISAAC HANONO (STRICTLY PROTECT), 
ARE ALREADY LOOKING BEYOND NORIEGA\'S DEPARTURE IN 
ADVOCATING WITH EMBOFFS AN OPPOSITION DECLARATION 
OF AMNESTY FOR REGIME SUPPORTERS.  SOURCES NOW 
INDICATE THAT NORIEGA SUSPECTS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO 
UNSEAT HIM AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 15. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
THE STATUS OF \"UNRELENTING PRESSURES\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
INTERNATIONAL 
------------- 
14.  THE RECENT RESOLUTION OF THE OASGA CONFIRMED 
NORIEGA\'S ISOLATION IN THE HEMISPHERE, BUT WAS MET 
WITH ONLY FLEETING INTEREST IN PANAMA.  THE FDP\'S 
DISINVITATION TO THE RECENT CONFERENCE OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMIES IN GUATEMALA WAS POTENTIALLY A 
MORE SERIOUS BLOW TO FDP MORALE, BUT THIS COLD 
SHOULDER FROM THEIR LATIN COLLEAGUES PASSED 
LARGELY UNNOTICED BECAUSE OF NORIEGA\'S ABSOLUTE 
CONTROL OF INFORMATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE HIS 
INSTITUTION. 
 
15.  AMBASSADORS OF MOST NATIONS REMAIN OUTSIDE 
PANAMA, EITHER ON VACATION OR CONSULTATIONS, BUT 
LOCAL DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION MAY BE IN DANGER.  THE 
FRENCH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY RETURNED FROM HIS 
\"VACATION\" TO REJOIN HIS ITALIAN AND SPANISH 
COLLEAGUES WHO NEVER LEFT.  SEVERAL AMBASSADORS 
AND MILITARY ATTACHES (E.G. MEXICO) MAY VISIT 
THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ARE RESIDING HERE AT 
CHRISTMAS.  NORIEGA IS MAKING ALL HE CAN OUT OF 
CONTACTS WITH THE USSR, THE PRC, LIBYA, CUBA, 
NICARAGUA, AND EVEN U.S. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT 
GROUPS.  HE WILL ALSO SEEK TO CONJURE UP SOME 
LIMITED LEGITIMACY IN HIS PLEA FOR LATIN 
SOLIDARITY OVER THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR ISSUE. 
 
ECONOMIC 
-------- 
16.  THE REGIME CONTINUES TO HAVE CASH FLOW 
PROBLEMS, BUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAS 
LEVELED OFF FOR NOW.  NORIEGA IS ABLE TO COMBAT 
THE WORST DISRUPTIONS BY SALARY ADJUSTMENTS AND 
CONTINUED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF LOYALISTS. 
UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS ON THE RISE, BUT ONE OF 
THE \"PILLARS\" OF THE PANAMANIAN SERVICE ECONOMY -- 
THE COLON FREE ZONE -- IS HAVING RECORD SALES AND 
PROVIDES SOMEWHAT INCREASING EMPLOYMENT IN THE 
POLITICALLY VOLATILE COLON AREA. 
 
17.  MEANWHILE, PARA-MILITARY DIGNITY BATTALIONS 
ARE ENLISTING OR SCARING THE UNEMPLOYED. 
BUSINESSMEN, HURT BY NORIEGA AND U.S. SANCTIONS, 
ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO MOVE TOWARD 
ACCOMMODATION WITH NORIEGA.  MANY FEEL THEY HAVE 
TO GIVE PRIORITY TO BEING ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. 
 
U.S. PRESSURES 
-------------- 
18.  FURTHER U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS HEIGHTEN THE 
SENSE OF CRISIS IN PANAMA, CREATING THE PARADOX OF 
REGIME-OPPOSITION-CHURCH AGREEMENT IN OPPOSING 
THEM.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE U.S. PORT BAN FOR 
PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS AND THE APPOINTMENT OF 
A TEMPORARY CANAL ADMINISTRATOR CREATE NEW 
PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORIEGA.  BANNING 
PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS FROM THE U.S. WILL ROB 
NORIEGA AND HIS CRONIES OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT 
OF INCOME.  SOME OF THE LATTER MAY EVEN JUMP SHIP 
AND TURN ON HIM.  BUT IN THE END RESULT, MANY MORE 
MAY REALIZE THAT IT WAS THEY WHO DEPENDED ON HIM, 
NOT HE ON THEM. 
 
19.  THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTMENT OFFERS 
NORIEGA SOME ADDITIONAL NATIONALISTIC PEGS TO 
SUPPORT HIS SEARCH FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL 
SUPPORT.  BLOWING THE TREATY VIOLATION AND 
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WHISTLE MAY WELL GAIN HIM 
SOME SUPPORT.  PLAYED WELL, HE MAY AGAIN BE ABLE 
TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST:  BUY TIME. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CRISIS 
--------------------------------------------- 
20.  DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPPOSITION TO NORIEGA IS 
SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE.  FOREIGN ATTENTION IN 
PARTICULAR IS DISTRACTED BY MUCH HIGHER PROFILE 
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, FROM EL 
SALVADOR TO BERLIN.  OF COURSE, NORIEGA TOO IS 
TIRING, EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SLOWNESS IN SETTLING 
THE TURMOIL INSIDE HIS OWN INSTITUTION.  BUT HE IS 
A MASTER OF SURVIVAL AND ABLE TO BUILD ON THE 
FATIGUE OF OTHERS.  RENEWED NOISES IN RECENT 
REGIME PRONOUNCEMENTS OF A WILLINGNESS TO \"TALK\" 
ARE A CLASSIC MANIFESTATION OF TRIED AND TRUE 
NORIEGA TIME-BUYING TACTICS. 
 
21.  THE POLITICAL TENSION IN PANAMA, INCREASED BY 
RECENT PRESS REVELATIONS AND U.S. SANCTIONS 
ANNOUNCEMENTS, WILL LIKELY EBB IN EARLY 1990, 
ABSENT SOME MAJOR EVENT.  NORIEGA IS SHOWING NO 
SIGNS THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF LEAVING 
VOLUNTARILY.  GIVEN BROAD POLITICAL REALITIES IN 
THIS COUNTRY, THE ONLY HOPE FOR A FIRST STEP IN 
CRISIS RESOLUTION IS ANOTHER COUP.  WAITING FOR 
THAT TO HAPPEN IS THE MAIN POLITICAL PROSPECT FOR 
PANAMA IN 1990.

SUBJECT:  OPPOSITION ACTIVIST GIVES ACCOUNT OF 
          REGIME TORTURE 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GUSTAVO CEDENO 
(STRICTLY PROTECT), WAS ARRESTED BY REGIME 
AUTHORITIES ON DECEMBER 5, DETAINED FOR 21 HOURS, 
BEATEN, AND QUESTIONED ABOUT A POSSIBLE NEW COUP 
ATTEMPT.  HE WAS FORCED TO SIGN STATEMENTS AGAINST 
THE CHURCH AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) 
PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND WAS 
REPORTEDLY ENLISTED TO SPY ON THE OPPOSITION 
BEFORE BEING RELEASED.  CEDENO HAS SOUGHT REFUGE 
AT A U.S. MILITARY FACILITY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  CEDENO, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC RATY ACTIVIST, 
MET WITH POLOFF ON DECEMBER 9 TO REPORT HIS ORDEAL 
AND DISPLAY HIS BRUISES (CEDENO COULD BARELY WALK 
AND HAS SINCE SOUGHT REFUGE ON A U.S. BASE.) 
ACCORDING TO CEDENO, ON DEC. 5, TWELVE ARMED MEN 
TOOK HIM FROM HIS HOME IN PANAMA CITY.  HE WAS 
PLACED IN A CAR WHERE A FRIEND, HECTOR ANTONIO 
ARROCHA RIVAS, HANDCUFFED AND HOODED, WAS 
WAITING.  IN SPITE OF THE HOOD, CEDENO CLAIMS HE 
RECOGNIZED ARROCHA.  ONE OF THE ARMED MEN SHOVED 
CEDENO\'S HEAD DOWN BETWEEN HIS KNEES.  FROM THIS 
POSITION, CEDENO COULD SEE THAT ARROCHA WAS NOT 
WEARING SHOES AND HIS FEET WERE BLOODY BECAUSE HIS 
TOENAILS HAD BEEN PULLED OUT. 
 
4.  A HOOD WAS THEN PLACED OVER CEDENO\'S HEAD. 
ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE, HE BELIEVES HE WAS 
TAKEN TO FDP HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN PANAMA 
CITY.  THERE HE WAS STRIPPED TO HIS UNDERWEAR, 
TAPE WAS PLACED OVER HIS EYES, AND HE WAS BEATEN 
AND INTERROGATED CONTINUALLY FOR 20 HOURS (LARGELY 
ON THE LOWER BACK, BUTTOCKS AND THIGHS) BY 
DIFFERENT TEAMS OF MEN USING RUBBER HOSES.  AT ONE 
POINT, A HAMMER WAS USED TO SMASH THE MIDDLE TOE 
ON BOTH FEET.  A DOCTOR WAS PRESENT AND CUT OPEN 
THE BLOOD BLISTER THAT FORMED ON ONE TOE AND TOLD 
HIS TORMENTORS THEY COULD NOT HIT THAT TOE ANY 
LONGER.  AT ANOTHER POINT, HE WAS THROWN INTO A 
TANK OF COLD WATER.  TWICE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. 
 
5.  CEDENO STATED THAT QUESTIONING CENTERED AROUND 
AN ALLEGED COUP ATTEMPT HIS CAPTORS ASSUMED MIGHT 
TAKE PLACE IN MID-DECEMBER.  CEDENO SAID THAT IN 
ORDER TO SATISFY HIS INTERROGATORS, HE MADE UP A 
STORY SAYING THAT SUCH A RUMOR MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN 
STARTED BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVED NORIEGA WAS HAVING 
TROUBLE PAYING THE FDP. 
 
6.  CEDENO, WHO ONCE WORKED IN THE NATIONAL 
INVESTIGATIVE POLICE (DENI) BETWEEN 1968-70, 
CLAIMED HE WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A NICKNAME USED 
FOR PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES (FDP) COL. AROSEMENA 
KING, NOW HEAD OF G-5 (CIVIC AFFAIRS).  CEDENO 
BELIEVES AROSEMENA KING WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO 
THREATENED HIM AND TRIED TO ENLIST HIM TO REPORT 
ON THE OPPOSITION. 
 
7.  CEDENO SAID HE WAS PROMISED HIS RELEASE AND 
THAT HIS PARENTS AND BROTHER WOULD NOT BE HARMED 
IF HE WOULD AGREE TO SPY ON THE OPPOSITION.  HE 
CLAIMS HE AGREED AND, TO LEND CREDIBILITY TO HIS 
PROMISE, BARGAINED FOR AND SECURED A MONTHLY 
STIPEND OF USDOLS 1,000.  (CEDENO SAID HE INFORMED 
PDC PRESIDENT ARIAS CALDERON OF THIS \"ARRANGEMENT\".) 
 
8.  BEFORE HIS RELEASE, CEDENO SAID HE WAS 
REQUIRED TO SIGN A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS.  ONE 
ACCUSED ARIAS CALDERON OF COMPLICITY IN A COUP 
PLOT.  ANOTHER ACCUSED PANAMA CITY\'S CATHOLIC 
ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH OF RUNNING AN ILLEGAL 
PRINTING PRESS IN THE SAME LOCAL CATHOLIC 
SECONDARY SCHOOL. 
 
9.  CEDENO SAID THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT 
THE G-2 HE HAD KNOWN WHEN HE HAD WORKED AT THE 
DENI SOME 20 YEARS AGO NO LONGER EXISTED.  IN HIS 
VIEW, THE CURRENT G-2 CONTAINED \"DANGEROUS AND 
STUPID\" ELEMENTS. 
 
10.  COMMENT.  EXCEPT FOR THE BRUISES ON HIS BODY 
AND THE DAMAGED TOES, WE HAVE NO WAY OF VERIFYING 
ALL OF CEDENO\'S STATEMENTS.  HIS PHYSICAL 
CONDITION, HOWEVER, AND THE DETAIL WITH WHICH HE 
WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE HIS EXPERIENCE PROVIDES ADDED 
INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE THINKING AND METHODS OF 
NORIEGA\'S THUGS.

1. (C) Ambassador Watt delivered reftel B demarche to 
Panama\'s Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias Madrid and Vice 
Foreign Minister and Summit of the Americas Coordinator Nivia 
Rossana Castrellon on December 30.  Ambassador Watt stressed 
with FM Arias the four key areas in Reftel A talking points. 
On January 6, DCM discussed USG goals for the Special Summit 
with Arias, impressing upon him the need for concrete 
proposals and solutions to emerge from the Monterrey meeting. 
 After requesting from Arias that Panama exercise the same 
leadership among Latin American countries as it did at the 
WTO Summit in Cancun, DCM stressed the need for hemispheric 
governments to commit to specific timelines, and to adopt 
concrete anti-corruption measures and programs to encourage 
small and medium enterprise.  Arias said that President 
Moscoso fully supports President Bush\'s policies, and noted 
previous productive conversations between Emboffs and 
Castrellon regarding the Summit (Reftel C).  Arias also said 
President Moscoso would seek an opportunity to discuss the 
status of Panama\'s request for designation as a distant 
foreign port under the Passenger Vessel Services Act with 
President Bush. 
 
 
2. (U) MFA advised Embassy that Castrellon will lead Panama\'s 
delegation to the January 8-10 Summit Implementation Review 
Group meetings.  President Moscoso and FM Arias will head 
Panama\'s approximately twelve-member delegation to the 
January 12-13 Summit.

SUMMARY: SAME HORSES, DIFFERENT RACE 
------------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Panamanians nationwide will go to the polls on May 
2, 2004 to choose a president, 78 legislators, 75 mayors, 619 
local representatives, and 20 representatives to the Central 
American Parliament.  The presidential campaign currently is 
a two-man race (in a field of four candidates) with the 
economy (especially unemployment), corruption, and personal 
security (common crime) at the top of the campaign agenda. 
Despite calls from civic organizations for reforms to 
Panama\'s constitution, which all candidates have said that 
they favor, prospects are increasingly remote that voters 
will be consulted on that issue on May 2 via an extra ballot 
(para 11).  A December 15, 2003 La Prensa poll shows 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) candidate Martin 
Torrijos with a comfortable lead (49%-31%) over former 
President (1989-94) Guillermo Endara, the Solidarity Party 
candidate.  Trailing the two front-runners are Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman (8%) and Cambio Democratico 
candidate Ricardo Martinelli (5%).  All the candidates are 
pro-American and can be expected to continue the current 
government\'s excellent cooperation on security and law 
enforcement issues.  Embassy is focusing on the campaign 
teams to identify any potential ministerial appointees who 
might be less compatible with U.S. interests.  Dominating 
international issues are upcoming Panama-U.S. FTA 
negotiations and Colombian border security.  End Summary. 
 
 
THE PARTIES AND THEIR ALLIANCES 
------------------------------- 
2.  (U) Official Electoral Tribunal (TE) records identified 
just over 2 million registered voters (Panama\'s population is 
2.9 million), many of whom are independents.  Seven 
legally-registered parties currently are backing the four 
official presidential candidates.  The most recent 
registration figures show that by far Panama\'s biggest 
political party is the PRD (see below): 
 
 
Party                                Membership   Candidate 
-----                                ----------   --------- 
 
 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD)  445,000      Torrijos 
 
 
Arnulfista Party (PA)                 198,000      Aleman 
 
 
National Liberal Republican Movement  110,000      Aleman 
(MOLIRENA) 
 
 
National Liberal Party (PLN)           74,000      Aleman 
 
 
Solidarity Party (PS)                  72,000      Endara 
 
 
Cambio Democratico Party (CD)          52,000      Martinelli 
 
 
Popular Party (PP)                     50,000      Torrijos 
 
 
The PRD-PP coalition backing Torrijos counts 495,000 party 
members; the coalition backing Aleman counts 382,000. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Frictions between alliance partners have already 
developed at the legislative and local representative level 
but are most notable within the Arnulfista alliance, where 
candidates from all three parties may be competing for one 
spot in important districts.  Endara, an Arnulfista Party 
founding member who has nominal support from the Solidarity 
Party\'s weak base, is welcoming \"refugees\" from other 
parties.  Polling data show support for Torrijos has remained 
strong after the PRD\'s August 10 primaries, despite minor 
hiccups over sharing electoral space with PP members.  Party 
alliances notwithstanding, gauging support for legislative 
and local candidates will remain problematic until after 
February 2, when the parties must name their candidates. 
 
 
(SBU) MARTIN TORRIJOS: NOT HIS FATHER\'S PRD 
------------------------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) Martin Torrijos is the only presidential candidate 
nominated by his party via nationwide primaries.  His strong 
lead in the polls, which has persisted for many months, 
suggests that he has convinced many voters that his PRD is 
very different than the party that once was the political 
vehicle for Panama\'s military dictators (Ref. A).  On the 
other hand, many observers believe that Martin is in hock 
politically to the PRD\'s discredited old guard.  A Torrijos 
presidency may offer Panama its best chance for efficient 
administration.  He has distinguished himself by his soaring 
ambition to make Panama a \"first world\" country in 20-30 
years and by having the brightest and best ideas on how to do 
it.  The PRD is more democratic than it was before Martin 
controlled it.  He has less credibility on anti-corruption, 
having failed to distance himself from his campaign manager, 
Hugo Torrijos, despite evidence of malfeasance brought to 
light in the recent PECC scandal.  Torrijos\' two VP 
candidates, who he will announce publicly on January 15, will 
most likely be businessman Samuel Lewis Navarro and Popular 
Party President and current Legislator Ruben Arosemena. 
 
 
SECURITY AGENDA 
--------------- 
5.  (SBU) Besides promising to improve Panama\'s economy, 
indeed, to take economic and administrative measures to 
propel Panama into the ranks of the first world, Martin 
Torrijos\' campaign has emphasized public/national security 
issues.  On the domestic front, the Torrijos team has focused 
on neighborhood security and what they claim to be an 
increase in violent crime.  On the international front, the 
PRD team has spoken frequently about how best to control the 
Panama/Colombia border region.  A Torrijos security brain 
trust (including former PNP Director Asvat) meet regularly to 
advise him on security.  In October, the PRD held a public 
conference on security matters (Ref D). 
 
 
ENDARA: A SOLID SECOND 
--------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Endara (like third-place Aleman) has already named 
both vice presidential running mates, Guillermo (Billy) Ford 
and Alejandro Posse.  Both Ford and Posse served in the 
Moscoso Administration -- Ford as Ambassador to the U.S. 
(September 1999 - January 2003) and Posse as Minister of 
Agriculture (September 1999 - August 2000).  Endara and Ford 
are logical running-mates, having served as President and 
Vice President during 1989-94.  They chose Posse for his 
strong links to Panama\'s agriculture industry, which is also 
a key constituency for Aleman\'s Arnulfista party.  (Some 
observers fear Posse\'s protectionist tendencies.  During his 
brief tenure in the Moscoso Administration, Posse increased 
selected agricultural tariffs to their WTO-bound levels.) 
Through Posse, Endara seems to be looking for support from 
Panama\'s agricultural producers, a small but influential 
lobby with its skeptical eye focused on bilateral FTA 
negotiations with the US. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Given his record and reputation, Endara is the 
campaign\'s most plausible \"anti-corruption\" candidate.  Some 
of his most active followers are members of the 
Anti-Corruption Front (Frente Anti-Corrupcion), who 
constantly denounce corrupt practices.  Endara favors calling 
a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution to replace 
the current 1972 constitution that was drafted under 
Panamanian military dictator Omar Torrijos, father of 
candidate Martin Torrijos.  Endara also promises to 
immediately repeal President Moscoso\'s executive order that 
gutted Panama\'s freedom of information law, which gives only 
parties with a \"personal interest\" a right to know specifics 
about the internal workings of their government, including 
budgetary and personnel matters.  Endara\'s administration was 
widely viewed as honest but ineffective; many Panamanians 
frustrated by the current corruption choose to forget 
Endara\'s shortcomings on the policy side.  In economic 
issues, Endara\'s populist campaign rhetoric raises concerns 
about campaign commitments to agricultural constituents that 
could complicate U.S. efforts to open up key components of 
Panama\'s market. 
 
 
ALEMAN A DISTANT THIRD 
---------------------- 
8.  (SBU) Last to officially launch his candidacy, polls show 
Arnulfista presidential candidate Jose Miguel Aleman\'s 
support is still struggling in single digits (8%), according 
to the latest polling data, and far behind front runners 
Endara (31%) and Torrijos (49%).  Despite effusive support 
from President Moscoso, Aleman\'s campaign is not gaining 
traction.  Some key defectors from the MOLIRENA party -- 
including founding member and former Endara VP Guillermo 
\"Billy\" Ford -- have withdrawn their support from the Aleman 
coalition to back Endara.  (PLN\'s support for Aleman may be 
less dependable than MOLIRENA\'s since PLN backed Martin 
Torrijos against Moscoso in 1999.)  Aleman\'s first and second 
vice-presidential running mates are MOLIRENA President Jesus 
\"Maco\" Rosas and PLN President Anibal Galindo. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) Though tainted by the corruption charges levied 
against this current administration, Aleman has been careful 
not to criticize Moscoso, fearing the loss of the 
Arnulfistas\' formidable electoral machine.  Aleman has 
concentrated his campaign efforts outside Panama City in the 
interior of the country, where the Arnulfistas hold an edge 
over the PRD but face a fight with Endara.  Aleman has 
promised to continue Moscoso\'s social agenda to help the most 
needy. 
 
 
MARTINELLI: COURTING THE SWING VOTE 
----------------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) Last in the polls with (5%) support, Cambio 
Democratico candidate Ricardo Martinelli is a long shot but 
will probably earn more than 4% of the popular vote, enough 
for his party to officially survive past 2004.  Having served 
in the current and in previous administrations, Martinelli 
could decide to throw his weight behind either Endara or 
Torrijos in exchange for a presidential appointment, though 
he denies such intentions.  Martinelli, who visited 
Washington during the week of December 8, markets himself as 
a no-nonsense businessman and gifted administrator and 
entrepreneur who can create jobs and effectively manage 
Panama\'s government, particularly the troublesome Social 
Security Fund (CSS).  He is calling for a limited return of 
U.S. Armed Forces to Panama, bashing his opponents for 
corruption and vowing to wipe it out.  He has proposed 
creating a Hollywood-like cinematographic center (\"Panawood\") 
at the former Howard AFB.  Martinelli\'s platform is the most 
straightforward of all the candidates.  His running mates are 
Roberto Henriquez, Moscoso\'s Vice Minister for Foreign Trade 
early in her term (September 1999 - August 2000), and Casa 
Esperanza activist Roxana Mendez Obarrio. 
 
 
HOT POTATO: CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 
--------------------------------- 
11. (SBU) With the Ecumenical Council, a consortium of 
Christian religious leaders, leading the charge, civic groups 
have pressed for reforms to Panama\'s constitution; however, 
not all Panamanians feel that reforming the constitution is 
the best way to resolve the country\'s problems.  All four 
candidates, eager to show that they\'re engaged on the issue, 
have signed the Ecumenical Council\'s petition to hold a 
non-binding referendum on whether constitutional reforms are 
necessary.  Of the four candidates, Endara\'s proposed 
solution is the most drastic and probably unconstitutional. 
He has stated that if elected, he will immediately convoke a 
parallel constituent assembly.  At first opposed to 
constitutional reforms, Torrijos now backs them through 
established constitutional procedures (which gives the 
Legislative Assembly greater control over the process), and 
remains opposed to convening a constituent assembly through a 
\"fifth ballot\" on May 2, 2004).  Legislators from Torrijos\' 
PRD party have proposed a bill to amend the constitution, 
which two consecutive Legislative Assemblies would need to 
approve.  Aleman has said little, but another Arnulfista, 
Legislator Jose Blandon, Jr., proposed a bill in the 
Legislative Assembly to order the printing of a \"fifth 
ballot\" for the May 2 elections to ask Panamanians whether 
they want constitutional reforms.  Although the first to sign 
the Ecumenical Council\'s call for citizen consultations about 
constitutional reform, Martinelli has not spoken much on the 
subject.  Embassy will report on the issue of constitutional 
reforms septel, discussing further the feeble efforts to push 
them forward in the Legislative Assembly. 
 
 
(SBU) COMMENT: PANAMA\'S CAMPAIGN AND U.S. INTERESTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
12.  (SBU) In Panama\'s four national electoral events since 
1990 (two presidential elections and two referenda), voters 
have sided with the opposition every time.  But, despite 
mounting public dissatisfaction in Panama with official 
corruption, the 2004 campaign has not produced any 
Chavez-like, anti-system candidates.  In fact, all the 
candidates are friendly to the Embassy and pro-American in 
their outlook.  They all have professed their intent to 
continue the GOP\'s excellent cooperation on law enforcement 
and security matters.  This is a two-man race.  Martin 
Torrijos\' comfortable lead over Guillermo Endara in opinion 
polls is not unassailable, as Mireya Moscoso demonstrated in 
1999 when she overcame a similar disadvantage late in the 
campaign to win an impressive come-from-behind victory.  For 
the campaign to become a real horse race, Endara must pick up 
mass support from defecting Arnulfistas, if not from 
Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman himself, who may 
gradually conclude that his party\'s best post-election 
prospects lie in allying with Endara.  Until then, Endara 
must also hope for a gradual improvement in his own standing 
in the polls and an erosion in support for Torrijos. 
Torrijos, naturally, will do all he can to maintain his lead. 
 Most observers have written off Aleman.  They may be right 
but it is hardly inconceivable for Aleman\'s support to 
increase (at Endara\'s expense), especially given the 
Arnulfistas\' formidable electoral machine and their control 
of the government\'s pursestrings.  Martinelli, the dark 
horse, could conceivably throw his support one way or the 
other, although he denies having that intention. 
 
 
13.  (SBU) The candidates are discussing vital national 
issues, such as constitutional reform, unemployment, and 
negotiating a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the United 
States.  Despite broad support from civil society for 
constitutional changes, the two big parties have effectively 
stifled calls for a constituent assembly.  Panama\'s 
politicians do not want to be saddled with a new constitution 
that may do away with legislative immunity, greatly reduce 
what is by many accounts a grossly over-staffed and 
overfunded legislature, or force the government (especially 
the executive) to be more accountable to the citizens.  With 
regard to a U.S.-Panama FTA, the parties are all claiming 
that their candidates will extract the most benefits for 
Panama from the negotiations, rather than preparing the 
electorate for more economic openness.  President Moscoso has 
even claimed, implausibly, that her administration will 
conclude negotiations before she leaves office.  The 
constitution and the FTA, both of great import to the 
US-Panama bilateral relationship and to Panama, will require 
concerted thoughtful consideration and statesmanship, not 
likely until after May 2, 2004.

SUBJECT:  PANAMA\'S CHANCES FOR QUICK CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFORM FADING 
 
Summary: No reforms before May Elections 
---------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU)  Due to a lack of support from the two biggest 
political parties and disagreements over procedure, the 
possibility that Panama\'s legislators will enact 
constitutional reforms in the near future is fading 
rapidly.  Many politicians have acknowledged publicly a 
need to reform Panama\'s current dictator-drafted 1972 
Constitution (as amended), but others claim that better 
enforcement of existing laws and better civic education 
could have more punch.  The main impetus for reform 
comes from civil society (including UNDP Panama\'s Vision 
2020, the Ecumenical Council, and other NGOs).  As 
reform is likely to greatly affect the legislature, it 
is far from clear whether meaningful reform is even 
possible, given that the legislature will control the 
process.  To remedy perceived corruption in Panama\'s 
public institutions, these groups want to change the 
method for selecting Supreme Court Justices, curtail the 
size and budget of the Legislative Assembly, reduce 
legislative immunity, and increase public access to 
information about government operations.  All but the 
latter would require amending Panama\'s constitution, but 
doing so would not automatically introduce better 
governance, restore citizen confidence, nor eliminate 
the corrupt practices that undermine it.  Political will 
is the missing ingredient. 
 
 
2. (SBU)  All four presidential candidates are on record 
favoring constitutional reform, but that does not mean 
that reform is likely in the short term.  Citing 
inadequate time to prepare, the Electoral Tribunal is 
now cautioning against issuing a separate \"fifth\" ballot 
(quinta papeleta) on May 2 to ask voters whether they 
want a new constitution.  A strong pro-reform vote could 
pave the way for a constituent assembly to write a new 
constitution without consulting the legislature (a plan 
of dubious constitutionality).  Legislative Assembly 
President Jacobo Salas has asserted that his institution 
lacks the credibility to enact constitutional reforms. 
In any case, the current legislature probably will not 
consider either of the constitutional reform bills 
before it.  End Summary 
 
 
Consecutive Assemblies (The PRD/PP Coalition\'s choice) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
3. (U)  On October 27 legislators from the largest 
party, the opposition PRD, backed by allies from the 
Popular Party (PP), submitted an eight-page 
constitutional reform bill.  The bill would limit the 
number of legislative seats to 60 (currently 78), reduce 
legislative alternates from two per principal to one, 
restrict legislative immunity, reduce the number of Vice 
Presidents from two to one, modify the process for 
electing Supreme Court Justices, and codify the use of a 
parallel constituent assembly for future reforms.  The 
bill would follow the procedure described in Article 308 
of the constitution.  Under the constitution, two 
successive legislative assemblies would have to approve 
an identical set of reforms for the constitution to be 
changed. 
 
 
The Arnulfista Response: A Fifth Ballot 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU)  Rejecting calls for a constituent assembly, 
Arnulfista legislators proposed a bill on November 17, 
2003 for a fifth ballot for the May 2, 2004 elections. 
(The other four ballots correspond to President, 
Legislators, Mayor, and Local Representative - 
Representante de Corregimiento in Spanish).  The fifth 
ballot as proposed by the Arnulfistas would ask 
Panamanians: (i) whether they want constitutional 
reforms and (ii) if so, whether they would like to carry 
out reform through consecutive legislative assemblies 
(per Article 308 of the current Constitution) or through 
a parallel constituent assembly (currently an 
unconstitutional procedure).  (COMMENT:  Ironically the 
Arnulfista bill does not require the incoming government 
to heed the result of the fifth ballot, but if a 
government ignored the results of a nationwide popular 
vote, it would face a substantial drop in public 
confidence. END COMMENT) 
 
 
Bills sleeping comfortably at the Legislative Assembly 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
5. (SBU)  The Legislative Assembly has not discussed 
either of the above-mentioned bills beyond the first of 
three debates necessary for their passage.  The Assembly 
adjourned on December 31.  President Moscoso has called 
Extraordinary Sessions of the Assembly from January 13 
through January 16, but not to discuss either of the 
above-mentioned bills.  Although the Arnulfistas control 
the Assembly, Arnulfista legislators have shown little 
interest in advancing debate on their bill.  The PRD is 
pleased that the Arnulfistas have not pushed hard for a 
fifth ballot. 
 
 
Parallel Constituent Assembly: Endara\'s pick 
-------------------------------------------- 
6. (SBU)  Presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and 
his close followers strongly support calling a 
constituent assembly, although it would be a measure of 
doubtful constitutionality.  Endara does not support the 
Arnulfista bill described in paragraph 3.  Endara 
advisor told Pol Counselor at a December 22 meeting that 
if elected, he would call a parallel constituent 
assembly on the day he takes office.  Endara considers a 
vote for him as a vote for a constituent assembly, his 
advisors say.  (NOTE: A December 2003 CID-Gallup poll 
showed that 75 percent of respondents didn\'t even know 
what a constituent assembly is. END NOTE)  Endara, who 
governed Panama from Operation Just Cause (December 
1989) through August 31, 1994, has been blamed 
throughout the years for not having promoted deep 
constitutional reforms through a Constituyente while in 
office.  The special circumstances early in his 
administration (great public support to eliminate the 
military, establish a democratic system, reconstruct the 
economy and a weak PRD) would have facilitated amending 
the 1972 constitution, designed to legitimize Panama\'s 
dictators, critics say. 
 
 
Comment: Reforms later, if at all 
--------------------------------- 
7. (SBU)  Political insiders believe that the two 
largest parties (PRD and Arnulfistas) are supporting 
constitutional reform only to appease civil society and 
dull the blows from presidential candidate Endara\'s 
constant demands for a constituent assembly.  In theory, 
the Legislative Assembly could still could approve a 
fifth ballot when it reconvenes on March 1, but it would 
be quite difficult for the Electoral Tribunal to print 
over one million ballots to be distributed throughout 
the country in time for the May 2, 2004 elections.  The 
PRD bill, which proposes a more conservative reform 
method, could be discussed after March 1, but by law 
would need to be passed by June 30, 2004.  After a new 
President emerges from the May 2 election and control of 
the Legislative Assembly becomes clear, negotiations 
could proceed on constitutional reforms.  As the 
reformers are intent on significantly reducing the perks 
of legislators and as the legislature probably will have 
a decisive role in framing reform, it seems doubtful 
that the idea will get far.  All bets are off if a 
constituent assembly is formed, but that is also 
unlikely.

TO AMBASSADOR REICH FROM AMBASSADOR WATT 
 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EWWT, SNAR, OVIP, PM, NAS 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: AMBASSADOR OTTO REICH\'S VISIT TO 
PANAMA 
 
 
1. (U) Embassy Panama welcomes Special Envoy for Western 
Hemisphere Initiatives Ambassador Otto Reich on his January 
17 - 24 visit to Panama.  You will have the opportunity to 
reiterate the Ambassador\'s good governance message to GOP 
officials, including Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, 
private sector representatives and local media.  Your visit 
highlights our governments\' mutual focus on the strategic 
issues of enhancing counterterrorism capabilities, combating 
international criminal networks and expanding trade and 
investment.  Expectations regarding the upcoming negotiations 
on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with the US will 
reign paramount in the minds of many of your interlocutors. 
It is worth noting that Panama was an early member of the 
Coalition of the Willing, has signed and ratified a bilateral 
Article 98 Agreement, and supported the USG at the WTO 
Ministerial in Cancun, Mexico.  Panama has proved itself a 
good friend and close ally. 
 
 
--------------- 
A Brief History 
--------------- 
 
 
2. (U) From its founding in 1903 until 1968, the Republic of 
Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a 
commercially oriented oligarchy focused on Panama as an 
entrepot for international trade.  In October 1968, Dr. 
Arnulfo Arias Madrid-- the deceased husband of current 
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso-- was elected to and 
deposed from the presidency for the third time.  General Omar 
Torrijos (d. 1981)-- the deceased father of current 
opposition leader and presidential candidate Martin Torrijos- 
- became dictator and was succeeded in infamy by General 
Manuel Noriega.  On December 20, 1989, former President 
George H.W. Bush ordered the US military into Panama to 
restore democracy, protect AmCits and their property, fulfill 
US treaty responsibilities to operate and defend the Canal, 
and bring Noriega to justice.  Noriega is still serving a 30- 
year sentence in Miami for drug trafficking.  Panama has 
twice since 1989 held free and fair elections, transferring 
power from/to opposition parties. 
 
 
------------------ 
May 2004 Elections 
------------------ 
 
 
3. (U) Panama will hold its next national elections on May 2, 
2004.  Candidates are vying for the presidency, 78 
legislative seats, and all mayoral and local representative 
positions.  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate 
Martin Torrijos maintains a small lead over third-party 
candidate and former Panamanian President Guillermo Endara 
(1989 to 1994).  Both are well ahead of ruling Arnulfista 
party candidate and former Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Aleman (1999 to 2003) and minor Democratic Change (CD) party 
candidate Ricardo Martinelli.  You will meet with all four 
presidential contenders.  Panama\'s elections should not 
warrant extensive monitoring or observation. 
 
 
-------------- 
A Mixed Record 
-------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under US administration, and Canal- 
related industries, especially cargo transshipment through 
ports at both ends of the Canal, have boomed.  But Panama\'s 
overall economy went flat when nearly 30,000 US military 
personnel and their dependents left during the late 1990s, 
and the 2001 global recession has perpetuated the country\'s 
estimated 13.4% unemployment.  Also, Panama has failed to 
attract large investments into the former Canal Zone. 
Poverty, economic disparity, and unemployment are arguably 
the biggest internal challenges facing Panama today.  More 
recently, the economy appears to have picked up, primarily as 
a result of tax incentives given to a now booming 
construction sector. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Towards a Democratic Culture 
---------------------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) Ambassador Watt\'s September 29 speech to Panama\'s 
Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, launching 
Embassy\'s Good Governance Initiative (GGI), resonated firmly 
with Panamanians and generated front-page headlines. 
Venality, conflict of interest, nepotism, and lack of 
transparency are ingrained in Panama\'s political culture and 
institutions.  Panama\'s \"spoils system\" allows politicians to 
use the entire state bureaucracy as a patronage base.  The 
country\'s criminal libel laws, left over from military rule, 
impose enormous costs and risks on whistle-blowers. 
Legislative immunity is often abused, as elsewhere in the 
region.  Embassy currently supports good governance 
activities directed toward judicial reform, civic education, 
business ethics, and strengthening anti-corruption 
prosecutors\' institutional capacity.  You will have a number 
of opportunities to reiterate our GGI message through local 
media outlets. 
 
 
---------------- 
Our Third Border 
---------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Panamanians have become increasingly willing to 
accept mil-to-mil security training, equipment and other 
assistance to enhance their capabilities to protect the Canal 
and borders.  Although the present terrorist threat to the 
Canal is considered low, Panamanian planning, layered 
defenses and security resources are generally well regarded. 
Continued US training, equipment and other assistance are 
vital to preempt a major terrorist attack.  Panama has 
committed to an ambitious maritime security agenda, which 
should help it meet new obligations under the International 
Maritime Organization\'s (IMO) International Shipping and Port 
Security (ISPS) Code by the July 1, 2004 deadline.  Panama\'s 
ship registry blossomed from the third largest in the world 
in 1990 to the largest in the world by 2002, comprising 
nearly 7,000 large commercial vessels.  Of all foreign 
flagged vessels arriving at US ports, 27% are Panamanian. 
About 13% of US ocean-going cargo transits the Canal each 
year.  Panama\'s seafarer registry has licensed approximately 
400,000 crewmembers.  And port services grew dramatically 
from about 200,000 containers per year in the early 1990s to 
almost two million by 2002, giving Panama Latin America\'s 
leading port complex. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Fighting International Crime 
---------------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Law enforcement cooperation with Panama is 
excellent.  The Moscoso Administration set up a new, GOP- 
interagency counternarcotics vetted unit; expanded upon the 
basic shiprider agreement to facilitate maritime/air 
operations in pursuit of drug, arms and explosives smuggling 
(and may soon include WMD); expedited maritime drug prisoner 
transfers to USG custody (saving U.S. taxpayers US$1 million 
per event); and captured and expelled seventeen fugitives 
from US justice (most recently, on January 14, Colombian drug 
kingpin Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya, wanted in New York 
for smuggling five tons of cocaine).  Panama is working much 
more closely with Colombian President Uribe\'s government 
against narco-terrorists.  The GOP has also welcomed USG 
assistance-- DOD special operations forces (training National 
Police (PNP) border units) and AID community development 
(enhancing productive capacity and governmental presence in 
the Darien border province). 
 
 
8. (U) The GOP revamped its legal and administrative 
structures to fight money laundering, becoming a model for 
other countries, such as Russia, that are trying to bring 
their regimes up to grade.  Panama assisted the USG in the 
prosecution of money laundering cases and provided crucial 
information against former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo 
Aleman.  However, at the 2004 Summit of the Americas in 
Monterrey, Mexico, several hemispheric neighbors chided 
Panama for recently granting \"asylee\" status to a former 
Ecuadorian cabinet minister, who is charged with embezzlement 
of government funds. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
9. (SBU) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the US. 
First, for political and economic reasons, President Moscoso 
is pushing for quick action on a bilateral FTA.  Second, the 
GOP has long argued for Panama\'s re-designation from a \"near 
foreign port\" to a \"distant foreign port,\" under the US 
Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA), in order to capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying 
the possibility of a re-designation.  The GOP estimates that 
up to US$50 million per year could be gained for Panama\'s 
growing tourism sector.  Third, over the last several months, 
we have seen a marked improvement in the GOP\'s willingness to 
make progress on a number of US investment cases, to address 
bilateral trade issues, including agricultural concerns, and 
to enhance cooperation/coordination in regional and 
multilateral trade fora.  The USG has asked Panama to 
continue its progress on resolving investment disputes and 
improving its investment climate through responsiveness to 
investor concerns, clear rules of the game, predictability, 
and transparency in decision-making.  During your visit, you 
will have the opportunity to meet several private sector 
representatives to solicit their views on these issues.

Biography: Mireya Moscoso 
------------------------- 
 
 
10. (U) Mireya Moscoso is President of the Republic of Panama 
and leader of the Arnulfista Party.  In the 1999 national 
elections, she defeated Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
presidential candidate Martin Torrijos by seven and a half 
percentage points (44.9 percent to 37.6 percent).  Moscoso 
took office on September 1, 1999.  Moscoso was born on July 
1, 1946, in Panama City, but was raised in the small coastal 
town of Pedasi in the southwest province of Los Santos.  At 
age 18, Moscoso met former Panamanian President Arnulfo Arias 
Madrid in 1964, who was 45 years her senior, and the two fled 
to Miami following the 1968 coup d\'etat.  They were married 
in the US in 1969 and lived in exile until 1978.  Moscoso 
served as Arias\' personal secretary and political understudy 
until his death in 1988. 
 
 
11. (U) Moscoso\'s formal post-secondary education includes 
English and computer courses and an Associate\'s degree in 
Interior Design from Miami Dade County Community College. 
She has a young teenage son Ricardo, whom she adopted during 
her four-year marriage to former Arias coffee plantation 
manager Ricardo Gruber.  She owns a large home in Panama 
City, but prefers to spend time at the coffee plantation and 
cattle ranch in the western province of Chiriqui, which she 
inherited from Arias.  Moscoso understands English well but 
prefers Spanish.

SUBJECT: ENDARA TO RUN AS PANAMA\'S \"HONEST GOVERNMENT\" 
CANDIDATE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Linda Watt for reasons 1.5 (B) & (D). 
 
 
SUMMARY 
======== 
1.  (C) Former president Guillermo Endara has mapped a 
come-from-behind election strategy, positioned himself as the 
campaign\'s most serious anti-corruption reformer, derides 
front-runner Martin Torrijos\'s lack of experience and 
ability, and plans tough talks with U.S. negotiators on 
agriculture on a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  In a 
late-December meeting with EmbOffs, Endara exuded confidence 
and was untroubled about the gap in election finances between 
the Torrijos campaign and his own.  He cast doubt on the 
accuracy of the latest Gallup poll, which shows him trailing 
Torrijos 49%-32%.  Endara\'s campaign team said he said would 
invite cooperation from a civilian U.S. intelligence agency 
and planned to work closely with the USG to formulate 
Panama\'s national security strategy.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Embassy offers this message as part of its 
continuing election coverage. 
 
 
Endara, with his vice presidential running mates Billy Ford 
and Alejandro Posse, and campaign advisor Menalco Solis in 
tow, met with Pol and Econ Counselors and EmbOffs on December 
23 to discuss his campaign.  The following is a brief account 
of Endara\'s current thinking. 
 
 
\"Honesty and Honor\" 
=============== 
3.  (SBU)  Guillermo Endara asserts that his 1989-1994 track 
record and his campaign proposals make him by far Panama\'s 
most plausible anti-corruption candidate.  Endara\'s profile 
-- \"honesty and honor\" -- is what the electorate wants.  His 
principal campaign issues are official corruption and the 
economy and the link between them: Panama will have no 
rule-of-law as long as corruption persists; foreign investors 
will leave because they cannot trust the courts; Panama\'s 
economy will create few jobs without new investment; 
Panamanians have lots of money they don\'t invest because of 
corruption.  But ending corruption in Panama will not be 
easy; it will require \"a fight by brave people.\" 
 
 
How Endara Would End Official Corruption 
=============================== 
4.  (C) If elected, Endara plans to 
 
 
Name as attorney general Mercedes Araz de Grimaldo (an 
Embassy Centennial International Visitor), who has a 
reputation for \"toughness\" and who won a 2003 Integrity Prize 
from Transparency International\'s Panama chapter. 
 
 
Introduce laws permitting prosecutors to openly investigate 
government officials for \"illicit enrichment.\"  (Present 
regulations give many government officials defacto immunity 
from prosecution.) 
 
 
Support a constituent assembly to rewrite Panama\'s 1972 
dictator-drafted constitution. 
 
 
Campaign to end legislative immunity.  (\"The legislators have 
no credibility; they are very corrupt,\" Endara said, adding 
\"The Supreme Court is worse.\") 
 
 
Give citizens the right to request specific information about 
internal government budgets and personnel by restoring the 
Transparency Law, rendered toothless by a Moscoso decree. 
 
 
Put an end to \"I\'ll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine\" 
politics and to promises by newly elected officials not to 
prosecute officials from a previous administration. 
(President Moscoso has been widely accused of entering into 
just such a pact with Martin Torrijos.) 
 
 
Establish an anti-corruption commission to investigate where 
things are going wrong and implement its findings, unlike 
President Moscoso. 
 
 
Come-From-Behind Strategy 
===================== 
5.  (C) Endara plans to win by attracting voters away from 
Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman.  An Arnulfista Party 
founder, Endara says Arnulfistas will vote for him because 
they see no way of winning with Aleman.  If Endara is 
president, Arnulfistas in government would have a better 
chance of keeping their jobs than if the PRD sweeps the 
polls.  Endara disbelieves polls showing him trailing 
front-runner Martin Torrijos 49-32%.  Endara claimed that 49% 
of the vote is improbably high for a PRD candidate, or any 
candidate.  (Note: Under Panama\'s \"first-past-the-post\" 
electoral system, PRD candidate Perez Balladares won the 1994 
election with 33% of the popular vote against a badly divided 
field; in 1999 Mireya Moscoso won with 45% of the vote, while 
PRD runner-up Martin Torrijos got 38%.)  Endara sees no money 
problems to counter the well-funded PRD.  Endara has run 
campaigns \"on a shoe string\" before. 
 
 
What\'s Wrong With Martin 
=================== 
6.  (C) Endara admits that Martin Torrijos democratized the 
PRD and has a name -- Martin\'s father is former Panamanian 
dictator Omar Torrijos (d. 1981) -- that \"is still attractive 
for some people.\"  But Martin Torrijos (b. 1963) has almost 
no experience, either as a politician or in private industry. 
 Martin Torrijos has only held one job in his life, managing 
a McDonald\'s in Chicago during 1988-1992.  Torrijos did serve 
as vice minister of Government and Justice (1994-1998) under 
Perez Balladares but \"did not shine at all.\"  Someone \"close\" 
to Perez Balladares once told Endara, Torrijos \"just can\'t do 
the work.\"  But Panamanians remember Endara as the man who 
\"saved the country\" after the brutal rule of dictators Omar 
Torrijos and Manuel Noriega.  \"He got Panama booming again.\" 
Endara\'s campaign (unlike Martin\'s) does not have to sell \"an 
unknown quantity.\" 
 
 
Is Endara Competent? 
================ 
7.  (C) Endara ran Panama for five years, which he calls \"the 
best administration since 1968\" (the year that the military 
took power) and says he has the firmest commitment to 
democracy and is the best defender of civil rights of all the 
candidates.  Though some critics consider his administration 
to have been honest but inefficient, Endara claims Panamanian 
society\'s disarray during his presidency was due to \"destape\" 
-- pulling the cork out of a highly pressurized bottle, the 
rapid decompression of a society with newly restored 
democratic liberties after two decades of dictatorships. 
 
 
\"We May Be Protectionist On Agriculture\" 
============================== 
8.  (C) At FTA talks with the USG, Panama under Endara will 
be somewhat protectionist on agriculture, aiming at 
self-sufficiency in rice, dairy, pork, and beef, to ensure 
that Panama provides first for its own people.  Posse, 
Endara\'s second VP candidate, says he is not against free 
trade and criticized USG agricultural subsidies. \"The FTA 
must be negotiated and studied.  The United States does that. 
 We should do the same.\" 
 
 
You Can Write Our National Security Plan 
============================== 
9.  (C) An Endara administration would in all likelihood work 
hand-in-hand with the USG on regional security issue. 
Endara\'s campaign has contacted an American consulting firm 
to draft a plan, concentrating on national security (not 
internal or public security).  The plan will not appear as a 
campaign document.  Once in office, Endara would be disposed 
to ask the USG to help draft such a plan but prefers the 
civilian CIA rather than a \"uniformed\" intelligence service. 
 
 
Comment 
======= 
10.  (C) Endara faces an uphill struggle as he attacks 
Torrijos\'s formidable but not insurmountable lead in the 
polls -- Mireya Moscoso overcame a similar gap in the polls 
during the final days of the 1999 campaign to best Martin 
Torrijos.  Endara\'s non-machine third-party candidacy and 
shoe-string budget may leave him with fewer debts to office 
seekers or special interests than his major rivals, should he 
manage to come from behind and win the presidency on May 2. 
 
 
11.  (C) Endara\'s unshakable commitment to democratic 
governance, his well-deserved reputation for honesty, and his 
modest image as a \"regular guy\" who worried about the welfare 
of the common people are his greatest assets in a country 
grown weary of the systematic looting of the public treasury 
by politicians.  He is the campaign\'s only anti-corruption 
candidate with real credibility and a proven track record in 
public office.  Despite their campaign pledges, both Torrijos 
and Aleman are vehicles for political parties (the PRD and 
the Arnulfistas) that have proved rapacious in defrauding the 
public trust while in office.  But Endara must overcome 
several negatives, doubts about his competence and ability as 
an administrator first and foremost.  His age (he is pushing 
70) will be a factor in youthful Panama, given that his main 
rival, Martin Torrijos, just turned 40 and is the youngest of 
the four candidates.  (Billy Ford is the same age as Endara.) 
 Endara\'s health is another issue.  Recently diagnosed with 
diabetes, Endara has shed dozens of pounds, apparently on 
doctors\' orders. 
 
 
12.  (C) Endara\'s awkward marriage-of-convenience with the 
Solidarity Party as his political campaign vehicle puts him 
at odds with the objectives of the party\'s founder and 
president, Samuel Lewis Galindo.  The two have a curious 
relationship.  Historically a staunch PRD supporter, Lewis 
Galindo broke away to found Solidarity in 1993.  Many have 
called the party \"PRD-lite.\"  The most adamantly anti-PRD 
candidate in the race, Endara\'s strange choice of political 
bedfellow is reason enough to make him blush. 
 
 
13.  (C) But Endara faces other problems, like money.  The 
notoriously thrifty Lewis Galindo is not giving the Endara 
campaign a dime.  In fact, Lewis Galindo may fear losing 
control over his party in the event of an Endara victory. 
Lewis Galindo expects Endara to lose but still do well enough 
to increase Solidarity\'s (and Lewis Galindo\'s) influence.  If 
the race is close, Lewis Galindo might try to find covert 
ways to support Torrijos, who is about to name Lewis 
Galindo\'s nephew, Samuel Lewis Navarro (see septel), as his 
running mate.  Yet an Endara supporter who is a high official 
in the Solidarity Party claims the first thing Endara will do 
if he becomes president of Panama is expel Mireya Moscoso 
from the Arnulfista Party and take over himself.  (Note: That 
seems unlikely because it would conflict with the electoral 
law -- The Arnulfistas expelled Endara for running as the 
Solidarity Party\'s candidate.)  \"Mireya Moscoso will not last 
two minutes if Endara wins.  You will see great changes in 
Panama if Endara wins,\" he told Pol Counselor.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) In recent meeting with Pol Counselor, first vice 
presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Navarro argued that the 
Martin Torrijos ticket of the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) offers Panama its best chance to improve social and 
economic conditions in Panama and eliminate the threat to 
democracy that increasing poverty, corruption, and 
disillusionment would bring.  The main tasks of a Torrijos 
government would be A) Canal expansion; B) a bilateral free 
trade agreement (FTA) with the United States; C) a \"redesign\" 
of Panama\'s strategic relationship with the U.S. to emphasize 
shared security interests; and D) rebuilding credibility with 
the people by delivering education, services, and improving 
Panama\'s transportation system.  End Summary. 
 
 
Panama\'s \"Last Chance\" 
---------------------- 
2. (C) Official corruption is Panama\'s most pressing problem, 
Lewis Navarro maintained, adding that \"change must come from 
the top or else we face a social revolution here.\"  He 
underscored \"disturbing parallels\" between 2004 and 1968, the 
year the military took power in Panama, when he said many 
were willing to gamble that the military might improve their 
lives.  Then, as now, people lost confidence in the governing 
class, Lewis Navarro said.  (Comment: Unlike in 1968, Panama 
no longer has a military.  On the other hand, observers have 
warned that the system is ripe for an unscrupulous, 
Chavez-type populist politician to exploit the anger and 
disillusionment of deprived Panamanians, who rail against the 
growing corruption in the governing class. See Ref A.)  One 
of Panama\'s leading businessmen, with international interests 
in fruit and packaging, Samuel Lewis Navarro told Pol 
Counselor that the best way to halt Panama\'s slide toward 
what he predicted would be social and political catastrophe 
would be to elect Martin Torrijos president. 
 
 
Get Panama Back on Track 
------------------------ 
3.  Radical reforms are not needed, Lewis Navarro claimed. 
Instead, a new PRD government would try to reform Panama 
gradually but steadily to put it back on track, by 
emphasizing A) canal expansion; B) a bilateral free trade 
agreement (FTA) with the United States; C) a redesign of 
Panama\'s strategic relationship with the U.S. to highlight 
shared security concerns after 9/11; and D) rebuilding 
credibility with the people by delivering education, public 
services, and improving a decaying transportation system. 
 
 
Endara As Anti-Establishment 
---------------------------- 
4.  (C) Saying he is very surprised at (former president) 
Endara\'s relatively high poll numbers (Torrijos leads Endara 
49%-32%), Lewis Navarro correctly noted that those 
prospective votes for Endara come at the expense of Jose 
Miguel Aleman (the Arnulfista candidate), not Martin 
Torrijos.  Labeling Endara as \"anti-establishment, the 
populist candidate for people who are fed up,\" Lewis Navarro 
discounted Endara as a serious threat to Torrijos, presumably 
because Endara lacks a nationwide party structure. 
 
 
Campaign of Ideas 
----------------- 
5.  (SBU) Lewis Navarro claimed that Torrijos is running \"a 
campaign of ideas,\" citing a speech that proposed Panama 
should emulate Finland, Ireland, Singapore, South Korea, and 
Taiwan as underdeveloped countries that lifted themselves out 
of poverty in a single generation.  Torrijos asserted that 
Panama\'s potential as the Hemisphere\'s logistics hub, and its 
growing middle class, will help it to maintain a sustained 
rate of economic growth. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Torrijos has proposed creating jobs by 
\"revitalizing\" export-capable economic sectors, such as 
agriculture and manufacturing; increasing productivity and 
competitiveness (through training, education, and investment 
in infrastructure); prioritizing tourism, maritime services 
and ports, transport, fisheries, communications, and 
financial services as \"growth industries\"; concluding a 
Panama-U.S. free trade agreement; and rationalizing public 
finances, reducing regulations, and completing the 
Colon-Panama highway.  Turning to economic issues, Lewis 
Navarro asserted that a U.S.-Panama FTA is about investment, 
not trade.  He touted the FTA for its positive effects on 
procurement and contracting as the main lever to get foreign 
financing for Canal expansion, which will be the biggest 
infrastructure project in the Hemisphere. 
 
 
Comment/Bio Note 
---------------- 
7.  (C) Not a politician himself, Lewis Navarro comes from a 
political family.  His uncle, Samuel Lewis Galindo, is 
president of the Solidarity Party, which he founded in 1993, 
with Lewis Navarro\'s father (now deceased), Gabriel Lewis 
Galindo, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the 
United States.  Lewis Navarro comes across as an ingenuous 
idealist.  Insiders say Torrijos chose him as a running mate 
because of his \"squeaky clean\" image and his obvious skill as 
a manager.  Lewis Navarro has not succeeded in masking his 
dislike for the \"Old Guard\" PRD nationalists and leftists, 
and they have returned the favor.  Therefore his naming as 
the PRD\'s vice presidential candidate (he has aspirations to 
follow in his father\'s footsteps as foreign minister) must be 
seen as a positive sign of Martin Torrijos\'s ability to keep 
the PRD\'s \"old guard\" in check. 
 
 
8.  (C) What distinguishes the Torrijos team from the other 
three camps is its ambition to transform Panama into a \"first 
world\" country and its prolific ideas on how to do it.  Even 
assuming Martin\'s good intentions, he will need to ride herd 
over the PRD\'s fractious wings to govern.  Torrijos insiders 
claim that the candidate is in firm control, but concede that 
20% of the PRD support former president Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, while 15% are (former dictator Manuel) 
Noriega-style nationalists, and many in those two groups are 
highly influential among party rank and file.  Seeing himself 
as a Panamanian Tony Blair, Martin Torrijos told an ex-USG 
official that he hopes to bring the PRD firmly to the middle 
of the electable political center, and drop its archaic 
political baggage. 
 
 
9.  (C) The question is, will Martin Torrijos be able to 
govern as he wishes with an influential \"old guard\" who 
mostly oppose his policies?  While we cannot answer this 
hypothetical question, we have noted conflicting signals: 
Torrijos scored a big win by (privately) urging Perez 
Balladares not to seek another term in PARLACEN.  The 
nomination would have sullied the PRD\'s image, and Torrijos 
deserves credit for raising the issue forcibly.  But what 
really changed Perez Balladares\'s mind was probably not the 
Torrijos intervention but a Supreme Court decision the day 
before he announced his decision not to run for PARLACEN that 
he could not be prosecuted under evidence presented by 
Comptroller Alvin Weeden in the PECC scandal.  (See Ref C.) 
Torrijos did finally sack his cousin Hugo Torrijos as 
campaign manager (due to corruption allegations cited in Ref 
C), only to appoint several questionable (visceral 
nationalists) from the \"Old Guard\" as key members of his 
campaign team.  Clearly, Torrijos is still struggling to 
balance competing pressures from the multiple factions that 
uneasily coexist within the PRD camp.

SUBJECT: PANAMA NGO CONCERNED ABOUT CHINESE DEBT BONDAGE 
AND CHILD LABOR, BUT LACKS HARD EVIDENCE 
 
------- 
 SUMMARY 
 ------- 
1. (SBU)  In a January 8 meeting to discuss trafficking in 
persons (TIP) and related issues with PolOff and political 
assistant, acting director of Casa Esperanza, Ramon Aleman 
Arias said Chinese migrant debt bondage and unregulated child 
labor are problems in Panama. (NOTE: Casa Esperanza is a 
leading Panamanian NGO assisting children and families in 
need. End Note.)  Arias admitted his evidence of Chinese debt 
bondage is anecdotal.  On illegal child labor, Aleman said 
some GOP officials resist Casa Esperanza\'s programs, possibly 
for their own financial benefits. 
 
 
2. (SBU)  Aleman is also concerned about sexual exploitation 
of minors. He said that in rural provinces minors have been 
known to offer sex, especially to foreigners.  Aleman said he 
does not know the extent of this activity.  He emphasized 
that he has no evidence of trafficking networks for the 
purposes of prostitution.  He thinks the USG has the 
necessary influence with the GOP to encourage any legal or 
programmatic changes deemed necessary.  End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE DEBT BONDAGE, EVIDENCE LACKING 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
3. (SBU)  Aleman raised concerns about forced labor and/or 
debt bondage, especially amongst the Chinese community.  He 
believes, but lacks evidence, that Chinese families are 
forced into debt bondage by Chinese organized crime. 
According to Aleman, the Chinese \"own\" their businesses but 
are forced to pay high \"interest\" and buy their goods only 
from one supplier.  Aleman does not have an estimate of the 
number of Chinese that might be affected by debt bondage. He 
believes more investigation is needed by GOP.  He offered the 
comments about Chinese debt bondage as possible area where 
Panama might have a TIP problem. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
CONTINUING EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHILD LABOR 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  On unregulated child labor, Aleman discussed his 
concerns because of Casa Esperanza\'s educational and 
prevention programs and USG interest.  He is proud of Casa 
Esperanza\'s efforts that increase children\'s education.  He 
noted this is especially important for indigenous families 
working on coffee plantations.  Aleman remains concerned that 
child labor is excessive on pineapple plantations and in the 
forestry industry in Darien province.  Aleman said Casa 
Esperanza is working hard to provide programs that offer 
realistic solutions to the problems of unregulated child 
labor.  He said these programs are not well received by some 
GOP officials. He believes this is because these officials 
own coffee plantations where child labor is used.  Aleman 
said he was told by one GOP official, \"this is a State matter 
and Casa Esperanza should not be involved.\" 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OR LOOKING FOR A \"GRINGO\" PARTNER? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
5. (SBU)  Because of Casa Esperanza\'s extensive work with 
children, PolOff and political assistant requested Aleman 
discuss his opinions on possible sexual exploitation of 
minors, especially any evidence of organized prostitution 
rings.  Aleman believes that there is sexual exploitation of 
minors in Panama. He thinks that it is especially prevalent 
in small towns and near resort communities.  Bocas del Toro 
province is a growing concern, according to Aleman.  He 
thinks that prostitution has reasserted itself and could have 
minors participating, however his focus is more on the 
reopening of formerly closed brothels with new powerful and 
politically connected owners. (NOTE: Bocas is a resort area 
near the Costa Rican border that attracts many foreigners as 
visitors and residents. End Note.) 
 
 
------------------------ 
GOP WILL FOLLOW USG LEAD 
------------------------ 
 
 
6. (SBU)  \"If you (USG) want the GOP to make new laws or 
change something, just tell them\", Aleman said.  He believes 
the GOP will follow the USG lead if new legislation and/or 
other changes are required to combat TIP and unregulated 
child labor.  Aleman says the GOP (present and future) knows 
the USG and international community are especially concerned 
about these issues. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  Many NGOs in Panama have extremely low opinions of 
the GOP. Aleman\'s comments should be taken within this 
context. In addition, his lack of hard evidence limits the 
validity of his claims.  However, he does bring a wealth of 
experience in the NGO field and as a private sector attorney 
familiar with Panama\'s legal framework, especially in regards 
to children\'s issues.  Further Embassy investigation into 
possible Chinese debt bondage and commercial sexual 
exploitation of minors will help determine the validity of 
Aleman\'s assertions.  Casa Esperanza is to be commended on 
their work enhancing the lives of Panama\'s children.

SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION (PANAMA): NEW VICE MINISTER 
OF TRADE, ROMEL ADAMES 
 
1.  Romel Adames (42) was appointed Vice Minister for Trade 
at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MICI) by President 
Moscoso on January 1, 2004.  Adames, Harvard-educated and 
until recently Panama\'s Ambassador to the WTO, will be the 
lead negotiator for the GOP during the upcoming FTA 
negotiations with the United States.  Adames replaces Meliton 
Arrocha, who was appointed head of CLICAC (Panama\'s 
Competition Authority).  Adames, a confidant of Commerce 
Minister Joaquin Jacome, enters the position with 
considerable trade experience having also participated in 
Panama\'s WTO accession in 1997. 
 
 
2.  Adames is a strong advocate regarding the benefits of 
trade liberalization and a believer in the multilateral 
trading system.  His main challenges will be establishing 
guidelines and priorities for Panama as well as outreach to 
the private sector during this election year. (Note: National 
elections are scheduled for May 2, with a new administration 
taking office on September 1.)  While the GOP would like the 
first FTA negotiating round to take place before the May 2 
national elections, Jacome and Adames insist the Moscoso 
Administration will treat the FTA negotiations as a State 
endeavor and keep politics out of the process.  Both plan 
extensive consultation with the economic advisors of 
opposition political candidates and the wider private sector. 
(Note: All political parties support the negotiation of a FTA 
with the U.S.)

(SBU) Summary: Probing the unknown 
---------------------------------- 
1. (C) Elected by his colleagues for a two-year term as 
President (Chief Justice) of Panama\'s nine-member Supreme 
Court on October 23, 2003, Cesar Antonio Pereira Burgos (DOB: 
29 SEP 1929) has not yet shown strong interest in continuing 
the drive to reform Panama\'s judiciary that his predecessor, 
Adan Arnulfo Arjona, began two years ago.  Upon assuming the 
court\'s top spot on January 5, Pereira Burgos took a tough 
line with the press, limiting court access to one accredited 
representative of each media company, supposedly to stop 
\"abusive\" and false reporting on internal court 
deliberations.  Pereira told AID Director that he admires the 
U.S. Supreme Court\'s method of accrediting media (which gives 
the press greater continuity on complex legal issues) and 
wishes to mirror it in Panama\'s Supreme Court.  Legal 
insiders doubt Pereira acted to protect the integrity of the 
deliberative process and suggest instead that he wanted to 
shield the judiciary from public scrutiny. 
 
 
2. (C)  Justice Pereira has expressed interest recently in 
learning more about USAID\'s Administration of Justice Program 
in Panama, but his dedication to judicial reform remains 
untested.  Pereira paints his management style as inclusive, 
and he claims that he will base his decisions on the will of 
his peers, which represents an opportunity to generate 
\"buy-in\" for reform from other Justices.  Arjona\'s 
unflinching dedication to reform at all costs contributed to 
his peers\' unwillingness to collaborate with him.  At the 
same time, Panama\'s Supreme Court, and other subordinate 
elements of the judiciary, continue to be subject to 
executive branch interference via patronage appointees and 
political manipulation.  If our long-term collaboration with 
the Supreme Court under Pereira turns out to be fruitless, 
Embassy is studying ways to increase its support to 
demand-based civil society initiatives that press for 
judicial reform from the outside in.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
(SBU) Anti-Arjona alliance 
-------------------------- 
3. (C) A bipartisan alliance of Justices linked to both the 
Arnulfista Party (PA) and its perennial opponent, the 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) united to elect Pereira 
Burgos.  Embassy interprets this unusual alliance as a 
backlash against Justice Arjona, who often operated on his 
own, without consulting the other Justices.  Resistance among 
the other Supreme Court Justices to Arjona\'s reform efforts 
often was rife (based as much on personal animosity towards 
Arjona\'s style as on opposition to the reforms themselves.) 
Arjona\'s colleagues actively politicked against him before 
the October internal elections. (See Reftel A.)  On October 
23, six of the nine Justices voted for Pereira, two voted for 
Arjona, and one abstained. 
 
 
(SBU) Pereira\'s political colors 
-------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Cesar Pereira Burgos, one of five original \"Special 
Advisors\" to President Moscoso until his January 2000 
appointment to the Supreme Court, openly acknowledged his 
political inclination in a January 5 speech.  In addition to 
Moscoso\'s 1999 campaign, he participated in former President 
Guillermo Endara\'s 1989 campaign and served as Endara\'s 
Ambassador to the UN (1990-92) and Agriculture Minister 
(1992-94).  Pereira Burgos claims \"an old friendship\" with 
hardline Arnulfista and Legislative Assembly President Jacobo 
Salas, and was an opposition legislator from 1980-84, 
representing Herrera province, in the Azuero Peninsula. 
Several Supreme Court observers have also suggested that 
Pereira has ties to ill-reputed businessman and Moscoso 
confidant Augusto \"Onassis\" Garcia, part of the network 
described in Reftel B. 
 
 
5. (C) Before taking charge of the Court in January 2004, 
Pereira attempted to have the controversial PECC corruption 
case (Reftel C) transferred to his jurisdiction from that of 
another Justice, an unprecedented move that his colleagues 
vetoed.  That case may be an anomaly, indicative of Pereira\'s 
personal animosity toward the defendant, Comptroller General 
Alvin Weeden.  Observers suggest that Pereira was 
transmitting a message from President Moscoso who did not 
want to be next in line if Weeden were left unchecked to 
investigate her predecessor, Ernesto Perez Balladares 
(1994-99) for corruption.  Nevertheless, the fact that 
Pereira didn\'t insist on the transfer over the protests of 
his colleagues is a positive sign. 
 
 
(U) Comment: Getting to know you 
-------------------------------- 
6. (C) Prior to his election as Supreme Court President, 
Cesar Pereira Burgos was known primarily as a grumpy old man 
with a tendency to speak out of school, and for his indolence 
and conspicuous consumption.  Pereira is certainly not a 
model reformer, but he\'s the most direct avenue to influence 
the Panama\'s hierarchical judiciary.  A recent Embassy 
interaction might point to a more positive relationship with 
the Court. The Court\'s chief statistician asked Embassy to 
request formally that Pereira release statistics which should 
be available publicly, just to see whether he would approve. 
Pereira promptly released the statistics.  While structural 
reform in the judiciary requires greater conviction than 
releasing statistics, Embassy hopes that Pereira\'s goodwill 
thus far is indicative of a greater commitment.  However, we 
are preparing to pursue other (civil society-based) 
initiatives that would advance our judicial reform goals in 
the event that Pereira turns out to be obstructionist in his 
leadership of the Court.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) On January 21 Special Envoy for Hemispheric 
Initiatives Otto Reich, accompanied by Ambassador Watt, met 
with Panama President Mireya Moscoso.  Flanked by Foreign 
Minister Harmodio Arias and Commerce and Industries Minister 
Joaquin Jacome, Moscoso pushed an April 2004 start date for 
the bilateral FTA talks.  The Ambassador told President 
Moscoso that a Commerce Dept. team would conduct research in 
Panama during January 27-30 on the economic effects of 
granting distant foreign port status to Panama under the 
Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA).  Moscoso said that 
Cuban President Fidel Castro (and Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez) would likely attend the February 2004 Panama meeting 
of the Association of Caribbean Nations, although Castro had 
been asked not to come.  Minister Jacome said a large 
investment by Dell Computers is imminent, adding to its 
existing call center.  End Summary. 
 
 
FTA 
--- 
2.  (SBU) President Moscoso pressed Special Envoy Otto Reich 
and Ambassador Watt for an April 2004 start date for the 
bilateral free trade agreement talks (that is, prior to the 
May 2 national election) in a January 21 meeting.  Amb. Reich 
replied that USTR had agreed to hold the talks the second 
quarter, which means they could start any time between April 
and June.  Minister Jacome confirmed that no specific date 
for the talks has been chosen. 
 
 
PVSA 
---- 
3.  (SBU) When President Moscoso urged a modification to the 
Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA) to grant Panama \"distant 
foreign port\" status, Amb. Watt explained that a Commerce 
Dept. team would be in Panama January 27-30 to conduct 
research on the economic effects of changing Panama\'s status. 
 The results of that research will help the USG make a 
determination on PVSA. 
 
 
Investment 
---------- 
4.  (SBU) Investor interest in Panama is rising, Minister 
Jacome told Ambassador Reich, and  Americans are buying real 
estate in Boquete, Chiriqui (in western Panama).  Jacome 
added that the Bell South and Manzanillo International 
Terminal (MIT) investment disputes are close to being 
resolved.  Recently, five cruise ships docked in Panama on 
the same day, he added, showing that Panama is growing in 
popularity as a tourist destination.  Panama expects 4% 
growth this year, fueled by tourism and construction.  Amb. 
Reich said he had noticed a big change in Panama City\'s 
skyline since his last visit 10 years ago.  Jacome said that 
chances are good that Dell Computer soon would decide to 
rapidly increase its call-center personnel and make a 
significant new investment. 
 
 
Drug Lord Arrest 
---------------- 
5.  (SBU) Amb. Watt thanked President Moscoso for Panama\'s 
excellent cooperation with Embassy and U.S. law enforcement 
officials in the recent arrest and deportation of Colombian 
kingpin Archangel de Jesus Henao Montoya, wanted in New York 
on drug charges.  (Note: Henao Montoya has been described as 
one of the Hemisphere\'s leading drug lords.) 
 
 
Castro, Chavez Visit 
-------------------- 
6.  (C) Cuban President Fidel Castro (and Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez) likely will attend the February 13-14 
Caribbean Heads of State Summit (Association of Caribbean 
States) meeting, President Moscoso said, although Foreign 
Minister Arias said Panama had asked Castro not to come. 
President Moscoso and FM Arias agreed that Venezuela is 
becoming \"more like Cuba.\" 
 
 
Trial of Anti-Castro Cubans 
--------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) Arias added that Panama\'s Miami consulate had been 
picketed more than once by anti-Castro demonstrators 
demanding the release of four anti-Castro Cubans soon to be 
tried in Panama for conspiring to murder Castro in Panama 
during the November 2001 Ibero-American Summit.  The accused 
are Luis Posada Carriles, Gaspar Jimenez Escobedo (AmCit), 
Guillermo Novo Sampol (AmCit), and Pedro Remon Rodriguez 
(AmCit).  (Note: Panama considers Posada Carriles to be a 
Cuban citizen.)  The first hearing in the trial, subject to 
constant delays, was held September 5, 2003.  (See Reftels A 
and B).  Panama has rejected Cuban demands for extradition. 
 
 
8.  (U) Special Envoy Reich did not have the opportunity to 
clear this message.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (SBU) On January 22, Special Envoy Otto Reich and 
Ambassador Watt met with Panama\'s four presidential 
candidates -- Ricardo Martinelli, front-runner Martin 
Torrijos, Jose Miguel Aleman, and Guillermo Endara.  The 
candidates explained their strategies, goals, and priorities 
in a series of 10-minute interviews and one general session. 
The candidates agreed on the need to end corruption, attract 
investment to create jobs, modernize the Canal, make 
government more honest and transparent, negotiate a Free 
Trade Agreement with the United States, support U.S. 
counter-terrorism and security initiatives, and maintain good 
Panama-U.S. relations.  Not surprisingly, they disagreed 
mainly on who would win the May 2 vote.  A luncheon meeting 
held earlier in the day for GOP officials and NGO/private 
sector representatives produced complementary themes, 
focusing on Panama\'s need for a modern, professional civil 
service and on the Canal Administrator\'s suggestion that the 
government of Panama increase transparency in government 
procurement by adopting the \"bid by internet\" system of the 
Panama Canal Authority.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) All four of Panama\'s presidential candidates met 
privately with Special Envoy Reich and Ambassador Watt on 
January 22, accompanied either by their vice presidential 
running mates or their campaign managers. 
 
 
Ricardo Martinelli 
------------------ 
3.  (SBU) Martinelli, accompanied by campaign manager Jimmy 
Papadimitriu, explained his stand for transparency and 
against corruption as the only way to increase jobs and 
investment and gave strong support to Amb. Reich\'s January 21 
speech declaring that the United States would no longer issue 
visas to corrupt officials.  (See Ref A.)  Martinelli also 
repeated his theme that U.S. troops should return to Panama. 
Martinelli said he would run the GOP \"like a business\" and 
would work to convince Panama\'s people \"to have faith in the 
system\" because unfortunately the system is \"guilty until 
proven innocent.\"  According to Martinelli\'s own poll 
(conducted by Greenberg, one of President Clinton\'s 
pollsters), his campaign is currently  in third place with 
11%, ahead of Jose Miguel Aleman (7%), but trailing Torrijos 
(45%) and Endara (30%).  He accused the PRD of \"rigging\" poll 
results that show Torrijos ahead with 49% and Martinelli last 
with 5%. 
 
 
Martin Torrijos 
--------------- 
4.  (SBU) Torrijos promised a 100-day legislative marathon 
following his inauguration as president to pass laws to 
reform social security and encourage large-scale investment. 
He also promised to revitalize the government transparency 
law by eliminating President Moscoso\'s restrictive 
implementing decree, which effectively gutted the law. 
Torrijos hopes to conclude a bilateral commercial agreement 
with Colombia to lure Colombian capital and entrepreneurs to 
Panama.  Torrijos noted that only the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) has good relations with Cocle 
Province residents who are in the path of Canal expansion. 
Vice presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Navarro (Refs B and 
C) said the Torrijos campaign shared many U.S. concerns, such 
as security, counter-narcotics, and counter-terrorism.  He 
pointed out that all three PRD candidates, including second 
VP candidate Ruben Arosemena, hold degrees from U.S. 
universities. 
 
 
Jose Miguel Aleman 
------------------ 
5.  (SBU) Shrugging off single-digit polling results, 
Arnulfista standard-bearer Aleman predicted a \"final battle\" 
between himself and Martin Torrijos.  He declared himself 
surprised but pleased that the bilateral Free Trade Agreement 
has a good chance of becoming reality, a fact he attributed 
to the good relations between President Moscoso and President 
Bush.  Aleman commented that \"too many party people\" are 
appointed at all levels throughout the government, which 
affects Panama\'s democracy.  Aleman said he is on the street 
every day where he finds \"much enthusiasm\" for his campaign. 
He noted that the Arnulfistas are fielding some 1800 
candidates and he predicted a clean electoral process.  In 
the session with the other candidates, Aleman said that 
Panama\'s beef, rice, and sugar industries are \"fragile\" but 
employ many people (which is why Aleman and Endara, with 
their strength in the countryside, are more protectionist on 
trade). 
 
 
Guillermo Endara 
---------------- 
6.  (SBU) Endara\'s vice presidential running mate (and 
ex-schoolmate), Billy Ford, said the days of Panama\'s 
\"special\" U.S. relationship were over; what Panama now seeks 
are \"excellent\" relations with the United States.  \"Our 
government (1989-1994) never stole a dollar,\" Ford said, 
adding that it was about time Panama had a government that 
can convince people that it knows what it is doing.  Endara 
promised to \"do what we did before, but better\" and recalled 
his close relations with former Ambassador Hinton, after the 
1989 \"Just Cause\" invasion restored Endara as president. 
Endara expressed interest in working closely with the USG on 
security (see Ref D), adding that Panama has no capability to 
identify citizens or residents with links to international 
terrorist groups. 
 
 
Luncheon With GOP/NGOs/private sector 
------------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) Prior to meeting the four candidates, Amb. Watt 
hosted a luncheon for Special Envoy Reich at which the themes 
of government financial transparency, administrative reform 
and Canal bidding practices were discussed intensively. 
Several participants asserted that the state was in dire need 
of overhaul and modernization -- \"Why should our civil 
servants be job hunting every five years?\" they asked. 
(Note: Panama has no professional civil service.  Government 
employment is subject to the \"spoils\" system, where the 
ruling party can appoint everyone from minister to postal 
clerk.)  Canal Administrator Aleman Zubieta argued for a 
change in the Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA) that 
would allow Panama to serve as an embarkation point for 
cruise ships, and for a new public contracting law that would 
permit internet bidding like the system now used by the Canal 
Authority.  Guests included embattled Controller General 
Alvin Weeden, Electoral Tribunal President Valdes, the 
Catholic Archbiship of Panama, Canal Administrator Aleman, 
Vice Foreign Minister Castrellon, and leaders from business, 
civil society, and the media.

Classified By: Ambassador Linda E. Watt for Reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
 
1. (SBU) This biographical report details Ambassador and 
Emboffs\' impressions of Nikolay Vladimir during his tenure as 
Russian Ambassador to Panama as well as the highlights of his 
Curriculum Vitae.  Ambassador Vladimir departed Panama in 
December 2003, informing Ambassador Watt that he had been 
selected to head the MFA\'s North American directorate, an 
appointment he characterized as a great privilege to which he 
looks forward enthusiastically. 
 
 
2. (U) Born in 1947 and bearing the diplomatic rank of Envoy 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, First Class, Nikolay 
Mikhailovich Vladimir entered the Soviet Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs in 1974.  He graduated in 1970 from the Moscow State 
Institute for International Relations (now MGIMO-Univ.) and 
in 1982 from the Diplomatic Academy, both under the USSR MFA. 
Vladimir served twice as in the Soviet Embassy in Hungary 
(1974-80, 1989-94) and also in the Soviet Embassy in Cuba 
(1982-85). 
 
 
3. (U) Most recently, Vladimir served as Russian Ambassador 
to Panama from August 2000 through December 2003.  Vladimir\'s 
most recent positions of note are: Deputy Director of MFA 
North America Department (1996-98), Ambassador to Jamaica, 
and non resident Ambassador to Antigua and Barbuda, later to 
the Commonwealth of Dominica (1998-2000). 
 
 
4. (C) Vladimir spent most of his term in Panama without his 
family, though his wife made occasional visits.  Mrs. 
Vladimir, who speaks good English, was caring for elderly 
parents in Russia, precluding her from accompanying her 
husband to Panama. Vladimir occasionally visited his wife and 
two adult children (one son, one daughter) in Russia.  His 
son works on non-proliferation issues at MFA 
 
 
5. (C) Vladimir speaks excellent Spanish and English.  He was 
active in Panama diplomatic social scene.  He was an active 
promoter of Russian economic interests in Panama.  As such, 
he arranged the visit of a large delegation of Russian 
businessmen to Panama and, near the time of his departure, 
was working on a reciprocal visit to Russia by leading 
Panamanian diplomats.  Vladimir was a popular member of the 
diplomatic corps in Panama, largely due to his easygoing and 
affable personality.  He showed special interest in the U.S., 
seeking out Embassy officers to discuss bilateral relations 
which he invariably cast in a positive light (even during the 
Iraq war when he highlighted mutual U.S./Panamanian interests 
in a stable Iraq). 
 
 
6. (C) Vladimir promoted a successful bilateral 
anti-money-laundering agreement, and coordinated the visit to 
Russia of the Panamanian Foreign Minister, Director of the 
Maritime Authority, and other senior officials to sign a 
reciprocal agreement on maritime issues.  He presided over 
the November 2003 groundbreaking ceremony for a large new 
Russian Embassy in Panama. 
 
 
7. (C) Vladimir consistently expressed great affection for 
the U.S., recalling in particular the month he spent at the 
University of Georgia in Athens in the mid-nineties.  He has 
traveled extensively in the U.S. as a member of official 
delegations.

Our View

2. (SBU)  Pol Counselor explained that Embassy has identified 
four primary areas in which Panama is vulnerable to 
terrorists. (A) The Canal: The threat to the Panama Canal is 
low, but it remains a highly visible potential target.  (B) 
Panama\'s ports and maritime environment: Two million 
containers each year pass through Panamanian ports (and four 
million containers pass through the Canal), creating 
opportunities to target the United States, other countries, 
or the Canal with weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  Another 
concern is the approximately 7,000 large ships using the 
Panamanian flag of convenience and the more than 400,000 
Panamanian seafarers.  (C) Finance: Panama\'s advanced 
financial banking sector and weak incorporation laws are ripe 
for money laundering.  (D) Colombian spillover: Colombian 
narco-terrorists use with impunity Panama\'s border region for 
rest and relaxation.  To address these possible threats, 
Embassy described the USG\'s CT policy objectives in Panama, 
including the push for Panama\'s ratification of the last of 
thirteen international CT conventions, and detailed the 
CT-related sustainable development (AID), law enforcement 
(NAS), and security (MilGroup) assistance provided to Panama. 
 Each representative explained his/her country\'s viewpoint, 
analysis, and CT-related programs.  They generally concurred 
with Embassy\'s overall analysis and recognized that the 
overwhelming amount of CT-related assistance comes from the 
USG.  (See ref A.) 
 
 
------- 
Germany 
------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) Germany\'s Minister Counselor Bernd Ganter took 
exception to labeling Colombian insurgents as terrorists and 
bluntly stated that assisting Panama in addressing that 
regional stability challenge was \"not in Germany\'s interest.\" 
 Ganter recognized the high visibility of the Canal as a 
terrorist target, but stated that Panama, as a \"developed\" 
country, should have the ability to protect the Canal and has 
the greatest interest in doing so.  Germany believes it faces 
no threat related to the Canal.  Furthermore, he said, the 
terrorist threat is greatest in Southeast Asia, where the GOG 
is concentrating its CT-related assistance.  Germany does not 
provide any direct CT-related assistance to Panama and 
recently withdrew its LegAtt-equivelant from the region. 
 
 
----- 
Italy 
----- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Italy\'s Commercial Attache Marco Ceasaroni agreed 
with the low terrorism threat assessment on Panama, confirmed 
that Italy does not provide any CT-related assistance to 
Panama, and pressed for more information/intelligence sharing 
between CTAG members and Panama as the best way to help 
Panama help itself and constructively use its limited 
resources. 
 
 
------ 
Russia 
------ 
 
 
5. (SBU) Russia\'s Charge\' Oleg Ostrovskiy confirmed that his 
government does not provide any CT-related assistance to 
Panama, but highlighted Russia\'s close cooperation with the 
GOP\'s Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), sharing information on 
money laundering cases.  Ostrovskiy proposed that GOP 
officials be invited to Embassy\'s next mini-CTAG meeting to 
brief the group on Panama\'s needs in the CT field.  He asked 
that the mini-CTAG draft a matrix to directly link GOP CT 
priorities (based on the briefing) to possible CTAG member\'s 
assistance. 
 
 
------------- 
Great Britain 
------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Great Britain\'s Consul Penny Walsh mentioned her 
government\'s donation of two sniffer dogs for use at Panama\'s 
Tocumen International Airport and her embassy\'s cooperative 
relationship with Panama\'s National Police (PNP).  However, 
the GOGB has not provided any other CT-related assistance to 
Panama.  Walsh noted Panama\'s upcoming May 2 general election 
as a possible distraction to CT-related cooperation, training 
and assistance, and GOP responses to mini-CTAG requests. 
 
 
----- 
Japan 
----- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Japan\'s Counselor Tetsuo Hiraide provided the 
mini-CTAG with a detailed nonpaper of the GOJ\'s worldwide 
CT-related assistance, which focuses on the areas of 
immigration, aviation security, customs cooperation, export 
controls, law enforcement cooperation, and anti-terrorist 
financing.  However, Japan\'s direct CT-related assistance to 
Panama was limited to the visit of two subject-matter experts 
to assist the PNP with its telecommunications network.  CT 
seminars in Japan were attended by some Latin American 
officials but not Panamanians.  Hiraide commented that most 
of the GOJ\'s CT-related assistance is focused on Southeast 
Asia.  Japan\'s assistance to Panama is mainly in 
humanitarian, sustainable development and environmental 
projects. 
 
 
------ 
France 
------ 
 
 
8. (SBU) France\'s Counselor Jean-Luc Wertheimer stated that 
France does not provide any CT-related assistance to Panama, 
but in the past has offered law enforcement training, 
specifically for Panama\'s Technical Judicial Police (PTJ, 
similar to our FBI).  He highlighted the presence of a French 
Regional Customs Attache in Bogota, Colombia, and a Regional 
CT Specialist in San Jose, Costa Rica. 
 
 
------ 
Canada 
------ 
 
 
9. (SBU) Canada\'s Consul Manuel Mulas said his government\'s 
CT-related assistance focuses on anti-money laundering 
programs, including technical assistance to Panama\'s UAF and 
a regional Central American and Caribbean seminar, to which 
UAF representatives will attend.  Mulas also highlighted the 
GOC-sponsored regional seminar hosted in 2003 in Panama on 
the use of the internet in police investigations. 
 
 
----- 
Spain 
----- 
 
 
10. (SBU) Spain\'s Counselor Salvador Maspoch said his 
government has provided training in-country and in Spain to 
Panama\'s Public Force\'s (PPF) security-focused units. 
However, Maspoch hesitated to characterize the training as 
CT-related, implying that future training might be.  While 
Spain does not provide any CT-related assistance to Panama, 
Maspoch made a point of expressing Spain\'s willingness to 
help Panama in any joint CTAG efforts.

SUBJECT: PANAMA ELECTION COUNTDOWN #1:  12 WEEKS TO GO 
 
Time is up 
---------- 
1. (U) Monday, February 2, marked the deadline for 
political parties to register candidacies for presidential, 
mayoral, legislative and local representative seats.  All 
parties complied with the deadline and despite rumors over 
the weekend that one would withdraw from the race; all four 
presidential candidates submitted their nominations.  The 
Electoral Tribunal will soon publish a final, official list 
of all 12,278 candidates that will run for 1,754 elected 
positions. 
 
 
Partido Liberal Autentico out 
----------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes 
officially announced that the hastily created Partido 
Liberal Autentico (PLA) will not be permitted to 
participate in the 2004 General Elections.  As requested by 
Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis, electoral magistrates 
will hold hearings to discuss alleged fraudulent membership 
registrations in the party. The PLA had already publicly 
endorsed PRD/PP presidential candidate Martin Torrijos. 
Torrijos was looking forward to PLA\'s official electoral 
recognition to A) form a 3-party coalition as the 
Arnulfistas have done; B) have Martin Torrijos\' name appear 
a third time in the presidential ballot; C) receive $1 
million more on campaign subsidies; D) have more candidates 
campaigning for Torrijos at the local level. 
 
 
First national debate 
--------------------- 
3. (U) Following the closing time for official nominations, 
the largest local TV chain, MEDCOM (channels 4 & 13) held 
the first presidential debate (septel).  Despite mixed 
feelings among the population about format and questions, 
the national consensus was that having such a debate was 
positive.  At least two more debates are scheduled for 
March and April on other TV stations (channels 2 and 21). 
 
 
Election results: the sooner the better 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (U) The President of the National Counting Board, Fausto 
Fernandez, announced that official results of the May 2 
elections will be known around 11:00 p.m. that same day. 
Voting centers close at 4:00 p.m. and counting starts 
immediately after.  Tally sheets will then be sent by 
electoral representatives to district counting boards. 
However, unofficial results for Panama City will be known 
by 7:00 p.m. since those counting boards are located 
nearby. 
 
 
Candidate Torrijos meets former Colombian Presidents 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
5. (U) PRD/PP presidential candidate Martin Torrijos in 
Bogota February 4 paid a courtesy call to former Colombian 
Presidents Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, Julio Turbay Ayala, and 
Ernesto Samper.  Reportedly, they discussed regional 
topics, including Panama-Colombia border issues.  Torrijos 
was accompanied by his first vice presidential candidate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro and his advisor, former Foreign 
Minister and Ambassador to Colombia Jorge Eduardo Ritter. 
The trip reflected long-standing ties between the PRD and 
Colombia\'s Liberal Party. 
 
 
Everything under control, so far 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Dennis Allen 
reported to Pol FSN that \"things are going smoothly\" in the 
electoral process so far.  According to Allen, an Electoral 
Tribunal employee by mistake deleted an electronic 
nomination submitted by Partido Popular (PP).  PP\'s 
President Ruben Arosemena publicly complained about it, but 
the Electoral Tribunal has already informed him that the 
candidacy has been accepted. 
 
 
Campaigning comes first 
----------------------- 
7. (SBU) A professional legislative staffer complained to 
Embassy about \"how boring work is these days.\"  Though the 
plenum at the Legislative Assembly is in recess, committees 
should have been meeting to discuss pending issues. 
According to this staffer, Legislative President \"Jacobo 
Salas makes constant calls for committees to meet, but he 
is not successful.  Not even those who are not campaigning 
are around.  We expect a very quite session after March 1 
as well,\" she ended. (Note:  The Legislative Assembly 
reconvenes officially on March 1, 2004). 
 
 
Can\'t get their act together 
---------------------------- 
8. (SBU) An Arnulfista source involved in the Arnulfista 
presidential campaign privately shared with Embassy that 
\"there is lack of communication and certainly little 
organization within Aleman\'s campaign.  Competing with 
public disappointment with the GOP is a difficult task and 
we need as much coordination as possible.\"  The source 
claimed that a new campaign strategy is to distance 
themselves from President Moscoso \"who knows it already.\" 
The source cited Aleman\'s promise to abolish the 
transparency law regulations (passed by Moscoso) as a 
start.  Embassy asked whether that stance would compromise 
Moscoso\'s support for the candidacy, the source said that 
\"attacks will not be personal, but against things that the 
GOP has ignored doing.\"  On party renovation, he said that 
after the elections a movement will promote current 
legislator Jose Blandon, Jr. to become the Arnulfista Party 
president in 2006, replacing Mireya Moscoso.

SUMMARY: CANDIDATES BARE TEETH 
------------------------------ 
2.  (SBU) During Panama\'s February 2 nationwide televised 
presidential debate, the four candidates soon shelved their 
inhibitions and began attacking one another.  Unemployment, 
corruption, and education figured prominently.  Front-runner 
Martin Torrijos outpaced his opponents with such 
uncharacteristically reasoned, thoughtful responses in an 
impromptu setting, that opponents alleged he was given the 
questions beforehand.  At pains to be polite, Guillermo 
Endara responded to questions with conviction, while shooting 
subtle barbs at his opponents, but lacked the spark that has 
set him apart from the others.  Of the two stragglers in the 
polls, Ricardo Martinelli trumped Jose Miguel Aleman with a 
no-holds-barred frontal assault on Panama\'s incestuous 
political system.  Aleman\'s responses were peppered with 
clumsy attempts to attack his opponents and seemed stiff and 
rehearsed. End Summary. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Each candidate used different means to try to sell 
himself to the debate viewers.  Martin repeatedly stressed 
that both Panama and the PRD \"are different now.\" Responding 
to a question about his proposal to appoint a career police 
official to head the Panamanian National Police, Torrijos 
stated that Panama no longer has a military, so where\'s the 
problem?  Martinelli insisted repeatedly that he does not 
represent the \"traditional political parties that are 
responsible for the poverty, unemployment and corruption from 
which this country suffers.\"  He stated that he would take 
\"drastic measures\" like reducing the tax on gasoline 
$0.25/gallon to stimulate economic activity.  Like 
Martinelli, Endara was willing to request that sitting 
Supreme Court Justices resign due to the perception that they 
are corrupt.  Endara curried favor with anti-PRD voters when 
he quipped that \"as the only \'guest\' in Panama\'s jails among 
the four candidates\" (during the Noriega dictatorship as a 
political prisoner), he was best qualified to know how to 
reform the judiciary. 
 
 
METHOD TO THE MADNESS 
--------------------- 
4. (SBU) The debate format was based on 20 questions from the 
general public that a four-member committee pre-selected from 
an initial pool of approximately 200.  The press conglomerate 
MEDCOM received the questions via telephone, internet, and 
personal interview with Panamanians who approached its 
affiliates.  The candidates drew lots to determine their 
order of speaking and rotated who answered first.  At the end 
of the debate, the moderators gave each candidate ninety 
seconds to offer final comments. 
 
 
COMMENT: PERFORMANCE CRITIQUE 
----------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Commentators generally concurred that Arnulfista 
Candidate Jose Miguel Aleman had made a poor showing, 
Torrijos\' had won, and the other two candidates had turned in 
a reasonable performance.  While repeating his \"proposals for 
you\" platform, which rarely responded to the question asked, 
Aleman launched personal attacks on Torrijos and Endara based 
on their past roles in government.  Martinelli\'s pugnacious 
anti-system assault catered to viewers fed up with Panama\'s 
political cronyism, but observers questioned his moral 
authority in saying such things having worked in the previous 
two administrations.  Despite being the firmest advocate of 
constitutional reform, Endara twice proposed measures that 
would violate the constitution.  After Endara said he would 
appoint a new Panama Canal Administrator, Torrijos corrected 
him by explaining that only the Panama Canal Board of 
Directors has the authority to name or remove the 
Administrator.  Endara later asserted that he would ask 
Supreme Court Justices for their resignation shortly after 
having complained about an overly powerful Executive branch. 
These missteps reinforced the public perception of Endara as 
an honest, well-intentioned figure who too frequently gets 
the facts wrong. 
 
 
BETTING ON THE PRESIDENTIAL HORSE RACE 
-------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) The morning before the debate, the El Panama 
America newspaper published a CID Gallup public opinion poll 
that ranked the four candidates as follows: Martin Torrijos - 
42%, Guillermo Endara - 34%, Jose Miguel Aleman - 8%, and 
Ricardo Martinelli - 4%.  Since June 2003, the gap between 
Torrijos and Endara has narrowed, while Aleman\'s popularity 
has doubled (though only to 8%), leaving Martinelli firmly in 
last place.  Political insiders swear that the 67-year-old 
Endara\'s campaign will run out of gas, leaving the true 
competition between Torrijos and Aleman, who represent the 
country\'s two largest parties.  Indeed, 60 of 130 Solidarity 
Party delegates walked out of the party\'s recent nominating 
convention after party managers told several Colon stalwarts 
to step down and make way for first VP candidate Guillermo 
Ford\'s picks, some say evidence of Endara\'s disintegrating 
backing outside Panama City.  Considering that 30% of 
respondents said they would never vote for Aleman, Torrijos 
may not see Aleman as a real threat at present. 
Nevertheless, many seasoned political analysts assert that 
the Arnulfista party machine will deliver sufficient votes to 
overtake Endara and even narrow the gap to within five 
percentage points between Aleman and Torrijos.  (See Septel.)

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: OREP, AMGT, ASEC, PREL, ECON, PM, ECON 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: CODEL WELLER\'S VISIT TO PANAMA 
 
This is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
1. (U) Embassy Panama welcomes Codel Weller on their February 
19-22 visit to 
Panama.  You will have the opportunity to reiterate US 
appreciation for the 
ongoing security and drug enforcement cooperation between our 
two countries. 
Your visit highlights our governments\' mutual focus on the 
strategic issues of 
counterterrorism capabilities, combating international 
criminal networks, and 
expanding trade and investment.  Congressional sentiment 
regarding upcoming 
negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with 
the US will reign 
paramount in the minds of many of your interlocutors. It is 
worth noting that 
Panama was an early member of the Coalition of the Willing, 
has signed and 
ratified a bilateral Article 98 Agreement, and supported the 
USG at the WTO 
Ministerial in Cancun, Mexico.  Panama has proven itself a 
good friend and ally. 
 
 
--------------- 
A Brief History 
--------------- 
 
 
2. (U) From its founding in 1903 until 1968, the Republic of 
Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a 
commercially oriented oligarchy focused on Panama as an 
entrepot for international trade.  In October 1968, Dr. 
Arnulfo Arias Madrid-- the deceased husband of current 
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso-- was elected to and 
deposed from the presidency for the third time.  General Omar 
Torrijos (d. 1981)-- the deceased father of current 
opposition leader and presidential candidate Martin Torrijos- 
- became dictator and was succeeded in infamy by General 
Manuel Noriega.  On December 20, 1989, former President 
George H.W. Bush ordered the US military into Panama to 
restore democracy, protect AmCits and their property, fulfill 
US treaty responsibilities to operate and defend the Canal, 
and bring Noriega to justice.  Noriega is still serving a 30- 
year sentence in Miami for drug trafficking.  Panama has 
twice more since 1989 held free and fair elections, 
transferring 
power from/to opposition parties. 
 
 
 
 
------------------ 
May 2004 Elections 
------------------ 
 
 
 
 
3. (U) Panama will hold its next national elections on May 2, 
2004.  Candidates are vying for the presidency, 78 
legislative seats, and all mayoral and local representative 
positions.  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate 
Martin Torrijos maintains a small lead over third-party 
candidate and former Panamanian President Guillermo Endara 
(1989 to 1994).  Both are well ahead of ruling Arnulfista 
party candidate and former Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Aleman (1999 to 2003) and minor Democratic Change (CD) party 
candidate Ricardo Martinelli.  Panama\'s elections should not 
warrant extensive monitoring or observation. 
 
 
 
 
-------------- 
A Mixed Record 
-------------- 
 
 
 
 
4. (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under US administration, and Canal- 
related industries, especially cargo transshipment through 
ports at both ends of the Canal, have boomed.  But Panama\'s 
overall economy went flat when nearly 30,000 US military 
personnel and their dependents left during the late 1990s, 
and the 2001 global recession has perpetuated the country\'s 
estimated 13.4% unemployment.  Also, Panama has failed to 
attract large investments into the former Canal Zone. 
Poverty, economic disparity, and unemployment are arguably 
the biggest internal challenges facing Panama today.  Since 
mid-2003, however, the economy appears to have picked up, 
primarily as a result of tax incentives given to a now booming 
construction sector, low interest rates, and a global economic 
recovery.  Panama\'s growth rate for 2003 is expected to come 
in at around 4 percent. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Towards a Democratic Culture 
---------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
5. (SBU) Ambassador Watt\'s September 29 speech to Panama\'s 
Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, launching 
Embassy\'s Good Governance Initiative (GGI), resonated firmly 
with Panamanians and generated front-page headlines. 
Venality, conflict of interest, nepotism, and lack of 
transparency are ingrained in Panama\'s political culture and 
institutions.  Panama\'s \"spoils system\" allows politicians to 
use the entire state bureaucracy as a patronage base.  The 
country\'s criminal libel laws, left over from military rule, 
impose enormous costs and risks on whistle-blowers. 
Legislative immunity is often abused, as elsewhere in the 
region.  Embassy currently supports good governance 
activities directed toward judicial reform, civic education, 
business ethics, and strengthening anti-corruption 
prosecutors\' institutional capacity. 
 
 
 
 
---------------- 
Our Third Border 
---------------- 
 
 
 
 
6. (SBU) Panamanians have become increasingly willing to 
accept mil-to-mil security training, equipment and other 
assistance to enhance their capabilities to protect the Canal 
and borders.  Although the present terrorist threat to the 
Canal is considered low, Panamanian planning, layered 
defenses and security resources are generally well regarded. 
Continued US training, equipment and other assistance are 
vital to preempt a major terrorist attack.  Panama has 
committed to an ambitious maritime security agenda, which 
should help it meet new obligations under the International 
Maritime Organization\'s (IMO) International Shipping and Port 
Security (ISPS) Code by the July 1, 2004 deadline.  Panama\'s 
ship registry blossomed from the third largest in the world 
in 1990 to the largest in the world by 2002, comprising 
nearly 6,300 large commercial vessels.  Of all foreign 
flagged vessels arriving at US ports, upto 27% are Panamanian. 
About 13% of US ocean-going cargo transits the Canal each 
year.  Panama\'s seafarer registry has licensed approximately 
300,000 crewmembers.  Port services have grown dramatically 
from about 200,000 containers per year in the early 1990s to 
almost two million by 2002, giving Panama Latin America\'s 
leading port complex. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Fighting International Crime 
---------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
7. (SBU) Law enforcement cooperation with Panama is 
excellent.  The Moscoso Administration set up a new, GOP- 
interagency counternarcotics vetted unit; expanded upon the 
basic shiprider agreement to facilitate maritime/air 
operations in pursuit of drug, arms and explosives smuggling 
(and may soon include WMD); expedited thirty-eight maritime 
drug prisoner 
transfers to USG custody (saving U.S. taxpayers US$1 million 
per event); and captured and expelled seventeen fugitives 
from US justice (most recently, on January 14, Colombian drug 
kingpin Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya, wanted in New York 
for smuggling five tons of cocaine).  Panama is working much 
more closely with Colombian President Uribe\'s government 
against narco-terrorists.  The GOP has also welcomed USG 
assistance-- DOD special operations forces (training National 
Police (PNP) border units) and AID community development 
(enhancing productive capacity and governmental presence in 
the Darien border province). 
 
 
 
 
8. (U) The GOP revamped its legal and administrative 
structures to fight money laundering, becoming a model for 
other countries, such as Russia, that are trying to bring 
their regimes up to grade.  Panama assisted the USG in the 
prosecution of money laundering cases and provided crucial 
information against former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo 
Aleman.  However, at the 2004 Summit of the Americas in 
Monterrey, Mexico, several hemispheric neighbors chided 
Panama for recently granting \"asylee\" status to a former 
Ecuadorian cabinet minister, who is charged with embezzlement 
of government funds. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
9. (SBU) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the US. 
First, for political and economic reasons, President Moscoso 
is pushing for quick action on a bilateral FTA. (Note: the US 
announced its intention to negotiate an FTA with Panama in 
November 2003 at the Miami FTAA ministerial. End Note). 
Second, 
the GOP has long argued for Panama\'s re-designation from a 
\"near 
foreign port\" to a \"distant foreign port,\" under the US 
Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA), in order to capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying 
the possibility of a re-designation.  The GOP estimates that 
up to US$50 million per year could be gained for Panama\'s 
growing tourism sector.  Third, over the last several months, 
we have seen a marked improvement in the GOP\'s willingness to 
make progress on a number of US investment cases, to address 
bilateral trade issues, including agricultural concerns, and 
to enhance cooperation/coordination in regional and 
multilateral trade fora.  The USG has asked Panama to 
continue its progress on resolving investment disputes and 
improving its investment climate through responsiveness to 
investor concerns, clear rules of the game, predictability, 
and transparency in decision-making.  During your visit, you 
will have the opportunity to meet several private sector 
representatives to solicit their views on these issues. 
 
 
10. (U) Panama\'s $12 billion economy is based primarily on a 
well developed services sector that accounts for 
approximately 78 
percent of GDP.  Services include the Panama Canal, banking 
and 
financial services, legal services, container ports, the Colon 
Free Zone (the 2nd largest in the world) and flagship 
registry. 
Panama also maintains one of the most liberalized trade 
regimes in the hemisphere.  Bilateral trade with Panama came 
to 
$1.7 billion in 2002.  U.S. exports were $1.4 billion and 
imports 
were $302 million.  The stock of U.S. Foreign Direct 
Investment 
(FDI) in 2001 was $25.3 billion.  U.S. FDI is primarily 
concentrated in the financial sector. 
 
 
 
 
------------------------- 
Biography: Mireya Moscoso 
------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
11. (U) Mireya Moscoso is President of the Republic of Panama 
and leader of the Arnulfista Party.  In the 1999 national 
elections, she defeated Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
presidential candidate Martin Torrijos by seven and a half 
percentage points (44.9 percent to 37.6 percent).  Moscoso 
took office on September 1, 1999.  Moscoso was born on July 
1, 1946, in Panama City, but was raised in the small coastal 
town of Pedasi in the southwest province of Los Santos.  At 
age 18, Moscoso met former Panamanian President Arnulfo Arias 
Madrid in 1964, who was 45 years her senior, and the two fled 
to Miami following the 1968 coup d\'etat.  They were married 
in the US in 1969 and lived in exile until 1978.  Moscoso 
served as Arias\' personal secretary and political understudy 
until his death in 1988. 
 
 
 
 
12. (U) Moscoso\'s formal post-secondary education includes 
English and computer courses and an Associate\'s degree in 
Interior Design from Miami Dade County Community College. 
She has a young teenage son Ricardo, whom she adopted during 
her four-year marriage to former Arias coffee plantation 
manager Ricardo Gruber.  She owns a large home in Panama 
City, but prefers to spend time at the coffee plantation and 
cattle ranch in the western province of Chiriqui, which she 
inherited from Arias.  Moscoso understands English well but 
prefers Spanish.

1.  (SBU) The September 11 attacks called significant 
attention to the potential for terrorist exploitation of 
Panama,s leading maritime position. Panama has the world,s 
largest flag state registry with approximately 6300 vessels 
over 500 gross metric tons and approximately 300,000 
seafarers.  Additionally, approximately two-thirds of Canal 
traffic originates or terminates at U.S. ports, roughly 13% 
of U.S. seaborne trade.  Nearly, 27 percent of 
foreign-flagged cargo ships arriving at U.S. ports are 
Panamanian.  Moreover, approximately 150 U.S. military 
vessels, including nuclear-powered U.S. submarines (\"high 
value transits\"), visit Panamanian ports and/or transit the 
Canal each year. 
 
 
2.  Given these equities, during the past year, the Embassy, 
through its Maritime Security Working Group and in 
coordination with Washington agencies, has undertaken a broad 
Maritime Security agenda with the GOP (REFTELS). We have seen 
a strong willingness on the part of the Moscoso 
Administration for Panama to meet its responsibilities as a 
major maritime player.  Progress has been particularly good 
since President Moscoso\'s appointment in June 2003 of 
Panama,s Public Security and National Defense Council (\"the 
Consejo\") Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis to coordinate 
maritime security matters.  Key components of the agenda 
include: secure seafarer documents, U.S. force protection, 
port security, container security, export controls, 
proliferation security, and strengthening GoP institutions 
(REF C). Progress by the GOP has been good on all of the 
fronts and in several cases the ball is in our court; 
however, we will have to keep the pressure on the GOP to 
follow-through, in particular, on ISPS implementation and new 
seafarer documents.  The fact that this is an election year 
in Panama will not facilitate things, but should also not 
hinder progress too much. The following paragraphs provide a 
brief update of key components of our agenda, which continues 
to evolve as the USG develops its broader maritime security 
strategy. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Component 1: Convince the GOP to create a secure system for 
seafarer documents, to include biometric markers, and 
verified credentials for Panama,s merchant marine. 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
3.  (C) Panama,s Maritime Authority (AMP) assured the 
Embassy that the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) would 
tender a public bid for creation of such a system by January 
2004.  MEF has allocated close to $3 million in order to fund 
the process; however, the public tender remains pending. The 
new documents will comply with requirements of the 
International Labor Organization,s (ILO) Convention 108 
(pertaining to International Identification Documentation), 
which issued directives for seafarer documents following a 
request from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). 
The GOP and ILO maintain, however, that full-blown biometrics 
are not required for this credential, although it will 
contain some security features.  The AMP is weighing the 
possibility of including a fingerprint on the document. 
Regardless of the Panamanian document\'s quality and improved 
controls on how such documents will be issued (Ref G), we 
remain concerned that the GoP will be challenged to conduct 
adequate background checks on seafarers.  While Consejo 
Director Jarvis has indicated that the Embassy would have 
access to the names of the applicants, we will continue to 
press the GOP to obtain unfettered access to the seafarer 
database to monitor issuance.  (Note: Corruption/graft by AMP 
officials and Panamanian Consuls in the issuance of 
seafarer,s documents has been well documented (Ref B). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Component 2: Push for the GOP to assure adequate, permanent 
facilities for National Maritime Service (SMN) bases, 
particularly at Pacific and Atlantic entrances to the Canal. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
4.  (C) On October 9, 2003 the Interoceanic Region Authority 
(ARI) signed over title to a new facility near the Atlantic 
entrance of the Canal for the SMN.  The Consejo has also 
received an oral commitment from the Pacific-side 
concessionaire that the SMN will be granted \"long term use 
rights\" to a facility located on the concessionaire,s 
property.  NAS funds have been earmarked to assist the GOP in 
reconstructing its Atlantic side pier facilities for the SMN. 
 Embassy is currently working closely with the SMN to begin 
construction on the pier and associated facilities. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Component 3: Develop a force protection arrangement to cover 
Canal transits by nuclear-powered U.S. submarines. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
5.  (C) This component focuses on force protection procedures 
for high value transits (HVTs) through the Canal.  The 
Consejo is consulting with the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) 
and security-related GOP agencies.  The GOP appears willing 
to conclude an arrangement whereby force protection 
procedures will be incorporated into ACP regulations.  A 
formal GOP reply/counter-proposal is expected by mid-March; 
we are optimistic that we can conclude some kind of agreement 
before the current government leaves office September 1, 2004. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Component 4: Support the creation of an analytical unit to 
monitor freight and container movements to enhance security. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Implementation of the U.S. Customs, Container 
Security Initiative (CSI) will facilitate the creation of 
such a unit.  A CSI port assessment team visited Panama 
mid-January 2004.  Post is awaiting the results of that 
assessment. (NOTE: Roughly 4 million containers (TEU) 
transited the Panama Canal in 2003; approximately 2 million 
containers (TEUs) were handled in Panama\'s ports; but, only 
75 thousand containers were loaded onto ships in Panamanian 
ports and ended up in the U.S. (2002 stats). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Component 5: Press the GOP to create port captaincies with 
national security/law enforcement authority or port security 
chief positions to coordinate these functions. 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
7.  (C) The GOP has designated the AMP with port captaincy 
responsibility instead of the SMN, as reflected by absence of 
authorizing text in the most recent draft of the SMN,s 
Organic Law.  However, to create a check and balance on the 
AMP, the Embassy is considering advocating that the AMP be 
required to designate a law enforcement officer from the SMN 
to be located at each port to assist the captain of the port. 
 Comment: our concern about the AMP fulfilling this role is 
twofold - first, the AMP is debilitated by graft and 
corruption; second, the AMP does not have the law enforcement 
authority or capability to serve as the port captaincy. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Component 6: Urge implementation of legislative/regulatory 
enhancements necessary for Export Controls and the 
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
8.  (C) Export Controls: The USG through the State 
Department,s Export Control and Related Border Security 
Assistance (EX-BIS) program and the Department of Commerce,s 
Transshipment Country Export Control Initiative (TECI) is 
working with Panama to develop and improve its 
export/transshipment controls. The GOP sent a team of key 
decision-makers to Washington to work with Commerce, Customs, 
and State Department officials December 8-11, 2003 to, inter 
alia, review the legal requirements for establishing an 
export control law and to improve its export/transshipment 
controls. Based on that visit the GOP has committed to 
introducing draft legislation to control the export, 
re-export, transit and transshipment of strategic items 
through the territory of Panama by April 2004. 
 
 
9.  (C) ISPS: The AMP is making considerable headway in this 
endeavor, despite resistance from the powerful and 
politically motivated Panama Maritime Lawyers Association. 
After designating Phoenix Services group (a U.S. company) as 
the primary Recognized Security Organization (RSO) for 
vessels in August 2003, AMP responded to Japanese shipping 
companies, concerns by designating two additional RSO,s on 
December 15: Singapore based Singapore Technologies and 
London-based Universe Security Group. The AMP has begun 
receiving applications for ship security plans, and has 
completed the reviews of some key shipping lines like Ned 
Lloyd.  The AMP fully recognizes that it will not/not certify 
all of the required vessels in its fleet prior to the July 1 
deadline.  AMP officials note that it expects to certify all 
ships above 1500 GMTs by the deadline, but that the laggards 
will be those ships between 500 - 1500 GMTs.  AMP officials 
note that most of the Panamanian flagged fleet (approximately 
70 percent) never travel to the U.S. 
 
 
10.  (C) The AMP has also made the preliminary announcement 
of a second layer of \"verifying RSO,s\" that will physically 
match individual security plans to specific vessels. 
Unfortunately three of the designated verifying RSO,s from 
Panama appear to be USCG Priority 1, or blacklisted, on 
safety grounds.  Nonetheless, the AMP has maintained that 
including these societies was politically necessary to 
appease local industry.  AMP argues that since evaluations 
for security are distinct from those for safety, it\'s 
premature to discard these RSO,s.  Finally, the AMP has 
assured the USG that should any of these RSOs fail in the 
security arena, the AMP would have a \"One strike and you\'re 
out\" policy. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Component 7: Urge the passage of an organic law for the SMN 
to provide a framework for its institutional development and 
for implementation of professional programs with stability 
for key personnel. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
11.  (C) The organic law, approved by the Moscoso Cabinet, 
was submitted to Panama\'s legislative Assembly for passage in 
early December 2003.  Whether ultimately passed or not, the 
organic law will at minimum take effect as a \"Ley Ejecutivo.\" 
 The law defines the SMN\'s primarily law enforcement mission 
and protects the institution and personnel (Ref L).  Some 
observers have criticized the organic law as inadequate to 
meet the SMN\'s bureacratic needs.  However, the law gives the 
SMN greater legitimacy and could help buttress the SMN\'s 
bureaucratic strength, if the SMN were able to find a 
Director with better political skills than the current one. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Component 8: Negotiate a bilateral agreement on cooperation 
in homicide, kidnapping and terrorism cases on the high seas. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
12.  (C) State\'s L/OES is currently preparing instructions 
containing a draft MOU proposed by USCG HQ. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Component 9: Push for control and verification of Panama,s 
maritime security and ISPS compliance by a national authority 
like the Consejo 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
13.  (C) The Consejo has been assigned the responsibility of 
inter-agency coordination of Panama,s maritime security to 
include working with Panama,s Maritime Authority (AMP) on 
ISPS compliance.  This marks a major step forward for Panama. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Component 10:  Negotiation of a Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI) Boarding Agreement with Panama 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
14.  (C) As laid out in ref K, the GOP is open to negotiating 
and concluding a boarding agreement to target ships suspected 
of carrying weapons of mass destruction (WMD), delivery 
systems and/or related materials.  However, the GOP has 
indicated its preference that the supplemental maritime 
agreement signed on February 5, 2002, between the USG\'s Coast 
Guard,  the GOP\'s National Maritime Service (SMN) and 
National Air Service (SAN), be amended to fulfill the purpose 
of a PSI agreement.  Post is optimistic that with the 
guidance provided in Ref M (dated 4 Feb 04) we will be able 
to move forward with amendment of the supplemental maritime 
agreement to fulfill USG PSI objectives.

The Race Is On 
-------------- 
2. (U) Candidates for all 1,754 national and local positions 
to be contested in Panama\'s May 2 elections have shifted 
their efforts into high gear.  As political advertising 
increases in every medium from rolling loudspeakers to 
internet popup windows, candidates and their representatives 
are hitting the talkshow circuits and pounding the pavement 
to win votes.  All may proceed full throttle now that the 
February 7 deadline for objecting to candidacies has passed. 
Within the next two weeks, the Electoral Tribunal will 
publish a comprehensive list of candidates in the 
government\'s Official Gazette and on their website, 
http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa.  The Electoral 
Tribunal\'s Spanish-language website also contains useful 
demographic statistics about Panama\'s voters, a comprehensive 
list of electoral regulations, and historical data from 
previous elections. 
 
 
Have some \"GUIMI\" with your \"MAMI\" 
---------------------------------- 
3. (U) Noting that several of Former President Guillermo 
Endara\'s Solidarity Party candidates served in the Moscoso 
administration, Martin Torrijos made a tongue-in-cheek 
assertion on February 9 that Moscoso has entered a silent 
pact with Endara, using the first syllables of the two\'s 
first names to form Guimi (GUI-llermo and MI-reya).  This 
conflating of syllables was intended to counter previous 
allegations by both Endara and Martinelli that Moscoso and 
Torrijos had entered into a \"Pacto Mami\" (MA-rtin and 
MI-reya) through which they agreed not to air dirty laundry 
about each other.  Torrijos noted that Endara has a comical 
way of saying things and complained that he deflects public 
attention by alleging conspiracies between presidential 
candidates and President Moscoso instead of focusing on what 
he will do if elected. 
 
 
He may be corrupt . . . 
----------------------- 
4. (SBU) Controversy about President Moscoso has swirled 
around her putative legal right to campaign on behalf of 
specific candidates, addressed in Article 130 of Panama\'s 
constitution, which prohibits \"direct or indirect official 
support to candidates for popularly elected positions.\"  The 
most recent dust-up arose when legislative candidate Carlos 
\"Tito\" Afu showed up at the Ministry of Public Works\' 
official inauguration of several new road projects in his 
electoral circuit. Afu, previously elected as an opposition 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) legislator, gained 
notoriety when he waved a wad of bills in the air on 
television in January 2001, claiming that it was a payment to 
vote in favor of the controversial CEMIS project. (See Reftel 
A).  The Supreme Court dismissed the case because ostensibly 
the Legislative Assembly had not lifted the immunity of the 
Legislators implicated in the scandal.  Afu is now a 
candidate for the Arnulfista Party in the same electoral 
Circuit (7-1, Las Tablas), and President Moscoso was 
pilloried in the press this week for campaigning on his 
behalf. 
 
 
. . . But he\'s my candidate 
--------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Responding to front-page newspaper images of Moscoso 
dancing with Afu during the official event, the Electoral 
Magistrates requested that the Electoral Prosecutor 
investigate Moscoso.  Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis 
responded that only the Legislative Assembly may investigate 
the President, but implied that he might investigate Minister 
of Public Works Eduardo Quiros, also present at the event. 
Legislative Assembly President, Arnulfista Jacobo Salas, 
stated on February 12 that the Assembly had no intention of 
investigating the President.  Moscoso lashed out at La 
Prensa, which published the initial report, claiming that 
journalists are using the power of the pen to support 
opposition PRD candidate Martin Torrijos. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Opposition candidates were outspoken in their 
distaste for Moscoso\'s actions.  Cambio Democratico Candidate 
Ricardo Martinelli stated that Moscoso should be doing the 
job for which Panamanians elected her -- running the 
government -- not campaigning for her friends.  PRD Vice 
Presidential candidate Ruben Arosemena said that it is 
obvious Moscoso is campaigning on behalf of her favorite 
candidates, but did not call for an investigation. 
Solidaridad Presidential Candidate Endara was the most 
colorful critic, asserting that he would never have supported 
Moscoso\'s presidential candidacy if he knew she were such \"an 
ignoramus\" when it came to electoral regulations.  Arnulfista 
candidate Aleman denied Moscoso had done anything wrong. 
(NOTE: According to Aleman supporters, Moscoso\'s arrogance is 
hurting his campaign, but he has not been able to break free 
of her. END NOTE) 
 
 
97,000 Support Constituent Assembly 
---------------------------------- 
7. (U) On February 11, Panama\'s Ecumenical Council submitted 
to President Moscoso a petition in favor of convoking a 
constituent assembly with 97,000 signatures.  Moscoso 
responded on February 12 that she had taken the signatories\' 
interest into account, but does not consider it prudent to 
convoke a constituent assembly in the middle of an electoral 
campaign.  Therefore, she continued, it will be necessary for 
the next administration to address constitutional reform. 
Given her declarations, prospects for a fifth ballot being 
included in the May 2 elections have slipped even further 
away (Reftel B).  (NOTE: Of 1,204 Panamanians who responded 
to a December 2003 CID Gallup public opinion poll, 75% didn\'t 
even know what a Constituent Assembly was. END NOTE) 
 
 
Comment: Pushing the envelope within limits 
------------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Since her decision to openly support then 
pre-candidate Jose Miguel Aleman before the party\'s 
nominating convention, much to the dismay of the other two 
pre-candidates, Moscoso has pushed the ethical envelope in 
campaigning, claiming that she is exercising her rights as 
President of the Arnulfista Party rather than abusing her 
authority as President of Panama.  Clearly, Moscoso\'s 
position changed since she requested in March 1999 that then 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares \"honor his word not to 
favor any candidate,\" (words that were reprinted in this 
week\'s newspapers).  Most observers agree that Moscoso has 
crossed an ethical line by making partisan statements and 
attending campaign events that favor Aleman, but disagree 
whether she has violated the constitution, the law, or the 
electoral code.  The fact that Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo 
Solis, a Perez Balladares appointee, didn\'t seize the 
opportunity to investigate Moscoso shows his penchant to act 
independently despite old PRD affiliations.  All are healthy 
indications that Panama\'s election controversies will be 
contained within the appropriate institutional channels. 
While the campaign rhetoric is bound to heat up in coming 
weeks, prospects for violent disputes over Panama\'s elections 
remain low.

BARRING MISHAP, MARTIN TORRIJOS WILL WIN 
 
 
REF: A. PANAMA 0040 
     B. 03 PANAMA 3294 
 
 
Classified By: DCM CHRISTOPHER MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) Former Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) political 
operative turned independent consultant and analyst, Jose 
Isabel Blandon, told DCM and POL Counselor that the PRD\'s 
superior numbers and organization and a divided opposition 
probably will secure the presidency for Martin Torrijos on 
May 2.  Blandon predicted that many supporters of former 
president Guillermo Endara will fail to vote because they are 
disaffected from politics and because Endara\'s party, 
Solidaridad, lacks the electoral machine to get them to the 
polls.  Also, candidate Jose Miguel Aleman, with support from 
the Arnulfistas and MOLIRENA, will get far more votes than 
his current 8% in opinion polls suggest.  Besides an 
(improbable) misstep, Blandon said several things could 
derail Torrijos: further complications and bad publicity from 
the apparently corrupt activities of his cousin (and 
sidelined campaign chief) Hugo Torrijos, and internal party 
infighting.  According to Blandon, anti-corruption, Endara\'s 
strongest issue, resonates more with the press than with 
voters.  Blandon made no bones about his dislike for Endara, 
calling him \"a danger to the country.\"  End Summary. 
 
 
Wary of Opinion Polls 
--------------------- 
2.  (SBU) Blandon, who served Panama dictator Manuel Noriega 
as publicist and New York Consul General (See Bio Note, para 
9), now turned political consultant, recently discussed his 
view of the 2004 electoral campaign with DCM and POL 
Counselor.  Blandon presented a concise analysis of Panama\'s 
electoral dynamics to support his view that PRD presidential 
candidate Martin Torrijos will win the May 2 vote.  According 
to Blandon, Panama opinion polls have been notoriously 
inaccurate in past elections.  (The latest poll shows Martin 
Torrijos leading ex-president Guillermo Endara 42%-34% with 
Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman in third place with 
8%.)  One fault is that polls focus too heavily on urban 
areas but do not concentrate on likely rural voters, Blandon 
pointed out. 
 
 
Party Loyalties Will Count 
-------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Blandon predicted that 1.4 million (70%) of 
Panama\'s roughly 2 million voters will actually cast ballots 
on May 2.  Of those 1.4 million voters, around 1 million are 
registered party members.  (See Reftel.  Figures below were 
updated as of 12/31/2004.)  Party affiliation is strong in 
Panama, Blandon said, and party members tend to vote for the 
entire party slate.  That tendency is stronger in the 
countryside, where around 80% of the electorate will cast 
ballots.  Among the parties, PRD has the biggest membership 
base (435,000), the most effective electoral machine, and the 
most disciplined voters.  Endara\'s Solidarity party has 
relatively few members (73,000), most of whom joined in the 
past several months, the weakest electoral machine, and least 
committed supporters.  The Arnulfista-MOLIRENA-PLN coalition, 
Blandon continued, with over 300,000 members and over 2300 
candidates for national and local office, will doubtless 
produce much more than 8% of the vote for Jose Miguel Aleman. 
 Those facts will count heavily in the countryside, when 
election day comes.  (Note: PLN is the National Liberal 
Party.) 
 
 
\"The Anti-System Vote Will Not Vote\" 
------------------------------------ 
4.  (SBU) Blandon said the 1994 and 1999 elections have shown 
a fairly constant baseline for the three biggest parties. 
The PRD can count on 32% of the vote; the Arnulfistas 21%; 
MOLIRENA 10%.  Endara appeals above all to disaffected voters 
who take a cynical view of politics, Blandon continued.  \"The 
anti-system (Endara) vote will not vote,\" he said, certainly 
not in as large numbers as party members; in short, a large 
percentage of Endara supporters are not likely voters.  Also 
Endara\'s support mostly is urban, where voter turnout is 
relatively low.  Blandon predicted the following election day 
results: 
 
 
Torrijos   37% 
Aleman     32% 
Endara     21% 
Martinelli  4% 
unaccounted 6% 
Anti-corruption a Declining Issue 
--------------------------------- 
5.  (SBU) Another historical reality confronting the Endara 
campaign is that third-party candidates fall short in Panama. 
 For instance, Alberto Vallarino, a highly placed Arnulfista 
who left the party to run for president in Panama\'s May 1999 
election under another banner finished with only 17% of the 
vote.  On the other hand, if Endara wins more than 25% of the 
vote, that could come at the expense of Aleman, Blandon said. 
 The PRD has never captured more than 37% of the vote, he 
pointed out, and PRD ally Partido Popular is limited in what 
it can deliver for Torrijos.  Anti-corruption, Endara\'s 
principal attraction for voters due to his clean record, in 
the end will have less effect on cynical voters than the 
press reports, Blandon predicted.  Endara could get elected, 
Blandon conceded, if either Torrijos or Aleman make a major 
mistake. 
 
 
Torrijos Also Has Problems 
-------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Predicting a tough campaign, Blandon hastened to 
add that victory for Torrijos is hardly assured.  Trying to 
counteract the PRD\'s \"lack of legitimacy with the private 
sector,\" Torrijos chose successful businessman Samuel Lewis 
Navarro as his first vice presidential running mate.  Blandon 
pointed to several potential problems that could cost 
Torrijos the presidency.  The first is the PRD\'s alliance 
with the Partido Popular (PP), the former Christian 
Democratic Party, which may not survive the election. 
Whether the alliance will help or hurt Torrijos is unclear. 
(Comment: Many observers point out that the PRD-PP alliance 
is inherently awkward because the Christian Democrats were 
fierce opponents of Manuel Noriega, whom the PRD supported.) 
Recently PP legislator Teresita de Arias publicized the abuse 
of tax \"exonerations\" by legislators who import luxury cars 
duty free, an action that angered many PRDistas who were the 
worst culprits. 
 
 
Cousin Hugo Could Prove Toxic 
----------------------------- 
7.  (C) But Torrijos faces still more potent internal 
dangers.  The first is his close relationship with first 
cousin Hugo Torrijos, a major source of finance for his 
campaign, who apparently is implicated in a corruption 
scandal dating from his late-1990\'s stewardship of Ports 
Engineering Consulting Corporation (PECC).  Martin has 
recently asked Hugo to step down as his campaign manager, 
Blandon noted, but can\'t really disentangle himself 
meaningfully from his involvement with Hugo.  Another problem 
for Torrijos are the 7 or 8 anti-Torrijos legislative 
candidates running in large constituencies (circuitos), such 
as Arraijan, Chorrera, David, and San Miguelito, where 
intense in-fighting could cost Torrijos votes. 
 
 
Endara Not Up To Challenge 
-------------------------- 
8.  (C) Blandon emphasized that Panama has serious challenges 
ahead of it in the coming years.  It must create a modern 
state structure, plan and finance Canal expansion, solve 
security issues on the Colombia border, and negotiate a Free 
Trade Agreement and \"normalize\" its relationship with the 
United States.  Endara is not up to the challenge, Blandon 
implied.  Calling him a \"rudderless ship,\" Blandon claimed 
former president Endara is \"a danger for the country,\" adding 
that Endara has no comprehension of how the 9/11/2001 
terrorist attacks have changed the world.  (Note: On this 
score, Blandon gave credit to President Moscoso for 
establishing a close relationship with President Bush that is 
highly valuable for Panama.  End Note.) 
 
 
Bio Note and Comment 
-------------------- 
9.  (C) Bright, wily (a generous term for some observers), 
well connected and highly paid for years under Noriega, 
Blandon served as Noriega\'s Minister of Culture and in 
several diplomatic posts.  An agronomist by training and an 
erstwhile leftist, Blandon leveraged his influence on his 
relationships with the Panama Defense Forces (PDF) and its 
leadership, making him one of the most powerful individuals 
in the government.  In the late 1980s Blandon authored \"Plan 
Blandon,\" an abortive attempt to ease Noriega from power and 
avoid bloodshed.  Since Operation Just cause and Noriega\'s 
fall from power in 1989, Blandon has reinvented himself, 
pursuing a career as a political analyst, commentator, and 
consultant for hire.  (Blandon\'s clients include PRD First 
Vice Presidential Candidate Samuel Lewis Navarro, which 
accounts in part for his acerbic assessment of Endara, 
although the bad blood between them dates back to the late 
1980s when Endara and Blandon were on different sides of the 
military/civilian divide.)  He hosts a daily talk show on 
political affairs called Radio Noticias Bahia.

-------- 
 SUMMARY 
 -------- 
1. (SBU)  The January 18-21 G/TIP visit to Panama helped 
refine Embassy and GOP anti-TIP efforts approach to 
strategies (Ref A).  The Embassy will push the GOP to focus 
its anti-TIP improvements on public awareness campaigns, 
victims assistance, and increased training.  In the short 
term, legislation to update and strengthen anti-TIP and 
anti-child pornography statutes and to eliminate sex-worker 
(\"alternadora\") visas for Colombians theoretically could be 
passed in the March legislative session.  However, the 
upcoming May 2 elections could slow Embassy and GOP efforts. 
The recent bust of a child prostitution ring (Ref B) and 
attendant publicity provides an opportunity to move Panama 
\"ahead of the curve\" combating both TIP and the broader issue 
of child sexual exploitation.  End Summary. 
 
 
------------------------ 
INFORMATIVE G/TIP VISIT 
------------------------ 
 
 
2. (SBU)  Embassy used the January 18-21 investigative trip 
of G/TIP officer Phillip Linderman to develop an abundance of 
information for G/TIP, Embassy, GOP officials, and others. 
Linderman shared the Washington perspective on TIP with a 
diverse audience.  Panama likely surpasses G/TIP\'s informal 
100 victims threshold; on the other hand, meetings with 
various GOP officials demonstrated that the GOP is willing to 
address the issue.  GOP efforts are hampered by a lack of 
resources.  Several NGOs are combating TIP, especially 
commercial sexual exploitation of minors, within the broader 
context of stopping forced child labor. 
 
 
------------------- 
AHEAD OF THE CURVE 
------------------- 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Embassy TIP working group (POL, NAS, INS, Customs, 
CONS), chaired by DCM, meet on January 29 to discuss findings 
and to map updated Embassy anti-TIP strategies (Ref A).  The 
working group\'s agreed that GOP efforts to combat TIP can be 
improved by: A) improving training, B) strengthening victim 
assistance C) starting a public education campaign, and D) 
proposing legislative changes.  Training, victims assistance, 
and educational campaigns, and legislation are viable 
near-term goals. 
 
 
---------------------- 
WE WANT TO LEARN MORE 
---------------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  A common refrain heard from the GOP and NGOs is 
the desire for more training.  Currently, two USG-sponsored 
training sessions are planned.  The \"Paul and Lisa\" training, 
partially subsidized by G/TIP (REF C), will bring together a 
diverse group of GOP officials, NGOs, and the press.  The 
training will be held in late March 2004 and will focus on 
identifying and preventing of TIP.  The Department of Justice 
(DOJ) is planning anti-TIP training in Panama for early 
summer 2004.  The training would focus on the legal issues 
related to combating TIP.  In addition, DHS/ICE are active in 
training focused on sexual exploitation of minors via the 
Internet and identifying potential TIP victims in transit to 
and/or through Panama. 
 
 
--------------- 
A PLACE TO TURN 
--------------- 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  TIP victims and/or those who know them need a 
place to report this crime.  A victims\' hot line is just such 
a place.  The Embassy TIP working group believes that the hot 
line should operated by a NGO or independent GOP agency (i.e. 
the Ombudsman).  A hot line separate from the GOP is less 
likely to be manipulated for policy or political reasons. 
Funding for such a hot line would be a joint venture between 
the GOP and the Embassy, using NAS funds. 
 
 
----------------------- 
MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE 
----------------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  A public education/awareness campaign on TIP makes 
a good link with a victims hot line.  PTJ detectives already 
conduct informal sessions at schools and universities. 
Embassy support for a GOP TIP public relations campaign will 
expand to a broader public relations campaign.  Print and 
visual media will be used.  State, INS, and Customs brochures 
and other informational resources will be included in this 
campaign.  Embassy also plans to work with high-level GOP 
officials on public announcements and speeches that will help 
Panamanians further understand the importance of stopping 
TIP. 
 
 
---------------- 
TOUGHENING LAWS 
---------------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  Legislative and statutory changes are proposed for 
anti-TIP, anti-child pornography and immigration laws. 
Panama\'s current anti-TIP statues can hamper investigations 
because of the need for a formal complaint.  Current 
proposals would eliminate that provision, and strengthen 
other parts of the law.  To reinforce the anti-child 
pornography law, a broad cross-section of the GOP and civil 
society proposed a new law to update the definitions of child 
pornography and prostitution.  Increased jail sentences and 
acknowledgment of the pervasive effects of the Internet in 
child pornography and prostitution are contained in this 
proposal.  Finally, as part of a sweeping change in 
immigration policy, the director of Immigration is proposing 
to eliminate the sex worker (\"alternadora\") visa program. 
(NOTE:  The \"alternadora\" visa is granted to approximately 
400-500 Colombian women annually to work in the sex trade in 
Panama.  End note.).  A limiting factor is the current 
election season, but the upcoming March legislative session 
could provide an opportunity to turn at least some of these 
proposals into law. 
 
 
----------------- 
BROADER CHALLENGE 
----------------- 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  Sexual exploitation of minors is not limited to 
TIP-related circumstances.  Poverty, drug abuse, alcoholism, 
and a \"keep quiet\" culture all contribute to child sexual 
exploitation and abuse.  Embassy believes a broader 
perspective is needed to address this issue.  Legitimate 
questions are raised about why the USG focuses so much time 
and effort in Panama on TIP when it likely affects relatively 
few (50-100) children.  Panama faces a much larger problem of 
sexual abuse within families and communities that has no 
commercial context and the effects on young minds and bodies 
is no less devastating.  The importance of combating TIP 
cannot be understated but applying our full efforts to 
problems that take deeper root and are more widespread in 
Panama might prove to be a more effective use of USG funds 
and time. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
9. (SBU)  Panama is fighting TIP and already has a good 
anti-TIP base.  GOP and Embassy near-term goals of enhanced 
training, victims assistance, and educational campaigns will 
help place Panama ahead of the anti-TIP curve.  Strengthening 
anti-TIP and anti-child pornography statutes, as well as 
eliminating sex worker (\"alternadora\") visas are ambitious 
but realistic goals as legislators broadly support these 
ideas.  Embassy believes that a broader perspective and 
action plan to combat child sexual exploitation is needed. 
As the recent dismantling of a child prostitution ring shows 
(Ref B), the GOP can and will take action against TIP.  With 
USG support, the GOP and Panamanian NGOs can take further 
action to ensure Panama limits the spread of TIP reduces its 
scope.

We\'re Getting there 
------------------- 
1.  (U) Electoral Magistrates proudly announced that the 
electoral process is moving forward and is 70 percent 
complete.  Among other things, The Electoral Tribunal must 
still select and train personnel to staff voting places and 
set aside space and staff for vote counting committees at 
the local and regional levels.  PolOffs confirmed during a 
trip to Chiriqui Province (septel) that Electoral Tribunal 
headquarters are in constant communication with regional 
directors regarding campaign developments, training, and 
the distribution of information.  Most of the regional 
electoral regional authorities have prior electoral 
experiences that will facilitate a smooth process and ease 
concerns about disorganization or fraud. 
 
 
Press Ethics Pact 
----------------- 
2.  (SBU) Amid allegations of media favoritism toward 
certain presidential candidates, key members of all of 
Panama\'s print, radio and TV media signed a February 16 
electoral ethics pact, promising to base their campaign 
coverage on peaceful and democratic values.  The Electoral 
Tribunal Magistrates, the Electoral Prosecutor, members of 
National Ecumenical Council and the coordinator of the 
Ethics Pact signed by the four presidential candidates last 
January were all on hand to witness the event.  No 
candidates or political representatives attended.  The pact 
comes in the wake of allegations of favoritism towards 
opposition leader Martin Torrijos by La Prensa and MEDCOM 
TV Channels 2 and 4 and censorship of presidential 
candidate Guillermo Endara\'s political advertisements. (see 
paras 5-6)  The pact aims to calm the waters between the 
press, the presidential candidates and their campaign 
managers. 
 
 
The Fifth Ballot is Dead 
------------------------ 
3.  (SBU) Early this week, Panama\'s Electoral Magistrates 
publicly urged against issuing a fifth ballot on 
constitutional reforms for the May 2 elections, claiming 
that there is not enough time to prepare.  The bill to 
authorize a fifth ballot is languishing in the Legislative 
Assembly, which reconvenes on March 1.  President Moscoso 
already has announced that she does not agree with 
including a referendum on constitutional reform in the May 
elections, further reducing the likelihood that she would 
sign or implement such a bill.  (Reftel C) 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Presidential candidates who support calling a 
constituent assembly spoke up while the others kept their 
mouth shut.  Endara and Martinelli attacked the Electoral 
Tribunal\'s position while frontrunner Martin Torrijos kept 
quiet since he and his party do not want a fifth ballot. 
Trapped between Moscoso\'s position and civil society\'s 
fervent calls for constitutional reforms, Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman temporized, offering no 
comment.  Having called for constitutional reforms in the 
early 90\'s and criticized Endara during the presidential 
debate for not rewriting the constitution when he had a 
chance, Aleman\'s weak response appeared inconsistent. 
 
 
Battling for an icon 
-------------------- 
5.  (U) Debate continues over the use of late President and 
Arnulfista Party namesake Arnulfo Arias\' image.  Electoral 
Magistrate Erasmo Pinilla had ruled in January that former 
President Endara could not use Arias\' image in his campaign 
advertisements because current President Mireya Moscoso, 
Arias\' widow, is the legal sole heir of Arias.  Endara 
complained that because as an ex-President and historical 
figure Arias\' image doesn\'t belong to anyone.  He railed 
against the Electoral Magistrates, stating to the press 
that they are \"not very virile\" for buckling to President 
Moscoso\'s will.  Shortly after Endara\'s TV advertisement 
was removed from the air, Aleman released one centered on 
Arnulfo Arias. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) On February 18, contradicting Pinilla, Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis said publicly that Moscoso had not 
inherited Arias\' image with his estate.  Solis continued 
that rights of image and honor cease when an individual 
dies.  He also noted that Moscoso had abandoned any 
residual rights she might have had when she remarried after 
Arias\' death. Endara, fed up with the situation, has 
already announced that he is not going to use Arias\' image 
anymore \"because it was only the first part of my public 
strategy.\"  Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman made 
angry public statements that the Endara group is planning 
an electoral fraud. (NOTE:  Prosecutor Solis is the son of 
Endara\'s campaign manager, Jose Menalco Solis. END NOTE) 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Aleman\'s statements represent the first GOP 
allegations about fraud in the May 2 elections.  Used to 
fraud allegations against themselves, GOP officials have 
insisted that they will respect election results.  Aleman\'s 
strong remarks could be part of a new Arnulfistas strategy 
to discredit Endara.  PolOffs learned from interlocutors 
that the Arnulfistas intend to launch frontal attacks on 
Endara instead of Torrijos so that the Arnulfistas end up 
\"at least in second place.\"

REF: PANAMA 229 
 
 
 ------- 
  SUMMARY 
  ------- 
1.  (U)  After two trials, two guilty verdicts, years of 
appeals, and not one day behind bars, the former head of a 
child prostitution ring, Thonya Xiomara Hubbard (aka Madam 
Thonya), will be spending the next 76 months in prison.  On 
February 16, the Supreme Appeal Court rejected Hubbard\'s 
appeal and ordered her immediate arrest based on sentences 
handed down by the 5th and 14th criminal courts for 
procurement of sexual services for others, corruption of 
minors, and procurement of sexual services with minors. 
Hubbard\'s child prostitution ring was originally uncovered, 
in 2000, by a Spanish television channel.  This decision 
comes less than a month after an unrelated child prostitution 
ring was broken up (Ref A) and in the wake of highly 
publicized GOP proposals to create a \"cyber police force\" to 
investigate child pornography on the Internet  End Summary. 
 
 
------------ 
AT LONG LAST 
------------ 
2.  (U)  The case of Thonya Xiomara Hubbard (aka Madam 
Thonya) has been on-going since 2000.  In that year, Antena 
Tres, a Spanish television station, conducted an undercover 
report in which Hubbard offered the sexual services of minors 
in exchange for cash to reporters posing as foreign 
businessman.  The first investigation resulted in Hubbard 
being sentenced to 40 months in prison for \"pimping\". 
However, she was freed on bail pending appeal.  In 2002, a 
second formal complaint was filed by the mother of a minor 
who Hubbard had hired out for sexual services.  In the second 
trial, Hubbard was found guilty and sentenced to 36 months in 
jail for corruption of a minor and procurement of sexual 
services to the detriment of a minor.  A Hubbard associate, 
Thanya Yamila de La Lastra Bedoya is already serving a 40 
month sentence and a former client, Venezuelan businessman 
Larry Pinto, was sentenced and served a 27 month jail term. 
Hubbard maintains her innocence and claims the Spanish 
reporters were on a witch-hunt against her and that all 
charges are unjustified. 
 
 
------------------ 
MAKING BIG STRIDES 
------------------ 
3.  (U)  The Supreme Appeal Court\'s decision comes less than 
a month after a high-profile bust of another child 
prostitution ring (Ref A).  In addition, in the same week as 
the Hubbard decision, the GOP announced it is considering 
proposals to establish a \"cyber police force\" to monitor and 
investigate internet crimes in Panama.  The GOP is especially 
concerned about internet \"scams\", identity theft, and child 
pornography.  (NOTE: The E-Panama Commission is a 
collaboration between the GOP and the Canadian Commerce 
Corporation.  End Note.) 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
4.  (SBU)  If the decision to send Hubbard to prison holds, 
Panama will achieved another victory in its efforts to combat 
TIP.  The Hubbard case is especially significant given the 
high level of national and international attention.  Members 
of Judicial Police (PTJ) sex crimes unit informed PolOff, 
NAS, and others that Hubbard claimed she had names of 
prominent Panamanian who were her clients and would expose 
them if she was sent to prison.  It appears, for now, that 
those were empty or unsubstantiated threats.  While Embassy 
has been pressing GOP for continued action combating TIP, the 
recent positive developments should be fully credited to GOP 
initiative.

SUMMARY: JOBS AND AGRICULTURE TOP THE AGENDA 
-------------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Residents of Chiriqui, Panama\'s largest dairy, 
coffee, and vegetable producer, and its capital David, 
Panama\'s third-largest city, want politicians to focus on 
unemployment and an agricultural sector threatened by a 
bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. 
Pol Counselor and Poloff visited from February 9-11 and met 
with Electoral Tribunal Officials, political party 
representatives, candidates, and interested observers, 
including Catholic Church activists and ACS Wardens. 
Interlocutors plugged favorite candidates and expressed 
confidence in Panama\'s electoral system, downplaying the 
possibility of electoral fraud.  As in Panama City, 
unemployment topped voters\' lists of urgent needs.  Unlike in 
the capital, Chiriqui\'s leaders view Canal expansion as a 
vital national project, although one that will give them 
little direct benefit.  Not unanimously against the 
construction of a road connecting the highland towns of Cerro 
Punta and Boquete, Chiriqui residents were convinced that 
President Moscoso\'s insistence on building the road despite 
strident ecological objections damages Arnulfista Candidate 
Jose Miguel Aleman\'s campaign. 
 
 
CHIRIQUI BASICS 
--------------- 
2. (U) Chiriqui is Panama\'s westernmost province on the 
Pacific coast.  It extends from Panama\'s western border with 
Costa Rica to the semi-desert lowlands of Veraguas on the 
east, bordered on the north by Bocas del Toro province and 
the Ngobe-Bugle indigenous community.  Poloffs visited Puerto 
Armuelles near the Costa Rican border, the home of a massive 
banana plantation formerly owned by Chiquita, to the eastern 
town of Tole in the foothills of Panama\'s central mountain 
range populated primarily by subsistence farmers.  At the 
center of the province in the shadow of Volcan Baru (11,400 
feet), Poloffs visited the coffee-growing town of Boquete, a 
popular ecotourism destination loaded with retired 
foreigners, many of whom have established profitable 
businesses.  Of Panama\'s nearly two million registered 
voters, 259,783 or almost 15% reside in Chiriqui, 90,492 of 
them in David and the nearby towns.  On May 2, 2004, 38,082 
Chiriqui residents will vote for the first time, the most new 
voters in any province except for Panama (140,493 of 970,703 
total).  While Chiriqui\'s population is clustered in urban 
areas, rural concerns, especially in the agricultural sector 
influence political decision-makers. 
 
 
ELECTION PREPARATIONS 
--------------------- 
3. (SBU) Electoral Tribunal (ET) officials explained to 
Poloffs their efficient management of their regional office 
in David and described the entire electoral process after the 
official presentation of candidacies on February 2.  Although 
currently focused on selecting voting place representatives 
from each of the political parties, they are also preparing 
the logistics to transport voting materials and ET personnel 
on election day.  he regional director for electoral 
organization, engrossed in managing the entire process, 
enlisted her colleague, the regional director of public 
registry (births & deaths) to pool GOP vehicles and drivers 
and make sure that they are in good shape for before election 
weekend.  The third regional director, in charge of issuing 
identity cards (cedulas), described her success in outreach 
to remote areas to register voters and replace IDs that are 
no longer valid. 
 
 
4. (U) Each of the seven political parties has a \"Campaign 
Headquarters\" in David, but the bulk of electoral activities 
occurred outside those buildings.  With the notable exception 
of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD), with five 
full-time staff, no more than two permanent employees were 
working in any of the offices that Poloffs visited.  On the 
streets, Poloffs saw campaign representatives hanging 
advertisements and heard jingles on the radio and from 
loudspeakers mounted on passing cars.  When local candidates 
were not busy meeting interest groups or shaking hands and 
kissing babies from one end of the province to the next, they 
were explaining to poloffs why they would win on May 2. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Poloffs also met the regional directors of the 
Catholic Church\'s Peace and Justice Commission, who said they 
are not concerned about fraud, and are focused instead on 
recruiting election observers and collecting funds to train, 
transport, and feed them.  The Commission will send 
representatives to polling stations to observe Panama\'s 
elections for the third time this year, having observed the 
1994 and 1999 elections.  They are known for the 
dependability of their \"quick count,\" intended to ensure that 
provincial and national vote totals don\'t deviate from local 
results.  Using copies of the final voting tally from each 
voting station, Commission representatives will transmit 
results to their Panama headquarters for rapid press 
dissemination. 
 
 
THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT 
---------------------- 
6. (SBU) Despite national polling data and assertions to the 
contrary from the Endara/Solidarity Party camp, political 
insiders insist that the real race is between Revolutionary 
Democratic Party (PRD) Candidate Martin Torrijos and 
Arnulfista Party (PA) Candidate Jose Miguel Aleman.  They 
believe that party infrastructures will prevail in getting 
out the vote in every corner of Panama for Torrijos and 
Aleman, but the Endara camp will suffer from a lack of 
organization.  Endara\'s supporters, several claimed, are so 
disenchanted with the political system that they will not 
vote at all.  Endara and Aleman supporters emphasized an 
internal weakness of the PRD\'s alliance with the former 
Christian Democratic Party, the Partido Popular (PP).  One 
Aleman supporter, Liberal Republican Nationalist Movement 
(MOLIRENA) provincial Secretary Ivan Jurado, said the 
alliance was \"like mixing oil and water.\"  After all, he 
noted, how can a party that fought against a dictatorship 
team up with the party that supported it? 
 
 
7. (SBU) Even Aleman supporters agree that President Moscoso 
is detracting from his campaign, especially with her stubborn 
support for the \"Ecological Road\" between Boquete and Cerro 
Punta a controversial 12 km mountain road would pass through 
a national park.  In late 2004, Moscoso stated to the Press, 
\"the Ecological Road will be built, and I don\'t care if it 
hurts Jose Miguel Aleman\'s campaign.\"  Neither Chiriqui 
Arnulfista Party President Einar Fanovich, nor any of Poloffs 
other interlocutors in Chiriqui could explain why Moscoso is 
so intent on the road being built.  Amcit warden Price 
Peterson, a Boquete resident for over thirty years, claimed 
that neither Moscoso nor any of her close associates owns 
land along the proposed route, contradicting reports that La 
Prensa published.  Peterson noted several serious engineering 
obstacles that would have to be overcome for the alternative 
route to be viable. (Note: Local ecologists have claimed that 
the road will damage unique forest and wildlife habitad 
irreparably, in an area they say has the fourth highest 
annual rainfall in the world. END NOTE) 
 
 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND AGRICULTURE: HAND IN HOOF 
------------------------------------------ 
8. (SBU) According to several interlocutors, despite 
large-scale coffee and dairy agroindustry in the Chiriqui 
highlands and a substantial banana plantation in the 
lowlands, many rural residents of the province are small 
farmers who could not compete in an open market.  Ivan Smith, 
a former MOLIRENA activist whose allegiance to Endara VP 
Candidate Guillermo \"Billy\" Ford motivated him to join the 
Endara camp, is a third-generation employee of the Puerto 
Armuelles banana industry who moved to David over ten years 
ago.  He explained that after Chiquita left Puerto Armuelles, 
taking lucrative salaries and fringe benefits with it, many 
unemployed plantation workers departed in search of other 
opportunities in urban areas or settled on uninhabited lands 
as subsistence farmers.  An infant free trade zone at the 
port directed by two Arnulfista patronage appointees offers 
no short term solutions to unemployment in that region. 
Expressing a pragmatic approach, PRD Chiriqui coordinator 
Belgis Castro Jaen claimed that there are already plenty of 
unemployed people in Chiriqui, and forcing small or medium 
farmers to cease production will create more.  A bilateral 
Free Trade Agreement with the United States will benefit 
Panama, Castro claimed, but Panama needs to find ways to 
allow vulnerable sectors to transition into other, more 
competitive enterprises. 
 
 
COMMENT: FEW NEW FACES 
---------------------- 
9. (SBU) Prohibitive campaign costs ($200,000 and up for a 
legislative seat) and intra-party oligarchies block new 
candidates from emerging.  Campaign stakes rise rapidly from 
zinc roof panels and cinder blocks in local representative 
races to six figure expenses in legislative races.  For 
instance, MOLIRENA incumbent Jorge Alberto Rosas, who 
represents an expansive but under-populated segment of 
Eastern Chiriqui with only 19,697 registered voters, told 
poloffs that he expects to spend around $250,000 on this 
year\'s campaign.  Cambio Democratico candidate for mayor of 
David, Raul Montenegro acknowledged that even with $35,000 
that he can piece together from personal savings and 
contributions from his friends, he is at a disadvantage 
compared with his opponents\' party machinery and wealthy 
benefactors. 
 
 
10. (SBU) The pool of viable candidates is small, and they 
move between parties as their interests shift, as evidenced 
in the race to defeat Rosas.  The Rosas family represents a 
Chiriqui political dynasty with extensive financial 
resources.  Without similar opportunities, others can\'t 
afford to be loyal to one party.  Rosas occupies the seat 
that his father Jorge Ruben Rosas lost in 1994.  MOLIRENA 
President and Jose Miguel Aleman\'s co-candidate for First 
Vice President Jesus \"Maco\" Rosas, is Jorge Alberto\'s uncle. 
Jorge Alberto explained that whereas Ricardo Martinelli\'s 
Cambio Democratico Party picked a virtual unknown as its 
candidate, Solidarity chose allies of former Arnulfista 
Rodrigo Jovane, who defeated Jorge Alberto\'s father in 1994, 
and could beat him on May 2.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, PM, ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: PANAMA\'S SCORECARD ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
 
1.  Summary and Comment:  Overall, Panama\'s intellectual 
property rights regime is headed in the right direction 
and has improved during the past year.  Panama has 
relatively well-developed intellectual property laws and 
institutions, and the GoP has increased specialized IPR 
training and technical support for local stakeholders. 
The GoP has also redoubled its efforts to legalize its 
software holdings this year, has strengthened its penal 
code, and is striving to fully implement its WCT and WPPT 
obligations. The specialized IP prosecutor,s office leads 
concrete and energetic GoP efforts to pursue cases and 
enforce the law. 
 
 
2.  Enforcement, however, is far from ideal as police, 
customs, and prosecutors suffer from a lack of resources, 
and cases often stall in the judicial system.  In addition, 
data exclusivity has become a concern. We are especially 
concerned with the dearth of resources for IPR enforcement 
in the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), outstanding international 
obligations, and the continuing lack of understanding of 
IPR within the judiciary.  In short, penalties applied in 
the CFZ have often not had a deterrent effect.  While 
the Embassy does not/not support a recommendation that 
Panama be placed on the Special 301 Watch List, we will 
continue to work with local stakeholders as well as U.S. 
industry representatives to press for continued 
improvement of IPR enforcement in Panama.  End Summary 
and Comment. 
 
 
Some GoP Institutions are Strong 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
3.  The GoP Inter-institutional Commission for Intellectual 
Property includes Public Ministry prosecutors, Customs and 
the Education Ministry\'s Copyright Office officials, Colon 
Free Zone (CFZ) administration, and representatives from 
the Commerce Ministry\'s international trade office 
(VICOMEX) and industrial property registry (DIGERPI).  The 
Commission takes the lead on IPR activities and is 
proactive in developing campaigns against IPR infringement. 
Using GoP funds, the Commission organized and executed a 
series of four regional workshops in 2003 throughout Panama 
to raise general awareness of IP, and also proactively 
sought Interamerican Development Bank matching funds for a 
total of $1 million to continue the campaign and also aid 
in modernizing Panama,s IP laws. 
 
 
4.  The Industrial Property Office (DIGERPI) of the 
Commerce Ministry maintains a centralized electronic 
database of all registered trademarks, accessible to remote 
users in the Intellectual Property Departments of both 
Customs and the CFZ, which allows those agencies to make 
determinations in potential infringement cases, and also to 
contribute information directly to the database.  In 2003, 
the system \"went mobile\" as investigators can now use 
wireless connectivity with laptop computers to access 
the data while actually inspecting merchandise at a port or 
at the CFZ. 
 
 
GoP,s Software Legalization Finally Underway 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  The GoP negotiated a government software legalization 
agreement with the Business Software Alliance (BSA), 
which President Mireya Moscoso signed as Presidential 
Decree 273 on December 27, 2000.  The agreement allowed 
for an 18-month analysis period, during which every 
government agency would audit the extent of its piracy, 
followed by an 18-month period of implementation, during 
which the GoP would license its software stock.  The entire 
process was to be completed by December 2003.  In April 
2003, 40% of GoP agencies still hadn\'t undertaken the 
audit, and even fewer had legalized their holdings.  In 
response, the Ambassador and Embassy mounted an aggressive 
campaign to focus GoP attention on this matter, and 
included the agreement on the agenda of the Embassy-GoP Ad 
Hoc Investment Commission and the USTR-led Trade and 
Investment Committee.  In the past few months, the GoP has 
finally moved to catalogue its software and most major 
ministries have either legalized or appropriated funds to 
legalize their holdings.  In January 2004, BSA,s local 
representative noted the sea change with the GoP, and 
emphasized that it was the direct result of Embassy 
intervention. 
 
 
Panama Modernizes its IPR Penal Code 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
6.  Law 1, promulgated on January 5, 2004, consolidated 
four previous IP-related laws, including parts of 
Panama\'s penal code.  It clarifies the definition of IP 
itself and violations against it while strengthening IP 
penalties.  While minimum jail sentences remain at one 
year, maximums have been increased to six years 
generally, and even up to twelve if a prosecutor can 
prove a linkage between IP violations and money 
laundering.  The law also allows for \"preventive 
detention\" and sets a minimum of $5,000 for bond while 
cases are investigated.  While the law does not consider 
minimum financial penalties/fines, it does allow for 
companies, Colon Free Zone trading permits to be revoked, 
as well as suspension of work permits for street vendors. 
The law is a significant step forward for Panama.  It 
includes a number of punishments that can be harsh enough 
to dissuade possible criminals from acting, yet allows 
for compassion in those cases where it\'s warranted. 
 
 
Panama ratifies WIPO treaties, almost in full compliance 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
7.  The GoP has signed and ratified ten World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) instruments, including the 
Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the Performances and Phonograms 
Treaty (WPPT).  DIGERPI and the Education Ministry estimate 
that Panama\'s national law is about 90 percent in 
compliance with these two key international treaties, but 
the GoP readily recognizes that it must update its 
copyright laws to be completely in line.  The office 
of the Vice Minister of Education took the lead on a law 
project to modernize the copyright law, but the proposal 
died in committee in the second legislative session of 
2003.  To date, the Ministry has not given a timeline to 
the Embassy for re-introduction of the bill, though we 
have provided useful texts and guidance from private 
industry to help with drafting the law. 
 
 
Agencies Striving to Enforce IPR law 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
8.  The specialized IP prosecutor,s office with national 
jurisdiction (Ninth Circuit attorney--created in December 
2002), has streamlined the execution of IPR cases, and now 
has four staff lawyers (twice as many as in 2002).  The 
office has even taken on the role of training other 
prosecutors to serve in backup roles, most importantly the 
Tenth Circuit attorney.  In one significant operation in 
November 2003, the office led an interagency team of 
prosecutors from Chiriqui province, the Technical Judicial 
Police, and National Police into nine different warehouses 
in the city of David.  The operation led to the seizure of 
counterfeit Levis jeans and the closure of five of the 
warehouses.  In another significant case in May 2003, the 
IP prosecutor led a team that seized 5000 counterfeit 
books.  Panama\'s Customs Authority seized significant 
amounts of contraband and fake goods during the year, 
including over 20,000 pieces of diverse merchandise like 
Black&Decker in one operation in Balboa and 2 full 
containers of pirated CD\'s in another.  The Colon Free 
Zone IP office averaged one on-site inspection per week 
in 2003 and seized over 11,000 cases of counterfeit and 
pirated goods.  In a display of judicial strength, a 
circuit court judge ordered 7 million pirated CD\'s to 
be destroyed in December, related to cases that have 
resulted in 20 convictions since 1999. 
 
 
Lack of Resources and a Still Weak Judiciary 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
9. U.S. companies have expressed concern about the general 
scarcity of resources and low priority given to IPR cases 
by Panama\'s Attorney General\'s office.  The specialized IPR 
prosecutor lacks even basic resources to conduct 
investigations and handle cases--and his office is better 
equipped than most other prosecutors,.  Prosecutors often 
ask victims to pay fees for storing evidence and other 
incidental costs related to seizures and investigations. 
This is disturbing considering that enormous merchandise 
trade flows through the Colon Free Zone, mostly from Asia 
to other Latin American countries.  Indeed, over 70% of 
IPR-related seizures in the CFZ originated from Asia in 
2003.  In addition, the music industry estimates that 
sales dropped by 30% in 2003, in large part due to piracy. 
 
 
10.  In spite of some successes like the destruction of 7 
million CD\'s mentioned in para 8, Panama\'s judicial system 
is generally weak, and the slow and inefficient criminal 
processes against IPR violators often deny victims any 
meaningful remedy. (Note: Regrettably, this applies to the 
wider judicial system.)  Cases brought before the criminal 
courts usually take years to be heard.  Despite the 
GoP,s concerted efforts to instill a better understanding 
of IPR, judges still lack a fundamental grasp of IP law and 
regard IP violations as misdemeanors, though the new penal 
code simplifies the laws and clarifies crimes.  In one 
especially egregious example in Colon, a CFZ merchant who 
had been convicted of previous IP violations was acquitted 
in 2003 in a case that had first started in 1999.  The 
judge had direct personal connections to the merchant and 
the merchant\'s company was clearly shipping several 
containers of contraband Philip Morris product. 
 
 
Data Exclusivity a Concern 
-------------------------- 
 
 
11.  Panama\'s Health Ministry requires companies that wish 
to sell drugs and chemicals to apply for \"sanitary 
registers\" that detail chemical makeups and laboratory 
results related to the development of the products. 
Several U.S. companies have applied for the registers, 
been approved, and begun sale of their products, only to 
find that a generic, locally produced version appears on 
the market soon after.  This indicates that the Health 
Ministry is not respecting the data exclusivity clause of 
Panama\'s Law 23 and is allowing other companies to view 
the proprietary data used in applying for sanitary 
registers.  According to Health Ministry lawyers, the 
Ministry\'s organic law (\"ley unica\") does not contemplate 
data exclusivity and takes precedence over any other law. 
Ministry officials have expressed their willingness to 
address this issue and the Ministry is currently 
undertaking an extensive review of how to bring the two 
laws into harmonization, but has given no indication of 
when this might be achieved. 
 
 
USG Provides Resources, Training 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
12.  The Embassy has helped bridge some of the GoP,s more 
glaring resource gaps.  Using Narcotics Affairs Section 
(NAS) funds, we have provided a photocopier, cable 
internet connection, and a computer projector to the IPR 
prosecutor to help with IPR training and investigations. 
We have helped cover the costs of storing evidence for IPR 
cases.  The CFZ uses USG-donated computers in several 
offices, and we are now undertaking a broader strategy of 
strengthening CFZ institutions.  We have sent two DIGERPI 
officials to a USPTO conference in the United States in 
2003.  Finally, the Embassy is aggressively pursuing 
anti-corruption and justice reform programs.

SUBJECT: CODEL WELLER UNDERSCORES GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PANAMA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Linda Watt for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  Codel Weller,s February 19-22 visit to 
Panama underscored our strong friendship and high level of 
bilateral cooperation with GoP interlocutors, who included 
President Moscoso, FM Arias, National Security Advisor 
Jarvis, and VM for Foreign Trade Adames.  Congressman Weller 
expressed appreciation for GoP support on Iraq, 
counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, Canal management, and 
added his strong backing for achieving a fair and balanced 
outcome during upcoming FTA negotiations.   President Moscoso 
stressed that the US can \"always count on us\" and encouraged 
completing FTA negotiations prior to her Administration 
leaving office on September 1.  She also voiced support for 
Panama,s designation as a distant foreign port under the 
Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA).  On the FTA, Moscoso 
noted that, with the exception of a few agricultural-sub 
sectors, most private business firmly supports the FTA. 
Regarding the upcoming May 2 national elections, Moscoso 
assured that they would be open, transparent, and democratic. 
 The Codel also attended a dinner hosted by the Ambassador 
with business and political leaders and visited the Panama 
Canal Authority, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute 
facilities, and the Manzanillo International Terminal (the 
largest container port in Latin America).  Codel Weller 
included Congressman Jerry Weller (R- Ill), Congressman 
Collin Peterson (D- Minn), and Ted Brennan (Western 
Hemisphere Subcommittee, Majority Staff).  End Summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Meeting w/ President Moscoso and FM Arias: 
\"You Can Always Count on Us\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Congressman Weller opened the February 19 meeting 
by noting that Panama has been a \"great friend\" to the US and 
thanked President Moscoso and FM Arias for Panama,s support 
in joining the Coalition of the Willing, signing an Article 
98 agreement, cooperating on regional security and 
counter-terrorism, and assisting in the capture last month of 
Colombian drug-kingpin Montoya.  He added that he shares a 
strong belief in free trade and that the U.S. wants a fair 
and balanced outcome for both countries from the upcoming 
negotiations.  President Moscoso praised the bilateral 
relationship calling the U.S. akin to the \"father Panama grew 
up with.\"  She added that in recent years the relationship 
has evolved and normalized.  She noted that cooperation has 
been excellent on security matters and on counter-terrorism. 
The GOP is taking all prudent measures to bolster Canal 
security.  She added the US \"can always count on us.\" 
 
 
3.  (U) Moscoso said the Canal,s increased revenues (a 
portion of which are transferred to the GoP) have permitted 
increased spending on hospitals, housing and education.   She 
said that the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) will finish a 
study on Canal expansion in June 2004 regarding a project to 
build a third-set of locks, and the GoP would subsequently 
hold a national referendum on the issue sometime afterwards. 
(Note: realistically the referendum will not likely take 
place before late 2004.)  The $ 4-9 billion dollar project 
will create jobs and participation will be open to US 
companies. 
 
 
4.  (U) Turning to the upcoming FTA negotiations, Moscoso 
said that she would like to conclude negotiations \"even if 
she does not sign the accord\" before leaving office September 
1.  She is pleased that the U.S. is thinking about Panama as 
an FTA partner and that the vast majority of Panama,s 
private sector supports the negotiation.  She noted sensitive 
areas for Panama are agriculture sub-sectors such as pork, 
chicken, beef, and rice.  FM Arias added -- for Congressman 
Peterson,s benefit -- that Panama has a small sugar 
industry, most of which is for domestic consumption. 
 
 
5.  (U) Moscoso assured the Codel that the upcoming May 2 
national elections would be \"open, transparent, and democracy 
will be respected.\"  She stressed that Panama had endured 21 
years of dictatorship and knows how important it is to get 
this right.  Congressman Weller noted that democracy is a 
fragile institution and that the U.S. is willing to work with 
Panama to strengthen democratic institutions. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Congressman Peterson said Panama,s desire to be 
designated a \"distant foreign port\" under the Passenger 
Vessel Services Act would be a difficult issue for the House 
Transportation Committee\'s Chairman Young.  FM Arias said he 
understood there was a way to bring this change about on the 
basis of executive branch authority.  Peterson cautioned that 
some in Congress might still try to block any such effort, 
but volunteered to talk with Young.   Arias explained that 
U.S. companies also see the re-designation as a way to 
increase business and that he will try to see Young when he 
visits Washington in March. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) On other security issues, Moscoso added that Panama 
is ready to implement the IMO,s ISPS code by the July 1 
deadline, but that it needs help obtaining x-ray equipment to 
inspect containers.  (Note: Moscoso appeared to be confusing 
ISPS implementation with the USG,s Container Security 
Initiative (CSI) program.)  She noted that Panama has also 
taken substantial measures during her administration to 
strengthen its anti-money laundering regime and in stopping 
drug transits.  Weller concluded by thanking Moscoso and 
Arias for the long and special relationship the US and Panama 
have enjoyed. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Meeting with National Security Director, Ramiro Jarvis 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
8.  (C) Codel Weller met with Ramiro Jarvis, Executive 
Secretary of the Public Security and National Defense 
 
SIPDIS 
Council, on Feb. 19.  Congressman Weller thanked Jarvis for 
Panama,s strong security cooperation with the United States, 
especially in the areas of counterterrorism and money 
laundering.  The discussion focused upon three themes: anti- 
security threats to the Panama Canal, terrorist activity in 
Panama, and regional cooperation. 
 
 
9.  (C) Jarvis noted that the 9/11 attacks caused Panama to 
change its perspective on Canal security, and that the GoP is 
continuously looking to enhance its capabilities to counter 
any potential threat.  He expressed gratitude to the USG for 
its role in providing equipment, training, and information. 
This collaboration has contributed to the strengthening of 
Panama,s borders and its ability to quickly respond to any 
situation.  He stated that the GoP evaluates every vessel 
that transits the canal, assigns it a threat level, and 
searches those considered suspicious.  Jarvis added that 
Panama has adapted a global view regarding its approach to 
national security.  In addition to the Container Security 
Initiative, Panama would like to sign the Proliferation 
Security Initiative with the United States before the end of 
the Moscoso administration.  He further stated that any USG 
assistance aimed at strengthening GoP immigration and customs 
organizations would be greatly appreciated. 
 
 
10.  (C) Regarding possible terrorist activities in Panama, 
Jarvis affirmed that the GoP has not/not identified any 
specific terrorist financial activity in Panama, adding that 
the UAF, Panama,s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), closely 
monitors the issue.  He noted Panama had recently made 
improvements to its anti-money laundering regime.  Responding 
to Congressman Peterson,s question on possible mainland 
Chinese encroachment into Panama, Jarvis responded that the 
main interest of China is to diminish Taiwan,s influence in 
Panama.  China\'s interests in Panama are commercial, he said. 
 Panama has not/not seen any indication of suspicious Chinese 
activities/penetration.  Congressman Weller stated that 
international cooperation amongst countries was imperative to 
stopping terrorists and their networks.  Jarvis concurred and 
explained that while Muslim communities in Panama and the 
region are well connected, Panama has not/not identified any 
abnormal activity.  He added that the GoP completes, with USG 
assistance, a strict identification check on selected 
individuals and foreign nationals coming to Panama and if 
there is any information regarding possible terrorist links, 
the GOP denies the visa. 
 
 
11.  (C) Jarvis continued that regional intelligence 
cooperation is good, especially with  Paraguay, Chile, and 
Argentina.  He elaborated that while arms trafficking has 
increased in the region as a whole, the countries are working 
together to stop it.  As a transit country of weapons, Panama 
continues to work closely with Colombia through a bi-national 
border and maritime security group.  Concerning the Darien 
border, Jarvis stated Panama would like Colombia to (1) 
strengthen the presence of its forces on the border and (2) 
communicate better with Panama.  Jarvis stressed that 
satellite communication and the willingness to exchange 
information are the keys to success.  At the moment, there is 
no means of communication at the border between the 
countries, although communication and coordination between 
Jarvis,s office and the Colombian Embassy in Panama City is 
close.  Ambassador Watt highlighted that the USG is working 
with the GoP to establish a secure communication system that 
is compatible between the two countries. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Meeting with VM for Trade, Romel Adames: 
The FTA: Panama,s Concerns 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
12.  (SBU) Codel Weller also met with Vice Minister for 
External Trade, Romel Adames, and his advisor, Analisa 
Palacios on Feb. 20.  Adames stressed the importance of 
beginning the FTA negotiations prior to Panama,s May 2 
national elections; \"beginning the negotiations in April 
would send the message the FTA is a state project rather than 
a political instrument in Panama.\"  (Comment: It\'s really 
just the opposite - the Moscoso Administration\'s timing 
argument is mostly local politics and trying to gain 
electoral advantage, although we see no downside with 
beginning discussions in April. End Comment.)   Adames stated 
that while there are some agricultural concerns (namely rice, 
onions, potatoes, dairy, and pork), the negotiations will 
also focus on services.  He specifically noted Panama,s 
interest in reducing barriers for Panamanian banks entering 
the US market.  Regarding CAFTA, Adames stated Panama is \"not 
uncomfortable with CAFTA as a starting place\" for the 
negotiations.  The GoP is currently studying CAFTA, and by 
early March will have a better understanding of what changes 
Panama wants.  Congressman Weller stated that CAFTA,s 
environmental additions would be important for Panama,s 
tourism industry.  Adames agreed and remarked that the 
environment was beginning to be a issue for Panamanians. 
 
 
13.  (SBU) Adames said that Panama views its main competitor 
for the FTAA Secretariat to be Miami.  He shared (protect) 
that Panama plans to offer its Atlapa Convention Center to 
house the Secretariat.  Weller stressed that the FTAA would 
permit the hemisphere to compete with Asia and China; the FTA 
between Panama and the U.S. is a key building block.  Adames 
concurred and called Brazil the region\'s largest stumbling 
block because of their self-conceived idea of power. 
 
 
14. (SBU) Congressman Weller asked Adames to elaborate on the 
issue of public procurement related to the Canal and whether 
American businesses are competitive in Panama.  Adames 
remarked that, in his opinion, the US initially pursued the 
issue in the wrong forum (read: the WTO,s GPA).  Panama, he 
explained, does not want to activate the Neutrality Treaty 
that permits the US to enter Panama to defend the Canal. 
Consequently, the GoP fears that foreign companies procuring 
in Panama could lead to allegations of active negligence, 
which could activate the treaty.  Panama is not giving 
preference regarding public procurement to countries with an 
FTA with GoP, but the GoP is willing to discuss the issue 
with the US.  (Comment:  While this logic seems convoluted it 
is clear the GoP will be prepared to discuss Canal 
procurement in the context of a bilateral FTA. End Comment.) 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Visit to the Canal and STRI 
--------------------------- 
 
 
15.  (U) Codel Weller also visited the Panama Canal 
Authority\'s Visitor Center where they met the Canal 
Administrator and received a briefing from Canal officials at 
the Incident Management Center on Canal Security.   The Codel 
also had the opportunity to visit the Smithsonian Tropical 
Research Institute\'s (STRI)  Galeta Point Laboratory and 
STRI,s Barro Colorado Island facility. 
 
 
16.  (U) Ted Brennan cleared for Codel Weller on paragraphs 
1-7 and 12-16; he did not have the opportunity to clear on 
classified paragraphs 8-11.

Fifth ballot refuses to die 
--------------------------- 
1.  (U) While a political cartoon in a Panama daily 
depicted the fifth ballot\'s funeral, civil society refused 
to let the issue rest in peace.  Criticism abounded in the 
wake of last week\'s Electoral Tribunal (ET) and Executive 
Branch insistence on not issuing a fifth ballot on 
constitutional reforms in the May 2004 elections.  Both 
1999 President of the National Counting Board Ricardo 
Lombana and widely known union leader Mariano Mena have 
attacked that decision and questioned the costs entailed by 
holding a future referendum on the issue versus issuing a 
fifth ballot this May.  Maribel Jaen, Executive Director of 
the Catholic Church\'s Peace and Justice Commission, appears 
resigned to the fifth ballot\'s demise, at least for this 
May.  Nonetheless, she asserted that regardless of the 
estimated $6 million cost, Panamanians deserve the 
opportunity to decide the issue of constitutional reform 
through a referendum.  Noting the millions of dollars that 
the GOP spent to promote last year\'s Miss Universe Pageant 
in Panama, Jaen insisted that the cost would be justified. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Civil society pressure led prominent Arnulfista 
legislator Jose Blandon Jr. to announce his willingness to 
consider constitutional reforms as proposed by opposition 
PRD-PP alliance.  Blandon said he is willing to follow 
Article 308 of Panama\'s constitution provided that certain 
amendments are made to the proposed bill. (See Reftel A.) 
Blandon insists that the bill include changes in the 
procedure for appointing the Attorney General and the 
Solicitor General, two officials that the next President 
will appoint.  Observers have noted that Blandon\'s move 
allows the Arnulfistas a certain peace of mind even if PRD 
frontrunner Martin Torrijos wins the May 2 election. 
Ironically, the Arnulfistas initially criticized the PRD-PP 
bill, proposing a fifth ballot instead.  Perceiving the 
Legislative Assembly as entirely corrupt, civil society 
groups do not want that entity to make constitutional 
reforms. 
 
 
\"La Dona\" 
--------- 
3.  (U) Flying in the face of conventional wisdom that 
\"nothing happens before Carnival\", well-known publicist, 
songwriter and singer Pedrito Altamiranda rocked Panama\'s 
political calm before the 5-day Carnival holiday with his 
wildly popular new tune, \"La Dona.\"  Panamanians refer to 
President Moscoso as \"La Dona\" (\"the stately old lady\"). 
With lilting, highly danceable rhythm and biting humor 
Altamiranda satirizes Moscoso\'s trips overseas, lavish 
parties, love life, and contested Supreme Court 
appointments, among other things.  Though he has not 
released his new CD, Altamiranda lent the song over the 
weekend of February 14-15 to a radio station popular among 
Panama\'s youth.  After two days, \"La Dona\" became the most 
requested song ever. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The GOP has not officially censored the song, but 
DJs at the radio station revealed that the station\'s owners 
instructed them to stop playing it.  Evidently the station 
does not want to lose revenue if Arnulfista presidential 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman were to pull his political 
advertisements.  Altamiranda paid a price too.  Panama\'s 
Tourism Institute (IPAT) had decided at the end of 2003 
that cancer victim Altamiranda would be honored during the 
official Carnival Queen\'s crowning ceremony; however, at 
the last minute, the organizers removed Altamiranda from 
the program.  Carnival Commission authorities and 
Altamiranda both deny that the change was due to the song, 
but a presidential staffer confided that Moscoso\'s office 
had placed a call to IPAT questioning their decision to 
honor Altamiranda. 
 
 
Candidates take it easy during Carnival week 
-------------------------------------------- 
5.  (U) Campaign activities dropped as expected during 
Carnival week when everyone in Panama City heads for the 
provinces to \"carnavalear.\"  Cambio Democratico Candidate 
Ricardo Martinelli, with a recent death in the family, 
decided to stay away from politics and carnival festivities 
this week.  Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara announced 
that he and his family would attend a religious retreat, 
but warned he would come back next week with a strong anti- 
corruption campaign.  Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman announced that he would spend time with his family 
and attend a popular Ash Wednesday Catholic mass in Las 
Tablas.  Campaign frontrunner, Revolutionary Democratic 
Party (PRD) Candidate Martin Torrijos spent a couple of 
days at a beach house, but also visited several towns to 
take advantage of the crowds and sponsored the very popular 
water trucks to entertain the people during Carnival 
festivities.  Torrijos was the most active of all the 
candidates. 
 
 
Presidential ballots ready 
-------------------------- 
6.  (U) Electoral Tribunal officers announced that the 
first draft of the presidential ballot has been printed. 
Once the Electoral Magistrates clear the text, the print 
shop will proceed to print the final version.  This 
announcement allows the Electoral Tribunal to publicly 
confirm that Panama\'s electoral process is on schedule. 
 
 
Call to submit blank votes 
-------------------------- 
7.  (U) In an unexpected announcement, a previously unknown 
leftist group calling itself the \"Unified Popular Movement\" 
(MPU) has urged Panamanians to submit blank ballots during 
the May 2 elections or void their votes by selecting more 
than one candidate.  Allegedly, MPU members are national 
university student leaders and professors, as well as 
workers.  MPU organizers insist that none of the candidates 
will fulfill their electoral promises and have criticized 
all of them.  Former President Endara, MPU charged was a 
puppet of then US Ambassador to Panama Deane Hinton during 
his 1989-2004 presidency.  MPU criticized PRD-PP Martin 
Torrijos for his allegedly poor performance as Vice 
Minister of Government and Justice under the Perez 
Balladares administration and his role in telephone and 
electricity privatization.  MPU referred to Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman\'s government plan as a 
continuation of the current GOP.  Finally, MPU criticized 
Cambio Democratico Candidate Ricardo Martinelli for having 
served in PRD and Arnulfista administrations. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) MPU\'s call spurred an immediate reaction by PRD- 
PP Martin Torrijo\'s First Vice Presidential candidate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro and another Torrijos supporter, former 
President of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Manuel 
Jose Paredes.  Both criticized MPU\'s position as 
irresponsible and encouraged people to study the 
candidates\' platforms and to make an informed decision. 
Historically, the PRD has had links with leftist groups in 
Panama and even has a leftist wing within the party. 
Observers have noted that the firm responses from Lewis 
Navarro and Paredes, neither of them old guard PRD, 
illustrate differences among Torrijos\' personal followers 
and party followers.

2. (SBU) On February 27, EmbOffs met with Deportes El 
Cazador\'s owner and president Rolando GONZALEZ Salerno at the 
company\'s offices, which are co-located with Gonzalez\' 
residence.  Since Deportes El Cazador was incorporated with 
Panama\'s Public Registry on July 16, 1991, the company has 
been located at its present site for the last seven of nearly 
13 years.  Gonzalez stated that El Cazador is primarily a 
wholesaler to large Panamanian department store chains, such 
as, El Machetazo and Cochez.  The company\'s offices have no 
external markings, signs or advertisements, and Gonzalez 
apparently relies on trade shows and word of mouth to attract 
clients.  The company also sells to smaller stores outside of 
Panama City and to GOP agencies.  There is no indication that 
the referenced purchases of weapons and ammunition will be 
diverted outside of Panama.  According to Gonzalez, El 
Cazador almost exclusively purchases from US firms, except 
for the company\'s Glock stock from Austria.  The company 
stores weapons within a double-door steel vault within the 
locked offices behind the residence\'s security wall.  El 
Cazador\'s records are impeccable, filed by US vendor and 
Panamanian purchaser.  The company not only meets Panamanian 
legal regulations and industry standards for weapons storage 
and purchases/sales records but surpasses them. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Gonzalez stated that the two referenced purchases 
intended for commercial re-sale represented annual orders. 
EmbOffs reviewed the company\'s records; the orders are 
actually smaller than in previous years.  Embassy\'s Foreign 
Commercial Service (FCS) office considers the order amounts 
to be \"normal\" for the company and for Panama and confirmed 
its own recent and positive check of El Cazador in January. 
The company\'s weapons and ammunition stocks from last year 
are not yet depleted, but Gonzalez times orders to take into 
account the lag in the US\' and Panama\'s authorization 
processes.  Gonzalez estimates stocks from this year\'s 
purchases to last 12 to 14 months.  He will place another 
order around December 2004.  Gonzalez noted that the GOP, as 
it has in the past, will likely declare a moratorium on 
weapons and ammunition sales before and after the country\'s 
national elections on May 2 and presidential inauguration on 
September 1, which may actually retard his estimates. 
Regarding the one referenced purchase of ammunition intended 
for re-sale to GOP agencies, EmbOffs confirmed the amounts 
stated in the contract with the information provided in ref, 
para 4, section C.  Most of the ammunition is for use by 
Panama\'s National Police (PNP), but smaller quantities will 
be used by government security guards assigned to the Social 
Security Fund, National Bank, Colon Free Zone and Panama City 
Municipal offices. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Panama\'s Public Security Director Edgardo Matteo 
confirmed the GOP authorizations described in ref, para 5. 
Matteo stated that the GOP has \"no issues\" with El Cazador or 
its owners, and regarding the latter, called Gonzalez a \"very 
serious businessman.\"  Matteo did not consider the amounts of 
the two referenced purchases intended for commercial re-sale 
to be excessive, noting that the GOP expanded and extended 
the sports hunting season this year.  He stated that, for 
example, Panama approved the import of 3.8 million rounds of 
ammunition in 2002 and a little under 2.0 million rounds of 
ammunition in 2003.  Matteo also pointed out that only 1.8% 
of violent crimes committed in Panama each year involve a 
legally imported weapon, most of which are stolen beforehand 
from their authorized owners. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: EmbOffs also questioned the amounts of the 
three purchases, but have allayed their initial concerns 
after visiting the offices of Deportes El Cazador and 
cross-checking with Embassy\'s FCS and the appropriate GOP 
agency.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) Roberto Eisenmann, Jr., founder of Panama\'s 
anti-dictatorship daily newspaper La Prensa, since 1990 
turned political maverick and op-ed gadfly, recently shared 
with POL Counselor some caustic commentary on what he called 
the \"outrageous\" attitude of Panama\'s political class and its 
corrupt behavior.  Eisenmann said his \"hopes\" for Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) presidential front-runner Martin 
Torrijos began to fade when Torrijos was slow to disengage 
himself from first cousin Hugo Torrijos.  Hugo is Martin\'s 
major, if not chief financial backer and recently dismissed 
campaign manager, implicated several times for financial 
abuse of public office, though never formally charged.  Given 
Torrijos\' spotty resume and his apparent reliance on shady 
finances, Eisenmann views an increasingly likely Martin 
Torrijos presidency as \"on the job training and then hope for 
the best.\"  On former President Endara\'s candidacy, Eisenmann 
said he faces a \"very uphill battle,\" adding that Endara has 
\"no new ideas\" and lacks money and a national organization. 
Although occasionally critical of U.S. politics in Panama and 
the wider region, Eisenmann is nonetheless an analyst with 
insight and a person of integrity whose views carry weight, 
even among those Panamanians who view him as arrogant and 
elitist.  End Summary. 
 
 
Two Biggest Parties \"Equally Corrupt\" 
------------------------------------- 
2.  (C) As a journalist, Roberto Eisenmann has focused 
squarely on corruption -- during military rule and after -- 
and he finds Panama\'s political elite sadly lacking.  He is 
anything but sanguine about democratic Panama, since 
Operation Just Cause ended Panama\'s 21-year military 
dictatorship in December 1989.  Panama could be a first-world 
country, he says, if it had decent government for just ten 
years.  Following the ouster of Manuel Noriega, he recalled 
that Panamanians with strong political convictions wanted a 
bipartisan system with two strong parties (Arnulfistas and 
PRD), but the two parties now \"are equally corrupt.\"  \"The 
attitude of the political class is outrageous,\" Eisenmann 
said. \"They don\'t seem to give a damn.\"  Panama must clean 
house or risk the emergence of a Panamanian Hugo Chavez. 
 
 
Endara As Anti-System Candidate 
------------------------------- 
3.  (C) Eisenmann is grateful for former President Guillermo 
Endara\'s presidential candidacy in Panama\'s May 2 election, 
\"or else we would have some crazy populist running,\" he 
added.  Endara is an establishment figure running for 
president in a slot that otherwise might have been filled by 
a genuine anti-system candidate, such as fired social 
security fund administrator Juan Jovane.  What Hugo Chavez 
proved in Venezuela -- that \"anyone\" can run for president -- 
may become true in Panama, Eisenmann said.  (See Reftel E.) 
At least in the May 2 election, no candidate poses any threat 
to the democratic process.  Eisenmann said that Endara faces 
a \"very uphill battle,\" and lacks a national organization, 
money, as well as new ideas. 
 
 
Friends Get the Cash Box 
------------------------ 
4.  (C) Eisenmann had few kind words for out-going President 
Mireya Moscoso.  Referring to his one-year stint as advisor 
to President Moscoso, Eisenmann recalled telling her \"I have 
friends too but I don\'t give them the cash box.\"  Eisenmann 
added that Moscoso hates former President Endara \"with a 
passion\" because she sees him as a Arnulfista party 
\"traitor.\" 
 
 
Historical Dislike of PRD 
------------------------- 
5.  (C) Eisenmann acknowledged his dislike of the PRD for 
historical reasons (an allusion to his personal clashes with 
PRD military strongmen Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega), but 
said he tries to be objective.  He views an increasingly 
likely Martin Torrijos presidency as \"on the job training and 
then hope for the best.\"  (Note: Martin Torrijos has held two 
jobs in his life that we know of.  He managed a McDonald\'s 
fast food franchise in Chicago in the late 1980s.  During 
1994-1998 he was Vice Minister of Government and Justice 
under President Ernesto Perez Balladares.  Given this limited 
experience, many other observers also worry about Torrijos\' 
lack of depth on issues.  End Note.) 
 
 
Alarm Bells 
----------- 
6.  (C) Eisenmann praised Torrijos for his ability to gain 
control of the PRD, for isolating the old guard, and winning 
a democratic intra-party primary vote.  But he sounded alarm 
bells about Hugo Torrijos, Martin\'s \"money man,\" who served 
as his campaign manager (until Martin recently asked him to 
step down) and likely will play a prominent role in a PRD 
presidency, and who recently was implicated in a scandal 
concerning his stewardship of Ports Engineering Construction 
Corporation (PECC -- See Ref C).  In November 2003 
Comptroller Alvin Weeden apparently called Torrijos to warn 
him to remove his cousin from the campaign on the day before 
accusations against Hugo Torrijos (and former president Perez 
Balladares) became public in the PECC scandal.  Even after 
removing Hugo a month later, Martin insisted it had nothing 
to do with PECC, adding that he was sure that Hugo was 
innocent of any wrongdoing.  (Note: Eisenmann thought the 
surprising thing about the PECC scandal was that Perez 
Balladares reportedly got such a small part of the action -- 
only 7.5%.  \"I bet he was pissed off when he found out the 
Torrijos boys were getting more than him,\" he said.  End 
Note.) 
 
 
\"This Hugo Thing\" 
----------------- 
7.  (C) \"I had hopes for Torrijos but this Hugo thing set me 
back,\" Eisenmann said.  Hugo Torrijos was ports director 
under PRD President Ernesto Perez Balladares, \"and left 
rich,\" Eisenmann noted.  \"A lot of money is made in Panama\'s 
Asian consulates,\" he quickly added, the Philippines in 
particular.  (Note: Also Vietnam.  Overall, commercial 
authentications make Tokyo Panama\'s most lucrative far 
eastern consulate.  End note.)  Augusto \"Onassis\" Garcia 
(advisor and close associate of President Moscoso) and Hugo 
\"understand each other,\" Eisenmann continued.  Onassis Garcia 
controls Panama\'s Asian consulates, he explained, (as Hugo 
Torrijos controlled them under Perez Balladares, when he was 
ports director, and before that under Manuel Noriega, as 
Finance Ministry shipping and consular services director). 
When Onassis Garcia\'s nephew, Juan Carlos Escalona (now 
Panama\'s ambassador and consul general in Manila), got there 
in 2000, Eisenmann continued, \"Hugo Torrijos told him, \'It 
will take you 18 months to set up your own system.  Why not 
use the one that I have and give me a cut?\'\"  Eisenmann 
quipped, \"These are the guys who are in government, because 
it\'s good business for them.\" 
 
 
Background: Seamen\'s Visas a Lucrative Trade 
-------------------------------------------- 
8.  (C) The licensing of merchant seamen to work on 
Panama-flagged vessels in East Asian capitals, Manila in 
particular, is a lucrative business for corrupt Panamanian 
officials (see Ref A and B), as is ship registration. 
Seamen, in their thousands, reportedly must pay an inflated 
\"fee\" of several hundred dollars, which officials pocket, for 
an identity cards whose nominal price starts at $115.  Also, 
to obtain their health clearances, the seamen reportedly must 
use only specific Manila clinics which, it is assumed, pay 
kickbacks to the officials.  (Comment: Embassy Panama has put 
the issue of seamen\'s visas and vessel registration at the 
top of our maritime security agenda.  While we have made 
major progress in virtually every other area of that agenda, 
the issue of seamen\'s visas and vessel registration remains 
elusive because of corruption in Panama\'s consulates and its 
Maritime Authority (AMP).  We hope to engage the next 
government which takes office on September 1, 2004, stressing 
that corruption involving seamen\'s visas and the registration 
of vessels under Panama\'s flag poses a direct threat to U.S. 
-- and Panamanian -- security interests.  End comment.) 
 
 
Ties of \"Blood, Marriage, and Adultery\" 
--------------------------------------- 
9.  (C) Interlocking relationships of blood and marriage (and 
adultery, as the wags have it) among Panama\'s elite go beyond 
mere nepotism, making official corruption difficult to root 
out.  For instance, Amb. Juan Carlos Escalona\'s brother, 
Arnulfo Escalona, is currently Minister of Government and 
Justice.  Both are nephews of Onassis Garcia (Moscoso\'s close 
advisor) but Arnulfo is also widely rumored to be President 
Moscoso\'s paramour.  Garcia\'s daughters, Bertilda and Rita, 
are Administrator of the Panamanian Maritime Authority (AMP) 
and Panama\'s Consul General in New York, respectively. 
Bertilda, Rita, and Juan Carlos thus control three of four 
AMP offices with authority to register ships and issue 
seafarer IDs (the fourth is London).  This particular group 
has long been known as the \"Chitre Mafia,\" after the 
Panamanian town they hail from (Ref D). 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10.  (C) Eisenmann may be an inveterate contrarian in his 
views, but his disdain for the traditional parties 
(particularly the PRD and Arnulfistas) is a sentiment 
increasingly shared by Panamanians who are unhappy with the 
corruption, clientelism, and cronyism within the political 
class.  Likewise, much of the popular support for ousted 
Social Security Chief Jovane, as well as the popularity of 
Solidaridad candidate Endara, reflects an underlying populism 
in Panama that could create conditions for the emergence of a 
charismatic demagogue, similar to the Chavez phenomenon in 
Venezuela.  Many observers believe that Panama\'s May 2, 2004 
election is key to restoring the credibility of the 
traditional political parties.  (See Reftel F.)  If Torrijos 
wins the election, as current trends suggest, Eisenmann and 
other top opinion shapers will be watching closely to see 
whether Torrijos lives up to his pledge to be \"the Tony Blair 
of Panama.\"  As Torrijos\'s First Vice Presidential Candidate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro has said about corruption in Panama, 
\"Change starts at the top.\"  His first test will be the 
appointment of government officials who can break the corrupt 
traditions that were described by Eisenmann.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  While Embassy Panama believes that trafficking in 
persons (TIP) is a problem in Panama, it is still relatively 
small and manageable.  Embassy has worked closely with the 
Government of Panama (GOP) to discover more about the extent 
of the problem in Panama and to encourage the GOP to work 
harder and more effectively to put an end to it.  We believe 
that the GOP is moving quickly in the right direction to 
address TIP and we have found great support for enhanced 
anti-TIP measures from all GOP levels, including its highest 
officials.  The GOP acknowledges that it has a TIP problem 
and is carrying out more intensive measures to sharply reduce 
the number of TIP victims.  In particular, the GOP recognizes 
that enhanced public awareness, public statements by 
government officials, effective legislation, aggressive 
police work and prosecution, victim assistance, and better 
program coordination all are necessary components to 
successful anti-TIP efforts.  The GOP is open to suggestions 
from Embassy-G/TIP and GOP ministries and the Legislative 
Assembly are increasingly \"on alert\" about the seriousness of 
TIP.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (U) Per Reftels (A and B) Embassy Panama is pleased to 
submit its input for the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) 
report. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Answers to Checklist Question 18. 
 
 
A.  IS THE COUNTRY A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, TRANSIT OR 
DESTINATION FOR INTERNATIONALLY TRAFFICKED MEN, WOMEN OR 
CHILDREN?  Yes.  SPECIFY NUMBERS WITHIN EACH GROUP: 
Estimated Men (0), Women (50-100), Children (50-100).   DOES 
THE TRAFFICKING OCCUR WITHIN THE COUNTRY\'S BORDERS? Yes. 
 
 
DOES IT OCCUR IN AN AREA OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONTROL? 
No.  ARE THERE ESTIMATES OR RELIABLE NUMBERS AVAILABLE AS TO 
THE EXTENT OR MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM? PLEASE INCLUDE ANY 
NUMBERS OF VICTIMS.  WHAT IS (ARE) THE SOURCE(S) OF AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  HOW RELIABLE ARE THE 
NUMBERS AND THESE SOURCES?  GOP tracks arrests, prosecutions, 
and victim complaints, in addition to deportations of illegal 
foreign sex workers. (Ref. C)  The International Labor 
Organization (ILO)/Program for Eradication of Child Labor 
(IPEC), along with academics at the University of Panama 
(UP), publish reports on commercial sexual exploitation of 
minors. (Ref. D)  (NOTE: ILO/IPEC is working regionally to 
combat commercial sexual exploitation of minors.  End Note) 
Panama\'s press has reported on underage sex workers and 
arrests and prosecutions of their traffickers. (Ref. E & F) 
GOP and NGOS officials also provide verbal reports and 
updates to Emboffs on numbers of TIP victims. (Ref. C) 
 
 
GOP and ILO reports and commentary are reliable.  Press 
reports at times are reliable, but  are often 
sensationalized.  A combination of official GOP reports, NGO 
studies, discussions with GOP and NGO officials, and 
extrapolation indicates the overall TIP victim total 
surpasses Department and G/TIP\'s 100 victim threshold. 
Estimated number of victims is 50-100 Women.  Embassy 
evaluated the sources of the reports and took a \"realistic 
and solid evidence\" approach, basing total TIP victims 
numbers on verifiable evidence and knowledge of Panama\'s 
overall social and economic conditions.  The estimates for 
the adults does assume that a small percentage (5-10%) of 
female sex workers in Panama or transiting Panama could be 
considered TIP victims.  All knowledgeable TIP sources agree 
that the overwhelming majority of adult female sex workers in 
Panama or transiting Panama have chosen their profession 
freely and are not to be considered TIP victims. (Ref. C, G, 
H, I, J) 
 
 
The estimated number of minor TIP victims is 50-100.  This 
estimate is based on ILO/IPEC reports, recent child sex 
worker ring busts, and meetings with NGOs. (Ref. E and K) 
The ILO reports indicate that there are at least 100 minors 
who are sexually exploited for commercial purposes, but a 
careful reading reveals that many of the victims appear to be 
part of the larger problem of familial sexual abuse or 
prostitute themselves because of drug addictions. 
 
 
Official GOP reports would indicate a combined adult and 
minor TIP victim population of 20-60 based on complaints, 
investigations, and extrapolation from other official 
records.  Immigration Department officials indicated 
approximately 125 women were deported for working illegally 
in the sex trade, mainly Colombians and some Dominicans. 
They reported that none of these women claimed to be TIP 
victims. (Ref. L)  (Note:  There have been unsubstantiated 
allegations of debt bondage amongst smuggled Mainland 
Chinese. (Ref. K)  No evidence has been uncovered to support 
these allegations.  Embassy continues to search for more 
credible evidence.  Estimates are not provided for debt 
bondage TIP victims.  End Note.) 
 
 
B.  WHERE ARE PERSONS TRAFFICKED FROM? Women: Colombia 
(primarily), Dominican Republic.   Children:  No credible 
evidence of international trafficking of children to or 
through Panama.  WHERE ARE THE PERSONS TRAFFICKED TO: Panama, 
Costa Rica, United States (through Central America). 
 
 
C.  HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE DIRECTION OR EXTENT OF 
TRAFFICKING?  In recent months it is likely that trafficking 
slowed because of high-profile arrests and prosecutions.  The 
direction of trafficking has not changed.  For women it flows 
from Colombia and Dominican Republic to or through Panama. 
For minors, evidence indicates it is an internal trafficking 
issue only. 
 
 
D.  ARE THERE EFFORTS OR SURVEYS PLANNED OR UNDERWAY TO 
DOCUMENT THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF TRAFFICKING THE COUNTRY? IS 
ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM SUCH REPORTS OR 
SURVEYS THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE LAST YEAR?  ILO/IPEC publishes 
reports and studies on the extent of commercial sexual 
exploitation of minors in Panama. (Ref. D)  Most of their 
reports have been published within the last two years.  NGOs 
publish reports on the health status of sex workers in 
Panama. (Ref. M)  The GOP tracks TIP victims complaints/cases 
through the Panamanian Judicial Police (PTJ) Sex Crimes Unit. 
 Immigration tracks deportations of illegal sex workers.  GOP 
could improve its reporting with better inter-agency 
coordination and a more formalized structure. 
 
 
E.  IF THE COUNTRY IS A DESTINATION POINT FOR TRAFFICKED 
VICTIMS:  WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE THE VICTIMS TRAFFICKED 
INTO?  WHAT METHODS ARE USED TO ENSURE THEIR COMPLIANCE? ARE 
THE VICTIMS SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE, THREATS, WITHHOLDING OF 
DOCUMENTS, DEBT BONDAGE, ETC?  Women and minors (girls) are 
trafficked into massage parlors and nude dancing 
establishments, which serve as brothels.  Many also work on 
the streets.  PTJ Sex Crime Unit detectives indicate that 
withholding of documents (passports) and heavy debts are the 
most common means of ensuring compliance.  Withholding of 
documents is most common for those who are working illegally 
(without work permits/\"alternadora\" visas) in prostitution. 
Threats of violence have not been reported in the vast 
majority of cases.  In a recent bust of child prostitution 
ring, PTJ detectives told EmbOffs that the minor victims 
(girls) and their families feared physical harm from the 
ring\'s operators who are linked with known drug traffickers. 
(Ref. F) 
 
 
F.  IF THE COUNTRY IS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Panama is not a 
country of origin for women or minors.  WHICH POPULATIONS ARE 
TARGETED BY TRAFFICKERS? WHO ARE THE TRAFFICKERS? WHAT 
METHODS ARE USED TO APPROACH VICTIMS?  WHAT METHODS ARE USED 
TO MOVE VICTIMS?  GOP and ILO reports indicate minors (girls) 
are offered cash and clothing by those running sex worker 
rings.  Traffickers are usually non-family, third parties. 
According to recent reports, girls are approached on the 
streets when away from their parents by third parties. 
Victims are transported within Panama by car and usually 
within a relatively limited area. (Ref. F) Adult victims are 
likely Colombian, and, to a lesser extent, Dominican female 
sex workers that arrive willingly in Panama to work in the 
sex trade but could become victims of TIP. 
 
 
G.  IS THERE POLITICAL WILL AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS? Yes.  IS THE 
GOVERNMENT MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO SERIOUSLY ADDRESS 
TRAFFICKING? Yes.  IS THERE A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ACTION 
AGAINST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LINKED TO TIP?  Yes.  IN BROAD 
TERMS, WHAT RESOURCES IS THE HOST GOVERNMENT DEVOTING TO 
COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (IN TERMS OF PREVENTION, 
PROTECTION, AND PROSECUTION)  The GOP, within its limited 
means, devotes considerable resources to combating TIP.  The 
Foreign Ministry (MFA) and the Ministry of Government and 
Justice (MOGJ) are well aware of the issue and are 
strengthening their efforts and putting into place pro-active 
and imaginative measures to combat TIP ((see para. 3(A), 4(A) 
and 5(A)).  (Refs. C, G, H, N)  The PTJ Sex Crimes Unit along 
with the Family and Children Court District Attorneys 
(Fiscales) are the primary investigation and prosecution arm 
of the GOP.  Within the Sex Crimes Unit, there are 6 
detectives who have specialized TIP knowledge but they do not 
exclusively investigate TIP cases.  (NOTE:  Panama has a 
greater magnitude problem of sexual violence and 
non-commercial sexual exploitation.  Resources and manpower 
within the Sex Crimes Unit and the District Attorneys offices 
are dedicated accordingly.  End Note.) 
 
 
The Immigration Department as part of its broader mission to 
deter illegal migration conducts raids on brothels and other 
establishments were TIP victims may be present.  These 
operations are carried out every two to three months and on 
an ad-hoc basis responding to complaints and leads. 
Immigration works in conjunction with the Panama National 
Police (PNP). (Ref. L)  Immigration also has increased 
airport and border-crossing enforcement, often in conjunction 
and with the assistance of USG resources.  As discussed with 
EmbOffs, Immigration officers are aware that certain visitors 
to Panama fit the profile of persons seeking to work 
illegally in the sex trade who could subsequently become or 
are TIP victims.  (NOTE: The profile includes adult women 
from Colombia or the Dominican Republic with limited cash, a 
one way or open-ended ticket, who often claim to be artists 
or hairdressers.  End Note.)  The National Air Service (SAN) 
and National Marine Service SMN also conduct interdictions to 
apprehend illegal migrants.  To date, no TIP victims have 
been found in these interdictions. 
 
 
The Ministry of Labor, Youth, Women, Children and Family 
Affairs, and Education have projects designed to eliminate 
illegal child labor, forced or otherwise, which can include 
commercial sexual exploitation of minors.  NGOs ((see para. 
5(I)) and international organizations (such as ILO) are also 
active in combating the larger problems of domestic violence 
and sexual abuse of women and children.  Combating TIP has a 
natural link with 
their work in these areas. 
 
 
Panama\'s legislature is preparing an important improvement to 
its existing TIP law ((see para. 5(A)). 
 
 
Per Reftels (C, G, H, N) USG has on-going TIP dialogue with 
all levels of the GOP.  The message has been delivered and 
heard by from the President to the offices of the PTJ Sex 
Crime Unit.  Embassy continues to work closely with the 
highest levels of the GOP and believes that in the coming 
weeks and months, GOP will further strengthen their anti-TIP 
efforts. 
 
 
H.  DO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF 
GOVERNMENT FORCES FACILITATE OR CONDONE TRAFFICKING, OR ARE 
THEY OTHERWISE COMPLICIT IN SUCH ACTIVITIES?  No.  There are 
allegations that a Panamanian consul is facilitating TIP 
related visa and/or passport fraud. (Ref. O)  Embassy is 
working with the GOP to investigate allegations.  Embassy is 
confident GOP would welcome additional information and take 
appropriate action.  DO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (SUCH AS 
CUSTOMS, BORDER GUARDS, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS, LABOR 
INSPECTORS, LOCAL POLICE, OR OTHERS) RECEIVE BRIBES FROM 
TRAFFICKERS OR OTHERWISE ASSIST IN THEIR OPERATIONS?  No 
evidence has been uncovered regarding bribes to GOP officials 
from TIP traffickers.  WHAT PUNITIVE MEASURES, IF ANY, HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS COMPLICIT OR INVOLVED IN 
TRAFFICKING? N/A, see above. 
 
 
I.  WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO 
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IN PRACTICE?  FOR EXAMPLE, IS FUNDING 
FOR POLICE OR INSTITUTIONS INADEQUATE?  Funding is limited 
for TIP-specific investigations within PTJ, PNP, Immigration 
and other GOP ministries.  Lack of funding limits training 
and hurts victim\'s assistance and coordination within the GOP 
and with NGOs.  The current anti-TIP, anti-child pornography 
law, while sufficient, can hamper active investigations 
because of the need for a formal complaint to be filed and 
antiquated legal definitions. (Ref. C)  IS OVERALL CORRUPTION 
A PROBLEM?  Corruption is a problem in Panama.  However, 
corruption does not seem to be related to GOP anti-TIP and 
anti-child pornography efforts. 
 
 
J.  TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMATICALLY MONITOR 
ITS ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS (ON ALL FRONTS, PROSECUTION, 
PREVENTION, AND VICTIM PROTECTION) AND PERIODICALLY MAKE 
AVAILABLE, PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY AND DIRECTLY OR THROUGH 
REGIONAL/INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, ITS ASSESSMENTS OF 
THESE ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS?  The PTJ Sex Crimes Unit 
tracks all active and closed cases and prosecutions.  The PNP 
and Immigration have statistics on deportations, including 
those involving illegal prostitution.  The GOP Ministries 
that work to eradicate forced child labor and commercial 
sexual exploitation of minors all track results of their 
projects.  The GOP shares its statistics with NGOS, ILO/IPEC, 
and the Embassy.  Embassy officials can call at any time and 
receive the latest updates from these GOP ministries. 
ILO/IPEC uses statistics from the PTJ to supplement their own 
reporting. 
 
 
K.  IS PROSTITUTION LEGALIZE OR DECRIMINALIZED? Yes and it is 
regulated.  IF PROSTITUTION IS LEGAL AND REGULATED, WHAT IS 
LEGAL MINIMUM AGE FOR THIS ACTIVITY? 18 
 
 
L.  DOES THE PRACTICE OF BUYING OR SELLING CHILD BRIDES 
(BRIDES UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS) OCCUR IN COUNTRY?  No.  DO 
MEN OF THE COUNTRY TRAVEL ABROAD TO PURCHASE CHILD BRIDES?  No 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  Answers to checklist question 19 
 
 
A.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TRAFFICKING IS A 
PROBLEM IN THAT COUNTRY?  Yes, GOP officials acknowledge 
there are TIP victims in Panama.  Those within GOP working to 
combat TIP speak openly about its existence in Panama but 
most do not believe there are more than 100 victims. (Ref. C) 
 However, GOP continues devote considerable time, efforts and 
resources to combating TIP. 
 
 
B.  WHICH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED IN 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS?  PTJ (including Sex Crimes Unit), 
PNP, Immigration, MFA, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Health, 
SAN, SMN, Family and Child Courts, District Attorneys, the 
Ombudsman (Defensora) and the Legislature. 
 
 
C.  ARE THERE OR HAVE THERE BEEN GOVERNMENT-RUN 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING INFORMATION OR EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS? IF SO, 
BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE CAMPAIGN(S), INCLUDING THEIR OBJECTIVE 
AND EFFECTIVENESS. DO THESE CAMPAIGNS TARGET POTENTIAL 
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND/OR THE DEMAND 
FOR TRAFFICKING (E.G. \"CLIENTS\" OF PROSTITUTES OR 
BENEFICIARIES OF FORCED LABOR).  The PTJ Sex Crimes Unit has 
conducted informal education sessions at schools and 
universities specifically discussing trafficking and related 
crimes.  The government, to date, has not conducted a formal 
national outreach campaign.  Embassy plans to assist the PTJ 
and other GOP ministries with the development of a public 
education program within the coming months. (Ref. C)  Program 
will follow similar format as the GOP educational campaigns 
on money-laundering, drugs, and violent crimes.  The 
Ministries of Labor, Education, Youth, Women, Children, and 
Family Affairs conduct educational campaigns about the 
negative effects of sexual abuse and forced child labor, 
including commercial sexual exploitation of minors. 
Immigration hosts radio call-in program where a variety of 
migration issues are discussed. (Ref. L)  (NOTE:  USG 
assistance supported GOP educational campaigns addressing 
money laundering, drugs, and violence.  Given the increased 
USG, GOP, and international communities efforts to combat 
TIP, USG support will enhance GOP\'s on-going efforts. End 
Note.) 
 
 
D.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OTHER PROGRAMS TO PREVENT 
TRAFFICKING? (E.G. TO PROMOTE WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN 
ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING OR EFFORTS TO KEEP CHILDREN IN 
SCHOOL). PLEASE EXPLAIN.  Yes, GOP sponsors a number of 
programs through the Ministries of Health, Labor, Education, 
and Youth, Women, Children and Family Affairs. These programs 
range from increasing access to education for child workers, 
anti-drug, HIV and Safe Sex awareness, and combating violence 
against women.  (Ref. G & N)  NGOs and other international 
organizations sponsor similar campaigns.  (Ref. K) 
 
 
E.  IS THE GOVERNMENT ABLE TO SUPPORT PREVENTION PROGRAM? 
Yes, but limited due to lack of funding. 
 
 
F.  WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, 
NGOS, OTHER RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF 
CIVIL SOCIETY ON TRAFFICKING ISSUE?  Good.  The GOP working 
relations, especially through the PTJ Sex Crime Unit, with 
the ILO/IPEC are good.  Embassy believes enhanced focus on 
prevention and victims assistance would improve effectiveness 
of GOP and NGO efforts to combat TIP.  USG-GOP relations are 
outstanding on this issue.  EmbOffs and Washington Reporting 
Officers are granted immediate and unrestricted access to GOP 
officials, including the opportunity to conduct \"ride-alongs\" 
with PTJ sex crimes unit detectives. 
 
 
G.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT ADEQUATELY MONITOR ITS BORDERS? Yes. 
DOES IT MONITOR IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION PATTERNS FOR 
EVIDENCE OF TRAFFICKING? Yes. DO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO SUCH EVIDENCE? Yes, the Immigration 
Department continues to increase its efforts to stem the flow 
of illegal migrants to and through Panama.  While the vast 
majority of those identified as illegal foreign sex workers 
are not TIP victims, Immigration does track the number of sex 
workers they deport.  According to Immigration officials, of 
the approximately 125 illegal foreign sex workers, all asked 
for voluntary departure and did not claim to be TIP victims. 
(Ref. L)   DHS/ICE works closely with Panamanian Immigration 
on detection and investigation of alien smuggling and TIP. 
The SAN and SMN also conduct interdictions based on 
intelligence received.  The overwhelming majority of those 
persons arrested are being voluntarily smuggled and not 
trafficked. 
 
 
H.  IS THERE A MECHANISM FOR COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION 
BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES, SUCH AS MULT-AGENCY WORKING GROUP 
OR TASK FORCE?  DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS TASK FORCE? There is no formal TIP task force.  The 
MFA conducts ad-hoc briefings with various GOP ministries 
based on USG demarches and of its own initiative.  Ministries 
also work together on prevention, protection, and prosecution 
on an ad-hoc basis.  ILO/IPEC has published a report with 
detailed information on which GOP agencies and NGOS are 
working to combat commercial sexual exploitation of minors. 
(Ref. P)  DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A PUBLIC CORRUPTION TASK 
FORCE? No.  GOP has an anti-corruption prosecutor and the 
Ministry of Economics and Finance has an office to coordinate 
anti-corruption efforts. 
 
 
I.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT COORDINATE OR PARTICIPATE IN 
MULTINATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUPS OR EFFORTS TO 
PREVENT, MONITOR, OR CONTROL TRAFFICKING?  GOP coordinates 
border control with neighboring countries through Immigration 
and PNP.  GOP and the Government of Colombia (GOC) have a 
border security working group for Darien Province.  GOP works 
directly with the International Organization on Migration 
(IOM) on alien smuggling and anti-TIP programs.  PTJ and PNP 
receive intelligence from Interpol on TIP cases.  (NOTE: 
Embassy believes GOP would support and participate actively 
in any additional bi-lateral and/or regional working groups. 
End Note.) 
 
 
J.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION TO 
ADDRESS TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  GOP does not have published 
national anti-TIP plan, however GOP, Legislature, 
international organizations (ILO), and NGOs have a number of 
proposals that if coordinated and formalized with their 
on-going efforts to combat TIP would constitute a national 
action plan.  IF SO, WHICH AGENCIES WERE INVOLVED IN 
DEVELOPING IT? District Attorneys, PTJ, Immigration, PNP, 
Labor, Youth, Women, Children and Family Affairs, Legislature 
 WERE NGOS CONSULTED IN THE PROCESS? Yes.  WHAT STEPS HAS THE 
GOVERNMENT TAKEN TO DISSEMINATE THE ACTION PLAN?  Proposed 
legislation has been discussed in the press.  The ILO action 
plan reports are public documents.  GOP should publicize 
their efforts to combat TIP more. 
 
 
K.  IS THERE SOME ENTITY OR PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOP 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS WITH THE GOVERNMENT? Given their 
investigative and prosecution responsibilities, the PTJ and 
the District Attorneys are the primary anti-TIP agencies 
within the GOP.  Immigration has strong role within the 
context of border security and illegal migration.  The 
Ministries of Labor and Youth, Women, Children and Family 
Affairs concentrate on efforts to combat commercial sexual 
exploitation of children.  MFA serves as a moderator and 
brings together various GOP ministries to address current TIP 
issues. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  Answers to checklist question 20 
 
 
A.  DOES THE COUNTRY HAVE A LAW SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITING 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS-BOTH FOR SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND 
TRAFFICKING FOR NON-SEXUAL PURPOSES (E.G. FORCED LABOR)? Yes. 
 IF SO, WHAT IS THAT LAW? Section 310 and 310 (a)  The law 
makes it a punishable crime for those who traffick people, or 
those who are part of an organization that trafficks people. 
The law also makes punishable any intervention related to 
trafficking involving fraud, or evading any immigration law 
in pursuit of trafficking.  A third law, Law 231, makes it a 
crime to facilitate the entry or exit of a person to engage 
in non-regulated prostitution, although it does not 
specifically mention trafficking.  Article 501 of the Family 
Code and Article 215C of the penal code criminalize child 
prostitution and child pornography.  ARE THESE LAWS, TAKEN 
TOGETHER, ADEQUATE TO COVER THE FULL SCOPE OF TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS? Yes. However, the laws need updating. 
Investigations and prosecutions are hampered by the need for 
a formal complaint to be filed in TIP-specific 
investigations.  Police officials need legal authorization to 
be more aggressive in their investigations.  The child 
pornography laws needs to be updated to incorporate the wide 
reaching effects of the Internet and to include harsher 
penalties for TIP and child pornography. 
 
 
A bill is currently before the legislature and with good 
chances of passage would remedy most if not all of the 
current shortcomings. Based on recent meetings between 
EmbOffs and legislative leaders from two leading political 
parties, it seems likely that an updated, tougher anti-TIP 
and anti-child pornography legislation will pass during the 
current legislative session.  The legislation would increase 
penalties for TIP, expand definitions of child pornography to 
include Internet based crimes, and eliminate the need for a 
formal complaint to initiate TIP-specific investigations. 
(NOTE:  Panamanian legislators proposed the new legislation 
on their own initiative and not because of pressure from 
EmbOffs.  End Note.)  Upon seeing G/TIP\'s model legislation, 
Panamanian legislators agreed to incorporate as much as 
possible into the pending bill.  In addition, the GOP is 
proposing a \"cyber-police force\" that would investigate child 
pornography on the Internet. (Ref. F) 
 
 
The Immigration Department is proposing eliminating the 
\"alternadora\" visa for foreign sex workers. (NOTE:  Contrary 
to prior information given to Embassy, the alternadora is not 
restricted to Colombians.  However, the vast majority of 
recipients are Colombians.  This visa was established in the 
1950s at the request of the USG.  End Note.) 
 
 
B.  WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR TRAFFICKERS OF PEOPLE FOR 
SEXUAL EXPLOITATION? FOR TRAFFICKERS OF PEOPLE FOR LABOR 
EXPLOITATION?  Law 310 sets the penalty at 10-15 years in 
prison. Law 310 A sets it at 5-10 years.  The different 
penalties depend on the circumstances and severity of the 
offense.  Under Law 231, the penalty is 2 to 4 years and 6 
years under more aggravated circumstances. 
 
 
C.  WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR RAPE OR FORCIBLE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT? HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO THE PENALTY FOR SEX 
TRAFFICKING? Under laws 216-218 of the penal code, rape is 
punishable by 3 to 10 years under most circumstances, and 5 
to 10 years under more serious circumstances. 
 
 
D.  HAS THE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTED ANY CASES AGAINST 
TRAFFICKERS? Yes.  IF SO, PROVIDE NUMBER OF ARRESTS, 
INDICTMENTS, CONVICTIONS, SENTENCES, INCLUDING DETAILS ON 
PLEA BARGAINS AND FINES, IF RELEVANT AND AVAILABLE.  In 
2003-2004, the Sex Crimes Unit (PTJ) has completed six formal 
investigations leading to 10 arrests for TIP-specific crimes, 
more arrests are possible. Two cases (total of approximately 
five adults) have been forwarded to the District Attorney 
(Fiscal) for trial. Other cases are awaiting transfers to the 
District Attorney.  The Supreme Court recently rejected an 
appeal of an infamous child prostitution ring leader Thonya 
Hubbard and upheld her 76 months sentence.  An associate 
(Thanya Bedoya) was sentenced to 3 years and a 
client/associate (Larry Pinto) was sentenced 2 years and 3 
months. (Ref. F)  Hubbard was convicted twice in separate 
trials in 1999 and 2002.  Bedoya was convicted in 1999 and 
Pinto in 2002. 
 
 
The PTJ has been conducting TIP-specific investigations since 
1999.  There were approximately 6 TIP specific investigations 
before 2003.  The Sex Crimes Unit has doubled the amount of 
formal investigations since last year\'s TIP report.  The unit 
does conduct surveillance and intelligence gathering on TIP 
but does not classify those operations as formal 
investigations.  As noted, the need for a formal complaint 
prior to an investigation limits does has limiting effect. 
(NOTE: The Panamanian judicial system is slow, inept and 
often corrupt. While no evidence indicates corruption affects 
TIP investigation, the overall nature of the system does slow 
TIP prosecutions. End Note.) 
 
 
Immigration, in conjunction with the District Attorneys and 
the PNP, have kept a number of brothels (EL Ovalo, El Halcon, 
El Buffalo) closed for several months based on complaints and 
investigations.  While no TIP victims were discovered, 
Immigration kept the establishments closed for other 
violations.  Immigration fines brothels with illegal foreign 
sex workers. (Ref. L)  ARE THE TRAFFICKERS SERVING TIME 
SENTENCED? Yes. IF NO, WHY NOT?  PLEASE INDICATE WHETHER THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION, AND IF NOT, WHY NOT? 
Government willingly provides all information. 
 
 
E.  IS THERE ANY INFORMATION OR REPORTS OF WHO IS BEHIND THE 
TRAFFICKING? Yes, independent dance club and/or massage 
parlor owners and, on occasion, persons with connections to 
illegal drug trade  ARE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INVOLVED? No 
hard evidence of government officials involved. There is one 
third party, third country allegation of a GOP official 
issuing visas and passports to women for alien smuggling and 
TIP. (Ref. O)  ARE THERE ANY REPORTS OF WHERE PROFITS FROM 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ARE BEING CHANNELED? (E.G. ARMED 
GROUPS, TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, JUDGES, BANKS, ETC).  Most 
profits appear to go directly to traffickers.  One child 
prostitution ring had ties to drug traffickers. 
 
 
F.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY INVESTIGATE CASE OF 
TRAFFICKING? Yes, however PTJ Sex Crime Unit is limited by 
law and must have formal complaint to investigate TIP cases. 
Immigration and PNP have more freedom to investigate alien 
smuggling, which may include TIP victims.  (Ref. C)  DOES THE 
GOVERNMENT USE ACTIVE INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES IN TRAFFICKING 
IN PERSONS INVESTIGATIONS? Yes.  TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER 
DOMESTIC LAW, ARE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE, 
UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS, AND MITIGATED PUNISHMENT OR IMMUNITY 
FOR COOPERATING SUSPECTS USED BY THE GOVERNMENT?  Undercover 
operations are primary tools.  There are very strict 
regulations for use of electronic surveillance. DOES THE 
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE OR LAWS PROHIBIT THE POLICE FORM 
ENGAGING IN COVERT OPERATIONS? No. 
 
 
G.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN HOW TO RECOGNIZE, INVESTIGATE, AND 
PROSECUTE INSTANCES OF TRAFFICKING?  GOP provides limited 
internal training. Most training is provide by third parties. 
 DHS/ICE provided specialized training in May and September 
2003 to GOP agencies on investigation and prosecution of 
child pornography in Miami. (Ref. N)  The Spanish government 
has proposed additional legal training for the PTJ Sex Crimes 
Unit this year. 
 
 
H.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN 
THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKING CASES? Yes, 
but depends on types of cases.  The GOP recently cooperated 
with the GOC on the take down of child prostitution ring in 
Panama.  (Ref. F)  Some of the ring leaders were Colombians. 
Immigration and MFA are very active with IOM programs to 
combat alien smuggling and TIP.  IF POSSIBLE, CAN POST 
PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF COOPERATIVE INTERNATIONAL 
INVESTIGATIONS ON TRAFFICKING?  At the moment, there is no 
additional data on cases other than that already listed. 
 
 
I.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE PERSONS WHO ARE CHARGED 
WITH TRAFFICKING IN OTHER COUNTRIES? No known extradition 
requests DOES THE GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE ITS OWN NATIONALS 
CHARGED WITH SUCH OFFENSES? No known extradition requests IF 
NOT, IS THE GOVERNMENT PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM EXTRADITING ITS 
OWN NATIONALS? Constitution prohibits extradition of 
Panamanians. 
 
 
J.  IS THERE EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN OR 
TOLERANCE OF TRAFFICKING, ON A LOCAL OR INSTITUTION LEVEL? 
No. As mentioned before, there are allegations that a 
Panamanian consul is facilitating TIP related visa and/or 
passport fraud.  Embassy is confident GOP would welcome 
evidence, if it could be found, and take appropriate action. 
Corruption is systemic in Panama but no current evidence 
indicates ties to TIP. 
 
 
K.  IF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING, WHAT 
STEPS HAS THE GOVERNMENT TAKEN TO END SUCH PARTICIPATION? 
Embassy is following up on report that GOP deported 
diplomatic officials from a third-country for TIP and/or 
alien smuggling.  (Ref. O)  HAVE ANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
BEEN PROSECUTED FOR INVOLVEMENT TRAFFICKING OR TRAFFICKING 
RELATED CORRUPTION? No GOP officials have been charged. 
 
 
L.  HAS THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED, RATIFIED, AND/OR TAKEN STEPS 
TO IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS? PLEASE 
PROVIDE THE DATE OF SIGNATURE/RATIFICATION IF APPROPRIATE? 
 
 
ILO CONVENTION 182: Ratified on June 15, 2000. Deposited in 
Geneva on October 31, 2000 
ILO CONVENTION 29:  Ratified in 1930 
ILO CONVENTION 105: Ratified in 1957 
THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE 
CHILD (CRC): Singed on October 31, 2000 and ratified on 
February 9, 2001 
THE PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SUPPLEMENTING THE UN 
CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: Panama 
signed this convention on December 13, 2000 but has not yet 
ratified it. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Answers to checklist question 21 
 
 
A.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT ASSIST VICTIMS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY 
PROVIDING TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY STATUS, RELIEF 
FROM DEPORTATION, SHELTER AND ACCESS TO LEGAL, MEDICAL, AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES?  IF SO, PLEASE EXPLAIN. Access to 
legal, medical, and psychological services are available. 
PTJ has a crime victims assistance center at PTJ headquarters 
in Panama City.  Service coordination is available at this 
center.  These services are not specifically focused on TIP 
victims but are designed to provide more generalized victims 
assistance.  MFA is proposing, in cooperation with IOM, the 
creation of shelter for victims of alien smuggling and TIP. 
This shelter and its services will be based on local NGO Casa 
Esperanza (see para 5(I)).  Immigration coordinates referrals 
to hospitals and NGOs for scheduled deportees who claim to be 
victims of abuse and TIP.  (Ref. L)  DOES THE COUNTRY HAVE 
VICTIM CARE AND VICTIM HEALTH CARE FACILITIES?  PTJ center 
coordinates victim referrals to these services.  Some 
hospitals and clinics have medical staff trained to treat 
rape and other sexual assault victims.  TIP-specific training 
would be beneficial.  IF SO, CAN POST PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF 
VICTIMS PLACED IN THESE CARE FACILITIES?  Statistics are not 
tracked for TIP victims specifically.  ARE TRAFFICKING 
VICTIMS OFFERED HIV/AIDS SCREENING OR OTHERWISE TESTED FOR 
HIV/AIDS? IF SO, WHAT ARE THE RESULTS? HIV/AIDS screening is 
offered but on a broader basis both to rape and sexual 
assault victims and to sex workers.  HIV/AIDS screenings are 
required and provided by the Ministry of Health for 
registered sex workers. (Ref. M) 
 
 
B.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE FUNDING OR OTHER FORMS OF 
SUPPORT TO FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC NGOS FOR SERVICES FOR VICTIMS? 
PLEASE EXPLAIN.  There is no direct financial support of NGOs 
by government. 
 
 
C.  IS THERE A SCREENING AND REFERRAL PROCESS IN PLACE, WHEN 
APPROPRIATE, TO TRANSFER VICTIMS DETAINED, ARRESTED OR PLACED 
IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO NGO\'S 
THAT PROVIDE SHORT OR LONG TERM CARE? The PTJ center 
coordinates victims assistance.  There is no formal and 
publicized procedure specifically related to TIP victims and 
NGOS.  Most victims assistance is coordinated through the Sex 
Crimes Unit.  Those NGOS that work with victims (adult and 
minors) of sexual abuse and assault are well known and law 
enforcement authorities can make referrals on ad-hoc basis. 
The services are available, but better coordination and 
publicity about victims assistance is needed. 
 
 
D.  ARE THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS RESPECTED OR ARE VICTIMS 
TREATED AS CRIMINALS?  Victims are not treated as criminals; 
their rights are respected.  ARE VICTIMS DETAINED, JAILED OR 
DEPORTED? Victims are not usually jailed.  A small portion of 
deported sex workers who are held in custody may have been 
TIP victims, although none claimed to be.  Enhanced victim 
identification training would be useful.  IF DETAINED OR 
JAILED, FOR HOW LONG? Most victims are not detained. If they 
committed another crime or are awaiting deportation, then the 
jail time will vary depending on the circumstances.  ARE 
VICTIMS FINED? Not unless they are found guilty of a crime. 
ARE VICTIMS PROSECUTED FOR VIOLATIONS OF OTHER LAWS, SUCH AS 
THOSE GOVERNING IMMIGRATION OR PROSTITUTION? As stated, there 
may be small percentage of undocumented sex workers 
(primarily Colombians, with smaller percentage of Dominicans) 
who could TIP victims.  Because of their illegal work status, 
they can be charged with immigration and labor violations. 
According to GOP, almost all ask for voluntary departure. 
 
 
E.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGE VICTIMS TO ASSIST IN THE 
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS?  Yes, victim 
participation is crucial.  PTJ and other law enforcement need 
a formal complaint to initiate active investigation and 
prosecutions.  Embassy is working with GOP to establish a 
victims hotline to further assist investigations and victims 
assistance.  MAY VICTIMS FILE CIVIL SUITS OR SEEK LEGAL 
ACTIONS AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS? Yes.   DOES ANYONE IMPEDE 
THE VICTIMS\' ACCESS TO SUCH LEGAL REDRESS? Like the United 
States, civil court cases can be a lengthy and expensive 
process. IF VICTIMS ARE MATERIAL WITNESSES IN A COURT CASE 
AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER, IS THE VICTIM PERMITTED TO 
OBTAIN OTHER EMPLOYMENT OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY?  They are 
permitted to leave country. If they have legal status to 
work, they can seek other employment. IS THERE A VICTIM 
RESTITUTION PROGRAM? No. 
 
 
F.  WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION IS THE GOVERNMENT ABLE TO PROVIDE 
FOR VICTIMS AND WITNESSES?  Identity of victims are not 
revealed.  There is not a witness protection program. DOES IT 
PROVIDE THESE PROTECTIONS IN PRACTICE? Yes 
 
 
G.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN RECOGNIZING TRAFFICKING AND IN 
PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE TO TRAFFICKING VICTIMS, INCLUDING THE 
SPECIAL NEEDS OF TRAFFICKED CHILDREN?  GOP has limited 
internal training but approximately 20-30 GOP officials from 
seven different ministries have received training from 3rd 
parties in Panama and abroad.  Ad hoc training is provided by 
DHS/ICE officials to Customs and Labor inspectors on forced 
child labor, including commercial sexual exploitation and 
child pornography.  DHS/ICE officials at Panama international 
airport provide informal training to Immigration officials on 
identification of potential TIP victims entering country. 
GOP sent six officials from the MFA, PNP, and Immigration to 
specialized TIP training in Bogota this year.  In February 
2003, the head of Immigration, an assistant district attorney 
and a Panamanian journalist all attended Washington, D.C. TIP 
conference. (Ref. Q)  Embassy, with G/TIP support, will 
provide training from the Paul and Lisa Project in April 2004 
to approximately 40-50 professionals from the PNP, PTJ, 
Immigration, Fiscales Courts, Labor, MFA, Customs, Youth, 
Women, Children and Family Affairs, ILO/IPEC, NGOs, and 
members of the local press. (Ref. C, N)  Department of 
Justice (DOJ) is scheduled to provide training to GOP 
officials in October 2004.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE 
TRAINING ON PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO ITS EMBASSIES AND 
CONSULATES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESTINATION OR 
TRANSIT COUNTRIES? Panama is not a country of origin for TIP 
victims.  DOES GOVERNMENT URGE THOSE EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES 
TO DEVELOP ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NGOS THAT SERVE 
TRAFFICKED VICTIMS? 
N/A, see above 
 
 
H.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS MEDICAL 
AID, SHELTER, OR FINANCIAL HELP, TO ITS REPATRIATED NATIONALS 
WHO ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING? N/A, Panama is not a country 
of origin. 
 
 
I.  WHICH NGOS, IF ANY, WORK WITH TRAFFICKED VICTIMS? 
ILO/IPEC (commercial sexual exploitation of minors) and Nueva 
Era en Salud (Sex Workers/Public Health).  The following NGOs 
do not have specific programs for TIP victims only but 
sponsor victim assistance programs.  Casa Esperanza 
(education/housing/nutrition for minors), Hogar Luisa McGrath 
(victims of incest/rape), Mujeres Coloneses en Camino 
(women\'s assistance programs).  There are a number of other 
NGOs with similar programs.  WHAT TYPE OF SERVICES DO THEY 
PROVIDE? WHAT SORT OF COOPERATION DO THEY RECEIVE FROM LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES?  Education, nutrition, health services and 
shelter.  Many provide counseling programs.  The GOP does not 
financially support these NGOS.  The government cooperates 
with their missions but a combined and more structured 
GOP/NGO victims referral system would improve TIP victim 
assistance. 
 
 
7.  (U)  Embassy point of contact for TIP issues is Political 
Officer John McIntyre (507) 207-7183, (F) 507-207-7418.  Time 
spent preparing this report: 60 hours.  Members of Embassy 
TIP working group spent between 2-10 hours reviewing this 
report. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  (SBU)  Panama, like the vast majority of nations 
(including the United States), suffers the ill effects of 
TIP.  While the magnitude of the problem is not nearly equal 
to that of familial sex abuse, violence against women and 
children, and drug abuse, the GOP has recognized that TIP 
must be addressed aggressively.  Like any nation with limited 
resources, there are a number of areas where efforts to 
combat TIP could be improved.  As noted in Reftel (C), 
improved training, increased victims assistance, and better 
laws are needed.  The GOP\'s ongoing efforts to combat TIP can 
be enhanced by USG material support and expertise.  The GOP 
is already a willing partner in USG efforts to stem the drug 
trade, money-laundering, and alien smuggling.  With better 
coordination of their efforts, the GOP and NGOs can ensure 
that Panama\'s TIP problem is a short term anomaly rather than 
a long term and growing blight.

Summary/Comment: Moving Along 
----------------------------- 
1. (SBU) New polls from two different not necessarily 
reliable sources are ranking presidential candidates in the 
usual order.  In the Assembly, legislators seeking to 
rejuvenate their rotten image have proposed forward-leaning 
reductions in their own privileges, but may lack the 
political will to push them through.  Charges by some of 
racist profiling in campaign propaganda, complaints by 
candidates that their billboards have been vandalized, and 
allegations that the Presidency has used public funds to 
support favorite candidates, have left Panama\'s Electoral 
Prosecutor with his hands full.  This campaign continues to 
be characterized by mudslinging and ad hominem attacks 
rather than by considered debate of key issues.  In part 
this reflects a real lack of ideological differences among 
the four Presidential candidates. End Summary/Comment. 
 
 
Poll margins vary, not rankings 
------------------------------- 
2. (U) The rankings of the four presidential candidates in 
public opinion polls has not changed since mid-2003.  PRD 
Candidate Torrijos continues to lead, followed by 
Solidarity Candidate Endara, with Arnulfista Aleman and 
Cambio Democratico Martinelli trailing well behind the 
other two.  This week, tabloids El Siglo and La Critica, 
the latter Panama\'s best-selling daily, released the 
following poll results: 
 
 
   CANDIATE                 Siglo  Critica 
   (Party) 
MARTIN TORRIJOS              39%     48% 
(Revolutionary Democratic) 
GUILLERMO ENDARA             23%     30% 
(Solidarity) 
JOSE MIGUEL ALEMAN           16%      6% 
(Arnulfista) 
RICARDO MARTINELLI           11%      6% 
(Democratic Change) 
 
 
3. (SBU) Educated Panamanians consider Panama\'s tabloids to 
be untrustworthy, and likewise consider their polls to be 
biased.  Such perceptions spring from several telling 
facts.  PSM/Sigma 2, which collects and analyzes poll data 
for La Critica, also does private polling for the PRD. 
Jaime A. Porcell, whose company collected data for El 
Siglo, is a longtime PRD sympathizer.  Finally, El Siglo 
President Ebrahim Asvat is a fixture in Martin Torrijos\' 
campaign team.  (COMMENT: Both polls show Torrijos winning 
handily, although the Siglo poll gauges Aleman\'s support at 
roughly double the level of any other poll we have seen. 
Emboffs are not persuaded by poll figures, aware that 1999 
public opinion polls identified Martin Torrijos as leading 
Mireya Moscoso until shortly before Election Day.  Embassy 
will report further analysis of the methodology for and 
credibility of Panama\'s public opinion polls septel.  END 
COMMENT) 
 
 
Solons propose pruning perks 
---------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Civil society pressure (intensified by front-page 
La Prensa investigative reporting) and pre-election 
calculations yielded bipartisan calls during a closed-door 
legislative session on March 2 to reduce legislative 
privileges.  A draft bill to reform legislative internal 
by-laws would allow legislators to import only one vehicle 
duty-free (instead of three) during their five-year term, 
capping exoneration at US$5,000, and require a three-year 
wait before the car could be resold.  Also, legislators\' 
two alternates (\"suplentes\") would no longer be entitled to 
diplomatic passports unless on official mission.  (COMMENT: 
Legislators may now import up to three cars duty-free with 
no maximum dollar limit and transfer them at any time to 
anyone.  The proposed reforms would help mollify criticism 
of Panama\'s legislators; however, Emboffs are skeptical 
that the reforms will pass, as are many Panamanians. END 
COMMENT.) 
 
 
Leave my ads alone 
------------------ 
5. (U) Candidates from all political parties have bombarded 
the Electoral Prosecutor\'s Office with complaints about 
vandalized campaign advertisements.  The previous volume of 
such complaints -mainly from candidates supporting 
Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara- pales in comparison 
with this week.  Arnulfista and MOLIRENA candidates 
complained to the media and electoral authorities that 
unidentified persons are destroying their billboards.  Some 
billboards have disappeared.  Vandals defaced others using 
black ink to cover the candidates\' faces.  One billboard 
was even shot several times with a handgun.  Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis announced that his office will 
investigate anyone accused of such crime and punish the 
guilty. 
 
 
No rest for Electoral Prosecutor 
-------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis is getting 
almost as much press coverage as the four Presidential 
candidates.  Since the campaign began, Solis has: 
 
 
---called hearings to review complaints about cooked 
registration books in the Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), 
eventually eliminating PLA from the 2004 race, 
---mediated a dispute between the Endara campaign and the 
Arnulfistas over the use of the image of deceased President 
and party namesake Arnulfo Arias, 
---investigated vandalism of political advertisements, 
---searched the Ministry of Labor to assess whether a 
legislative candidate was demoted for running with a non- 
GOP coalition party, and 
---announced that he will investigate whether official 
funds from the Ministry of the Presidency have been used 
illegally to fund campaigns for Arnulfista candidate Jose 
Miguel Aleman and/or turncoat legislator Carlos Afu. 
 
 
The President\'s Legal Slush Fund 
-------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) While Aleman denied GOP funds have entered his 
campaign, claiming that he has enough other money, Afu made 
no public comments.  Minister of the Presidency Mirna Pitti 
claimed she had nothing to hide.  Legally, Pitti has 30 
calendar days to disclose use of the funds from President 
Moscoso\'s \"secret allotment.\" (NOTE: This allotment, known 
in Spanish as the \"partida discrecional\" or \"partida 
discreta\" existed during the Endara Administration (1989- 
94) at a level of US$2 million per year.  President Ernesto 
Perez Balladares (1994-99) raised the stakes to US$6 
million, where they have since remained.  Unlike other 
government spending, use of these funds is neither pre- 
authorized nor audited post-expenditure.  Thus many civil 
society leaders have called for public release of expense 
records. End note) 
 
 
Racial profiling in PRD Ad 
-------------------------- 
8. (SBU) A TV advertisement for PRD-PP candidate Martin 
Torrijos offended several members of the Afro-Panamanian 
community.  The ad, relating concerns about citizen 
security, portrayed a black man shadowing two elderly 
Latino women.  Afro-Panamanian activist Alberto Barrow 
asserted that the ad gave the impression blacks are crime 
perpetrators and Latinos victims.  Barrow had a heated 
discussion March 3 on a live TV talk show with another 
black PRD leader Luis Gomez, who defended the ad.  The PRD 
convened a meeting between Barrow and ad producer Cesar 
Sanjur and then decided to modify the ad.  The new ad has 
already aired, minus the suspicious-looking black man.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (SBU) In the past ten days (March 1-9) the Panamanian 
government (GOP) organized an inter-agency anti-TIP working 
group, set into motion a 45-day action plan, launched a 
public awareness campaign, prepared tougher anti-TIP 
legislation, readied a victims hotline, and announced that it 
had identified members of TIP gangs and that arrests would 
soon follow.  In a public statement March 8, Minister of 
Justice and Government (MOGJ) Arnulfo Escalona said that he 
had ordered Immigration, the Panamanian National Police (PNP) 
and the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) to take \"energetic 
measures\" against TIP.  Legislative Assembly President Jacobo 
Salas predicted to POL Counselor March 3 that the Assembly 
would soon pass new anti-TIP legislation to include 
anti-child pornography, unimpeded police investigations, and 
stiffer sentencing requirements.  MOGJ Escalona met with DCM 
and POL Counselor March 5 to emphasize the GOP\'s wishes to 
fully cooperate and comply with G/TIP requirements.  We also 
learned on March 5 that PNP Director Carlos Bares had met 
several days before with Colombia\'s top police officials to 
discuss how the two countries should coordinate anti-TIP 
migration measures.  These events follow POL Counselor\'s 
March 1 meeting with Vice Foreign Minister (VFM) Nivia 
Rossana Castrellon, who has mobilized the GOP at its highest 
levels to focus on producing tangible anti-TIP results. 
Castrellon will meet PPC Director Paul Trivelli March 11 to 
discuss TIP, among other topics.  End Summary. 
 
 
Demarche to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs 
-------------------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) In an effort to focus GOP attention on TIP, POL 
Counselor met with VFM Castrellon March 1 to explain the 
annual G/TIP report and the likelihood that, in the 2003 
report (to appear in June 2004), Panama for the first time 
would be listed as out of compliance with minimum TIP 
standards. 
 
 
POL Counselor emphasized that to improve Panama\'s anti-TIP 
stance, GOP officials should 
 
 
A) make anti-TIP public statements; 
B) launch a public awareness campaign; 
C) institute a victims\' shelter and restitution program; 
D) redouble efforts to arrest and prosecute traffickers; 
E) pass tougher TIP legislation; 
F) work toward regional anti-TIP cooperation; and 
G) form an inter-agency working group to improve coordination. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Castrellon assured POL Counselor that combating TIP 
is a top GOP and a personal priority.  She said she would 
inform the GOP agencies with the power to influence TIP, 
especially MOGJ which oversees Immigration, the PNP, the 
Panama Judicial Police (the PTJ has the lead in TIP cases) of 
our discussion.  (Comment: Castrellon evidently moved 
immediately to mobilize the GOP.  PolOffs overheard her 
several hours later telling Panama\'s Immigration chief, \"We 
need to meet very soon to discuss an urgent matter.\"  MOGJ 
Escalona contacted DCM McMullen shortly thereafter to request 
a meeting to discuss TIP.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Demarche to Legislative Assembly President 
------------------------------------------ 
4.  (SBU) On March 3, POL Counselor met with Legislative 
Assembly President Salas to explain Panama\'s likely status in 
the USG\'s 2003 TIP report, to brief him on USG TIP minimum 
requirements, and to give him a copy of the USG\'s model TIP 
law.  Salas, a member of the Arnulfista Party, introduced 
fellow Arnulfista legislators Francisco Aleman and Jose 
Blandon, Jr., author of the anti-TIP law now before the 
legislature.  Salas explained that there is no opposition to 
the law and predicted it would pass by April.  The bill began 
as anti-child pornography legislation last October, Blandon 
explained, but since has become a more frankly anti-TIP bill. 
 For instance, the new law will permit the police to 
investigate TIP crimes without having to wait for a victim\'s 
statement, which the police now do.  Examining our model law, 
Blandon commented that he would include as many provisions 
from it as possible. 
 
 
Anti-TIP Legislation 
-------------------- 
5.  (SBU) Speaking with a legislative staffer March 8, 
Embassy political specialist reported that the bill before 
the Assembly will include the following provisions: 
 
 
A) The police will no longer need a victim\'s statement to 
investigate TIP crimes; 
B) Victims who make police statements will have immunity from 
prosecution; 
C) Victims will be indemnified; 
D) Sexual tourism will be penalized; 
E) Increased sanctions for TIP crimes; and 
F) Anti-child pornography will be penalized, especially 
internet child porn. 
 
 
The legislation is due for a second debate soon.  It can 
become law only after three debates, so further improvements 
could be made before then, the legislators said.  (Comment: 
Embassy political specialist learned from a MOGJ source that 
MOGJ is drafting a more general anti-TIP legislative 
proposal.  Embassy will ensure that the drafters have access 
to the USG\'s model law.  The GOP also has proposed changes to 
Immigration statutes to eliminate the \"Alternadora\" visa, 
used by entertainers and sex workers.  End comment.) 
 
 
Meeting with MOGJ and PNP 
------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) DCM McMullen and POL Counselor met with PNP chief 
Bares, National Security Chairman Ramiro Jarvis, and MOGJ 
Escalona on Friday, March 5, at Escalona\'s request.  POL 
Counselor briefed the officials on minimum G/TIP requirements 
and on the likelihood that in June 2004 Panama would be 
listed as out of compliance with minimum standards for the 
first time.  Escalona informed us that that week the GOP had 
formed a high-level anti-TIP working group to coordinate 
anti-TIP initiatives among MFA, MOGJ, the Legislative 
Assembly, Immigration, and Ministry of Youth, Family, and 
Minors and had launched a 45-day action plan to produce rapid 
results.  PNP Chief Bares said he had just returned from a 
visit to Colombia where he had met with top Colombian police 
officials to discuss how Panama and Colombia would coordinate 
cross-border anti-TIP activities.  Escalona said Panama 
President Mireya Moscoso, as a woman head of state, was 
particularly troubled that Panama had not yet taken effective 
anti-TIP actions and therefore could be cited in the G/TIP 
report.  \"Just tell us what you want us to do on TIP and 
we\'ll do it,\" Escalona said.  Bares informed EmbOff March 9 
that he had appointed a retired PNP officer to head an 
internal anti-TIP group within the PNP. 
 
 
Information from Dominican Republic 
----------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) Saying that Embassy was disturbed by reports from 
the Dominican Republic Foreign Ministry via G/TIP that a 
Panamanian diplomatic official was facilitating the 
trafficking of Dominican women to Panama (See Ref B), DCM 
passed the official\'s name to Escalona.  Glancing at the 
name, Escalona replied that the official in question, former 
Consul General Otilio Miranda Melendez, had been fired and 
left the DR months ago.  Escalona did not specify why Miranda 
had been fired.  (Comment: Further research by Embassy 
political specialist revealed that Miranda had been fired six 
months ago on September 3, 2003 by Executive Decree 211. 
Escalona has asked Foreign Minister Arias to update MFA\'s 
webpage which still lists Miranda as CG.  End Comment.) 
 
 
MOGJ Acts 
--------- 
8.  (SBU) Following up on the March 5 meeting, POL Counselor 
spoke with MOGJ Escalona on Monday, March 8 to reiterate that 
while Friday\'s news regarding anti-TIP GOP activities was 
very good, concrete and public actions (such as statements, 
arrests, victim sanctuaries, etc.) are much better.  Escalona 
replied that he expected to make a public statement on TIP 
that day and that arrests would follow.  Escalona, 
accompanied by PNP Bares, appeared later in a March 8 news 
conference in which he announced to the public media, 
including television news, that the GOP had ordered a series 
of \"energetic measures\" against TIP and would investigate and 
break up TIP rings, pass more effective anti-TIP legislation, 
and collaborate with other countries to close down TIP. 
Escalona said a new victims hotline is operating and he 
encouraged victims to come forward to denounce their 
tormentors. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9.  (SBU) The GOP has introduced, in little over a week, a 
breathtaking array of anti-TIP plans and measures, which will 
make parts of our G/TIP report input obsolete (Ref A).  Our 
message on TIP has clearly gotten through to the GOP.  We 
will report changes and new developments on TIP as they 
occur.  Embassy will remain vigilant to ensure that the new 
GOP measures and actions bring real results.

1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified, please 
treat accordingly. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  Panamanian Vice Minister for Foreign Trade Romel 
Adames told Econ Chief on March 8 that Panama would strongly 
support the USG position within the G-14 and moving forward 
with agreement on procedures for plurilateral negotiations. 
Adames added that at the February TNC Panama was prepared to 
\"sign on\" to the plurilateral, but understood why things were 
not there yet. 
 
 
3. (SBU)  However, with regard to the plurilateral, he was 
clearly concerned about three aspects.  First, overlap with 
the upcoming U.S.- Panama FTA negotiations.  He noted that 
some in Panama are concerned that \"if we go too far in the 
FTAA plurilateral there is no reason for the FTA,\" but added 
that everything would be open in the bilateral.  He was also 
not keen on having the possibility of \"free riders\" in areas 
such as government procurement.  Secondly, he expressed 
concern about a Caricom provision whereby that organization 
would receive an exclusion for certain EU subsidies, adding 
that this created a systemic problem if you make exceptions 
by name, but seemed open to putting such coverage in an 
annex. (Note: on the subsidies in question, he did not know 
what products they covered and requested clarification). 
Lastly, he expressed concern about a U.S. proposal whereby 
the U.S. would reserve the right to reimpose export subsidies 
if a country allowed product carrying export subsidies in. 
He said this would create a problem if Panama were to remove 
tariff barriers.  He added, \"we understand your concerns, can 
you see ours?\" 
 
 
4.  (SBU) VM Adames said that because of civil society 
outreach in Panama on the upcoming bilateral, he might not 
arrive in Puebla until March 19.  Nonetheless, the U.S. could 
count on Panama at the TNC meeting.

SUBJECT: PANAMA OFFERS BETTER HIGH-VALUE TRANSIT GUARANTEE 
 
REF: A. 03 PANAMA 2201 
     B. 03 PANAMA 470 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Christopher J. McMullen for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Panama\'s unilateral alternative to the USG\'s 
bilateral MOU proposal may be a better force protection 
guarantee for US military high-value transits (HVTs).  After 
Embassy receives actual GOP language, probably in one to two 
months, we will analyze it and report our conclusions and 
recommendations for further action.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) After successfully implementing a US-Panama MOU for 
USG vessels visiting Panamanian ports (ref B), Embassy 
cleared with USG agencies a second force protection MOU to 
cover HVTs (ref A), to be signed under chief of mission (COM) 
authority.  This MOU was presented on November 13, 2003, to 
the GOP\'s Public Security and National Defense Council 
(Consejo) Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis and Senior 
Advisor for Maritime Security Marta Achurra, who are 
coordinating the many GOP agencies with equities in this 
issue.  (Note: Unlike the port visits MOU, for which Panama\'s 
Maritime Service (SMN) was the only GOP negotiator and is the 
sole point of contact for implementation, HVT force 
protection involves all GOP security-related agencies 
(Consejo, Police (PNP), Air Service (SAN), Maritime Service 
(SMN) and Institutional Protection Service (SPI)), as well as 
the Foreign Ministry (MFA) and the Canal Authority (ACP), 
which is not under the Consejo\'s chain of command).  End 
note.) 
 
 
3. (C) On January 27, EmbOffs met with GOP agency 
representatives led by Consejo\'s Achurra, who now says that a 
separate bilateral HVT MOU would be slow to conclude and more 
cumbersome to implement.  Furthermore, the ACP is loath to be 
included in what would be a primarily security-specific 
document, wanting to avoid any charges of \"mission creep.\" 
Instead, the GOP has countered with two unilateral documents, 
first floated at the January 27 meeting.  Consejo plans to 
present to Embassy by mid-April (1) currently applicable ACP 
regulations, amended to include USG requirements that are 
directly under the ACP\'s operational control and (2) a new 
GOP interagency MOU, codifying relevant portions of Consejo\'s 
threat matrix security SOP.  Alternatively, the latter may be 
codified via an executive decree, though the process would be 
lengthy and may not be completed by the September 1 change in 
government. 
 
 
4. (C) The GOP has also raised other concerns regarding USG 
force protection requests.  First, USG armed \"escort units\" 
are illegal under Panama\'s Constitution; only the PPF can 
provide security within Panamanian territory.  If security 
procedures are guaranteed in a unilateral instrument, as the 
GOP proposes, determination of USG responsibilities is moot. 
Such units become \"auxiliary vessels,\" which will arrive with 
the high value vessel and will be granted expeditious transit 
per the Neutrality Treaty.  Auxiliary vessels have the right 
to transit with their personnel and weapons and have the 
international right of self-defense, which concurrently 
provides force protection for the high-value vessel.  Second, 
the GOP noted that the level of force protection requested in 
our draft MOU is more than currently provided for US military 
HVTs, e.g., the USG would like to see water, land and air 
patrols commence earlier and have GOP quick reaction forces 
on alert.  These services will increase the cost of a 
transit.  (Note: Though not yet mentioned by the GOP, the PPF 
services may also need equipment, training and other 
assistance to be able to guarantee force protection.  End 
note.)  Embassy requested that the GOP inform the USG of the 
cost of each component of the force protection procedures to 
be considered along with other factors for our determination 
of services the USG needs.  Third, the ACP noted that it has 
no authority to order another GOP agency to take action 
during an HVT; its jurisdiction over the transit does not 
extend to security for the transit.  Embassy does not expect 
a military-like chain-of-command and understands competing 
jurisdictions, but does expect the ACP to take full 
responsibility for an HVT, coordinating with PPF services, 
possibly with the bureaucratic assistance of the Consejo. 
Such services are provided to all other ACP customers, 
including high interest vessels that create similar security 
concerns. 
 
 
5. (C) Embassy accepts the GOP\'s counterproposal to guarantee 
force protection for US military HVTs with two unilateral 
Panamanian commitments vice a bilateral MOU.  In many 
respects, because our proposed MOU would have been negotiated 
under COM authority and therefore legally unenforceable, the 
counterproposal is a better guarantee.  The ACP operational 
regulations can only be changed by its Board of Directors, a 
group concerned about its business relationship with valued 
clients and its global reputation as a premier service 
provider.  These regulations, once approved, are unlikely to 
be altered capriciously.  The GOP interagency security MOU 
will be based on Consejo threat analyses and planning, which 
has already been vetted and agreed upon.  This MOU, once 
approved, is unlikely to be altered easily.  Both documents 
will be given to Embassy for its concurrence.  Embassy has 
been clear with the GOP about our principal goals in these 
negotiations: (1) The USG wants force protection procedures 
to be regularized and verifiable; (2) As many protections as 
possible requested in the original USG proposal should be 
provided; and (3) Embassy\'s Force Protection Officer, who is 
Embassy\'s Chief of the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) as 
US Defense Representative in-country, is to have one GOP 
point of contact to coordinate both operational and security 
issues of an HVT.

COUNTDOWN #6: 7 WEEKS TO GO 
 
REF:  A. PANAMA 0564 
      B. PANAMA 0465 
 
 
Summary: Observers, Opacity and a Pledge 
---------------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU)  With less than two months to go, electoral 
issues are finally gaining prominence in Panama\'s media. 
Panamanian and foreign observers organize for the May 2 
elections.  Embassy plans to coordinate with OAS and 
Ombudsman\'s Office observers to ensure broad coverage of 
key polling areas on election day (although the Embassy has 
made clear that we are not official observers).  Ombudsman 
Juan A. Tejada and Electoral prosecutor Gerardo Solis 
demanded an accounting of the Presidency\'s discretionary 
funds, but President Moscoso refused to cooperate.  A lack 
of Party support and dissension in the ranks marred the 
signature ceremony for Political Party youth leaders\' 
Electoral Ethics Pact and highlighted weaknesses in the 
Endara campaign, which has lost some steam.  End Summary. 
 
 
Electoral Tribunal in high gear 
------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU)  Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes 
announced on a live TV talk show that 20,124 Panamanians 
have received Electoral Tribunal training for Election Day. 
Mostly between 18-25 years old, these individuals will 
supervise voting centers and staff individual precincts 
(called voting tables in Spanish).  Each receives $40 for 
working from 6:00 a.m. until past midnight.  Electoral 
Tribunal authorities nationwide had a closed-door meeting 
over the weekend in Chiriqui Province for one final 
discussion of the \"Plan General de Elecciones\" (Overall 
Election Plan).  Among other issues, they discussed how to 
interpret the formula for allocating legislative seats 
based on residual votes and voting for the handicapped. 
 
 
Embassy, OAS election observers 
------------------------------- 
3.  (SBU)  Embassy Panama will field 12-15 two-person non- 
official observer teams on election weekend (May 1-2) to 
report conditions in key areas.  Likewise, the Defensoria 
del Pueblo (Ombudsman\'s Office) and the Organization for 
American States (OAS) plan to organize official observer 
teams for Panama\'s elections.  OAS Country Director Hernan 
Hurtado Prem extended the tin cup to Embassy in a March 8 
letter detailing proposed OAS plans to observe Panama\'s 
elections and a $129,888 budget.  Embassy has repeatedly 
turned down Electoral Tribunal and Washington-based 
electoral NGOs\' funding requests, noting confidence in 
Panama\'s electoral system.  EmbOffs are studying how to 
coordinate with OAS and Defensoria observers to ensure the 
best possible coverage of the country, while avoiding 
financial commitments or the public perception that Embassy 
teams are official observers. 
 
 
4. (SBU) The Defensoria\'s Director for International 
Affairs Max Lopez and Director for Education and Human 
Rights Promotion Cesar Solano advised Embassy that they 
plan to field 300 Panamanian observers for the May 2 
general elections, an ambitious plan considering human, 
financial, and logistical constraints.  Also, Ombudsman 
Juan A. Tejada will use Electoral Tribunal funds to host 
Latin American Ombudsmen during the elections.  Tejada 
estimates that between 7-10 Ombudsmen will observe 
elections in remote areas of Panama.  Solano plans to meet 
Electoral Tribunal authorities to discuss the scope of 
observation.  Like Embassy Panama, the Defensoria will pay 
special attention to the Ngobe-Bugle (indigenous) 
Reservation, which will be electing legislators for the 
first time. 
 
 
Moscoso says mind your own beeswax 
---------------------------------- 
5.  (SBU)  Controversy over how President Moscoso is using 
her discretionary budget allotment continues.  Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis met privately at the Presidential 
Palace with Economy and Finance Minister Norberto Delgado, 
Minister of the Presidency Mirna Pitti and Comptroller 
General Alvin Weeden.  Solis confirmed media accounts to 
PolOffs that he requested the GOP provide him a \"finiquito\" 
(a list of check recipients and justification for the 
checks) in lieu of a full-blown inspection.  Comptroller 
Weeden criticized Solis, a Perez Balladares (PRD)-appointee 
for playing politics. (NOTE: Solis\' father, Menalco Solis, 
manages Solidarity Party Presidential Candidate Guillermo 
Endara\'s campaign.  Some have alleged the money was used to 
renovate former Minister of the Presidency Yvonne Young\'s 
house. END NOTE.)  Solis added that he believes the GOP 
will seek a way to remove him from office for abuse of 
authority, knowing that its control of the Supreme Court 
will allow them to quash appeals. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Two officials from the Defensoria del Pueblo 
(Ombudsman\'s Office) predicted that Moscoso would refuse to 
publish her use of the discretional funds as the Defensoria 
requested under Panama\'s Transparency Law.  Providing the 
requested information would set a precedent that political 
heavyweights find threatening.  Ombudsman Juan A. Tejada 
said after waiting the 30 days that the law grants Minister 
Pitti to release the information, he will submit a habeas 
data request to the Supreme Court.  Defensoria staff 
believes the GOP-controlled Supreme Court would deny such a 
request. 
 
 
Would Martinelli vote for opponent? 
----------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU)  In a 30-minute TV interview by well-known boxing 
commentator Juan Carlos Tapia during his popular program 
called The Best of Boxing, Cambio Democratico presidential 
candidate Ricardo Martinelli stated that if he were not 
running himself, he would vote for Arnulfista candidate 
Jose Miguel Aleman.  Surprised when asked, Martinelli\'s 
first asked if voiding his vote was an option.  When Tapia 
said no and pressed him, Martinelli said he would vote for 
Aleman, but only if he distances himself from President 
Moscoso, a difficult prospect for most Panamanians to 
imagine.  Martinelli\'s campaign manager told PolOff that 
Martinelli chose the lesser threat Aleman because whereas 
CD\'s internal \"likely voter\" polls show Aleman at 11.5%, 
Torrijos is at 50%.  Martinelli insisted during the 
interview that he and his associates are not \"traditional 
politicians\", but businessmen and managers who want to make 
a difference.  As in the past, Martinelli criticized 
traditional parties and recent public opinion polls. 
 
 
Youth pledge to play fair - kind of 
----------------------------------- 
8.  (SBU)  On Wednesday, representatives of the Political 
Parties Youth Forum signed an electoral ethics pact 
promising to promote an open, transparent, democratic and 
participatory May 2 election.  The Pact explicitly endorses 
the Electoral Tribunal.  Promoters hoped to use the 
disorganized and poorly attended event to foment a more 
active and influential political role for youth leaders 
despite snubs from the older generation in their own 
parties.  Representatives from all legally registered 
political parties except the Solidarity Party signed the 
pact.  Martin Torrijos (PRD) was the only Presidential 
Candidate who showed up, but he departed before the event 
began, leaving PRD legislator Hector Aleman behind to 
attend to the youth.  Cambio Democratico (CD) First Vice 
Presidential candidate Roberto Henriquez also attended.  No 
ranking representatives of Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman participated.  Solidarity Party youth leaders didn\'t 
participate because they believe the Electoral Tribunal 
(ET) is too responsive to partisan pressures.  Only PRD, 
MOLIRENA, and CD youth showed up in large numbers. 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  By boycotting the event, Solidarity 
is snubbing the Tribunal for what Solidarity believes is 
the Tribunal\'s favoritism to the Arnulfistas.  For 
instance, giving President Moscoso sole rights to the image 
of former President Arnulfo Arias.  Panamanian analysts 
believe the Endara team\'s attacks on the Electoral Tribunal 
only serve to highlight weaknesses in his campaign.  Print 
media have reported recent defections from Solidarity to 
other political camps as significant symptoms of campaign 
sickness in the Endara camp.  Also several influential 
supporters have either distanced themselves from Endara or 
abandoned his campaign, disgusted by the domineering yet 
clumsy tactics of campaign manager Menalco Solis.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
 
1. (C)  Still leading in the polls, Revolutionary Democratic 
Party (PRD) presidential candidate Martin Torrijos is 
starting to consider what his administration might look like, 
well aware of our interest in key PRD appointments.  Meeting 
with PolOff, senior advisor and \"friend of Martin\" Ubaldino 
Real, said he is confident that Torrijos can control his 
party\'s factions and assured us of continued close 
cooperation if Torrijos wins.  Real added that Torrijos has 
dropped plans to appoint a former uniformed officer to head 
Panama\'s National Police (PNP), and that he had recently 
journeyed to Taiwan to assure Taipei that Torrijos plans no 
change in diplomatic relations. 
 
 
------------------- 
The Envelope Please 
------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) On March 2, PolOff met with Ubaldino Real, chief 
financial officer and senior advisor for Revolutionary 
Democratic Party (PRD) Martin Torrijos\' presidential 
campaign.  According to Real, PRD internal polls show 
Torrijos 15% ahead of Solidaridad presidential candidate 
Guillermo Endara.  (Note: This tracks with published polls, 
with the most recent showing Torrijos nearly 18 points ahead 
of second-place Endara,  See ref A.  End note.)  The PRD 
believes it can win (with its Partido Popular ally) 40 
legislative seats, giving it a one-vote majority in the 
78-seat Legislative Assembly.  Real predicted that the PRD 
would win 35 spots and coalition partner Popular Party would 
win 5 spots. 
 
 
3.  (C) Real said that, until recently, Torrijos\' had been 
unwilling to concentrate on anything but the campaign-- 
partly out of fear of jinxing his chances-- but added that 
the two had begun to \"pencil in\" names for an estimated 200 
high-level GOP positions (ministers, vice ministers, 
directors, commissioners, ambassadors and consuls general). 
Real (a naturalized AmCit and close personal friend of 
Martin) is considering a standing offer from Torrijos to be 
Minister of the Presidency, a position similar to the 
President\'s Chief of Staff.  Real was well aware of the GOP 
posts \"of particular interest to the United States\"-- 
Executive Secretary of the Public Security and National 
Defense Council (Consejo), Minister of Government and Justice 
(MOGJ), and the Directors of Panama\'s Police (PNP), Air 
Service (SAN), Maritime Service (SMN), Institutional 
Protection Service (SPI), Maritime Authority (AMP) and 
Immigration (among others, such as Foreign Minister, Minister 
of Commerce, and Ambassador to Washington). 
 
 
---------------------- 
Balancing PRD Factions 
---------------------- 
 
 
4. (U) Real dismissed speculation that once in power Torrijos 
will have difficulty balancing the PRD\'s three competing 
factions-- \"old guard\" (about 40% of the party), \"new guard\" 
(about 60% of the party) and \"friends of Martin.\" \"This is 
Martin\'s party,\" and he will make the choices.  (Comment: The 
campaign is heavily skewed in favor of \"new guard\" and 
\"friends of Martin,\" reflecting the shift in power from 
former President Perez-Balladares.  End Comment.)  Real 
emphasized that unlike with Torrijos\' 1999 run or 
Perez-Balladares\' 1994-1999 term, the PRD presidential 
candidate has not had to bargain with the various factions 
before turning to the general election.  Nevertheless, Real 
conceded that Torrijos will have to engage in some horse 
trading to placate factions or individuals who might 
otherwise interfere in important policy areas.  PolOff 
expressed the hope that positions \"of particular interest to 
the United States\" will not be involved in this patronage 
politicking. 
 
 
--------------------- 
Jump on the Bandwagon 
--------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) Several members of Panama\'s Arab community have 
recently expressed interest in donating to the Torrijos 
campaign, Real said, but he has stalled, claiming the 
campaign is flush with money (which is not the case).  Real 
said the campaign is avoiding donations from \"suspicious\" 
individuals for fear of making \"a mistake.\" 
------------ 
Backpedaling 
------------ 
 
 
6. (U) Real commented that Torrijos was unlikely to push hard 
for his proposed institutional reforms to Panama\'s Public 
Force (PPF) and other public and national security agencies 
(ref B), such as appointing career officers as PPF service 
directors.  In hindsight, Real said, those proposals were 
politically ill-conceived and not fully thought out.  Real 
confirmed that Daniel Delgado, the author of the proposals, 
still leads the campaign\'s security policy team, but was 
unsure whether Delgado\'s time and efforts would translate 
into an administration position. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Don\'t Sign the FTA Without US 
----------------------------- 
 
 
7. (U) Real fully expects a Torrijos administration to 
conclude a US-Panama free trade agreement (FTA) and to be 
involved in the negotiations.  It would be \"irresponsible\" 
for the Moscoso Administration to sign a bilateral FTA before 
the September 1 inauguration, he said.  Real implied that 
Alejandro \"Andy\" Ferrer, Jr. would lead the new 
administration\'s FTA negotiators.  (Note: Also mentioned as a 
possible foreign minister in a Torrijos administration, 
Ferrer negotiated Panama\'s accession to the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), serving as Panama\'s Special Ambassador to 
the WTO and as Vice Foreign Minister.  He has a law degree 
from the University of Michigan and is one of the stars in 
Torrijos\' progressive pro-business faction.  End note.) 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
Taiwan: Status Quo Will Continue 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) Just back from a 2-day trip to Taiwan, Real said that 
the Taiwanese had pressured Torrijos for months to send a 
high-level, personal representative to allay their concerns 
and respond to persistent rumors that Torrijos will switch 
diplomatic recognition to China if he wins.  Real was 
instructed to assure Taiwan unequivocally that a Torrijos 
administration would maintain the status quo (ref C). 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
9.  (C) The Torrijos team is well aware of our interest in 
certain high-level PRD appointments, and we anticipate having 
more intensive discussions on that topic after the May 2 
election.  On the FTA and on other important bilateral issues 
(such as security), Embassy is making plans with Department 
to brief transition teams from the victorious party.  From 
the perspective in Panama, we believe it\'s unlikely that FTA 
talks could be wrapped up before September 1.  Torrijos\' 
decision not to carry out his publicly announced plan to 
reform the security services (which was not well received 
among the electorate because it could have centralized too 
much power over the security forces) or to appoint a former 
uniformed officer to head the PNP were welcome moves.  On the 
other hand, the fact that he delivered a less than fully 
cleared speech suggests that those who charge that Torrijos 
allows others to put words in his mouth may have a point.

SUBJECT: STATUS OF FORMER USG PROPERTIES IN THE PANAMA 
CANAL ZONE--A MIXED RECORD OF SUCCESS 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Panama,s Interoceanic Region Authority 
(ARI) is responsible for converting former USG property in 
the Panama Canal area to private and commercial use.  It has 
had a number of significant successes, and current and future 
investment in these \"reverted\" areas could total $2.5 
billion.  Even so, ARI is plagued by slow bureaucracy, 
accusations of corruption, and ham-handedness in planning, 
which have caused numerous investor disputes and complaints, 
while significant portions of the lands remain undeveloped. 
Despite its problems, ARI has certainly had a positive effect 
on Panama,s economy, but much remains to be done in the 
remaining two years of its mandate.  End Summmary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
A Huge Development Goal: Former USG Facilities and Lands 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Charged with marketing former U.S. military bases 
in the former Canal Zone that reverted to the GoP under the 
terms of the 1977 Carter-Torrijos treaty and negotiating 
deals to convert them to productive civilian use, ARI manages 
59,300 hectares of land (1 hectare equals 2.47 acres).  Some 
46,000ha are zoned and set aside for environmental protection 
and forestry projects.  Of the remaining 13,300ha, 4,500ha 
are in housing developments and 8,800ha are commercially 
developable.  ARI also controls 13,573 former USG structures, 
including 8,584 houses and 1082 commercially developable 
buildings, plus 3,907 \"other\" units such as storage tanks. 
There has been no clear methodology to calculate the total 
value of the structures, and overestimation of their 
functional value and investor interest led some experts to 
conclude in 1999 that the reverted areas\' buildings were 
worth an improbable $30 billion, though now the GoP uses a 
more modest $5 billion figure, not accounting for 
depreciation. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
ARI Has Made Significant Advances Converting the Property 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
3.  (SBU) As of May 2003, private enterprise has invested or 
signed contracts to invest approximately $1.5 billion in the 
reverted areas, with a projected additional $1 billion more 
through 2006.  The maritime industry leads the pack with $771 
million in current investment, followed by infrastructure 
projects at $164 million and tourism at $130 million. 
Businesses in the reverted areas employ 52,000 workers--a 
three-fold increase since the USG relinquished control of the 
Canal, according to ARI.  In the maritime sector 
particularly, the new investment has had a significant 
impact.  Container ports such as Manzaniilo International 
Terminal (MIT- owned by Stevedoring Services of America) and 
Evergreen on the Atlantic side, and Panama Ports on the 
Pacific have all averaged more than $200 million in 
investment with plans for more.  Whereas in 1994 ports in 
Panama moved 400,000 containers, capacity in 2003 was 2.8 
million, and capacity may reach 4 million containers by 2006. 
 Investment in cruise ship ports on the Atlantic and Pacific 
entrances totals $100 million. In the 2002-2003 season, a 
total of 145 cruise ships made port calls with 160,000 
passengers visiting Panama. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The City of Knowledge, based at the former Ft. 
Clayton, is a business and technology incubator.  Currently 
some 40 companies focused on research, telecommunications, 
software development have set up shop there.  In addition, 
Canada,s McGill University grad school labs, UNICEF and UNDP 
regional headquarters, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research 
Institute have offices there.  Companies on-site receive 
sizeable tax breaks, duty free import of goods, and exemption 
from income tax. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Fort Amador at the Pacific entrance of the Canal is 
ARI\'s most visible and clearly successful project.  It has 
seen $140 million in investment so far, and the useable 
terrain is 90% occupied.  In addition to the cruise ship 
port, the development includes four hotels, two marinas, 
multiple restaurants and shops plus a biodiversity museum 
partnered with the Smithsonian.  A convention center that 
anchors the development was the site of the Miss Universe 
pageant this past May.  But success doesn,t stop there- the 
former Albrook air base is now Panama City\'s domestic airport 
as well as the home to a multi-million dollar  international 
bus terminal.  A new $100 million shopping mall is about to 
open as well.  Other facilities throughout the reverted areas 
include the ecotourism-based Gamboa Rainforest Resort, and 
the five-star Melia Panama Canal Hotel on the site of the 
former School of the Americas. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Unfortunately the Success Belies Serious Investment Problems 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Numbers work both ways, however.  Almost all of 
ARI,s success stories date from before the formal turnover 
in 1999 or immediately after.  A key indicator of ARI,s 
slowing success is its net revenue contribution to the GoP-- 
income from concession fees and property sales minus 
operating costs and investments--which has totaled a paltry 
$100 million from July 2000 to July 2003.  Further, there 
were 323 property transfers for a total of $40 million in 
2000, but in the period January-July 2003, ARI approved only 
48 property transfers worth a total of $3 million--a mere 
fraction of the 2000 figure.  By one estimate, 70% of the 
former USG housing lies vacant in a country where 41% of the 
population lives in poverty and in substandard housing 
conditions. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Investors are generally critical of ARI,s 
performance, complaining of bureaucratic delays and failure 
to follow through on investor interest.  And though no 
smoking gun has ever been discovered, there are persistent 
charges that ARI officials are corrupt, requiring kickback 
\"fees\" on concessions that are approved.  Symbolic of these 
difficulties, the Embassy currently monitors six separate 
U.S. investor disputes that involve ARI.  For example, 
MIT--touted by ARI as a major success--has been trying to 
expand its operations by purchasing land adjacent to its 
current concession, but ARI has consistently overpriced the 
value of the property than its commercial value and has 
forced MIT to shelve the project.  Florida State University, 
resident in Panama for over 40 years, has unsuccessfully 
sought to purchase its leased property from ARI.  Again, 
reneging on a previous agreement with FSU, ARI revalued and 
overpriced the concession.  As a result, FSU is seriously 
considering leaving Panama. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) In another project called the Bridge of the 
Americas Cultural Center, ARI delayed granting the concession 
to a U.S. investor for over two years, and even then in a 
much-reduced form, while prime areas of the original project 
were awarded to a relative of the current Colon Free Zone 
manager.  ARI officials granted a marina concession at Ft. 
Amador that trespasses on a Ministry of Economy and Finance 
license that could potentially cause serious damage to Global 
Crossing,s intercontinental fiber-optic cable and hinder 
telephone and internet connection between North and South 
America.  Anecdotally, Econoffs have heard of individual 
homebuyers who have paid over half the value of the house 
they purchased and after several years of delays still do not 
have a title.  The concerns are not isolated to foreign 
investors--ARI has asked the GoP,s National Maritime Service 
(SMN) to move from its current site at the former 
Caribbean-side Ft. Sherman which ARI controls and views as a 
potentially lucrative tourism development.  While 
negotiations are ongoing and the future SMN base will most 
likely be of similar size and utility, initially many worried 
that ARI was foregoing the importance of Canal security for 
economic expediency. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Expectations/Pressures Result in \"Grand Scheme\" Thinking 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
9.  (SBU) Early successes have unfortunately led to 
unrealistic expectations about what ARI can accomplish and 
exacerbated pressure on ARI to produce visible results 
leading up to the 2004 Presidential elections.  As a result, 
ARI has made a number of inconsistent decisions and resource 
allocations that appear more questionable than those made a 
few years ago.  Indeed, ARI appears to favor a series of 
\"grand scheme\" projects, while small projects are being 
rebuffed and hence no investment momentum is being created. 
As an example, ARI has taken an \"all or nothing\" approach to 
develop the former Howard Air Base for $400 million. 
 
 
10.  (SBU) Tenders for Howard as one giant development have 
closed without bidders, and several other concepts for use 
have been stillborn.  Only in March of this year did ARI 
succeed in attracting a Dell Computer Call Center to Howard 
as the anchor of a proposed multimodal-shipping hub.  A GoP 
proposal on September 5 to the Legislative Assembly to turn 
to turn Howard into an Economic Development Zone has 
generated howls of protest from the Colon Free Zone about an 
unbalanced legal framework.  Worsening the situation, ARI has 
approved construction of several high-rise buildings near 
Howard that could obstruct the landing approach to the 
airstrip on the former base, which could inhibit that aspect 
of development altogether. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
COMMENT: Troubled victories, confused priorities, unclear 
future 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
11.  (SBU) Clearly, the reverted areas have been an economic 
boon to Panama, and there is significant potential to develop 
the remaining areas that haven,t been auctioned.  In ARI,s 
defense, no government agency could have been completely 
prepared for the massive tidal wave of property and 
infrastructure transferred just before the December 1999 
handover.  Further, some projects are very tough to 
adjudicate quickly, often needing to pass muster by multiple 
GoP agencies--valuations approved by the Comptroller, 
environmental impact statements by the Environmental 
Authority, port improvements by the Maritime Authority, etc. 
Even so, investor disgruntlement and accusations of 
corruption are tough to ignore.  Current investors complain 
of serious problems and potential investors find their ideas 
ignored while ARI pursues grandiose development plans.  It is 
important to remember that the revertes areas include 
significant capital investments by the USG--investments that 
were handed to the GoP for free, and that any conversion to 
private hands is pure profit for ARI. 
 
 
12.  (SBU) Perhaps most importantly, ARI,s mandate ends on 
December 31, 2005.  With substantial land and infrastructure 
yet to be transferred to private hands, ARI would have much 
to accomplish in such a short period of time--a goal that it 
is unlikely to achieve.  However, Panama,s Legislative 
Assembly has made no move to extend the mandate, and ARI,s 
future is unclear.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: AMBASSADOR ARCOS\' VISIT TO PANAMA 
 
 
REF: PANAMA 325 
 
 
 This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
1. (U) I warmly welcome your March 23-25 visit to Panama. 
You will have the opportunity to reiterate USG appreciation 
for the ongoing maritime security cooperation between our two 
countries, and to press for continuing focus on this as well 
as aviation security (and increasingly cruise ship security). 
 Your visit highlights our governments\' mutual interest in 
the strategic issues of counterterrorism capabilities, 
combating international criminal networks, and expanding 
trade and investment.  Designation for Panama as a \"distant 
foreign port\" under the Passenger Vessels Services Act 
(PVSA), possible inclusion of Panama\'s ports in the DHS 
Container Security Initiative (CSI), and upcoming 
negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with 
the US will reign paramount in the minds of many of your 
interlocutors.  Cancellation of visas of corrupt public 
officials may also arise.  It is worth noting that Panama was 
an early member of the Coalition of the Willing, has signed 
and ratified a bilateral Article 98 Agreement, and supported 
the USG at the WTO Ministerial in Cancun, Mexico.  Panama has 
proven itself a good friend and ally. 
 
 
------------------ 
May 2004 Elections 
------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) Panama will hold its next national elections on May 2, 
2004.  Candidates are vying for the presidency, 78 
legislative seats, and all mayoral and local representative 
positions.  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate 
Martin Torrijos maintains a small lead over third-party 
candidate and former Panamanian President Guillermo Endara 
(1989 to 1994).  Both are well ahead of ruling Arnulfista 
party candidate and former Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Aleman (1999 to 2003) and minor Democratic Change (CD) party 
candidate Ricardo Martinelli.  Panama\'s elections should not 
warrant extensive monitoring or observation. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
A Mixed Macroeconomic Record 
---------------------------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under USG administration.  Canal-related 
industries, especially cargo transshipment through ports at 
both ends of the Canal, have boomed, as have visits by U.S. 
cruise ships, which will surpass 200 port calls in Panama 
this year.  But Panama\'s overall economy went flat when 
nearly 30,000 US military personnel and their dependents left 
during the late 1990s, and the 2001 global recession has 
perpetuated the country\'s estimated 13.4% unemployment. 
Also, Panama has failed to attract large investments into the 
former Canal Zone. Poverty, economic disparity, and 
unemployment are arguably the biggest internal challenges 
facing Panama today.  Since mid-2003, however, the economy 
appears to have picked up, primarily as a result of tax 
incentives given to a now booming construction sector, low 
interest rates, and a global economic recovery.  Panama\'s 
growth rate for 2003 is expected came in at around 4 percent. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Towards a Democratic Culture 
---------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Ambassador Watt\'s September 29 speech to Panama\'s 
Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, launching 
Embassy\'s Good Governance Initiative (GGI), resonated firmly 
with Panamanians and generated front-page headlines. 
Venality, conflict of interest, nepotism, and lack of 
transparency are ingrained in Panama\'s political culture and 
institutions.  Panama\'s \"spoils system\" allows politicians to 
use the entire state bureaucracy as a patronage base.  The 
country\'s criminal libel laws, left over from military rule, 
impose enormous costs and risks on whistle-blowers. 
Legislative immunity is often abused, as elsewhere in the 
region.  The Embassy currently supports good governance 
activities directed toward judicial reform, civic education, 
business ethics, and strengthening anti-corruption 
prosecutors\' institutional capacity, and is reviewing 
implementation of President Bush\'s inititiative to cancel 
travel visas to the United States of corrupt public officials. 
 
 
---------------- 
Our Third Border 
---------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) Panamanians have become increasingly willing to 
accept military-to-military security training, equipment and 
other assistance to enhance their capabilities to protect the 
Canal and borders.  Although the present terrorist threat to 
the Canal is considered low and Panamanian planning, layered 
defenses and security resources are generally well regarded, 
the Canal remains vulnerable. Continued U.S. training, 
equipment and other assistance are vital to preempt a major 
terrorist attack. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Fighting International Crime 
---------------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Law enforcement cooperation with Panama is 
excellent.  The Moscoso Administration set up a new, GoP- 
interagency counternarcotics vetted unit; expanded upon the 
basic shiprider agreement to facilitate maritime/air 
operations in pursuit of drug, arms and explosives smuggling 
(and may soon include WMD); expedited thirty-eight maritime 
drug prisoner transfers to USG custody (saving U.S. taxpayers 
US$1 million per event); and captured and expelled seventeen 
fugitives from US justice (most recently, on January 14, 
Colombian drug kingpin Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya, 
wanted in New York for smuggling five tons of cocaine). 
Panama is working much more closely with Colombian President 
Uribe\'s government against narco-terrorists.  The GoP has 
also welcomed USG assistance-- DoD special operations forces 
(training National Police (PNP) border units) and AID 
community development (enhancing productive capacity and 
governmental presence in the Darien border province). 
 
 
7. (U) The GoP revamped its legal and administrative 
structures to fight money laundering, becoming a model for 
other countries, such as Russia, that are trying to bring 
their regimes up to grade.  Panama assisted the USG in the 
prosecution of money laundering cases and provided crucial 
information against former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo 
Aleman.  However, at the 2004 Summit of the Americas in 
Monterrey, Mexico, several hemispheric neighbors chided 
Panama for recently granting \"asylee\" status to a 
formerEcuadorian cabinet  minister, who is charged with 
embezzlement of government funds. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
8. (SBU) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the United 
States.  First, for political and economic reasons, President 
Moscoso is pushing for quick negotiation on a bilateral FTA. 
(Note: the USG announced its intention to negotiate an FTA 
with Panama in November 2003 at the Miami FTAA ministerial, 
with a view to begin negotiations during the second quarter 
of 2004. End Note).  Second, the GOP has long argued for 
Panama\'s re-designation from a \"near foreign port\" to a 
\"distant foreign port,\" under the U.S. Passenger Vessels 
Services Act (PVSA), in order to capture a larger share of 
the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying the possibility 
of a re-designation.  The GoP estimates that up to US$50 
million per year could be gained for Panama\'s growing tourism 
sector.  Third, over the last several months, we have seen a 
marked improvement in the GoP\'s willingness to make progress 
on a number of U.S. investment cases, to address bilateral 
trade issues, including agricultural concerns, and to enhance 
cooperation/coordination in regional and multilateral trade 
fora.  The USG has asked Panama to continue its progress on 
resolving investment disputes and improving its investment 
climate through responsiveness to investor concerns, clear 
rules of the game, predictability, and transparency in 
decision-making. 
 
 
9. (U) Panama\'s $12 billion economy is based primarily on a 
well-developed services sector that accounts for 
approximately 78 percent of GDP.  Services include the Panama 
Canal, banking and financial services, legal services, 
container ports, the Colon Free Zone (the 2nd largest in the 
world) and flagship registry.  Panama also maintains one of 
the most liberalized trade regimes in the hemisphere. 
Bilateral trade with Panama came to $2.2 billion in 2003. 
U.S. exports were $1.85 billion and imports were $301 
million.  The stock of U.S. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
in 2001 was $25.3 billion.  U.S. FDI is primarily 
concentrated in the financial sector. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Our Maritime Security Agenda 
---------------------------- 
 
 
10. (SBU) The 9/11 attacks called significant attention to 
the potential for terrorist exploitation of Panama,s leading 
maritime position. Panama has the world,s largest flag state 
registry with approximately 6300 vessels over 500 gross 
metric tons and approximately 300,000 seafarers. 
Additionally, approximately two-thirds of Canal traffic 
originates or terminates at U.S. ports, roughly 13% of U.S. 
seaborne trade.  Nearly, 27 percent of foreign-flagged cargo 
ships arriving at U.S. ports are Panamanian.  Moreover, 
approximately 150 U.S. military vessels, including 
nuclear-powered U.S. submarines (\"high value transits\"), 
visit Panamanian ports and/or transit the Canal each year. 
Port services have grown dramatically from about 200,000 
containers per year in the early 1990s to almost two million 
by 2002, giving Panama Latin America\'s leading port complex. 
(Note: Although a large number of containers transit the 
Panama Canal, the number that actually are shipped and 
transhipped from Panama are substantially less -- around 90 
thousand.) 
 
 
11. (SBU) Given these equities, the Embassy, through its 
Maritime Security Working Group and in coordination with 
Washington agencies, has undertaken a broad Maritime Security 
agenda with the GoP. We have seen a strong willingness on the 
part of the Moscoso Administration for Panama to meet its 
responsibilities as a major maritime player.  Progress has 
been particularly good since President Moscoso\'s appointment 
in June 2003 of Panama,s Public Security and National 
Defense Council (\"the Consejo\") Executive Secretary Ramiro 
Jarvis to coordinate maritime security matters.  Key 
components of the agenda include: making Panama,s seafarer 
document more secure, protecting U.S. forces, port security 
(including for cruise ships), container security, export 
controls, proliferation security, and strengthening GoP 
institutions. Progress by the GoP has been good on all of the 
fronts however, we will have to keep the pressure on the GoP 
to follow-through, in particular, on ISPS implementation and 
new seafarer documents.  The fact that this is an election 
year in Panama will not facilitate things, but should also 
not hinder progress too much. 
 
 
12.  (SBU) On several points of the agenda, the ball is in 
our court to move ahead.  For example, DHS headquarters is 
currently reviewing language for a Declaration of Principles 
with Panama for the Container Security Initiative (CSI).  A 
CSI assessment team visited Panama in mid-January and the 
formal report of outcomes is pending.  Additionally, the 
Coast Guard is exploring the possibility of sending a USCG 
\"audit\" team to measure GoP progress towards ISPS 
implementation and discuss the status of Panama,s seafarer 
document.  The Embassy is also reviewing the possibility of 
using Narcotics Affairs Section funds to support GoP efforts 
to strengthen cruise ship port security. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Suggested Talking Points 
------------------------ 
 
 
13. (U) Talking points for meetings with GoP interlocutors 
(additional points for press opporuntities will be delivered 
upon arrival): 
 
 
- Express appreciation for Panama,s excellent cooperation on 
maritime security. 
 
 
- Press for continued focus on ISPS implementation. 
 
 
- Urge for increased attention to airport security at 
Panama\'s Tocumen International Airport and security for 
cruise ships at Panama\'s main ports. 
 
 
- Note USG willingness to work with the GoP on initiatives of 
mutual interest, including cruise ship security and 
initiatives like CSI.

1. (C)  Summary: Minister of Commerce and Industry Joaquin 
Jacome and VM for Trade Romel Adames will be traveling to 
Washington next week for the March 23 TPSC Panama hearing at 
USTR and to press for moving forward expeditiously with FTA 
negotiations.  The upcoming November U.S. elections and the 
political environment regarding FTAs have not been lost on 
them. Both will press for holding a negotiating round or 
meeting in April -- before the May 2 national elections -- 
and concluding the negotiations before the Moscoso 
Administration leaves office on September 1 or shortly 
thereafter.  Their expectations are that the agreement will 
have aspects of both the CAFTA and Singapore FTAs.  Post sees 
no down-side with holding an April negotiating round or 
meeting, schedules permitting.  Presidential candidates 
support an FTA with the United States (three of the four very 
strongly), and we believe they will want discussions to move 
forward provided the winner\'s representatives have \"a place 
at the table\"(read: are consulted closely).  The Panamanians 
view the FTA as a vehicle to eliminate uncertainty related to 
unilateral benefits such as CBI, improve market access for 
goods and services (e.g. sugar, banking, and maritime), but 
most importantly, to attract investment (or not lose 
investment to CAFTA).  Showing his talent for one-liners, 
Adames told Econ Chief, this (U.S. investment) will represent 
the return of the U.S. without the military bases.  Both 
Jacome and Adames also argue that the FTA will reinforce 
stability and strengthen democratic forces for the long-term 
in a country where the U.S. still has strategic interests. 
End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (C) During a wide-ranging conversation with ECON Chief, 
on March 8, VM Adames, Panama\'s Chief Negotiator, shared his 
thoughts on the upcoming bilateral FTA negotiations with the 
United States. (Note: the Panamanians are studying the CAFTA, 
Chile, and Singapore texts.) Like his bosses, President 
Moscoso and Minister Jacome, Adames would like to make as 
much progress as possible on the bilateral before the Moscoso 
Administration leaves office September 1.  He has argued that 
starting the negotiations in April before the May 2 national 
elections would send the right signal that this is a \"state 
project rather than a political one (Ref C).\" (Comment: While 
this is most likely to gain pre-electoral political 
advantage, we see no down-side with holding a first round or 
meeting prior to May 2.  President Moscoso told Codel Weller 
in February that she would like to see the negotiations 
concluded before leaving office, even if she didn\'t sign (Ref 
C). Clearly the Panamanians have one eye on the U.S. November 
elections and the expiration in 2005 of TPA.  End Comment.) 
 
 
3. (C) For Adames, the FTA represents a vehicle to lock in 
the status quo or better (CBI, GSP), improve market access 
for Panama in niche areas (e.g., banking, maritime, and 
sugar), and most importantly to attract \"good U.S. 
investment.\"  Adames also expressed concern that investment 
might now be diverted to \"CAFTA low wages -- our China\", and 
the uncertainty of the EU\'s counter-drug driven GSP program. 
He said that he has met with representatives from the 
sensitive sectors (rice, dairy, pork, and professional 
services) and forewarned that he will \"have to make tough 
decisions.\"  He noted that Panama exports very little to the 
United States (approximately $301 million in 2003) and that 
Panama must compete in niches -- banking, maritime, sugar, 
etc.  He quipped that Panama may not initially be looking to 
give as much on agriculture since Costa Rica didn\'t give much 
to the U.S. on services, \"only around the edges.\"  Another 
defensive interest for Panama will be treatment of the Colon 
Free Trade Zone. One area that he believes Panama can be 
forthcoming is government procurement, and coverage of the 
Panama Canal, given the probable decision to move forward 
next year on a multi-billion dollar expansion project. 
 
 
4.  (C) Adames proved very adept at making the larger 
strategic arguments about the importance of this FTA.  For 
Panama he believes that by attracting \"good U.S. investment,\" 
and \"consolidating the U.S. way of doing things\" the 
agreement will help create greater stability, and strengthen 
democratic forces for the long-term (i.e., mitigate against 
future leftist-populist tendencies).  He declared that this 
would mark \"the return of the U.S. without the bases.\"  With 
an obvious allusion to the Canal and Panama\'s strategic 
location, he said that if things go bad in some countries in 
the hemisphere \"no problem\" but \"if things go bad here, 
you\'re affected.\" 
 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  The Panamanians have been doing their 
homework and with the assistance of the U.S. law firms Arnold 
and Porter and Sandler,Travis & Rosenberg, appear prepared to 
begin negotiations.  Adames is a strong proponent of this FTA 
and also a strong believer in the benefits of trade 
liberalization.  He obviously believes that if the U.S. can 
accommodate Panama\'s interest in selected \"niche\" areas that 
this can be a very high-standard agreement; he also 
recognizes Panama doesn\'t have much leverage.  With respect 
to the presidential candidates, all three (Torrijos-PRD and 
current front-runner),  Aleman-Arnulfista, and Martinelli - 
CD) strongly support the FTA with the United States.  Endara 
(Solidarity) also supports an FTA; however, he and he and his 
advisors have shown that they may be more sensitive to 
Panama\'s rural agricultural interests.

SUMMARY/COMMENT: REMARKABLY UNREMARKABLE 
---------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Local press meticulously covered former President 
Ernesto Perez Balladares\' unexpected disclosure of 
discretionary expenditures during his presidency (1994-99), 
tied to the ongoing battle between Electoral Prosecutor 
Gerardo Solis and President Moscoso. (Reftels A & B).  A 
March 16 presidential debate focused on the four candidates\' 
plans to address unemployment, corruption, the administration 
of justice, and Panama\'s ailing Social Security Fund, but 
broke no new ground.  Diplomatic community representatives 
are skeptical about OAS election observation plans, citing 
Panamanians\' ambivalence about the election and solid track 
record for peaceful balloting.   Finally, La Prensa published 
an opinion poll on March 15 showing Martin Torrijos (PRD) 
still far ahead with 47%, followed by Guillermo Endara 
(Solidarity) at 29.5%, Jose Miguel Aleman (PA) creeping up 
and staying out of single digits at 13%, and Ricardo 
Martinelli at 7.5%.  According to PolOffs\' discussions with a 
wide range of Panamanians and diplomats, neither group 
believes that the candidates have addressed the country\'s 
most pressing problems in a serious way.  In a country where 
politics is a national sport, none of the candidates has 
touched a cord among the electorate. End Summary/Comment. 
 
 
ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF THE NUMBERS GAME 
--------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Panamanians do not appear to be avidly following the 
ongoing electoral campaign.  On March 15, La Prensa published 
an opinion poll showing Martin Torrijos (PRD) at 47%, 
Guillermo Endara (Solidarity) at 29.5%, Jose Miguel Aleman 
(PA) at 13%, and Ricardo Martinelli at 7.5%.  Respondents are 
not aware either of the professional background or 
vice-presidential running mates of the presidential candidate 
for whom they plan to vote.  Endara\'s background was \"best\" 
known, but 59.2% of respondents who stated they intend to 
vote for him were unable to identify what he studied in the 
University.  The figures were grimmer for Aleman (77%), 
Martinelli (75.6%), and Torrijos (74.7%).  Corresponding 
figures for those unable to name the running mates of the 
candidate for whom they intend to vote were: Torrijos 
(56.9%), Endara (59.6), Aleman (71.8%) and Martinelli 
(83.3%).  In the unfavorable category, Aleman continues as 
the candidate for whom the most Panamanians say they would 
definitely not vote, with 39.5% of respondents dismissing his 
candidacy. 
 
 
I SHOWED YOU MY CARDS. WHAT ABOUT YOURS? 
---------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Former President Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB) 
jumped into the press circus over President Moscoso\'s refusal 
to reveal discretionary expenditures to Electoral Prosecutor 
Gerardo Solis.  EPB\'s records of discretionary expenditures 
during his Presidency appeared on the front page of the El 
Panama America newspaper March 16.  The March 17 El Panama 
America detailed EPB\'s expenditures, including payments to 
former President and current Solidarity Party Candidate 
Guillermo Endara.  Embassy will research those payments and 
report any substantive findings septel.  Noting correctly 
that EPB had not provided complete records, an angry Moscoso 
sarcastically told a television reporter that she would 
gladly do the same, but only five years after leaving office. 
 Ironically, before EPB appointed him as Electoral 
Prosecutor, Gerardo Solis was involved in managing the 
Presidency\'s discretionary funds. 
 
 
SLOPPY DEBATE MANAGEMENT 
------------------------ 
4. (SBU) A consortium of print and television media 
collaborated with the Panamanian Foundation for Ethics and 
Civism to produce and broadcast the second of three debates 
between Panama\'s four presidential candidates.  A panel of 
four print and television journalists sitting at a small 
conference table queried the candidates on what they would do 
to address unemployment, corruption, the administration of 
justice, and Panama\'s ailing Social Security Fund. 
Unfortunately, debate moderator Father Manuel Santiago 
Blanquer failed to control the interaction, allowing 
candidates\' outbursts to become mini-monologues.  Nor did 
Blanquer accurately monitor the 90-second time allotment for 
each candidate, erring most often in Martin Torrijos\' favor 
and twice interrupting Jose Miguel Aleman when he was 
entitled to more time. 
 
 
MORE SLAMS THAN PROPOSALS 
------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Candidates failed to offer concrete proposals about 
what they would do if elected, offering only vague promises 
about how they would reduce unemployment, the most common 
concern among Panamanians.  All four candidates agreed that 
developing the tourism sector would help combat unemployment. 
 While Martinelli recommended reforming the Labor Code, thus 
spurring micro-entrepreneurs to hire new employees, Aleman 
said the key was education, Torrijos focused on training, and 
Endara insisted on reducing corruption to attract 
job-creating foreign investment.  All four candidates waffled 
in response to a follow-up question on whom they would fire 
when they took office, stating only that they would get rid 
of inefficient or unnecessary staff. 
 
 
6. (SBU) When the topic switched to means for ensuring the 
judicial branch\'s integrity and a fair administration of 
justice, Aleman attacked Endara for not reforming the 
constitution during his presidency (1989-94).  Endara 
rejected the claim, pointing out he only respected popular 
will when Panama\'s voters rejected his constitutional reform 
proposal in a 1992 referendum.   The four candidates all said 
that no one should be above the law and Martinelli brashly 
stated that justice can be bought in Panama.  Torrijos\' 
response to both the initial and follow-up questions was to 
criticize the manner in which President Moscoso selected 
Supreme Court Magistrates loyal to her, implying that they 
were obedient to her thereafter.  On previous occasions, all 
four candidates have advocated reforms to de-politicize the 
selection process for Supreme Court Justices.  (NOTE: A 
subsequent poll claimed that Torrijos had \"won\" the debate, 
although the statistics suggested that opinions broke down 
according to party preferences.  END NOTE.) 
 
 
LOOK AT ME! I\'M THE MOST TRANSPARENT 
------------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) Having announced his plans during the March 16 
debate, Aleman presented a sworn declaration of his assets to 
the Ombudsman\'s office on March 18.  Jose Miguel Aleman\'s 
challenge to his opponents to do the same serves three 
purposes.  First, Aleman\'s move helps him question the wealth 
of campaign front-runner Martin Torrijos of the Revolutionary 
Democratic Party (PRD).  Second, due to the PRD\'s alliance 
with the Partido Popular (PP), the declaration is a jab at 
Ombudsman Juan A. Tejada and several of his chief 
lieutenants, all former PP activists, in retaliation for 
their persistent complaints about President Moscoso\'s lack of 
transparency.  Finally, being more transparent than Moscoso 
is part of Aleman\'s thus far unsuccessful effort to distance 
himself from her, so Torrijos can no longer accuse him of 
\"hiding behind her skirt\" as he did during the debate. 
(NOTE: Presidents and cabinet-level Panamanian officials must 
submit such a statement to the Comptroller General upon entry 
and departure from office, but the requirement does not 
extend to candidates. END NOTE.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) CD candidate Ricardo Martinelli lists his campaign 
contributors on his website, a pledge he made when he began 
campaigning.  While trying to prove his credibility as 
someone who would fight corruption from the Presidency, 
Martinelli stated during the March 16 debate that corruption 
starts with campaign donors expecting something in exchange 
for their contribution.  Although both other opposition 
candidates have approached the Embassy regarding questionable 
campaign donors, only Martinelli has published a list on the 
internet.  Critics would say that Martinelli has nothing to 
lose by publishing his list of donors as he has little chance 
of winning Panama\'s May 2 election.  Nonetheless, while not 
enough to put him over the top, Panamanians welcome 
Martinelli\'s transparency when it comes to campaign 
donations.  Martinelli was also the first candidate to 
formally present an anti-corruption plan to Panama\'s chapter 
of Transparency International, which Aleman did this week. 
 
 
WHY WOULD OAS OBSERVE PANAMA\'S ELECTION? 
---------------------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Several diplomatic missions to Panama share this 
Embassy\'s skepticism about the need for external OAS election 
observers, expecting a free and clean vote.  OAS\' Panama 
office contacted foreign diplomatic missions in Panama, as 
well as local IDB and UNDP  offices during the week of March 
8 on behalf of the OAS Unit for the Promotion of Democracy 
(UPD) to request funds (reftel A) and convoke a March 17 
coordination meeting.  UPD proposed a $130K budget for a 
short-term observation mission consisting of 8 OAS experts 
(elections, IT, training, etc.) and 12 foreign observers. 
UPD representatives at the meeting explained that their 
proposed mission would fit a new model, that of extracting 
helpful lessons from Panama\'s electoral process to apply 
elsewhere.  The breadth and scope of the mission will depend 
on the sum of contributions.  So far, Brazil has contributed 
the only funds in the pot, $10,000. 
 
 
10. (SBU) Representatives of several diplomatic missions, 
including Mexico, Japan, and Argentina, all noted that they 
would prefer to observe Panama\'s elections at the invitation 
of the Electoral Tribunal rather than as part of an official 
OAS delegation.  Diplomatic representatives present at the 
March 17 meeting were not concerned about any 
election-related problems arising in Panama.  For instance, 
though not present at the meeting, the British First 
Secretary for Political Affairs will be on vacation during 
 
SIPDIS 
the elections.  Officials from the Japanese Embassy contacted 
our Pol Counselor after the meeting to inquire about the 
USG\'s position on the election, including funding external 
observers.  Pol Counselor responded that Embassy is confident 
that the electoral process will continue without major 
hiccups and it is unlikely that the USG would fund an OAS 
observer mission. 
 
 
11. (SBU) Embassy will not join the OAS official observer 
delegation, but plans to send some 26 mission members to 
observe the elections.  We plan to coordinate geographic 
coverage with OAS and other diplomatic missions via an e-mail 
usergroup, checking in with the OAS control center 
periodically on election day for any breaking news.  This 
approach appears to mesh with the plans of other diplomatic 
missions with smaller presences in Panama, whose work as 
observers will be primarily a vote of confidence in the 
Panamanian system.  Furthermore, none of the diplomatic 
representatives at the March 17 meeting welcomed the OAS 
suggestion that Embassies should encourage their citizens 
residing in Panama to observe the May 2 elections.  Between 
the Ombudsman\'s Office (300) and the Catholic Church\'s Peace 
and Justice Commission (1200), approximately 1,500 
Panamanians will also volunteer to observe Panama\'s 
elections, which we believe is adequate coverage.

Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis.  On March 19, Jarvis

on March 15, chaired by Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso. 
The GOP concurs with our concern surrounding North Korea\'s 
purchase of commodities that can be used or modified for use 
in North Korea\'s nuclear program.  The GOP accepts its role 
for stopping the transit of such commodities; Panama does not 
produce those commodities.  Jarvis reported Moscoso\'s 
approval of a review of Panamanian Law to determine the 
parameters of the GOP\'s authority over transshipments, and 
noted Panama\'s general cooperation with and work on the 
Transshipment Export Controls Initiative (TECI) and other 
security-related initiatives, e.g., Export Control and 
Related Border Security Assistance (EX-BIS) Program, 
Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Proliferation

NEEDS, AND BEST PRACTICES 
 
REF: STATE 42798 
 
 
1. Summary.  Post has provided primarily financial support 
and equipment to Panama in support of promoting effective 
protection and enforcement of IP rights.  Panama has 
relatively well-developed intellectual property laws and 
institutions, and the GOP has also increased specialized IPR 
training and technical support for local stakeholders. 
However, enforcement is far from ideal as police, customs and 
prosecutors suffer from a lack of resources, and cases often 
stall in the judicial system.  Panama\'s most important needs 
center on additional training for on-the-ground officials 
(i.e., police, customs officers, and technical judges) and 
the acquisition of additional equipment.  End summary. 
 
 
2. Per reftel, Answers to Questionnaire (Question 7). 
 
 
A.1. While post has not/not conducted specific IPR training 
programs or workshops, IPR training was included in various 
conferences.  Most recently, a one-hour IPR training session 
was held on March 3 in a DHS-led Conference on Money 
Laundering.  This session included presentations by a DHS 
official and GOP IPR Prosecutor on IPR laws and practices 
specific to each country.  While the audience was comprised 
of GOP officials (police and prosecutors) with money 
laundering responsibilities, many of these individuals have 
IPR duties as well.  IPR training was also included in a 
January 2004 terrorist financing seminar led by DOJ/OPDAT. 
Prosecutors and judges attended this training. 
 
 
A.2. The GOP Inter-Institutional Commission for Intellectual 
Property includes Public Ministry prosecutors, Customs and 
the Education Ministry\'s Copyright Office officials, Colon 
Free Zone (CFZ) administration, and representatives from the 
Commerce Ministry\'s international trade office (VICOMEX), and 
industrial property registry (DIGERPI).  Using GOP funds, the 
Commission organized and executed a series of four regional 
workshops in 2003 throughout Panama to raise general 
awareness of IP.  These private forums invited GOP judges, 
customs officials, and police to a three-day seminar on IP. 
Day One introduced IP and its theory; Day Two provided the 
audience with technical demonstrations (i.e., how to verify a 
\"true\" product with its look-alike); and Day Three discussed 
the role of the GOP in combating IP crimes.  The police also 
held a training session in January 2004 on how to identify 
suspicious bills of lading and airway bills.  The GOP 
Specialized IP Prosecutor\'s Office (Ninth Circuit attorney - 
created in December 2002) plans to hold a seminar in late 
March / early April of this year to target Superior Court 
judges from across the country on the fundamentals and 
principles of IP. 
 
 
B.1. Post has not/not conducted or observed any IP-specific 
training programs. 
 
 
B.2. According to GOP IPR Prosecutor Jose Ayu Prado, the most 
successful type of training has been the case study approach 
because of the audience\'s ability to directly see their role 
in the investigation or court proceedings.  However, this 
approach has not been recently utilized because GOP judges 
feel uncomfortable discussing real-life accounts. (Note: The 
GOP IPR Prosecutor\'s office does not/not have the resources 
to develop a fictional case study to be used for training 
purposes at this time.  End note.)  While post believes there 
is a strong need to send GOP IPR officials to international 
conferences and training, in-country training provides more 
individuals the access to training. 
 
 
B.3. The Embassy has helped to bridge some of the GOP\'s more 
glaring resource gaps.  US. companies have expressed concern 
about the general scarcity of resources and low priority 
given to IPR cases by Panama\'s Attorney General\'s office. 
The specialized IPR prosecutor lacks even basic resources to 
conduct investigations and handle cases.  Many of his workers 
use personal or donated computers and/or printers, some 
dating to the early 1990s.  Using Narcotics Affairs Section 
(NAS) funds, we have provided a photocopier, cable internet 
connection, and a computer projector to the IPR prosecutor to 
help with IPR training and investigations.  We have helped 
cover the costs of storing evidence for IPR cases.  Finally, 
the Embassy is aggressively pursuing anti-corruption and 
justice reform programs. 
 
 
C.1. Post sees a need for further training of GOP officials. 
Most of the training programs to-date have consisted of broad 
introductions to IP.  While these continue to be a necessity, 
continued, more specific training programs are a necessity to 
give GOP officials the skills they need.  These training 
programs may focus upon specific themes on trademarks, 
copyrights, or particular skill-sets such as identifying 
counterfeits and frauds.  In the past, post has utilized NAS 
funds to send GOP officials to industry-wide conferences and 
USG-sponsored conferences.  NAS funding allowed for two GOP 
officials to attend an  USPTO-sponsored IPR conference in 
Washington in September 2003. 
 
 
C.2. The Embassy recommends a plan focused on two specific 
areas that need improvement: CFZ enforcement and the judicial 
system.  First, we recommend expanding programs in the CFZ to 
improve security and law enforcement on money laundering, 
counter narcotics, and terrorist financing as they relate to 
IPR to include finite resources (cell phones, 
computers/laptops, copiers, printers, internet access, 
digital camera).  These would further their mission and to 
access and contribute to the DIGERPI-maintained copyright 
database.  Second, we would welcome a judiciary-focused 
technical workshop - perhaps a DOJ/OPDAT-style conference, 
led by a US circuit court judge that would use a mock court 
case to educate Panamanian judges in the intricacies of 
adjudicating IPR cases.

23. (SBU) REMARKS: After nearly three and one-half years of 
incarceration, prosecutors and defense attorneys completed 
the arguments stage on March 17, and the fate of three Cuban- 
Americans, charged with conspiracy, possession of 
explosives, endangering public security and falsification of 
documents, all in connection with an alleged plot to kill 
Fidel Castro during a November 2000 Ibero-American summit, 
is in the hands of a judge.  Anti-Castro activists Guillermo 
Novo (Sampoll), Pedro Crispin (Remon) and Gaspar Jimenez 
(Escobedo), along with the alleged ringleader, Cuban-born 
Luis Posada Carriles, believed to be stateless, await a 
verdict.  A guilty sentence on these counts could amount to 
between six to fifteen years for the different charges. 
 
 
Alternate Judge Jose Ho Justiniani presided over this trial, 
and promises a verdict within 10-30 days, the normal time 
under law.  However, given the fact that there are about 
21,000 pages of legal information presented, he could ask 
for an additional few weeks to read the evidence.  He 
promises a fair verdict, and did in fact keep the court in 
order, not tolerating any interference or interruptions in 
this drawn out controversial case.  (Note: In fact, the 
planned five-day arguments stage ended earlier than 
expected, on March 17.  Conoffs had planned to attend part 
of the trial on March 18 or March 19.  End note.)  This case 
has long generated passions on both sides: family, friends 
and supporters of these Cuban Americans, and Cuban Embassy 
officials, pro-Castro student and labor groups, as well as 
the families of the victims of these defendants\' alleged 
past crimes on the other side, along with reporters and 
spectators. 
 
 
The Public Ministry alleges that the four defendants 
conspired to kill Castro at a University of Panama 
reception.  Several labor and student organizations, 
Castro\'s hosts for the event, have also filed private 
criminal charges.  The lead prosecutor is aided by several 
private prosecutors, some of who are prominent leftist 
Panamanian attorneys working on a pro bono basis.  The 
prosecution states that the accused have long records of 
violent opposition not only to Castro\'s regime, but to 
American citizens, ordinary Cubans, and people from other 
countries as well.  Prosecutors linked the defendants to a 
long string of attacks and killings in the past.  In mid 
2002, the most serious charge, attempted murder, was dropped 
due to insufficient evidence.  The nearly three-year wait to 
proceed with trial is not unusual in the extremely slow 
Panamanian judicial system, where over half of all prisoners 
are pre-trial detainees, and often are held under this 
status for more time than the penalty would have been for 
the original crime. 
 
 
The defendants\' lead attorney is former Panamanian Attorney 
General Rogelio Cruz, who reportedly also has access to a 
defense committee in Miami.  The Cuban Americans state that 
they were lured to Panama by a false report that a top Cuban 
intelligence officer wanted to defect during Castro\'s visit 
and needed their assistance, and that once they were here 
Castro\'s agents planted the explosives on them and tipped 
off Panamanian police.  Cruz expressed confidence about the 
outcome both publicly and privately in a conversation with 
Consular FSN.  He even inquired about Embassy travel 
documents/passports, evidently anticipati

SUBJECT: PANAMA\'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN: VERAGUAS PROVINCE IS 
TORRIJOS-LANDIA 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
 
1. (SBU) On March 14, seven weeks before Panama\'s May 2 
general elections, PolOffs toured rural Veraguas province 
with members of three of the four party coalitions vying for 
the presidency and 78 legislative seats.  Though 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) presidential candidate 
Martin Torrijos lost the province in 1999, most interlocutors 
said they expect a big Torrijos victory this year.  Torrijos 
coattails will almost surely return three of four PRD 
incumbent legislators.  Torrijos appears to attract Veraguas 
voters worried about agricultural unemployment.  Solidarity 
Party presidential candidate Guillermo Endara\'s 
\"anti-corruption\" message is not getting traction in 
Veraguas, and his campaign manager Menalco Solis already 
concedes an across-the-board loss in the province.  While the 
PRD machine in Veraguas is formidable, the Torrijos campaign 
is not taking any chances, and is fighting Arnulfista Party 
\"dirty tricks\" with its own. 
 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
 
2. (U)  Rising up from jungle-surrounded subsistence farms on 
the Atlantic coast to small coffee plots in the mountainous 
continental divide and then back down to expansive 
cattle-grazing plains and fishing villages along the Pacific 
coast, Veraguas is Panama\'s third largest voting province 
with 7.5% of the national electorate.  Dictator General Omar 
Torrijos, father of Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) 
presidential candidate Martin Torrijos, was a Veraguas native 
son, from the province\'s capital, Santiago, where more than 
elsewhere in Panama, PRD campaign paraphernalia includes the 
dictator\'s image.  Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso 
carried the province in 1999 by just 3,941 votes, but the PRD 
captured four of the province\'s six legislative seats. 
 
 
---------------- 
Home, Sweet Home 
---------------- 
 
 
3. (U) This year, Torrijos should win Veraguas by a 
comfortable margin, taking with him at least three of four 
PRD incumbent legislators.  PRD Veraguas elections 
coordinator Arturo Fabrega predicted Torrijos would win as 
much as 65% of the vote, holding Arnulfista Party 
presidential candidate Jose Miguel Aleman to 20%.  Fabrega 
also stated that the fourth PRD incumbent, Pedro Miguel 
Gonzalez, is in a close race with Arnulfista legislative 
challenger Jose \"Pepe\" Gomez (septel).  Gomez concurred that 
Veraguas is \"Torrijos country\" and that at least three PRD-PP 
legislative candidates would win.  Menalco Solis, campaign 
manager for Solidarity Party presidential candidate Guillermo 
Endara and accompanying the candidate on a March 14 caravan 
through Veraguas, did not believe Endara or Solidarity\'s 
legislative candidates would do well in Veraguas.  Solidarity 
had problems finding and has problems retaining \"suplente\" 
(alternate legislator) candidates.  PRD Fabrega told PolOffs 
of first-time, walk-in campaign volunteers being offered 
spots on the ballot and of a number of Solidarity candidates 
later withdrawing.  Endara\'s March 14 tour of the province 
was to buck-up Solidarity\'s legislative candidates, but 
conceding a Torrijos victory, Endara has no plans to return. 
 
 
-------------------- 
Playing to the Crowd 
-------------------- 
 
 
4. (U) Endara\'s \"anti-corruption\" focus has received scant 
attention from Veraguas voters who are more concerned about 
agricultural unemployment.  Not even Endara\'s choice for 
second vice president (and former Moscoso Agriculture 
Minister) Alejandro Posse has helped attract this rural vote. 
 According to PRD Fabrega and Arnulfista Gomez, and as 
witnessed by PolOffs who accompanied both parties\' candidates 
on \"caminatas\" (door-to-door campaigning), Veraguas voters 
are asking for the GOP\'s help to improve crop yields. 
Demands for agricultural subsidies or protective tariffs are 
not prevalent, and the possible US-Panama free trade 
agreement (FTA) is so far a non-issue.  Fabrega claimed that 
Torrijos has found support by promising low-interest farming 
loans and by attacking Moscoso\'s Agriculture Ministry for not 
providing enough training on the latest farming methods. 
These themes also resonate with Santiago voters who work in 
farming-related industries and with independent voters.  The 
Torrijos campaign, especially, is going after those two 
demographics, hitting houses in the provincial capital as 
many as three times before the May 2 elections and setting 
the goal of 10,000 independents for the Torrijos column. 
Every street is divided and assigned a warden 
(\"segmentacion\"), and \"converts\" are put through a party 
orientation. 
 
 
------------ 
Tit for Tat? 
------------ 
 
 
5. (SBU) PRD Fabrega plans to avoid the mistakes made in 1999 
that lost the province to Moscoso.  In addition to the above 
noted \"caminatas,\" \"segmentacion\" system and party 
orientations, Fabrega will monitor exit poll results from 21 
voting centers which represent 70% of the province\'s 
electorate.  Based on the data, Fabrega plans to focus 
last-minute get-out-the-vote efforts.  Aside from these 
legitimate election tactics, when Fabrega was asked about 
\"vote buying\" and \"vote verification\"-- elderly voters 
pressured to claim disabled status, which allows someone else 
to accompany them into the voting booth-- instead of 
responding, he counter-charged that the Arnulfistas are 
buying voter cards to tamp down PRD totals.  Fabrega implied 
that the PRD may be planning to use such tactics and that 
they are a legitimate response.

Summary/Comment: Simmer to rolling boil 
--------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Panama\'s electoral campaign suddenly became more 
interesting with a bristling 3/23 confrontation between 
Arnulfista youth and Endara supporters and a 3/24 shooting 
incident in a depressed area.  From here forward, campaign 
tensions will mount, primarily in the form of mudslinging 
and editorials rather than violent confrontations.  Thus 
far, there have been few surprises in cabinet nominations 
or endorsements.  We doubt that any of the candidates want 
to identify possible Cabinet members this early, since the 
potential ministers could become a lightning rod for public 
criticism.  Furthermore, none of the candidates want to 
offend key members of their campaign by excluding them from 
possible top jobs.  See septels for reports on each of the 
three major campaigns.  End Summary/Comment. 
 
 
Campaigns\' brush with violence 
------------------------------ 
2. (SBU) Aside from vandalized political posters, election 
campaigning had been peaceful until this week.  A March 23 
Arnulfista youth gathering on a main street in Panama ended 
with a strident, though not physical, confrontation between 
mainstream Arnulfistas and Endaristas.  Arnulfista youth 
gathered at noon on the Transistmian highway near 
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara\'s campaign center. 
The Endaristas, who consider that area their turf, exited 
the center and confronted the Arnulfistas.  After the 
yelling and cursing began, an Endarista called the 
Electoral Tribunal and Electoral Delegates where sent to 
the area to calm the waters.  No damage or injuries were 
reported.  (NOTE: Former President Guillermo Endara, a 
lifelong Arnulfista, is running on the Solidarity ticket 
because he asserts the party has strayed from its roots 
under President Moscoso\'s leadership. END NOTE) 
 
 
Activist shot 
------------- 
3. (SBU) In a violent incident, on March 24 a political 
activist that supports Arnulfista legislator Francisco 
Reyes was shot in her left thigh while she was campaigning 
door to door.  Reyes was participating in the event, so 
questions remain on whether the attack was aimed at him. 
Witnesses reported that the perpetrator was a minor and 
Police are investigating this incident.  We believe this 
was an isolated case of violence and not a harbinger of 
worse things to come. 
 
 
Former campaign manager re-appears 
---------------------------------- 
4. (U) PRD Martin Torrijos\' first cousin and former 
campaign manager Hugo Torrijos re-appeared on a live TV 
interview campaigning for Martin.  Hugo Torrijos, who had 
been \"separated\" from the campaign early in January 2004 
due to his links with the PECC scandal (reftel C), has 
returned as \"electoral promoter\" (\"encargado de oferta 
electoral\").  In that capacity, Hugo\'s two main 
responsibilities are making sure party promoters ask voters 
to vote for the entire party slate (\"voto en plancha\") and 
that voters nationwide gets transportation to voting 
centers on Election Day.  Hugo Torrijos announced that the 
PRD wants to a get a solid legislative majority to avoid 
the need for alliances with smaller parties.  (This comment 
probably did not sit well with the Partido Popular, which 
is a PRD ally and hopes to secure as many as seven seats, 
which would give them greater leverage in a PRD 
government.) 
 
 
Potential Cabinet members 
------------------------- 
5. (U) During a TV interview, Solidarity presidential 
candidate Guillermo Endara announced that his First Vice 
Presidential candidate Guillermo Ford would become his 
Minister of Economy and Finance.  Endara also said Second 
Vice Presidential candidate Alejandro Posse would be his 
Agriculture Minister.  Former Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino would Endara\'s Foreign Minister again, and current 
Alternate Attorney General Mercedes A. de Grimaldo would 
become the new Attorney General when current Attorney 
General Jose Sossa\'s term expires in December 2004.  El 
Panama America confirmed these names in a 3/25 article 
about potential cabinet members. 
 
 
6. (SBU) El Panama America had approached all candidates 
asking for names of likely Cabinet ministers in the next 
government.  Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman 
mentioned only campaign manager Carlos Raul Piad as a 
future Cabinet member.  Torrijos refused to give names to 
the newspaper, but in a TV interview on 3/25, he finally 
announced that actor/singer Ruben Blades will be part of 
his cabinet, along with his two Vice Presidents, Samuel 
Lewis Navarro and Ruben Arosemena.  Strong rumors are that 
Lewis Navarro would also serve as Torrijos\' Foreign 
Minister.  Arosemena allegedly would be in charge of anti- 
corruption plans within the Cabinet.  Cambio Democratico 
Ricardo Martinelli recited a list of mostly well-known, 
well-reputed Panamanians that might end up in his Cabinet. 
The voluminous list even included highly successful banker 
Alberto Vallarino, who obtained 17% of the popular vote as 
a 1999 presidential candidate, but would likely refuse a 
job in anyone\'s Cabinet. 
 
 
Martin Torrijos to void his vote 
-------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) In an interview hosted by popular boxing 
journalist Juan Carlos Tapia, Torrijos, the last of the 
four candidates to appear, said if he were not running that 
he would void his vote.  Tapia just laughed when Torrijos 
dodged the question.  Tapia has been linked to the PRD for 
many years and traditionally his political comments before 
his boxing show criticize whoever is in power.  Tapia did 
not turn the screws on Torrijos to answer the question, as 
he did for Martinelli and Endara, or criticize his 
evasiveness, as he did with Aleman.  Tapia told Torrijos on 
air that he is the only candidate he, \"considers a friend,\" 
providing more reason to believe allegations of his bias 
toward Torrijos.

A Fighting Chance 
----------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) On March 14, PolOffs accompanied Arnulfista Party 
legislative challenger Jose \"Pepe\" Gomez on a tour of 
Veraguas province\'s 9-3 electoral circuit, encompassing 
Calobre, Santa Fe and San Francisco.  (See ref for Veraguas 
campaign overview.)  Gomez is in a close race with 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) legislative incumbent 
(and unconvicted murderer) Pedro Miguel Gonzalez.  (See para 
5 for background on the Sgt Zak Hernandez case.)  Gomez, who 
as Secretary General of Panama\'s Legislative Assembly was 
helpful behind the scenes to Embassy during the debate of the 
Article 98 agreement (close hold), has spent over $100,000 of 
his own money to challenge Gonzalez.  Gomez claimed to be 
leading in the polls, and believes himself so strong that he 
may put Arnulfista presidential candidate Jose Miguel Aleman 
over the top in the circuit.  (Note: In a separate meeting 
with PolOffs on March 14, the PRD\'s Veraguas elections 
coordinator Arturo Fabrega conceded that Gomez has a good 
chance to win the 9-3 seat.  End note.) 
 
 
3. (SBU) The Veraguas 9-3 circuit is expansive, stretching 
from San Francisco (just North of the provincial capital, 
Santiago) to the Atlantic Ocean.  Arnulfista Gomez hails from 
Calobre, with nearly 10,000 registered voters of the 
circuit\'s 26,000.  Gomez said he is running strong in his 
hometown and in San Francisco with its 7,000 voters.  He 
admitted to be weak in Santa Fe, his opponent\'s home, which 
has 9,000 voters.  It was in the far reaches of this circuit 
that in 1999 then EmbOffs witnessed PRD Gonzalez\' tactic of 
\"vote verification\"-- pressuring elderly voters to claim 
disabled status, which allowed Gonzalez lackeys to accompany 
them into the voting booth.  Gonzalez has yet to arrive in 
the circuit to begin campaigning and is reportedly keeping 
his war chest in reserve for similar last-minute dirty tricks. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Arnulfista Gomez fears a repeat of 1999 and asked 
for Embassy\'s assistance, to the extent possible, with his 
personal security, security at polling stations and observer 
teams throughout the district to document any irregularities. 
 Already aware that Embassy deliberately avoids funding 
humanitarian and development programs that would benefit PRD 
Gonzalez\' circuit, Gomez expressed his hope that, if he 
unseats Gonzalez, Embassy would provide the area with 
humanitarian civil engineering projects like New Horizons and 
related Medical Readiness Training Exercises (MedReTEs), law 
enforcement and counternarcotics training for local National 
Police (PNP) units, and AID sustainable development programs 
aimed at small coffee growers.  (Comment: Embassy plans to 
send observers to numerous electoral circuits throughout the 
country, including this hotly contested area.  Embassy would 
consider humanitarian and development projects in this poor 
region only if Gonzalez were voted out of office.  End 
comment.) 
 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) In 1992, just days before then President George H.W. 
Bush visited Panama, US Army Sgt Zak Hernandez was fatally 
shot in broad daylight while driving his Humvee from Colon to 
Panama City.  Witnesses at the scene described the passing 
vehicle and gunman, who was later identified by Panama\'s 
Technical Judicial Police (PTJ) as Pedro Miguel Gonzalez. 
The PTJ found the murder weapon on the property of Gonzalez\' 
sister, and separate ballistic tests performed by the US 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the UK Scotland 
Yard linked the fatal shot to the AK-47.  Gonzalez fled to 
Cuba, returning to Panama in 1994.  His \"surrender\" to 
Panamanian authorities was engineered by newly-elected 
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez-Balladares.  Gonzalez\' 
father, Gerardo, was a close confidant of Perez-Balladares as 
well as a legislator and president of the PRD.  The ensuing 
trial was fraught with irregularities and probable jury 
intimidation.  Gonzalez was found not guilty in 1997.  In 
1999, Gonzalez succeeded his father as legislator from the 
Veraguas 9-3 circuit.

STATE PLEASE PASS DHS - AMB. ARCOS 
 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EWWT, PTER, ETRD, PM, ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: DHS AMBASSADOR ARCOS PRESSES MARITIME SECURITY 
AGENDA IN PANAMA 
 
1.  Summary:  During a March 23-24 visit to Panama, 
Ambassador Cresencio Arcos, Director for International 
Affairs at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security pressed 
the USG agenda on maritime security.  At a meeting with 
Panama\'s Minister of Government and Justice (MOGJ), Arnulfo 
Escalona, the Minister discussed the GoP\'s bilateral security 
agenda with the USG and broader national policies, including 
Panama\'s desire to be a Container Security Initiative (CSI) 
country.  Arcos emphasized the need to stamp out corruption 
to aid in getting CSI.  Escalona reaffirmed the GoP\'s close 
and continuing relationship with the United States and 
updated Arcos on Panama\'s efforts to comply with other USG 
and international security initiatives.  Arcos later 
delivered a speech at a broadly attended dinner in which he 
urged companies from the Colon Free Zone--the world\'s second 
largest--to take a leading role in financial and maritime 
security.  He also visited Panama\'s key cargo and passenger 
port facilities, and held an interview with a leading local 
newspaper.  End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Meeting with the Minister of Government and Justice 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
2.  On March 23, Ambassador Arcos, accompanied by the DCM and 
Econoff, met with MOGJ Escalona.  Also attending were GoP 
Public Security and National Defense Council (Consejo) 
Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis, National Police (PNP) 
Director Carlos Bares, Maritime Authority (AMP) Director 
Bertilda Garcia, and AMP Deputy Director Capt. Luis Perez 
Salamero.  Ambassador Arcos opened by noting that the 
landscape of terrorism was rapidly changing, and that 
governments had to work aggressively to adapt and remain 
innovative to be one step ahead of terrorists.  He thanked 
the GoP for its continued support in this effort.  Minister 
Escalona replied that Panama was and would remain a strong 
partner to the United States in the aviation and maritime 
security arenas, and this was the policy of the entire 
Moscoso administration.  To that end, there were two agendas 
that the GoP followed--the specific U.S.-Panama bilateral 
relationship and a general GoP security agenda. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
The Container Security Initiative: a GoP Priority 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
3.  In the bilateral arena, he said, the GoP was making every 
effort to become a Container Security Initiative country.  He 
pointed to the extensive GoP support of a January 14-21 CSI 
technical visit by DHS officials, and noted that the GoP was 
still waiting for a formal report from that visit to 
implement further improvements and move forward.  He queried 
on the status of the proposed Declaration of Principles (DoP) 
for CSI, saying, \"Tell me where to sign.\"  (Note: The draft 
agreement has been with DHS headquarters since March 1.  Our 
GoP interlocutors continue to press for a DoP status update 
at every opportunity.  End Note.)  He observed that Panama\'s 
law for privatization of ports hadn\'t contemplated security 
oversight, and in essence, the GoP had given up this control 
to the operators when the port concessions were granted to 
private companies.  He said the GoP deemed CSI as key to 
regain effective sovereignty over the ports as well as 
strengthening GoP institutions and offering a competitive 
advantage to Panama,s maritime industry. 
 
 
4.  Ambassador Arcos replied Panama was a truly changed 
place.  He observed that the USG and GoP were much more than 
just friendly nations, but had a healthy, cooperative 
relationship.  He said it was clear that Panama understood 
its role as a strategically critical country, especially with 
the new threat of terrorism.  Given that 60% of world GDP is 
in the Pacific basin, with all projections indicating an 
increase, Panama\'s strategic importance could only grow. 
Arcos mentioned that 20 countries are CSI certified and that 
DHS is now looking at the second tier of developing nations, 
of which Panama was included.  Arcos said that the USG was 
considering many issues for including a country in CSI, but 
emphasized that \"port integrity\" that kept out corruption was 
a major factor.  CSI involved much more that signing 
documents, he stressed. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Other USG initiatives also highlighted: TECI, EXBS, PSI 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
5.  Escalona said that a GoP inter-agency working group was 
reviewing Panamanian law to determine compliance with the 
Department of Commerce,s Trans-shipment Export Control 
Initiative (TECI) and the Department of State\'s Export 
Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) 
program.  He said the working group was to present a law 
proposal to the Legislative Assembly before the summer that 
would greatly improve the GoP\'s control of dual use items 
entering, leaving and transiting Panama.  Escalona added that 
the GoP was reviewing ways to sign a Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI) boarding agreement with the USG, and that it 
was beginning to focus on cruise ship security, given the 
rapid increase of port calls in the past two years, and asked 
for our assistance to train Panamanian officials in this 
area. (Note:  The Embassy is currently working with GoP 
entities to address this endeavor.  End note.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
6.  AMP\'s Salamero noted that the AMP was charged with 
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code 
implementation for Panama.  Beginning April 15 he said, the 
AMP would begin to review port security plans for Panama\'s 
major ports, including the Panama Canal.  He added that 5500 
Panama-flagged ships are subject to ISPS review.  Of those, 
the three GoP-designated Recognized Security Organizations 
(RSO\'s) had approved 2200 security plans for ships and 
another 800 are in the pipeline.  He opined that Panama was 
well ahead of other maritime states in its ISPS 
implementation.  Arcos reiterated the importance of ISPS 
compliance, and noted that the July 1 deadline for 
implementation was very firm.  Salamero responded that for 
this very reason, the GoP was requiring all Panama-flagged 
vessels to turn in their ship security plans by May 1 to 
avoid a bottleneck just before July.  Arcos noted that the 
movement of people across borders is a challenge, and alluded 
to the USVISIT program, which will include biometrics for 
passports.  He urged the GoP to apply similar standards to 
mariner documents. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Airport Security, Borders, and Migration 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
7.  Escalona then moved to the general GoP security agenda, 
saying that the GoP viewed the June 2003 semi-privatization 
of the Tocumen International airport as a positive move to 
strengthen security, as it would allow the airport to 
undertake a $50 million renovation that would include 
significant security upgrades, including suggestions made by 
a March 10-17 Transportation Security Agency (TSA) team.  He 
noted that the GoP was working to strengthen its border 
security by taking a strong stand against the Colombian FARC 
in the Darien region. He said the GoP had regained control of 
the Darien, professionalizing and increasing the PNP forces 
there to keep the FARC from using the Darien as a safe haven. 
 Escalona added that the GoP coordinated closely with 
Colombian counterparts to repatriate refugees as humanely as 
possible, and was working hard to address narcotrafficking. 
He said that USG support, such as a recent $1 million 
allocation to help maintain the National Air Service\'s 
helicopters, was integral in all these efforts and greatly 
appreciated.  Escalona finished by saying that the GoP was 
revising its migration policy, including a census of illegal 
immigrants in Panama, passing laws to stop child pornography 
and clamping down on prostitution abuses--this latter 
initiative to address concerns about trafficking in persons. 
 
 
8.  In a press conference following the meeting, Ambassador 
Arcos emphasized the positive relationship between the two 
countries, noting it was a solid based on which to build to 
confront threats.  He added that Panama and the Canal were 
strategically important, and underlined the importance of 
striking a balance between security and open commerce. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Speech to the Users Association of the Colon Free Zone 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
9.  Immediately after, Ambassador Arcos addressed the Colon 
Free Zone (CFZ) Users Association, which represents the 
majority of companies present in the world,s second largest 
free zone, on the topic of the new security stance of the 
United States and its implications for Panama.  He noted that 
Latin America was much affected by changes in U.S. security 
and gave an overview of DHS operations.  He observed that 13% 
of U.S. maritime commerce passes through the Panama Canal, 
and lauded the GoP\'s counterdrug cooperation.  He noted that 
the recently announced U.S-Panama Free Trade Agreement 
negotiations would enhance respect for the rule of law in 
Panama and would ensure strong and accountable institutions 
of government.  He exhorted the CFZ to be a global standard 
bearer in the areas of financial and transportation security. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Review of the Canal and Ports, PVSA, CSI Redux 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
10.  On March 24, Ambassador Arcos participated in an 
overflight of the Panama Canal and its installations. 
Afterwards he visited Atlantic-side ports including Panama 
Ports Company,s Cristobal passenger and cargo installations, 
the Colon 2000 passenger terminal, and the U.S.-owned 
Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT) for cargo.  Upon 
return to Panama City, Ambassador Arcos also visited the Fort 
Amador cruise ship, hotel, and shopping complex.  MIT 
managers noted that while the privatized ports in Panama were 
prepared to shoulder the costs of CSI implementation, it was 
important to keep in mind that only 70,000 containers that 
were transshipped (off-loaded and then onloaded again) in 
Panama actually were destined for the United States, and of 
those, more than 80% originated from CSI-certified ports.  In 
addition, they observed that Panama was the country of origin 
of perhaps only 20,000 more containers.  Ambassador Arcos 
reiterated that CSI considers many factors, not just 
container volumes, and highlighted the need to stamp out 
corruption to maintain port security integrity.  The cruise 
ship terminal operators expressed their interest in Panama,s 
designation as a distant foreign port under the Passenger 
Vessels Services Act (PVSA), claiming that the designation 
could significantly increase the number of port calls to 
Panama and thus significantly benefit the tourism sector. 
Arcos replied that the Department of Commerce continues to 
analyze the economic impact of the change and that the USG 
would consider options soon. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Interview with El Panama America Newspaper 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
11.  Though Ambassador Arcos discussed the broad maritime 
agenda in a one-on-one interview with El Panama America, a 
leading Panamanian daily, the published article focused 
entirely on the background of the CSI program and Panama,s 
potential to be included.  The article noted that Arcos had 
visited Panama,s key ports and his observation that there is 
no set timetable for CSI implementation for Panama. 
 
 
12.  Ambassador Arcos did not have the opportunity to clear 
this cable.

Summary/Comment: One month out 
------------------------------ 
1. (SBU) With the May 2 elections just one month away, the 
campaigns and the candidates are entering the home stretch. 
The Electoral Tribunal and the Ombudsman\'s office are 
focused on Election Day logistics and observers.  Panama\'s 
media and civil society are investigating candidates\' 
backgrounds.  Presidential candidates are campaigning hard 
for votes and pulling out all the stops to find ways to 
discredit their opponents.  Embassy is scanning the horizon 
for signs of potential problems, but has noted none.  End 
Summary/Comment. 
 
 
Latin American Ombudsmen to observe elections 
--------------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Ombudsmen from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Peru, and Puerto Rico, Colombia\'s Deputy 
Ombudsman, and the Secretary General of the Latin American 
Institute of Ombudsmen (Colombian Isaac Hochman) have 
accepted an invitation from Panama\'s Ombudsman to observe 
Panama\'s May 2 General Elections.  Panama\'s Electoral 
Tribunal (ET) will finance travel for the guest observers, 
who will arrive in Panama a few days before the elections. 
The visiting Ombudsmen will observe polling in areas where 
the ET and/or Ombudsman\'s office believe election results 
could be controversial.  Electoral Tribunal (ET) 
authorities and Panama\'s Ombudsman advised EmbOffs about 
the invitation in early March. (See Ref. C.)  (NOTE: Six of 
twenty-nine Embassy election observers will observe polling 
and vote counting in the areas about which the Electoral 
Tribunal has expressed concern. END NOTE.) 
 
 
Press and TI-Panama inform voters 
--------------------------------- 
3. (U) NGOs and the press are working hard to brief voters 
about presidential candidates so they can make informed 
decisions on May 2.  Though each presidential candidate has 
published his campaign platform (plan de gobierno in 
Spanish), the average Panamanian cannot or will not read 
them.  Therefore, El Panama America and La Prensa have 
offered the public service of digesting and printing each 
candidate\'s position on key issues.  Topics range from 
tourism, the environment, and the Panama Canal, to fiscal 
reform, crime and the penitentiary system, sports, and 
culture.  Printed compilations are short and easy to read. 
Panama\'s chapter of Transparency International announced on 
March 29 that it will broadcast background information for 
all presidential candidates and as many other candidates as 
possible.  TI\'s Executive Director Angelica Maytin 
announced that TI will distribute information about 
candidates through its website and some published media. 
 
 
Targeting undecided voters 
-------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Candidates are targeting independent voters. 
Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara, running second in 
opinion polls, released another anti-PRD TV advertisement, 
as did Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman.  Endara\'s 
15-second spot highlights public scandals that involved PRD 
leaders like PECC (Ref. D) and CEMIS (Ref. E) and reminds 
viewers of the PRD ties to Panama\'s 21-year military 
regime.  The clever ad features a man intended to represent 
PRD candidate Martin Torrijos making campaign promises 
while a group of masked men behind him are busily cutting 
up a cake shaped like Panama.  Each has a sign on his 
chest, including \"buoys\" and \"lighthouses\" (references to 
the PECC scandal).  When \"Martin\" turns around, he has the 
word \"Zemys\" written on his back, pronounced \"Cemis\" in 
Spanish, like the CEMIS scandal.  At the end of the spot 
Endara points angrily to the group and says, \"don\'t let 
them govern.  These people [PRD] have never changed and 
they will never change.\" 
 
 
5. (U) Front-runner and PRD-PP Presidential candidate 
Martin Torrijos has aired a new tactic in Panama City\'s 
densely-populated 8-10 electoral circuit.  Its almost 
200,000 registered voters tend to support the Arnulfistas 
or Endara, not the PRD.  This past weekend, Torrijos and 
his large, well-organized staff, brought a \"medical tour\" 
to the district, offering free veterinary and legal 
services as well.  The PRD has offered free medical 
services in other areas, but in Circuit 8-10 Torrijos took 
special care to make sure that everyone had a favorable 
memory of his visit. 
 
 
Distracting rumors of secret pacts 
---------------------------------- 
6. (U) All four presidential candidates have set aside 
substantive issues in favor of negative campaigning. 
Cambio Democratico (CD) presidential candidate Ricardo 
Martinelli\'s allegations of secret discussions between 
Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara and Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman made front-page news on 3/29. 
On 3/30, Endara and Aleman both denied that they met each 
other privately.  Martinelli explained on 3/31 that the 
Arnulfistas had invited him and Endara to a closed-door 
meeting with Aleman, but he declined.  Martinelli later 
denied that he said Aleman and Endara had met, but insisted 
that Endara and Aleman supporters had. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Taking aim at Endara, whose consistently anti- 
Torrijos TV advertising repeatedly alleges a MAMI (MArtin- 
MIreya) mutual non-prosecution Pact, PRD-PP candidate 
Martin Torrijos quipped that there must be an ENDALE 
(ENDara/ALEman) Pact.  Endara and his running mates all 
come from the Arnulfista and MOLIRENA parties that support 
Aleman.  In colloquial Spanish, ENDALE means \"to give to 
him,\" and Torrijos implied that the agreement would commit 
the winner to split May 2 spoils with his \"friends\" in the 
other camp via ministerial and diplomatic appointments. 
President Moscoso has publicly denied any such pacts. 
 
 
What\'s that Attorney General up to? 
----------------------------------- 
8. (U) Rumors of a private meeting in the Western Province 
of Chiriqui between PRD-PP Presidential candidate Martin 
Torrijos and Attorney General Jose A. Sossa quickly became 
a political football.  Torrijos said on 3/29 it was \"a

Sossa.  On 3/30, Arnulfista Presidential candidate Jose 
Miguel Aleman published a full-page letter in print media. 
The letter expressed his \"concern\" and asked Sossa to 
dedicate himself to investigating corruption cases like 
CEMIS and PECC and disappearances during the military 
regime \"instead of harassing journalists and well-reputed

SUBJECT: PANAMA: KEY AGRICULTURAL ISSUES FOR THE UPCOMING 
U.S.-PANAMA FTA NEGOTIATIONS, APRIL 26-30, PANAMA CITY 
 
 
1. This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
 
2. Summary: This cable provides an overview of Panama\'s 
agricultural sector and Post\'s assessment of key issues in 
preparation for the upcoming bilateral negotiations (Round 
One will be held April 26-30, 2004 in Panama City). Paras 1-4 
provide an overview of the sector; paras 5-9 provide a 
summary of key barriers to increased U.S. market access; 
paras 10-11 provide a summary of Panama\'s agricultural 
incentives; and paras 12-22 provide background and basic 
trade and production data for sub-sectors (e.g. beef, dairy, 
rice, etc) identified as sensitive by local agricultural 
groups.  Like elsewhere, Agriculture represents a largely 
defensive interest for Panama (with the clear exception of 
improved sugar access under the US-administered TRQ).  (Note: 
While the Ag sector represents only 6 percent of Panama\'s 
GDP, it represents 53.3 percent of the rural labor force and 
14.6 percent of the total force.  End note.)  The GOP has 
reviewed the CAFTA Ag chapter and understands US 
expectations.  End Summary. 
 
 
3. According to 2003 official statistics from the GOP 
Comptroller General\'s office, the ag sectors contribution to 
Panama\'s total GDP (approximately USD 12 billion) fell 0.1 
percent to USD 557.4 million.  Total agricultural imports for 
2002 were USD 417 million while agricultural exports were USD 
603 million.  (Note: Detailed GOP agricultural statistics for 
2003 are still pending.  End note.)  According to USDA 
statistics, Panama imported a total of USD 191 million from 
the US in agricultural products in 2003 and exported USD 151 
million to the United States.  (Note: This figure includes 
both raw and processed ag products.  End note.)  This 
represented a 3.1 percent increase in imports from 2002 and 
continued a traditional upward trend, interrupted only by 
greater increases in 1998 and 1999 when El Nino forced Panama 
to increase food imports from the US.  In 2002, 46 percent of 
Panama\'s total imports of food products came from the United 
States and 23 percent of Panama\'s total food exports went to 
the US. 
 
 
4. Following Panama\'s accession to the WTO in 1997, Panama 
lowered all duties to 15 percent or less, becoming the most 
open market in the area.  However, at the end of 1999, the 
incoming Moscoso Administration reversed this and raised 
duties for sensitive products.  Sensitive products include 
beef, dairy, rice, poultry, pork, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, 
onions, and cooking oil.  In addition to increased duties and 
Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs), Panama does not/not recognize the 
US sanitary meat inspection system and has never accepted 
fresh or chilled US chicken, citing high phytosanitary risk. 
Nevertheless, Panama imports frozen turkeys and turkey meat 
for the meat processing industry.  Particularly troublesome 
has been the lack of transparency by the Ministry of 
Agricultural Development (MIDA) when deciding whether to 
issue or deny phytosanitary permits -- in effect, at times, 
seemingly using this authority to administer a de facto quota 
system.  Like elsewhere, many agricultural groups complain 
that their U.S. counterparts enjoy an unfair advantage 
through subsidies/domestic support.  To date, three sectors 
-- beef, dairy, rice -- have expressed a strong desire to be 
excluded from the agreement.  Aside from the above-mentioned 
sensitive products, market access is generally good for US ag 
products.  The average tariff for non-sensitive ag products 
is 15 percent. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Key Barriers to Increased US Market Access 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
5. The GOP has increased protection for sensitive sub-sectors 
primarily by raising duties and creating Tariff Rate Quotas 
(TRQs).  The GOP has limited its protection for potatoes, 
onions, cooking oil, beef, and sugar to duty increases.  It 
maintains TRQs for poultry, pork, corn, rice, dairy, and 
tomato products.  (Note: Para 6 contains detailed TRQ data. 
End note.)  TRQs are entirely filled every year for pork, 
corn, rice, dairy, and tomato products.  The yearly quota for 
poultry products has never been filled because of 
phytosanitary concerns about US poultry, which have led to 
delays in the issuance or denial of phytosanitary import 
permits.  This lack of procedural transparency in the 
issuance of these permits and the lack of recognition of US 
plant inspection are the two key barriers to increased US 
market access. 
 
 
6. TRQ detailed information: (Note: Out-of-quota tariff rates 
are as of 01/01/04. End note.) 
 
 
Poultry TRQ: 626 MT 
In-quota tariff: 15 percent 
Out-of-quota tariff: 273 percent 
 
 
Pork TRQ: 772 MT 
In-quota tariff: 3 percent 
Out-of-quota tariff: varies 
Hams, picnics, parts: 74 percent 
Deboned, other buts with bone: 30 percent 
 
 
Corn TRQ: 141,450 MT 
In-quota tariff: 3 percent 
Out-of-quota tariff: Not Available 
 
 
Rice TRQ: 8,297 MT

Tomato puree: 83 percent 
Tomato pulp crude: 83 percent 
Remaining: 83 percent 
Ketchup: 50 percent 
Tomato paste: 50 percent 
Remaining: 50 percent 
 
 
7. Panama\'s application of standards and certification 
requirements generally conforms to WTO standards.  However, 
restrictions have been applied from time to time in response 
to pressure to protect local producers.  Particularly of 
concern has been the lack of procedural transparency by 
relevant Panamanian authorities when deciding whether to 
issue or deny phytosanitary import permits.  The Ministry of 
Agricultural Development (MIDA) has, most recently, failed to 
act upon the issuance of import permits for frozen french 
fries but has also stalled issuance of imports for onions, 
corn, and dairy products.  The permits were partially issued 
after the Embassy intervened. 
 
 
8. Panama also requires certification by Panamanian health 
and agricultural officials of individual US processing plants 
as a condition for the import of poultry, pork, and beef 
products.  US exporters have assisted Panamanian officials in 
making inspection visits to US plants.  There have been no 
instances of a US plant failing to be certified, but 
inspections have been delayed many times for various reasons, 
including lack of personnel and budgetary constraints in the 
responsible Panamanian ministries. 
 
 
9. In September 2003, Executive Decree No. 352 was signed by 
President Moscoso requiring Panamanian officials certify 
international plants as a condition for the import of 
consumer-ready products.  While this decree has not been 
implemented fully, the Ministry of Health is requiring this 
certification for sanitary registrations.  Sanitary 
registration certificates allow products to be marketed and 
sold within Panama and must be renewed every 5 years.  This 
decree does not/not comply with the requirements of Chapter 
III of Law 23 of 1997 that requires Panamanian acceptance of 
free sale certificates from exporting countries.  This law 
was implemented as a result of Panama\'s WTO accession. 
 
 
----------------- 
GOP Ag Incentives 
----------------- 
 
 
10. While total domestic supports to the ag sector are low 
(less than USD 9 million annually prior to WTO accession), 
aid consists of preferential tariffs, income tax deductions, 
and tax deductions.  Preferential tariffs (30 percent 
reduction from the market rate) are given for the 
installation and consumption of electricity used in farming 
activities.  A 30 percent income tax deduction is allowed for 
investments in livestock, fisheries, and agro-industrial 
activities (a maximum deduction of 40 percent of taxable 
income in the tax period prior to the investment is 
required).  The following tax exemptions are permitted: (1) 
profits derived from timber plantations planted within the 
last 7 years, (2) income of less than USD 100,000 per annum 
derived from ag or livestock production, and (3) property tax 
on farming estates with a land registry value of less than 
USD 100,000.  A deduction of a percentage of capital invested 
in farming activities (where farm incomes exceed USD 100,000 
annually) is also available; the deduction is limited to the 
average rate of interest for fixed term deposits plus 3 
percent of that average. 
 
 
11. The GOP has also granted special contracts to certain 
investors whose activities required the use of large areas of 
land; the land areas had ordinarily been granted under a 
concession system.  Mineral resources exploration has 
benefited from such contracts.  Agricultural exports of 
Panama are also exempted from income tax on the income 
derived from the exported goods, and Tax Credit Certificates 
(Spanish acronym: CAT or certificado de ahorro tributario) 
have been granted for non-traditional ag products.  CATs are 
administered by MICI and pay 15 percent of value added to 
exports of non-traditional ag products.  CATs will be 
eliminated in 2005.  Panama recently enacted an Industrial 
Law that is WTO consistent and will replace CAT-lost income 
through various incentives and subsidies.  Panama also 
maintains Laws 24 and 25 which provide support money to 
farmers and are administered by MIDA.  Law 24 provides money 
to farmers that suffer losses due to natural disasters 
whereas Law 25 provides money to farmers that convert from 
traditional to non-traditional crops for export. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
Beef, Dairy, and Rice: \"We don\'t want to be a part of the FTA\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
 
12. Panama\'s leading industry groups for beef, dairy, and 
rice have publicly spoken against inclusion of their sectors 
in the FTA.  However, while they prefer their industries be 
excluded from the discussions, they have also begun to lobby 
the Moscoso Administration to change current laws to ensure a 
more protected agricultural sector.  This lobbying has not 
yet produced tangible results but the GOP has also not shut 
the door on their requests.  (Note: Panama has FTAs with 
Taiwan and El Salvador.  Only rice was excluded from both 
agreements whereas beef products are tariff and quota free 
and some dairy products are tariff free while others have 
quotas.  End note.)  A common argument used by these 
organizations against an FTA is that U.S. subsidies create an 
uneven playing field. 
 
 
---------------- 
Sub-sector: Beef 
---------------- 
 
 
13. Panama\'s livestock industry is traditionally operated as 
family-owned with extensive low-tech ranches.  These depend 
primarily upon low quality grassland and rain water.  The 
growth of the industry is small.  Between 1991 and 2001, when 
the agricultural census was taken, cattle production grew 
only 9.1 percent (less than 1 percent a year).  The GOP has 
set a duty of 27.5 percent for beef and 10 to 15 percent for 
offal.  There is no/no TRQ for beef.  The consumption per 
capita of beef and offal in 2002 was 91.3 pounds.  The 
following statistics refer to 2002. 
 
 
Overall beef imports: 160 tons for a total value of USD 
573,000 
 
 
Countries of origin: USD 573,000 from US (Note: Panama did 
not/not import beef from any other country. End note.) 
 
 
Overall offal imports: 451 tons for a total value of USD 
333,000 
 
 
Countries of origin: 
USD 91,000 from US 
USD 186,000 from Canada 
USD 46,000 from Nicaragua 
USD 10,000 from other countries 
 
 
Exports: 3,997 tons for a total value of USD 14,607 million 
 
 
Countries of destination: 
USD 5,883 million to Mexico 
USD 2,065 million to Guatemala 
USD 1,481 million to Venezuela 
USD 1,368 million to Taiwan 
USD 3,810 million to other countries 
(Note: There were no/no beef exports from Panama to the US. 
End note.) 
 
 
14. The National Association of Cattle Raisers (ANAGAN) has 
solicited the GOP to approve two changes in Panamanian law 
that would diversify and strengthen the domestic beef 
industry.  ANAGAN has requested a law that would include a 
meat grading system on par with other leading beef-producing 
countries; this law has been returned to its drafters for 
corrections and may go before the Assembly in September 2004. 
(Note: Reportedly, a motivation for this measure is to keep 
out Nicaraguan beef.  End Note.)  The second law proposed by 
ANAGAN requests that a percentage of profits from the cattle 
quota go to ANAGAN to strengthen its commercial structure. 
 
 
----------------- 
Sub-sector: Dairy 
----------------- 
 
 
15. Panama\'s dairy farmers produced 150 million liters of raw 
milk in 2002.  Of this, 4 million liters were utilized as ice 
cream, 47 million liters as evaporated/powdered milk, 56 
million liters as pasteurized milk, and 43 million liters as 
cheese and other dairy products.  The following statistics 
refer to CY 2002. 
 
 
Overall dairy imports: 9,819 metric tons (MT) with a total 
value of USD 18.8 million 
 
 
The most important imported products and country of origin 
were: 
Powder Skim Milk: 1,081 MT (97 percent from New Zealand) 
Powder Whole Milk: 2,069 MT (100 percent from New Zealand) 
Butter oil: 1,031 MT (93 percent from New Zealand) 
Cheddar cheese/industrial: 2,934 MT (99 percent from New 
Zealand) 
Consumer ready cheese: 437 MT (55 percent from the US) 
 
 
Overall dairy exports: 7,634 MT with a total value of USD 
10.9 million 
 
 
The most important exported products and countries of 
destination were: 
Condensed milk: 4,205 MT (94 percent to Central America) 
Evaporated milk: 2,404 MT (83 percent to Central America) 
 
 
16. The Association of Dairy Producers (APROGALPA) claim that 
the importation of milk has negatively affected domestic 
production.  The cost of production in Panama and elsewhere 
in Central America is higher than more developed countries 
because of the slow transfer of technology.  APROGALPA 
advocates the creation of a national plan developed by the 
GOP and milk producers to improve quality and efficiency. 
While the Panamanian dairy industry is competitive in Central 
America, the industry claims it cannot compete with subsidies 
provided to US dairy farmers. 
 
 
---------------- 
Sub-sector: Rice 
---------------- 
 
 
17. Panama had a total of 51,040 rice farms in 2002; of 
these, 1,767 were mechanized and 49,273 were non-mechanized. 
(Note: Non-mechanized farms include poor farmers and Indians 
that plant rice for self-consumption.  End note.)  Mechanized 
farmers were paid between USD 9.50 and USD 11.00/qq paddy. 
Consumers paid USD 0.36/lb for a 5-lb bag of white rice 95/5. 
 (Note: \"qq paddy\" refers to 100 lbs of paddy rice and 95/5 
signifies for every 100 grains of rice, 95 grains are perfect 
and 5 grains may be defective.  End Note.)  Panama has the 
highest consumption of rice in the region at 179.7 lbs/year. 
The following statistics refer to 2002. 
 
 
Overall rice imports: 30,108 MT (27,432 MT of paddy rice and 
2,676 MT of white rice) 
 
 
Countries of origin: 100 percent from the US 
 
 
(Note: Panama did not/not export rice in 2002.  MIDA 
constantly monitors stocks, which are traditionally kept at 
the minimum level of a two-months supply.  If stocks fall 
below this point, MIDA either approves the TRQ product or an 
\"extraordinary\" TRQ, if needed.  Typically, during and 
immediately after local harvests, the market is closed to 
imports. End note.) 
 
 
18. The Federation of Farmers\' organization (UNPAP), the main 
organization for rice farmers, asserts subsidies of developed 
countries must be eliminated before their products are 
discussed within FTA negotiations.  Following the abolition 
of subsidies, UNPAP wants a 60-year protectionist period of 
declining tariffs on sensitive products.  UNPAP presented its 
proposal to then Vice Minister of Trade Meliton Arrocha in 
December 2003.

(Note: Panama exported no/no turkey or turkey products in 
2002.  End note.) 
 
 
20. Pork.  In 2003, Panama slaughtered 302,641 heads of pork, 
an increase of approximately 10 percent from 2002.  The 
following figures refer to 2003. 
 
 
Chilled/Frozen Pork Imports: 2,041 MT with a total value of 
USD 3,229,421 
(Note: Of this, 1.095 MT were shoulder imports.  End note.)

(Note: Panama did not/not export any pork products in 2003. 
End note.) 
 
 
21. Corn.  Panama had a total of 50,248 corn farmers in 2003; 
of these, 540 were mechanized and 49,708 were non-mechanized. 
 Mechanized farmers planted 10,000 hectares whereas 
non-mechanized farmers planted 58,230 hectares for a total of 
68,230 hectares of corn planted in CY 2003.  The following 
statistics refer to CY 2002. 
 
 
Yellow corn imports: 286,291 MT with a total value of USD 
35.6 million 
Popcorn imports: 209 MT with a total value of USD 0.15 million 
(Note: All imports (286,291 MT) went toward animal feed.  End 
note.) 
 
 
Consumption from local, mechanized farmers: 10,000 MT for 
human consumption 
21,818 MT for animal feeds 
 
 
Consumption from local, non-mechanized farmers: 454,627 MT 
for human consumption 
 
 
(Note: All figures are for yellow corn.  Consumption of white

Countries of origin: 
2,343 MT from the US 
2,381 MT from Holland 
1,056 MT from Canada 
25 MT from other countries 
 
 
(Note: While small, the potato industry continues to be 
protected by MIDA.  Since December 2003, MIDA initially 
refused to grant import licenses for frozen french fries on 
two separate occasions.  After Embassy intervention, the 
permits were issued.  The Embassy also notes that the 
issuance of such permits for franchises serving frozen french 
fries has never been disrupted.  The last Embassy 
intervention, negative press, and discussions between US and 
Panama at the WTO negotiating session on Food Aid in Geneva 
have prompted GOP officials and interested parties to seek a 
resolution to the problem. End note.)

Classified By: AMBASSADOR LINDA WATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) The prospect of a PRD government assuming power on 
September 1 is high, barring an unforeseen development. 
Martin Torrijos enjoys a big lead in the polls barely four 
weeks before Panama\'s May 2 presidential election.  According 
to many observers, Martin has consolidated his control over 
the PRD after wresting it away from former president Ernesto 
Perez Balladares (EPB).  Today\'s PRD, dominated by Martin and 
his friends, is quite different from the 1979-1989 political 
arm of the now-defunct Panama Defense Forces and dictators 
Omar Torrijos (Martin\'s father) and Manuel Noriega.  Embassy 
believes that Torrijos will keep PRD radicals -- the 
anti-U.S. nationalist/leftist intellectuals known as \"La 
Tendencia\" -- and high-level EPB supporters on the sidelines. 
 A Torrijos government would actively pursue and advance 
shared bilateral interests in security and law enforcement 
matters and free trade policy, and views Canal expansion as a 
priority.  Whether and to what degree Torrijos will be an 
effective agent of anti-corruption and social change in 
Panama remains to be seen.  End Summary 
 
 
Martin\'s PRD 
------------ 
2.  (SBU) With over 400,000 members, the PRD is Panama\'s 
oldest, biggest, most disciplined, and best organized 
political party.  (See Ref A).  PRD candidates garnered 33% 
of the presidential vote in 1994 and 38% in 1999, when Martin 
Torrijos lost to Mireya Moscoso.  Although EPB kept control 
of the party during Martin Torrijos\'s failed 1999 
presidential bid, Torrijos wrested it away from him later 
that year and has effectively controlled it ever since. 
Martin has democratized the party, which now chooses its 
candidates in open primaries.  At the same time, he has 
promoted his close friends and schoolmates, many of whom have 
strong U.S. connections like himself, to positions of 
prominence.  Although a last-minute \"April surprise\" is not 
out of the question, all indications suggest that Martin 
Torrijos will defeat his opponents by a solid margin.  As the 
youngest candidate in the race, Torrijos (age 40) appeals to 
Panama\'s thousands of youthful voters.  (Note: Over 55% of 
Panama\'s registered voters are under 40 years old.  End 
Note.)  The PRD also looks set to control the Legislative 
Assembly, possibly with the help of its Partido Popular (PP) 
ally. 
 
 
Who is Martin Torrijos? 
----------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Martin Torrijos is running for president of Panama 
because of his last name.  The son of Panamanian dictator 
Omar Torrijos and Xenia Espino, a former Air Panama flight 
attendant who was not his wife, Martin Torrijos was born in 
1963.  Omar Torrijos recognized Martin as his son when he was 
in his teens, and sent him to St. John\'s Military Academy in 
Wisconsin.  Martin, who spent ages 15-29 (1978-1992) mostly 
in the United States, earned bachelors degrees from Texas A&M 
in political science (1986) and economics (1988).  (He 
married Vivian Fernandez Bello, whose parents are Cuban, in 
1990.  They have three children, Daniella, Martin Jr., and 
Nicolas.)  Until EPB called him back to Panama to help 
reorganize the PRD in 1992, Martin spent four years managing 
a McDonald\'s restaurant in Chicago.  Martin eventually became 
PRD Youth Committee chairman.  When EPB became president in 
1994, he named Martin as vice minister of government and 
justice.  After EPB lost a 1998 referendum to permit him to 
run for another term, EPB grudgingly allowed Torrijos to run 
for president in 1999. 
 
 
A Credible Democratic Ally 
-------------------------- 
4.  (C) The PRD under Torrijos has forged an electoral 
alliance with the Partido Popular (the ex-Christian 
Democrats), historically the fiercest and most consistent foe 
of Panama\'s military governments and the PRD.  The PP\'s 
retired chief, ex-vice president Ricardo Arias Calderon, 
recently told POL Counselor, that he initially shunned 
Torrijos, as the son of the dictator who exiled him from 
Panama in 1969 but he changed his mind after meeting Martin. 
\"I made a mistake,\" Arias Calderon said.  \"He\'s (Martin) a 
good man.  He\'s the son of his mother, not the son of his 
father.\"  Martin sometimes is excessively cautious and takes 
too long to make decisions, the veteran politician added, but 
he has demonstrated his political \"claws\" in taming the PRD 
to his will. 
 
 
Torrijos, the PRD, and U.S, Interests 
------------------------------------- 
5.  (C) Martin Torrijos has shown every indication of his 
intention and his ability to work closely with U.S. officials 
should he and his party assume the presidency.  His advisors 
have told us that Martin\'s supreme foreign policy priority is 
to maintain good relations with the United States, pursuing 
mutual interests in security and law enforcement matters, 
free trade, and Canal expansion.  (Note: Embassy is doing due 
diligence on rumors of possible choices for key positions in 
a future government.  See Ref C.  EmbOffs will use the four 
months between the May 2 election and the September 1 
inauguration to bolster contacts with whichever party wins so 
that we can ensure a smooth transition to the new 
administration.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Good Choices for VP 
------------------- 
6.  (C) Most observers agree that Martin made good VP 
choices.  For first vice president, he chose non-politician 
Samuel Lewis Navarro, son of former Noriega foreign minister 
(later anti-Noriega exile) Gabriel Lewis Galindo.  The PRD\'s 
chief \"Gringo handler,\" the articulate, intelligent, pro-U.S. 
Lewis Navarro is a successful businessman with multi-national 
interests in fruit and packaging.  He also is rumored as 
Martin\'s first choice for foreign minister.  (See Ref B.) 
Martin\'s candidate for second vice president is soft-spoken 
Partido Popular chief Ruben Arosemena.  Arosemena is rumored 
to be slated for anti-corruption coordinator in a Torrijos 
government. 
 
 
Martin\'s Anti-Corruption Credentials 
------------------------------------ 
7.  (C) Martin has little credibility so far on his pledge to 
reduce corruption.  The prior PRD administration under EPB 
was notably corrupt and after five years out of power, PRD 
stalwarts are hungry for power and its perquisites, observers 
say.  Martin\'s first cousin, Hugo Torrijos, until recently 
Martin\'s campaign manager and finance chief, is heavily 
implicated in a multi-million dollar scandal involving Ports 
Engineering and Construction Company (PECC -- See Ref  D). 
Many observers think that Martin himself may be implicated in 
the multi-million dollar CEMIS scandal (although we have not 
seen any evidence yet to support these allegations).  Martin 
is rumored to have a mutual non-prosecution pact with Mireya 
Moscoso.  Martin skillfully handled the PRD primaries, but 
opponents have criticized him for promising government jobs 
to primary losers to keep them in the party. 
 
 
A Dictator\'s Creation 
--------------------- 
8.  (SBU) The Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD) was 
founded on October 3, 1979 as the political arm of the Panama 
Defense Forces, eleven years after an October 1968 military 
coup brought the military to power, and one year after the 
Carter-Torrijos treaties forced dictator Omar Torrijos to 
tolerate the reemergence of political parties.  The PRD 
flourished under the military, who used it to staff a bloated 
government bureaucracy, supply puppet presidents, distribute 
patronage, and spy on the populace.  Through a rigged and 
repressed political system, the PRD provided Panama\'s 
dictators with a democratic \"cover story\" and 
\"anti-imperialist\" (read anti-U.S.) ideology and rhetoric to 
enhance their image and lend them international 
respectability. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) After Operation Just Cause ended Panama\'s 
dictatorship in December 1989, the PRD lapsed into sullen 
opposition and disarray, and led violent but politically 
fruitless anti-U.S. demonstrations to protest the loss of 
life associated with the U.S. invasion.  In 1994, former 
close Noriega crony Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB) squeaked 
by to win the presidential election with just 33% of the vote 
in a crowded and divided field. 
Dictator Dad 
------------ 
10.  (C) A 2004 PRD campaign poster attempt\'s to capitalize 
on Omar\'s lingering mystique with certain voters, showing 
Martin giving a speech superimposed on a photo of his 
uniformed dictator dad puffing on a cigar.  Despite his role 
in the destruction of Panama\'s democracy, Omar Torrijos (who 
died in a 1981 plane crash) was popular with poor 
Panamanians, who saw him as the scourge of the traditional 
\"rabiblanco\" (\"white-tailed\") upper class.  Omar Torrijos 
connived with the rich, bankrupted the country and stole it 
blind, while engaging in drug running and other kinds of 
criminal activities, but many poorer Panamanians benefited 
from his policies to expand the bureaucracy and to reduce 
racial discrimination.  The core PRD constituency is still 
about one-third of the electorate.  But at least one-third of 
Panamanians regard the PRD as an anathema and they would 
never vote for it. 
 
 
What About \"La Tendencia\"? 
-------------------------- 
11.  (C) The PRD, Panama\'s oldest party, ran the government 
for 15 years (1979-89 and 1994-99), much longer than any 
other Panamanian party.  Many former high PRD officials were 
associated with an internal grouping of anti-U.S. \"leftist,\" 
pro-dictatorship intellectuals known as \"La Tendencia.\" 
Although the term is less often used today than in the past, 
most of the individuals associated with La Tendencia are 
still around.  An informal rule-of thumb puts internal PRD 
support for La Tendencia at 15-20% and for EPB at around 20%, 
leaving the pro-Torrijos faction with 60-65%. 
 
 
EPB \"in a Box\" 
-------------- 
12.  (C) Ambitious, arrogant, corrupt, wily former president 
Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB), who openly flaunts his 
ill-gotten wealth, is still a force to be reckoned with in 
the PRD, although his political career has fizzled.  EPB 
wants to be president again, although he lost a 1998 
referendum to permit him to hold two terms by a 3-to-1 
margin, and he still has his sights set on the 2009 election. 
 To that end he repeatedly attempted to sabotage Martin 
Torrijos\'s nomination and campaign, believing that his 
re-election prospects are better if a PRD candidate does not 
win in 2004.  (Comment: The Department revoked EPB\'s visa in 
2000 for alien smuggling, which became a high-profile case in 
Panama and makes EPB\'s prospects for re-election even more 
remote.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Love-Hate 
--------- 
13.  (C) Observers say that EPB and Martin Torrijos have a 
love-hate relationship.  EPB was instrumental in launching 
Martin\'s career but would have tried to control him if he had 
become president in 1999.  Although he is wary of EPB, Martin 
cannot afford to antagonize EPB and his supporters during an 
election campaign, and EPB will need Martin\'s good graces for 
his future political plans.  Therefore the two have been 
careful not to antagonize each other, despite their mutual 
mistrust.  Observers have given Martin high marks for 
managing EPB, and for bringing a sizable number of former EPB 
supporters to his side. 
 
 
14.  (C) Martin also reportedly has \"bottled up\" former EPB 
cabinet loyalists (and U.S. betes noires) Mitchel Doens and 
Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, marginalizing them from the party 
mainstream decision-making process.  (Comment: We also 
understand that ex-EPB foreign ministers Jorge Ritter and 
Ricardo Alberto Arias, vocal anti-U.S. nationalists who in 
the late 1990s opposed establishing a U.S.-backed 
anti-narcotics center in Panama, have put the past behind 
them and are ready to work with us if the PRD wins.  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
Worth Watching: A \"New\" Balbina Herrera 
--------------------------------------- 
15.  (C) An ambitious PRD legislator with known presidential 
ambitions and links to \"La Tendencia,\" Balbina Herrera is a 
savvy political operator, well on her way to becoming one of 
the most powerful women in Panama.  She is number-two in 
command of the party and, if Martin is elected president, 
will become acting secretary general and will gain the 
ability to control PRD appointments to the government, 
payroll, and PRD \"businesses.\"  Observers speculate that her 
ambitions may run afoul of Vivian Torrijos, who also will 
become one of Panama\'s most powerful women if her husband 
becomes president. 
 
 
The Proof is in the Pudding 
--------------------------- 
16.  (C) Many observers are convinced that Martin Torrijos 
means what he says about \"leading by example.\"  But he cannot 
govern by himself.  As we have repeatedly told PRD leaders, 
including Torrijos, the U.S. will judge his government (or 
whoever wins the elections) by the quality of appointments to 
top positions and by the willingness of these individuals to 
work with us in areas of mutual interest, especially on 
security, law enforcement, and trade/investment matters. 
While we believe Torrijos is truly committed to establishing 
good relations with us, we are less certain of his ability to 
deliver quality people in key positions.  Nevertheless, we 
will continue to hammer home the importance that we attach to 
a mutually beneficial relationship, and that we are prepared 
to work constructively with whichever party wins on May 2.

Summary 
------- 
 
 
1. (U) PolOffs recently toured Panama\'s Herrera and Los 
Santos provinces, meeting with Herrera\'s Electoral Tribunal 
Regional Director Hector Paulette, Arnulfista Party 
legislative challenger Pacifico Escalona and Revolutionary 
Democratic Party (PRD) Herrera elections coordinator Reynaldo 
Salerno.  Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, native 
daughter of Pedasi, Los Santos, has spent nearly every 
weekend during her term in the region, making it an even 
greater Arnulfista stronghold than before.  Arnulfista 
legislative candidates should win at least three seats out of 
the two provinces\' six.  If Arnulfista legislative candidates 
do well in the May 2 general elections, Arnulfista 
presidential candidate Jose Miguel Aleman could eke out a win 
in the Azuero.  Many voters will vote Arnulfista for 
legislature but could choose PRD presidential candidate 
Martin Torrijos for president. 
 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
 
2. (U) Among Panama\'s smallest provinces, Herrera and Los 
Santos (on the country\'s southwestern Azuero peninsula), only 
account for 4.0% and 3.5% of the national electorate, 
respectively.  In this rugged, cattle ranching part of the 
country, Panama\'s Liberal parties (in the European sense) 
have traditionally won at the polls.  These include the 
Arnulfista Party and the National Liberal Republican Movement 
(MOLIRENA).  Speaking with local Latino farmers, an observer 
notes continued animosity toward deceased dictator General 
Omar Torrijos\' long-past, heavy-handed policies.  His 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is popular only in 
isolated pockets.  In 1999, Panamanian President Mireya 
Moscoso, native daughter of Pedasi, Los Santos, won the 
Azuero by a whopping 11,248 votes, running against native son 
PRD presidential candidate (then and now) Martin Torrijos 
from Chitre, Herrera.  Three of the region\'s legislators are 
Arnulfistas; two are PRD; and one is from the Solidarity 
Party.  Each province has three legislators. 
 
 
----------------- 
Reverse Coattails 
----------------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) PolOffs met with Arnulfista legislative challenger 
Pacifico Escalona (former Governor of Herrera and brother of 
Minister of Government and Justice (MOGJ) Arnulfo Escalona), 
who is running against Solidarity legislative incumbent 
Alberto Magno Castillero.  According to Menalco Solis, 
campaign manager for Solidarity\'s presidential candidate 
Guillermo Endara, Castillero is popular in the circuit, and 
Solidarity is counting on him to win.  However, the 
Arnulfistas\' Escalona is carpet bombing the circuit with 
posters on every electric pole and radio advertisements 
averaging every few minutes.  He claimed that his internal 
polls show him way ahead Castillero.  Admittedly, Escalona 
appears strong, particularly with the 18-30 age group, which 
accounts for about 50% of the Azuero vote, according to 
Herrera\'s Electoral Tribunal Regional Director Hector 
Paulette. 
 
 
4. (SBU) PRD Herrera elections coordinator Reynaldo Salerno 
reluctantly agreed with Escalona\'s confident assessment. 
According to both Arnulfista and PRD contacts, Arnulfista 
legislative candidates Escalona, Jose Luis \"Popi\" Varela and 
Carlos Afu are sure to win.  Escalona and Salerno also agreed 
that one PRD candidate is a shoo-in.  A fourth Arnulfista is 
a favorite for the region\'s fifth slot, and a coalition 
partner MOLIRENA challenger is in a close race for the sixth. 
 Torrijos plans to fight back in the Azuero with several 
scheduled visits in the campaign\'s remaining month, including 
a closing campaign rally. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Arnulfista presidential hopeful Jose Miguel Aleman, 
according to his campaign manager Carlos Raul Piad, is 
counting on an apparent legislative \"full house\" to sweep him 
to victory in Herrera and Los Santos, where the electorate 
traditionally votes for the entire party slate.  However, 
Aleman\'s registered party base (his floor) only accounts for 
about 20% of the Herrera electorate and 25% of the Los Santos 
electorate, slightly below the PRD\'s registered party base. 
Three of the Arnulfista legislative candidates have no 
political allegiance to Aleman (much less personal or 
professional scruples) and are not pushing supporters to vote 
for the top of their ticket.  Panamanian President Mireya 
Moscoso has a personal stake in two of the Arnulfistas and 
has spent political capital on the third; however, her 
support for Aleman has been ineffective thus far.  Many 
independent voters (about half of the Azuero electorate) are 
expected to vote Arnulfista for legislature but then vote 
Torrijos (or no one at all) for president.

------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1)  (SBU)  On April 1, 2004, officials from the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the 
Government of Panama (GOP) agreed to the establishment of a 
permanent UNHCR office in Panama, capping many months of 
negotiation.  The GOP, UNHCR, and the Government of Colombia 
(GOC) will conduct a joint census of the remaining Colombian 
refugees beginning April 7, 2004.  The GOP is considering 
centralizing the remaining refugees in three Darien province 
towns through a voluntary process.  The GOP\'s refugee status 
commission will meet May 27, 2004, but UNHCR wants the GOP to 
take a more flexible approach for granting refugees internal 
freedom of movement.  Infrastructure and sustainable 
development projects under discussion will seek funding 
through the Department\'s Ambassador\'s fund and/or via UNHCR. 
End Summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
A PERMANENT HOME FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE 
-------------------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU)  On April 1, 2004 the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Americas Director Hope 
Hanlon and UNHCR Panama director Gonzalo Vargas Llosa along 
with Minister of Foreign Relations Harmodio Arias signed an 
agreement establishing a permanent UNHCR Panama office.  The 
UNHCR in Panama is now a fully independent and accredited UN 
agency.  The Geneva-based Hanlon noted during an April 1 
meeting with POL Counselor that the agreement placed no 
restrictions on the UNHCR or its operations. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
REFUGEE CENSUS, PROPOSED RELOCATION 
----------------------------------- 
3.  (SBU)  The GOP, the Government of Colombia (GOC) and 
UNHCR will conduct a joint census of the Colombian refugee 
population April 7, 2004.  In addition, the GOP is proposing 
to relocate Colombian refugees to three Darien towns (Jaque, 
Puerto Obaldia, and El Real) to provide better security and 
social services.  The GOC and UNHCR are adamant that 
relocations are voluntary. GOP refugee agency (ONPAR) 
director Harmodio Jimenez confirms all relocations must be 
voluntary.  (NOTE:  In all likelihood, very few refugees will 
want to be relocated.  End Note.)  It is unlikely there will 
be further repatriations of refugees to Colombia as neither 
government has expressed a desire to conduct one. 
 
 
----------------- 
PROPOSED PROJECTS 
----------------- 
4.  (SBU)  Infrastructure and sustainable development 
projects will be proposed in the near future.  Department\'s 
regional refugee coordinator is working with Embassy-Panama, 
UNHCR, and the GOP developing to develop project proposals to 
assist Darien communities with Colombian refugee populations. 
 Some infrastructure projects (such as additions to a health 
center) could receive funding through the Department\'s 
Ambassador\'s fund.  Sustainable development projects (such as 
job creation programs) would be supported via UNHCR special 
funding requests.  Links to existing USAID programs will be 
considered to approve project effectiveness. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
FREE MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES IN PANAMA 
----------------------------------- 
5.  (SBU)  After an inconclusive March 2004 meeting of the 
GOP\'s refugees status commission, another commission hearing 
is scheduled for May 27, 2004.  Panama\'s Migration Department 
remains a UNHCR concern.  UNHCR believes some Migration 
officials are resisting fair and equitable refugee status 
decisions.  As previously reported, (Ref A), some Migration 
officials still resist UNHCR\'s presence and believe there are 
significant security issues linked to the Colombian refugees. 
 UNHCR believes it is unlikely that the refugee status 
commission will function effectively during the current 
administration due to Migration\'s \"roadblocks.\"  UNHCR 
believes the $600 (US) migrant processing fees, paid by all 
migrants, is limiting refugee case applications.  The GOP 
insists the fee is a statutory requirement.  (NOTE:  A person 
with formal refugee status has the freedom to live and work 
anywhere in Panama.  Persons without formal refugee status 
must get police permission for any travel, even to the next 
town.  End Note.) 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
6.  (SBU)  Embassy Panama is pleased to report a dramatic 
turnaround in UNHCR and GOP relations and refugee affairs 
generally.  During the past six months the GOP has conducted 
repatriations that comply with international norms, hired an 
ONPAR director truly interested in refugee issues, and built 
a close working relationship with UNHCR.  Department support 
for crucial infrastructure and sustainable development 
projects will demonstrate USG\'s continued interest in refugee 
assistance and the Darien province.

SUMMARY: Arms Trafficker Walks 
------------------------------ 
1. (C) Citing \"lack of jurisdiction,\" by an 8-1 vote, 
Panama\'s Supreme Court has terminated Public Ministry 
investigations of all charges against Israeli national Shimon 
Yalin Yelinek, currently residing in Panama, for his alleged 
role in smuggling Nicaraguan military weapons to the 
paramilitary United Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).  More 
than one source has alleged that all eight justices who voted 
for the decision received bribes. With the Supreme Court\'s 
action, announced in print and television media during the 
week of March 29, there are no other charges pending against 
Yelinek in Panama or any other country, including the United 
States.  (NOTE: Yelinek is the subject of an ongoing DEA 
money laundering investigation. END NOTE.)  Nicaraguan 
authorities have not brought charges against Yelinek or any 
Otterloo defendants, while Colombian authorities have charged 
two Otterloo defendants, but not Yelinek, GOP sources told 
EmbOffs.  Embassy is assessing appropriate responses to the 
Court\'s latest questionable decision, which has brought this 
institution to a new low in terms of credibility.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
The lone dissenting opinion 
--------------------------- 
2. (C) The Supreme Court\'s decision that Panamanian Courts 
have no jurisdiction in the Otterloo case surprised many 
observers, given the fact that the defendants had been 
charged with falsifying Panamanian National Police documents 
and using a Panamanian flagged vessel, owned by a company 
headquartered in Panama.  Lone dissenting Supreme Court 
Justice Adan Arnulfo Arjona (please protect) told AID 
Director on April 1 that the majority ruled on issues he 
believes should have been left to lower courts. 
 
 
3. (C) Arjona lamented that since taking leadership of the 
Court in January 2004, Supreme Court President Cesar Pereira 
Burgos is making the Court\'s decisions and operations more 
and more opaque, restricting public access to Court opinions 
and doing away with internet publication of rulings, the 
latter an AID-funded initiative the Court took under Arjona. 
Arjona criticized Pereira for having ruled differently on two 
nearly identical cases.  An April 4 La Prensa article cites 
the same two cases, and chides the Court for lack of 
consistency, comparing Court decision-making to a child 
picking petals from a daisy.  Under Pereira, the Court has 
rejected any reliance on precedent, calling into doubt this 
institution\'s credibility with the Panamanian public. 
 
 
Who is Carlos Carrillo? 
----------------------- 
4. (C) Arjona alerted AID Director that Yelinek\'s Panamanian 
lawyer, Carlos E. Carrillo, is one to watch.  Carrillo is the 
attorney who defended sitting Legislator Pedro Miguel 
Gonzalez, wanted for the 1992 murder of U.S. Army Sargeant 
Zak Hernandez (Ref. D), and then helped prosecute former 
Judicial Technical Police Director Jaime Abad on trumped up 
charges of evidence tampering. (Abad had led the 
investigation in the Gonzalez case).  Carrillo also 
represented alleged CEMIS bag-man and PRD Legislator Mateo 
Castillero.  (NOTE: The CEMIS scandal involved another 
Supreme Court decision that has raised concerns about 
corruption within this institution. See Reftel C for details. 
END NOTE.)  Recently Carrillo has represented the sister of 
drug trafficker Jesus Arcangel Henao Montoya as well former 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB) in other 
controversial cases tried before Panama\'s Supreme Court. 
(EPB won his case, and it appears that Lorena Henao Montoya 
also will.) 
Case Details 
------------ 
5. (S) According to reftel B, in November 2001, the suspect 
cargo vessel Otterloo, delivered from Puerto El Bluff, 
Nicaragua, to Turbo, Colombia, 14 containers of Nicaraguan 
military weapons -- approximately 3,000 AK-M rifles and five 
million rounds of ammunition.  In January 2002, the 
Panamanian National Police (PNP) seized and searched the 
Otterloo in Panamanian waters after receiving a tip from 
Colombian authorities.  The guns and ammo never were 
recovered, but the size and nature of the shipment were 
pieced together by police work and intel reports.  The PNP 
discovered two conflicting sets of cargo records and took 
statements from the ship\'s crew regarding the Otterloo\'s true 
cargo.  Nicaraguan officials then produced a weapons purchase 
order allegedly authorized by mid-level PNP officials that 
was later proved to be a forgery.  The document was traced to 
Shimon Yalin Yelinek and two Israeli nationals residing in 
Guatemala.  Yelinek faced charges in Panama for forgery and 
conspiracy in the illegal shipment of weapons and was 
released on $750,000 bail.  A specially formed OAS commission 
implicated Yelinek, but exonerated Panamanian authorities. 
 
 
6. (C) The Supreme Court\'s majority decision to quash the 
Yelinek case cites a lack of evidentiary ties (nexus) to 
Panama to allow Panama\'s Supreme Court to assert 
jurisdiction.  The justices ruled that there is no evidence 
that meetings took place in Panama to purchase the weapons 
and ammunition, that the purchase order was not issued in 
Panama, and dismissed forgery charges.  The ruling ignores 
the Otterloo\'s Panamanian flag (and legal responsibilities 
under that registry) and the fact that the forged purchase 
order was a Panamanian National Police (PNP) document. 
 
 
Comment: Next Steps 
------------------- 
7. (C) In yet another example of Panama\'s Supreme Court 
deep-sixing a high profile corruption case on trumped-up 
technicalities, Panamanians are becoming increasingly 
disenchanted with their high court.  (NOTE: Panama\'s press 
closely covered the Yelinek case and reported a blow-by-blow 
of bribery accusations and deliberations in the equally 
egregious multi-million CEMIS case, which the Supreme Court 
threw out on September 17, 2003. END NOTE.)  Despite his 
insistence that complainants exhaust all other options before 
filing constitutional claims with the Supreme Court, Pereira 
accepted another particularly contentious case, ordering the 
immediate release of Former President Perez Balladares\' 
assets, which the Comptroller General\'s office froze based on 
EPB\'s ties to the PECC scandal. (See Reftel D.) 
 
 
8. (C) DEA\'s investigation of Yelinek continues.  DEA Panama 
has requested the assistance of DOJ\'s Assets Forfeiture Money 
Laundering (AFML) Section for an eventual prosecution in the 
United States.  Despite reports that Yelinek is trying to 
\"expedite\" his naturalization as a Panamanian citizen, high 
GOP officials are apparently angry with the ruling and 
seeking to have Yelinek\'s residency revoked in order to expel 
him from Panama.  Panama\'s constitution prohibits extradition 
of Panamanian citizens, which would complicate future US 
prosecution of a case against him if he were to gain 
citizenship. 
 
 
9. (C) We believe that this type of egregious corruption in 
the courts poses a threat to U.S. economic and security 
interests in Panama.  Unfortunately, decisions driven by 
factors other than jurisprudence are seen at all levels of 
Panama\'s judicial system.  The lack of positive role models 
at the top appears to drive the lack of political will among 
leaders to tackle fundamental weaknesses in the judiciary. 
Expressions of USG concern would have the greatest 
demonstration effect if directed at the top of the judicial 
hierarchy.  Thus, Embassy is including whether a 212(f) visa 
revocation would be appropriate for any of the individuals 
involved in this case in its assessment of options for 
responding to the Supreme Court\'s latest dubious decision. 
Another option we will consider is suspending USAID\'s 
assistance to the Supreme Court, channeling it instead to 
civil society.

SUBJECT: PANAMA PUBLIC OPINION POLLS NOT DEPENDABLE 
INDICATORS OF ELECTION RESULTS 
 
 
SUMMARY: POLLS DON\'T PICK PRESIDENTS 
------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Panama\'s nationally-published public opinion polls 
are probably biased, do not offer a dependable measure of 
Panamanians\' voting preferences, and probably will not 
accurately predict outcomes for the May 2 elections.  While 
we still think Martin Torrijos will win the May 2, 2004 
presidential vote, in 1994 and 1999, public opinion polls 
published in Panama dailies failed to correctly rank 
presidential candidates, or even predict the winner.  For 
instance, in this year\'s race Partido Arnulfista (PA) 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman only escaped single-digit 
opinion poll rankings in January 2004, but his alliance has 
401,225 registered voters (among an electorate of almost 2 
million potential voters).  Revolutionary Democratic Party 
(PRD) candidate Martin Torrijos, whose party has 434,000 
registered voters, remains the front-runner by any measure, 
but former President Guillermo Endara\'s \"lead\" over Aleman is 
dubious. End Summary. 
 
 
 
 
ABOUT THE PUBLISHED POLLS 
------------------------- 
2. (SBU) There are two main reasons that polls in Panama 
inaccurately predict electoral results.  First, while 75% of 
Panama\'s registered voters will vote, guessing who will and 
who won\'t vote is nearly impossible for pollsters.  Second, 
party affiliation in Panama is crucial for many voters, but 
polls often can\'t capture the vote-winning potential of 
candidates who are backed by coalitions with large numbers of 
loyal members. 
 
 
3. (U) The CID Gallup poll (published in El Panama America) 
and the Dichter & Neira poll (published in La Prensa) have 
the longest track records, but they mis-forecast electoral 
results in 1999.  Critics question their objectivity because 
they both perform for-fee services for specific political 
parties.  La Prensa founder Roberto Eisenmann had trumpeted 
the independence of Dichter & Neira, but PolOffs recently 
learned of candidates for whom Dichter & Neira provides 
private polling services.  Critics also assert that newspaper 
editors and publishers are biased, further threatening the 
credibility of poll results.  The Board of Directors of both 
La Prensa and El Panama America are packed with Torrijos 
supporters. 
 
 
4. (U) Polls failed to accurately predict voting results in 
Panama\'s two most recent national elections.  In 1999, public 
opinion polls showed Martin Torrijos (who finished second 
with 37.8% of the vote) leading Mireya Moscoso (who won with 
44.8%) until just two weeks before the elections.  Polls in 
1994 correctly pegged the winner, Ernesto Perez Balladares 
(EPB), but overestimated support for eventual third-place and 
fourth-place finishers Ruben Blades and Ruben Dario Carles to 
the detriment of Mireya Moscoso, who finished a close second. 
 
 
5. (SBU) The credibility of three other public opinion polls 
with shorter track records is also in doubt.  Recently formed 
PSM Siglo Dos, which publishes results in top selling tabloid 
La Critica, also does private polling for Torrijos\' 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) and its candidates.  The 
intellectual author of El Siglo\'s monthly \"2004 Political 
Monitor\" is former PRD activist Jaime Porcell and El Siglo 
President Ebrahim Asvat openly advocates for Martin Torrijos. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Unlike most other polls, the \"Decision 2004\" poll, 
published consistently in La Estrella de Panam, shows 
Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara well behind Arnulfista 
Jose Miguel Aleman.  La Estrella\'s bias toward the Moscoso 
administration is so well known that even Aleman\'s campaign 
manager recently told PolOff that Aleman decided not to place 
an anti-Torrijos advertisement there since, \"people would 
laugh at us if we published it in La Estrella.\" 
 
 
NOT EVERYONE VOTES 
------------------ 
6. (SBU) May 2, 2004 voting results probably will differ 
markedly from pre-election polls because the pollsters have 
not yet learned to identify likely voters.  (Perhaps 25-30% 
of registered voters will not vote.)  In addition, some 
Arnulfistas allege that lingering memories of Panama\'s 
21-year military dictatorship make some respondents reluctant 
to reveal their true voting preference to pollsters. 
Fourth-place candidate Ricardo Martinelli hired a firm to 
perform a \"likely voter\" poll, which clearly predicted a 
Torrijos win.  It prompted Martinelli\'s campaign manager to 
tell PolOff, \"unless the U.S. Government declares Torrijos a 
national enemy, and maybe not even then, he\'ll be Panama\'s 
next President.\" 
 
 
CORE MEMBERSHIP DRIVES PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
---------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Historically, core supporters of the PRD and the PA 
tend to vote for whoever is running on their party\'s slate. 
The following figures recount how the seven parties fared in 
presidential voting during Panama\'s 1994 and 1999 general 
elections: 
 
 
  PARTY                                     1994    1999 
  -----                                     ----    ---- 
  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)     30.0%   31.0% 
  Arnulfista Party (PA)                    19.8%   28.7% 
  Liberal Republican Movement (MOLIRENA)   10.8%   10.9% 
  Popular Party (PP)                        2.4%   10.6% 
  Solidarity Party (PS)                     1.7%    4.9% 
  National Liberal Party (PLN)              ***     2.8% 
  Democratic Change Party (CD)              ***     2.8% 
  *** Neither the PLN nor CD existed in 1994. 
 
 
On May 2, 2004, the PP probably will be lucky to survive as a 
party with 4% of the vote (as required under Panama\'s 
electoral law), while Solidarity will do much better, with 
former president Guillermo Endara as its standard bearer. 
 
 
8. (SBU) The PRD, with its sophisticated electoral machine, 
has assigned teams in each administrative division to make 
sure local party members have transportation to the polls 
(and a free meal in many cases).  The Arnulfistas are 
preparing for the elections much like the PRD.  During 
provincial trips, PolOffs observed that the Solidarity Party 
lacks the funds or manpower to develop the same sort of 
infrastructure at the local level, although Endara campaign 
officials stoutly maintain that they will get out the vote. 
 
 
MIGRANTS AND TURNCOATS 
---------------------- 
9. (SBU) Analogous more to snapshots than videos, polls 
cannot capture subtle changes in voter mood, due to 
candidates and voters migrating between parties or 
legislators who campaign hard for themselves but quietly 
endorse another party\'s candidate for President.  Migrations 
occur at the highest levels, like Torrijos\' first VP 
candidate Samuel Lewis Navarro, who left the Solidarity Party 
in late 2003 to join his friend Martin.  Mobile components of 
the electorate are typically non-core voters, many of whom 
register in a party only to support a pre-candidate who may 
eventually lose an internal race.  Those voters lose interest 
if their favorite candidate is no longer running and may not 
even vote.  For over a year, the PRD has been aware that 
Legislator Olivia de Pomares a supporter of former President 
Ernesto Perez Balladares (1994-99), hasn\'t lifted a finger to 
promote the candidacy of Martin Torrijos.  Arnulfista sources 
recently told PolOffs that Pomares and others are urging 
their supporters to vote for Aleman for President (a strategy 
aimed at setting the stage for another run for president by 
Perez Balladares in 2009). 
 
 
COMMENT: PREDICTION WRAP-UP 
--------------------------- 
10. (SBU) PolOffs have heard plausible arguments explaining 
why Torrijos, Endara, or Aleman (but not Martinelli) will win 
on May 2.  The polls meanwhile mostly show Torrijos well 
ahead, mostly agree that Endara is second, and Martinelli 
last.  A very dubious \"Decision 2004\" poll that La Estrella 
published on March 31 showed Aleman ahead of Endara by nearly 
24% and only a 2.1% gap between Torrijos (39.2%) and Aleman 
(37.1%).  Embassy believes Torrijos will win the presidency, 
but the Endara vs. Aleman battle for second-place is too 
close to call.

SUBJECT: PANAMA\'S TELECOM/TECH SECTOR: AN OVERVIEW 
 
 
1.  Summary: Panama\'s telecommunications and technology 
sector is growing, and now represents 6% of GDP.  The 
regulatory authority \"Ente\" has maintained a fairly good 
record for enforcement over the sector, though the former 
monopoly, Cable & Wireless Panama (CWP) has been slow in 
negotiating interconnection agreements.  Fixed-line services 
are dominated by CWP, though new entrants, including those 
offering internet phone calls, are beginning to compete in 
the market since deregulation in 2003.  Panama has no/no 
universal access fund.  Wireless telephony is a duopoly by 
CWP and BellSouth since the exit of trunking operator TriCom 
in March, but BellSouth may soon be sold to Telefonica. 
Internet service is widely available; e-government and 
e-commerce are still underused.  In sum, the GoP has proved 
to be forward thinking in telecom policy and had been 
somewhat successful in regulatory enforcement.  End Summary. 
 
 
------------------- 
Regulatory Overview 
------------------- 
 
 
2. Legislation passed in 1996 provided for the privatization 
of telecommunications services and the creation of an 
independent regulatory authority for public utility 
companies-- the Regulating Entity for Public Services (ERSP 
or \"Ente\").  Ente\'s role has increased in recent years, as 
telecommunication services now represent approximately 6% of 
Panama,s GDP and 80% of voice and internet traffic between 
North and South America pass through Panama\'s fiber optic 
hubs.  It controls the frequency spectrum, grants wireless 
concessions, and regulates tariffs under monopoly or 
non-competitive situations (otherwise the market will 
determine prices.)  It also has an enforcement mechanism. 
For example, Ente has fined former monopoly Cable & Wireless 
Panama (CWP) over $1 million since 2001, mostly for delays in 
implementing interconnection agreements with competitors.  In 
fact, Ente has had to intervene in over half of the 
interconnection negotiations between CWP and its competitors. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Fixed Line Services: Partially Deregulated 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
3. In May 1997, the Government of Panama sold a 49% stake in 
the national telephone company, INTEL, to Cable & Wireless of 
the United Kingdom for $651 million.  The government 
maintained a 49% of the shares with INTEL workers controlling 
the remaining 2%.  Under this arrangement, C&W gained 
operational control over the company and was granted an 
exclusive concession to offer basic telecommunications 
services until 2003.  The company was re-named Cable & 
Wireless Panama (CWP).  The company currently has 300,000 
subscribers; and claims to have invested $700 million in new 
infrastructure in Panama in past six years. 
 
 
4. On January 2, 2003, Panama liberalized local, long 
distance, and international fixed-line telecommunications 
services effectively ending C&W\'s monopoly.  Consumers are 
now allowed both contractual and immediate consumer options, 
allowing a choice on a per-call basis.  The contractual 
carrier provides billing for all services.  Metering is in 
second increments, and numbers are portable.  Nineteen local 
and international companies immediately applied to Ente to 
provide service; and by April of this year, more than 100 
operators had applied for basic service concessions. 
Although only five license holders have successfully 
negotiated interconnection agreements with C&W and only two 
are offering competitive service, the cost of an 
international call has decreased between 200% and 400% since 
the market opening in January 2003.  In March 2004, the GoP 
removed a $1 flat tax on all international phone calls and 
replaced it with a 12% per-minute tax, further reducing the 
cost of the call to the end consumer.  In spite of this, 
there were only 365,000 landline subscribers in Panama at the 
end of 2003, a drop of 100,000 since 1999, due mostly to 
increased mobile phone use. 
 
 
5.  Panama has no universal access fund, though the Ministry 
of Economy and Finance and Ente have been drafting a law on 
the issue since 2003.  Under the terms of its concession, CWP 
maintains 12,000 public phones throughout the country. The 
company estimates that 9,000 of those are net money losers, 
and calculates this \"subsidy\" to be over $40 million 
annually.  CWP expects to cease this subsidy when the terms 
of universal access are negotiated, likely to happen by the 
end of 2004. 
 
 
6.  Ente issued a resolution in October 2002 ordering 
Internet service providers in Panama to stop offering Voice 
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone calls, on the basis that 
the companies were not paying the dollar tax on international 
phone calls.  In November 2002, Panama\'s Supreme Court 
ordered an indefinite suspension of the resolution.  As of 
April, this suspension remained in effect, and will likely 
never be lifted, as VoIP providers are now included in the 
12% tax that replaced the dollar tax in March. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
Wireless: A Duopoly until 2007 
------------------------------ 
 
 
7.  The mobile market in Panama is currently served by a 
duopoly consisting of BellSouth and CWP.  In 1997 the two 
operators were granted concessions to provide mobile services 
in the A and B Bands, respectively.  The government will 
begin further liberalization of this sector in 2007 when it 
will auction nationwide PCS licenses.  As in much of Latin 
America, the wireless market has shown significant growth in 
Panama.  In 1999, there were 223,000 cellphone subscribers; 
in 2003 there were 810,000.  Mobile penetration exceeded 28% 
at the end of 2003.  Approximately 87% of the sector comes 
from pre-paid services with post-paid representing 13%.  At 
the end of 2003, market share was split 51% BellSouth to 49% 
CWP. Both operators have recently upgraded their 
networks*BellSouth to CDMA and CWP to GSM/GPRS. 
 
 
8.  BellSouth Panama is 56% owned by the Panamanian 
investment company Multiholdings Corporation (MHC) and 44% by 
BellSouth.  The joint venture paid $72 million for the 
concession in 1997.  BellSouth and MHC are currently in 
negotiations to sell all of the company or BellSouth\'s 
holdings to Telefonica of Spain for an undisclosed sum, 
though industry sources indicate that the sale price may be 
as high as $700 million. 
 
 
9.  In April 2001, Tricom, a Dominican Republic-based 
company, but 18% owned by Motorola Corporation and with 38% 
of its stock listed on the NYSE, entered the Panama market 
with the intent to offer cellular-like products based on IDEN 
digital trunking technology.  TriCom invested a total of $52 
million in infrastructure, employed 115 employees, and had 
11,000 users until March.  The company estimated its 2003 
revenue at $14 million.  BellSouth protested this service on 
the grounds that Tricom did not possess a mobile license and 
filed numerous legal suits against the company.  In March, 
TriCom closed its Panamanian operations due to the high legal 
costs and liquidity problems related to currency devaluation 
in the Dominican Republic, and sold its assets for $12.5 
million to a local investor who plans to transfer the 
equipment to Nicaragua.  Ironically, BellSouth now provides 
the same IDEN-based technology on its network. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Internet/Broadband Wireless, E-commerce/E-government 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
10.  Internet service is fairly widespread in Panama.  As of 
mid-2003, there were more than 250 internet cafes in Panama, 
charging rates as low as $1 per hour.   The GoP National 
Secretariat of Science, Innovation, and Technology (SENACYT) 
 
SIPDIS 
offers subsidized internet nodes throughout the country for 
students and teachers, especially in underserved areas, 
charging 25 cents per hour using VSAT satellite technology. 
For-fee services for cable modem, DSL, A/DSL, and dialup are 
also readily available.  Since January, hotspotpanama.com has 
offered seven broadband wireless (wi-fi) hot spots in Panama 
City. 
 
 
11.  In spite of easy access, e-commerce and e-government are 
still in their nascent stages.  Business to Consumer (B2C) 
e-commerce is almost nonexistent, with the exception of the 
country\'s three major supermarkets (even in this case, the 
market focuses more on expats who wish to send food instead 
of remittances to family members in Panama).  Almost all 
government agencies have an online web presence (accessible 
via www.pa), though the quality of content varies greatly. 
The Panama Canal Authority is the only GoP body to offer 
procurement opportunities completely online, however the GoP 
now publishes most public tenders online 
(www.e-compras.gob.pa) and is moving to make the process 
entirely electronic. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Comment: Moving forward slowly but surely 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
12.  Overall, Panama\'s telecom and technology sector is 
experiencing positive and continued growth.  The GoP has 
shown initiative to develop internet access generally and 
government information specifically.  The Ente has had some 
difficulty in reigning in the former monopoly CWP--especially 
given the conflict of interest posed by the GoP\'s 49% stake 
in the company, but also has proved that it has enforcement 
capability by issuing high fines to CWP for noncompliance.

SUMMARY/COMMENT: EVERYONE PREPARING 
----------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Panama\'s May 2 election - only three weeks away - 
is starting to concentrate minds.  The Electoral Tribunal 
is implementing fraud prevention procedures, informing 
voters, and fending off critics.  Electoral Prosecutor 
Gerardo Solis depoliticized his investigation of the 
Presidency\'s legal slush fund by postponing it until after 
the election.  Taking the opposite course, President 
Moscoso\'s entire cabinet publicly criticized Solis for 
exceeding his mandate under the constitution, a matter over 
which they have no authority.  Jose Miguel Aleman 
(Arnulfista) and Guillermo Endara (Solidarity) are 
attacking each other as they compete for the same anti-PRD 
voters.  With campaigning becoming more energetic and 
vigorous daily, Embassy still sees no indication that 
cheating or violence will mar May 2 polling. End Summary 
 
 
What - No Ink? 
-------------- 
2. (U) The Electoral Tribunal\'s 4/2 decision not to mark 
voters\' fingers with India ink after they vote on May 2 
provoked strong criticism and allegations of potential 
electoral fraud.  In previous elections, electoral 
officials marked each voter\'s index finger with indelible 
ink after he/she voted to prevent individuals from voting 
more than once.  Electoral Magistrates decided that new 
information systems could crosscheck voting records and 
easily identify anyone voting more than once.  Critics are 
concerned about identifying those using more than one 
identity cards, and that the lag between Election Day and 
data entry could delay definitive polling results; however, 
Magistrates Valdes and Allen strongly defended their 
decision.  They claimed that during the 1999 Elections, 
only 100 people voted more than once.  After the computer 
system caught them, they were brought to electoral trial, 
found guilty and sentenced. 
 
 
One at a time, please 
--------------------- 
3. (SBU) During a radio interview, Director for Education 
and Human Rights Promotion of the Ombudsman Office, Cesar 
Solano, announced that only blind individuals or those with 
motor impediments that limit their ability to write could 
be assisted at the voting booth.  People with any other 
type of disability can be assisted all the way to the 
voting area, but should be left alone once there to vote. 
The goal is to protect voting secrecy.  Solano shared 
privately with Embassy why the Electoral Tribunal and the 
Ombudsman\'s Office had addressed this issue.  He mentioned 
allegations in the 1999 elections that political parties 
abused this entitlement in the remote Veraguas province 9-3 
Electoral Circuit, \"escorting\" people without severe 
disabilities to the voting area and hovering over them at 
the voting booth. (See Reftel A.) 
 
 
Moscoso\'s Legal \"Secret\" Slush Fund: The Saga Continues 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
4. (SBU) Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis put the entire 
Moscoso cabinet in a tizzy this week.  On April 8, the 16- 
member cabinet made a joint statement that Solis\' 
insistence on inspecting Ministry of the Presidency expense 
records to look for evidence that discretionary 
presidential funds were used illegally, to fund political 
activities, is itself illegal, unconstitutional, and 
politically motivated.  On 4/5, Minister of the Presidency 
Mirna Pitti refused to answer Solis\' questionnaire 
regarding expenditures in her office, stating President 
Moscoso herself handles the funds.  Though Solis has no 
legal authority to investigate Moscoso herself, it is 
common knowledge the Minister of the Presidency manages the 
funds on a day-to-day basis. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Solis and others, including a former Electoral 
Magistrate and a former Supreme Court Justice, reacted by 
stating that Pitti cannot hide behind Moscoso and her 
Cabinet\'s position is wrong.  Solis reiterated that he is 
not assuming that there has been any wrongdoing with the 
fund, but the GOP\'s position not to reveal details is 
questionable.  Despite the Solis\'threat of immediate legal 
action, he stood down and publicly announced that he had 
returned the questionnaire to Pitti and set a deadline for 
her reply after May 2.  Solis justified his decision by 
saying that he does not want to influence the ongoing 
electoral process. 
 
 
Endara & Aleman tit for tat 
--------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Former President Guillermo Endara insists that he 
remains an Arnulfista, banking on disillusioned party 
members to support him.  Endara explained that he does not 
support Moscoso, so he is not a \"Mireyista.\"  Noting his 
Arnulfista roots, Endara said that he is not \"controlled by 
Moscoso or her corrupted inner circle.\"  Throughout the 
campaign, members of Jose Miguel Aleman\'s campaign team 
have feared that Arnulfistas, particularly the illiterate, 
could get confused and vote for Endara, believing that 
Endara (instead of Aleman) is the Arnulfista candidate. 
Endara\'s original attempt to win Arnulfista votes by using 
late President Arnulfo Arias\' image was censored by the 
Electoral Tribunal (ET), spurring Endara to criticize the 
institution.  Aleman\'s team has made a strong internal 
effort to inform rural Arnulfistas that Aleman, not Endara, 
is the party presidential candidate. 
 
 
7. (SBU) In a shameless vote-grabbing ploy, Arnulfista 
Presidential candidate Jose Miguel Aleman staged a photo-op 
with several Endara administration cabinet ministers, but 
many observers considered it distasteful that a son of one 
deceased cabinet member and the widow of another were 
included.  Former Housing Minister Guillermo Quijano, a 
well-known construction developer and TGI Friday\'s 
franchisee, \"reminded\" Panamanians of the unique and 
adverse conditions immediately after Operation Just Cause 
when they took office, highlighting how fit they left 
Panama at the end of their term.  But will that convince 
voters not to vote for Endara?  Endara\'s running mate 
Guillermo Ford responded that everyone in Endara\'s cabinet 
worked under direct instructions from President Endara and 
they should share credit with Endara for their 
accomplishments.  Ford encouraged Panamanians to vote for 
Endara on Election Day so the PRD could not take power. 
 
 
Another flawed opinion poll 
--------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Local company Investigacion y Mercadeo announced a 
poll using a new system.  The polling system was 
implemented jointly with U.S.-based Greenberg Research, 
known for its work on Bill Clinton\'s campaign.  Panama 
residents received computer-generated phone calls asking 
which presidential candidate they would vote for and to 
identify their choices by touch tone key.  The sampling 
methodology is questionable.  Four members of the Embassy 
Political Section found messages on their Embassy voicemail 
from the automated polling server upon arriving in the 
office on April 5.  Like other opinion polls in Panama, 
this one does not appear very trustworthy.  (See Reftel C.)

SOLIDARITY PARTY VEHICLE IN LAST HURRAH.  WHAT AN ENDARA 
PRESIDENCY WOULD MEAN FOR U.S. INTERESTS.

Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES CHRISTOPHER J. MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1. 
5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (SBU) His campaign may lack money and glitz and his poll 
numbers are stubbornly stuck in second place behind Martin 
Torrijos but former president Guillermo Endara (1989-1994) is 
confident his single-message campaign -- that he is Panama\'s 
only hope for honest government -- will catapult him to the 
presidency once more.  But many observers say that Endara had 
his chance already, and the time for Endara and his aging 
associates has past.  The most frankly protectionist of the 
four presidential candidates, Endara claims he wants a Free 
Trade Agreement that is good for the United States and for 
Panama.  Endara plans to cooperate closely with U.S. agencies 
on security and law enforcement.  He has said, if elected, he 
plans to put \"big wheels\" behind bars for corruption, and has 
mentioned President Mireya Moscoso by name.  The vehicle that 
67-year-old Endara has chosen for his presumably last foray 
into presidential politics, is Samuel Lewis Galindo\'s 
Solidarity Party, founded in 1993 as an anti-old-guard PRD 
offshoot, \"PRD lite\" as it is known in some circles.  The 
wily Lewis Galindo, who is 76, may be Panama\'s only 
politician who stands to lose nothing on May 2.  With Endara 
as its candidate (the latest poll gives him 29% of the vote), 
the party will easily pass the 4% bar it needs to survive and 
to secure a hefty electoral subsidy.  If Endara wins, 
Solidarity will become the ruling party (though without a 
majority in the legislature).  If he loses, as seems 
increasingly likely, the probable winner will be Martin 
Torrijos, whose vice presidential running mate, former 
Solidarity leader Samuel Lewis Navarro, is Galindo\'s nephew. 
 
 
2.  (C) From our perspective, the biggest potential drawback 
to an Endara government would be the lack of young 
technocrats needed to implement the policies that Panama 
needs to pursue.  Endara\'s principal policy advisors are well 
past their prime and many observers believe that a second 
Endara government would be even more lackluster than the 
first one (which missed many opportunities to change Panama\'s 
politics-as-usual).  End Summary. 
 
 
How To Stop the PRD? 
-------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Posing as the campaign\'s subversive in a field of 
four candidates, Endara is betting that a majority of voters 
will wake up on polling day (May 2) and ask themselves -- 
\"How can I stop the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and 
Martin Torrijos?\" -- and conclude Endara is their best hope, 
Endara\'s campaign manager and four-decade law partner Menalco 
Solis said.  In a recent meeting with POL Counselor, Solis 
claimed that Endara is only 7-8 percentage points behind PRD 
front-runner Martin Torrijos, about half what the polls 
indicate.  Solis explained that an Endara victory on May 2 
will hinge on what he called a \"historical tendency\" for the 
Torrijos campaign to collapse as election day nears, as he 
loses many voters who at the last minute cannot bring 
themselves to vote PRD.  Thousands of state workers will vote 
for Endara because they see him, not Arnulfista 
standard-bearer Jose Miguel Aleman, as their best bet to hold 
onto their jobs, which would be lost if the PRD wins, Solis 
reasoned. 
 
 
\"Incredible Enthusiasm\" 
----------------------- 
4.  (SBU) The polls may show Torrijos has nearly 50% of the 
vote, Solis said, but he argued that it just doesn\'t \"feel\" 
like one out of two Panamanians are really planning to vote 
for Martin.  On the contrary, the enthusiasm for Endara on 
the campaign trail has been \"unbelievable,\" he said.  Solis 
described how a crowd in Los Santos had waited in the sun 
over six hours for Endara to arrive.  People told Solis that 
the warmth of the crowds compares only to how Panamanians 
once greeted president Arnulfo Arias, the deceased husband of 
President Mireya Moscoso, Solis said. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) \"Mark my words,\" Solis said, \"when people see that 
they have a choice between Endara and the PRD, they\'ll vote 
against the PRD.\"  This is Endara\'s fifth electoral campaign, 
Solis said, and he\'s never been more optimistic about his 
chances on May 2 than this month.  Solis claimed Endara (who 
was president during 1989-1994) will carry the provinces of 
Panama, Colon, Chiriqui, Los Santos, Herrera, but not Cocle, 
Darien, or Comarca Kuna Yala, with Comarca Ngobe Bugle a toss 
up, and that Solidarity would elect 13-to-19 legislators. 
(Comment: Our own estimates differ sharply.  With the 
smallest electoral base of the three leading campaigns 
(73,000 registered members), we think Solidarity will be 
lucky to win six legislative seats, up from four presently. 
End Comment.) 
 
 
Endara: No Promises 
------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Endara refuses to make a lot of specific promises 
in the campaign, Solis continued (besides running an honest 
government, locking up corrupt bigwigs, and helping 
Panamanian farmers), because he does not have to.  His 
credibility and his honesty are his main assets.  Endara also 
has not asked big companies or wealthy individuals for 
contributions because he does not want to give the impression 
that he owes political favors to anyone.  Lack of money is 
not impeding Solidarity\'s plans to get its supporters to the 
polls, Solis claimed, somewhat improbably. 
 
 
Likely Appointees 
----------------- 
7.  (SBU) Endara has announced some names of people he plans 
to appoint to high office, such as first vice presidential 
running mate (former vice president, ambassador to the U.S.) 
Guillermo \"Billy\" Ford to head a reconstituted Planning 
Ministry; second vice presidential running mate (former 
agriculture minister) Alejandro Posse to head the agriculture 
ministry; (former Foreign Minister) Jose Raul Mulino to 
Foreign Minister; and Mercedes Arauz de Grimaldo to Attorney 
General.  Endara has identified a candidate to head the 
Panama National Police (PNP), whom Solis refused to name, and 
expects to send him to the United States for training 
immediately following the election. 
 
 
\"We\'ll Put Big Wheels In Jail\" 
------------------------------ 
8.  (SBU) As president, Endara will focus on fiscal rectitude 
and give his attorney general free rein to prosecute Panama\'s 
most egregiously corrupt politicians.  Endara has said 
publicly that he will not interfere with the attorney 
general\'s work but has named Mireya Moscoso, who will step 
down as president September 1, as one of the \"big wheels\" he 
aims to see behind bars.  He has said that he will end 
Parlacen (Central American Parliament) immunity for 
Panamanians.  (Note: Former president Ernesto Perez 
Balladares availed himself of Parlacen immunity and current 
president Mireya Moscoso has plans to do the same.) 
 
 
9.  (SBU) Endara also says he will sponsor a complete rewrite 
of the constitution.  When he was president, Endara tried to 
rewrite the constitution, which dates from the military 
dictatorship, through a badly drafted 1992 referendum, which 
failed with voters. 
 
 
New Party? 
---------- 
10.  (SBU) If elected, Endara probably will form a new 
political party, Solis said.  Endara believes that the 
Arnulfista Party, which he helped found, has outlived its 
usefulness and has become \"a bad word\" for the people due to 
corruption. 
 
 
Frankly Protectionist 
--------------------- 
11.  (SBU) Solis acknowledged Endara\'s frankly protectionist 
bias, especially on agriculture.  \"We are more protectionist 
than the other parties,\" he said.  Endara believes that 
Panamanian farmers must remain capable of producing staples 
(rice, beans, meat, etc.) to feed the population.  He also 
decried U.S. agricultural subsidies, claiming that opening 
Panama\'s market to subsidized U.S. products would drive 
farmers out of business.  (Note: In part due to pressure from 
this Embassy, President Moscoso removed Alejandro Posse from 
his position as Agriculture Minister in 2000 because of his 
insistence that Panama maintain high tariffs across the board 
on agricultural products.) 
 
 
Comment: Hand Holding Needed 
---------------------------- 
12.  (C) Times have changed since the early 1990s, when 
Endara used to meet former Ambassador Deane Hinton weekly for 
breakfast, but Endara still may be counting on a certain 
amount of hand-holding.  Endara wants to cooperate closely 
with the United States on security and law enforcement 
matters but his campaign clearly has not thought out its 
security posture as thoroughly as the PRD has; more worrisome 
is that he seems to lack qualified advisors to fill key 
positions.  Endara\'s unnamed nominee to head the PNP 
apparently is someone without any security background at all. 
 Solis will likely become Endara\'s national security advisor, 
a post he held under Endara\'s presidency.  He apparently 
intends to rely heavily on \"civilian\" USG advice on security 
matters.  (Note: These remarks reflect the general neuralgia 
in Endara\'s camp regarding anything that smacks of 
\"military,\" a legacy of the Torrijos/Noriega dictatorship. 
End Note.) 
 
 
\"Voting Their Conscience\" 
------------------------- 
13.  (C) Endara\'s electoral success, if it materializes as 
Solis suggests, will have to come from thousands of 
Panamanians who, at the eleventh hour, decide to \"vote their 
conscience\" in the polling booths to stop the PRD, although 
we have seen no evidence to suggest he is right, or that it 
would apply to younger voters as well.  Among Panama\'s nearly 
2 million registered voters, over 300,000 are voting for the 
first time.  Without a track record, they are a potential 
wild card in these elections, especially for Endara\'s 
prospects.  In fact, as Torrijos firms his grip on 
front-runner status with just weeks to go, we are unclear 
whether Endara actually will finish second (despite the 
polls), or whether he will finish third to Aleman.  Aleman, 
whom the polls have shown languishing in single digits until 
recently, can draw on a much stronger alliance and electoral 
machinery than Endara. 
 
 
The Panamanian Labyrinth 
------------------------ 
14.  (C) Despite Endara\'s antipathy to the PRD, not even his 
campaign is without \"baggage\" from the dictatorship period. 
In Panama, politicians who served governments under the 
dictatorships prior to 1990 are not confined to the PRD. 
Solis himself is a case in point, having served briefly as 
Manuel Noriega\'s Minister of Finance (1984-85).  More 
importantly, he is widely thought to have been the brains 
behind the 1984 electoral fraud that secured Nicolas 
Barletta\'s \"victory\" over the grand old man of Panamanian 
politics, Arnulfo Arias, namesake of the Arnulfista party. 
(Thus the uproar fifteen years ago when Endara named Solis as 
his National Security Advisor during his Presidency.) 
 
 
Bio Note 
-------- 
15.  (SBU) Born in Panama in 1936, Guillermo Endara Galimany 
was a long-time associate and confidant of three-time 
president Arnulfo Arias Madrid, to whom Mireya Moscoso was 
married until his death in 1988.  He served briefly as 
Minister of Planning under Arias in 1968 until a military 
coup terminated the administration.  Endara later founded the 
Arnulfista Party, from which Moscoso expelled him in 2003 
after he announced his candidacy for president on the 
Solidarity ticket.  In 1989 Endara was elected president in 
an election that dictator Manuel Noriega annulled.  Operation 
Just Cause restored his presidency and removed Noriega in 
December 1989.  Endara is recognized for consolidating an 
economy sacked by years of military rule in less time than 
expected but the coalition supporting him was weak and slowly 
disintegrated.  To his credit, Endara held power during 
unstable times.  He survived several attacks on his life and 
at least one foiled coup d\'etat attempt by former Panamanian 
Defense Force loyalists.  His administration is remembered 
for good economic times, honest but not always adept 
administration, and fractious politics.

SUBJECT: PANAMA\'s MAY 2 ELECTORAL PROCESS: NUTS AND BOLTS 
 
 
SUMMARY: General Elections 
-------------------------- 
1.  (U) Panama will hold general elections on Sunday, May 2 
to elect a total of 1,756 new officials for five-year 
terms.  Voters will elect a President, two Vice Presidents, 
78 legislators (and 156 alternates), 75 mayors (and 150 
alternates), 619 local representatives, 7 councilmen, 20 
representatives to the Central American Parliament 
(PARLACEN) (and 20 alternates).  Voting will start promptly 
at 7:00 a.m. and end at 4:00 p.m.  Electoral officials have 
announced that preliminary national voting results should 
be available around 7:00 p.m. on May 2 (8:00 p.m. 
Washington time).  Up to 1,999,553 registered voters will 
vote at Panama\'s 2,193 voting centers throughout the 
country.  Up to 1,900 national and international observers, 
including 25-30 from the OAS, will be watching the polls on 
May 2. 
 
 
2.  (U) Panama has no mandatory voting law, no electronic 
voting, and no absentee voting.  Panama holds General 
Elections every five years on the first Sunday in May.  The 
President-elect is inaugurated and the Legislative Assembly 
holds its first session on September 1, 2004.  End Summary. 
 
 
Voters and Registration 
----------------------- 
3.  (U) Panamanian law stipulates that all adult (at least 
18 years-old) citizens of Panama may register to vote, 
provided they are within Panamanian territory and not 
detained, in jail awaiting trial or convicted.  Panama\'s 
electoral code does not allow absentee voting for 
Panamanians residing overseas.  Although voting is not 
mandatory in Panama, voter turnouts have been high in 
Panama\'s previous two general elections.  In 1994, 73.7% of 
registered Panamanians voted; in 1999, 76.2% voted.  Over 
55% of Panama\'s registered voters are between the ages of 
18 and 40. 
 
 
4.  (U) The Electoral Tribunal (ET) publishes the official 
and final electoral registry (\"padron electoral\") after 
purging duplicate records through careful review and 
computer proofreading.  Registry entries include every 
voter\'s: (i) complete name, (ii) personal identification 
number (cedula), (iii) voting center (based on residence), 
and (iv) digital photo.  The final electoral registry for 
Panama\'s May 2004 elections contains 1,999,553 registered 
voters.  The ET has provided every political party a copy 
of the final list to maintain the transparency of the 
registration process. 
 
 
Administrative divisions 
------------------------ 
5.  (U) Panama is divided in nine provinces and seven 
indigenous reservations, which in turn are divided in 43 
electoral districts.  Each district elects a mayor, and, 
depending on population, between one and seven legislators. 
There are 78 total seats at stake in Panama\'s May 2, 2004 
elections for its unicameral Legislative Assembly. 
Municipal Councils in each district include the mayor and 
local elected representatives. 
 
 
6.  (U) Residents of each \"corregimiento\" (group of 
neighborhoods) elect their local representative, known as 
the \"representante de corregimiento.\"  Representing the 
smallest administrative division, there are a total of 619 
corregimientos in Panama, each with a separate 
representative.  Representantes de corregimiento are 
vestiges of Panama\'s political system under dictator Omar 
Torrijos.  Torrijos abolished the Legislative Assembly, 
forming an Assembly of Local Representatives (ALR) in its 
stead.  Since the ALR no longer exists, Panamanian 
political analysts have called for eliminating the local 
representative position. 
 
 
Political parties 
----------------- 
7.  (U) Panama has seven legally registered political 
parties:  Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), Partido 
Popular (PP), Movimiento Liberal Republicano Nacionalista 
(MOLIRENA), Partido Arnulfista (PA), Partido Solidaridad 
(PS), Partido Liberal Nacional (PLN) and Cambio Democratico 
(CD).  To obtain Electoral Tribunal recognition, a party 
must register members totaling at least 4% of the number of 
votes cast for President during the most recent election. 
To survive a general election, an existing party must win 
at least 4% of the votes cast in presidential, legislative, 
or local representative balloting.  All political parties 
must have a name, internal by-laws, government platform and 
a distinctive symbol (a flag).  Panama\'s electoral law 
prohibits religious symbolism in political party flags. 
 
 
Official Nominations 
-------------------- 
8.  (U) Parties choose their candidates during primaries or 
a National Congress, Assembly or Convention, as stipulated 
by their internal by-laws.  If a candidate dies or resigns, 
his/her first alternate automatically occupies the vacant 
candidacy.  The opposition PRD was the only party that held 
primaries to select its candidates.  The other six parties 
elected or nominated their candidates through a national 
congress or convention. 
 
 
9.  (U) After the Electoral Tribunal closed the official 
voter registry on December 31, 2003, Panama\'s electoral 
process officially began with political parties officially 
notifying ET of the candidates that they had nominated 
between January 2 and February 2, 2004.  The process will 
end when the ET issues official electoral credentials to 
the winners.  During the electoral process, the ET 
publishes an official electoral calendar by which all 
political parties and independent candidates must abide. 
Panama\'s electoral law states that only political parties 
can nominate candidates for President or Legislator. 
Independent candidates can run for mayoral and local 
representative seats. 
 
 
Electoral calendar 
------------------ 
10.  (U) Panama\'s official electoral calendar consists of 
the following milestones: 
 
 
---Oct. 15: Deadline for minors turning 18 years old before 
May 2 to renew their \"cedulas\" at the Electoral Tribunal.

---January 2: Official initiation of electoral process 
---Jan 2-Feb 2: Formal written nominations of candidates 
---Feb 1: Deadline for political parties to formally inform 
the ET that they intend to participate in the electoral

---April 30: Last day for any kind of political campaigning 
and/or advertising.  Last day for political talk shows to 
air on state-owned TV. 
---May 1-3: All bars, clubs, cantinas, and liquor stores 
are closed.  Sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. 
---May 2: Election Day 
   -6:00 a.m. Voting centers set up 
   -7:00 a.m. Voting centers opened 
   -4:00 p.m. Voting ends and counting begins 
   -7:00 p.m. Exit poll results may be broadcast 
 
 
Observers 
--------- 
11.  (U) Close to 1,900 national and international 
observers will be visiting voting centers and counting 
boards on May 2.  The largest group will be Panama\'s 
Catholic Church NGO Comision de Justicia y Paz, which will 
have 1,500 observers throughout the country.  Panama\'s 
Ombudsman Office is coordinating the participation of close 
to 300 local observers and will host approximately 15 Latin 
American Ombudsmen who will also observe the elections. The 
Organization of American States (OAS), with USG financial 
support, will send a delegation of 25-27 VIPs.  Foreign 
diplomats resident in Panama will also cover polling, but 
their presence will be limited.  Embassy Panama will deploy 
approximately 30 observers to 12 different locations, 6 in 
metro Panama, and 6 outside the capital. 
 
 
Voting 
------ 
12.  (U) Voting day procedures are well choreographed. 
After identifying themselves with personal ID cards 
(cedulas), Panamanians who vote on May 2 will each receive 
four ballots: one for President, one for legislator, one 
for mayor, and one for local representative.  The ET is 
preparing 5,105 voting tables (\"mesas de votacion\"), 
located in 2,193 voting centers (usually public schools). 
Up to 500 voters will be registered at each table.  Voting 
starts promptly at 7:00 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. sharp, 
after which counting at each table immediately begins. 
Accompanied by representatives designated by each political 
party, electoral officials painstakingly review ballots one 
by one, calling out votes for each elected position. 
 
 
Vote Counting 
------------- 
13.  (U) Once counting has finished (about 1-1.5 hours 
after voting ends), volunteer electoral officials at each 
\"table\" enter results on a tally sheet (acta), spelling out 
figures to avoid confusion.  Then, electoral officials and 
party representatives sign the tally sheet.  Tally sheets 
are essential because there are no recounts in Panama. 
Once the tally sheet is completed and signed, electoral 
representatives burn the ballots while party 
representatives observe.  The electoral representatives 
then take the tally sheet directly to the District Counting 
Board for computing after giving a copy to each party 
representative.  District Counting Boards pass their 
results to their respective Provincial Counting Boards, 
which in turn transmit their results to the National 
Counting Board (\"Junta Nacional de Escrutinio\"), located by 
law in Panama City.  (NOTE: Counting Board Members are 
usually CPAs and other professionals who have volunteered 
their services and received training and credentials from 
the ET. END NOTE.) 
 
 
Poll Results 
------------ 
14.  (U) Despite the laborious counting process, voting 
results will be quickly disseminated including the 
Electoral Tribunal website (www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa). 
Electoral officials have announced that preliminary 
national voting results should be available around 7:00 
p.m. on May 2 (8:00 p.m. Washington time).  Rather than 
waiting to announce definitive results, electoral officials 
plan to broadcast results as they become available. 
 
 
Security, sobriety, and ad-ban 
------------------------------ 
15.  (U) Panama\'s Electoral Code dictates that the ET 
controls the National Police on Election Day.  Only on-duty 
policemen are authorized to carry weapons on Election Day. 
All political advertising and campaigning is prohibited 
after noon on April 30.  Alcohol sales and consumption must 
cease between noon on May 1 and noon on May 3.  On Election 
Day, while voters may wear hats or t-shirts with political 
symbols, distributing political propaganda is forbidden 
inside voting centers.

Summary/Comment: Almost There 
----------------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Candidates, voters, and electoral officials are 
in the home stretch for Panama\'s May 2 general elections. 
The Electoral Tribunal (ET) briefed the diplomatic corps on 
elections in an April 13 luncheon presentation with media 
present.  On April 14, the ET warned the Supreme Court not 
to accept the case filed by Minister of the Presidency to 
inhibit Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis\' investigation 
of discretionary Presidency expenditures.  The Panama 
chapter of Transparency International lamented that high 
absenteeism forced Panama\'s Legislative Assembly to adjourn 
until May 3.  This week, presidential candidates announced 
their closing campaign events.  The final presidential 
debate is scheduled for Tuesday, April 20.  Labor leader 
calls for union members to submit void or blank ballots 
will likely fall on deaf ears.  Embassy sees continued 
normal development of the campaign with no areas of 
concern.  End summary. 
 
 
President\'s legal \"secret\" slush fund continued 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2.  (SBU) Observers are hoping that the Supreme Court 
rejects the request that Minister of the Presidency Mirna 
Pitti filed with it on 4/13.  Pitti\'s request seeks to ban 
Electoral Prosecutor Gerardo Solis from investigating the 
President\'s discretionary expenditures, on constitutional 
grounds.  Solis told Emboffs that he has postponed all 
action until after May 2 so that the case does not become 
more politicized.  Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Eduardo 
Valdes marked his territory with acrid 4/14 statements to 
the press that the Supreme Court should not meddle in 
electoral affairs. 
 
 
3  (SBU) COMMENT:  In terms of context, most Panamanians 
believe President Moscoso controls the Supreme Court, to 
which she appointed five of nine sitting Justices, all but 
one with close political ties to her.  In this instance, 
Valdes\' ire relates to the Court\'s \"stealing\" from the 
Electoral Tribunal the earlier case involving the appeal by 
Legislator Carlos Afu of his expulsion from the PRD. 
Constitutional scholars assert that the Supreme Court 
should only have reviewed the Afu case after the Electoral 
Tribunal issued a ruling.  These scholars say that the 
Supreme Court should reject Pitti\'s case.  As in the Afu 
case, former Electoral and Court officials insist that 
Pitti may only pursue a Supreme Court case if Solis\' 
investigation yields an Electoral Tribunal ruling that 
Pitti believes violates her constitutional rights.  Solis 
is well within his constitutional mandate, they add.  END 
COMMENT 
 
 
Electoral training for Diplomatic Corps 
--------------------------------------- 
4.  (U) Emboffs attended a 4/13 Electoral Tribunal (ET) 
presentation/lunch offered to educate members of the 
diplomatic corps about Panama\'s May 2 elections.  In 
addition to explaining the electoral law, the ET provided 
sample ballots, described safeguards to prevent fraud (ref. 
A) and invited foreign diplomats to observe the voting 
(ref. B).  ET officials also announced international and 
national observers who will cover Panama\'s May 2 elections. 
In addition to 25-30 member OAS observer delegation, 
approximately 15 Ombudsmen from other Latin American 
countries will observer May 2 voting.  About 1,500 
Panamanian observers from the Catholic Church\'s Peace and 
Justice Commission and 300 from the Panamanian Ombudsman\'s 
office will also observe voting.  Approximately 30 Embassy 
observers will cover 12 different sites, six in Metro 
Panama, where nearly half of Panama\'s voting population 
resides, and the other six outside the capital. 
 
 
Where are all the Legislators? 
------------------------------ 
5.  (SBU) Electoral campaigning has paralyzed the 
Legislative Assembly as many legislators seeking re- 
election and staffers running for office have taken leave 
from their official duties, leaving the body in the hands 
of the very few alternates who show up.  Assembly President 
Jacobo Salas (Arnulfista), and Budget Committee Chairman 
Arnulfista Alcibiades Vasquez (Arnulfista), pleaded with 
their colleagues to attend legislative sessions to no 
avail.  So little was accomplished earlier this week that 
Assembly management postponed sessions until May 3.  To 
compensate for lost time, legislators are supposed to work 
all Fridays and Saturdays until the Assembly adjourns on 
June 30.  Civil society representatives, most notably 
Transparency International (TI) Panama Chapter\'s Executive 
Director Angelica Maytin have asked Panamanians to take 
absenteeism into account when voting on May 2. 
 
 
TI-Panama to publish candidates\' backgrounds 
-------------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Panama\'s Chapter of Transparency International 
(TI) plans to broadcast biographical information about 
presidential candidates and other candidates, as well as 
information about their proposed policies.  TI sent 
candidates a questionnaire with an April 15 deadline, then 
published a 4/14 ad in local media reminding candidates 
that hadn\'t submitted information to do so and listing 
their names.  The list included, among others, presidential 
candidates Martin Torrijos (PRD-PP) and Ricardo Martinelli 
(CD).  A PRD source called the long and detailed 
questionnaire \"ridiculous.\"  Source told Embassy that 
Torrijos was adamantly against responding because, \"it felt 
as if he were confessing to the Pope.\" 
 
 
Final Campaign Rallies 
----------------------- 
7.  (U) Presidential candidates have announced 
traditionally massive campaign closing rallies.  The two 
largest coalitions have made the most complex plans. 
Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman announced at a 
press conference that his alliance has planned a large 
caravan in Panama City on Sunday, April 18 and will top off 
their campaign on Sunday, April 25 at a large Panama City 
gathering.  Unfazed by financial constraints, PRD-PP Martin 
Torrijos will hold several regional events to top off his 
campaign.  Also on 4/25, Torrijos will close his campaign 
in the western province of Chiriqui.  Torrijos will then 
close in Panama City on 4/28.  He is considering other 
final events in other parts of the country. 
 
 
8.  (U) Panama\'s two one-party candidates have also 
discussed their plans for final campaign events. 
Solidarity presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, who has 
run a frugal campaign due to lack of funds, decided not to 
hold a large event in a single venue, but will stage a six- 
day caravan beginning in the Western Province of Chiriqui 
and ending in the Atlantic Province of Colon, apparently an 
Endara stronghold.  During the caravan, Endara plans to 
visit 29 communities.  Cambio Democratico Ricardo 
Martinelli hasn\'t announced specific plans yet, but his 
associates have suggested that he will do something 
unconventional.  Critics have speculated that Martinelli 
might refrain from hosting a large event to avoid the 
embarrassment of a weak turnout. 
 
 
Unions call for void/blank votes 
-------------------------------- 
9.  (SBU) In another demonstration of their lack of civic 
responsibility, Panama\'s union leaders have called on their 
members to either void their vote or submit a blank ballot 
on May 2.  They\'re protesting the arrest of SUNTRACS leader 
Gerardo Lopez after a recent fracas at the Ministry of 
Labor where SUNTRACS was seeking to establish a legal 
personality for a new union of workers on the Southern 
Corridor highway.  Unions in Panama are poorly organized, 
but have the strongest pull in the construction and 
transportation sectors, where they seek to protect vested 
interests.  (COMMENT: The Cuban-funded SUNTRACS blocked 
streets to protest the ouster of former CSS director Juan 
Jovane in September 2003.  Since Panama\'s vote is secret 
and unions are poorly organized, Embassy does not expect 
any major adherence to this call.)

Summary 
-------- 
1.  (C) Arnulfista and Solidarity Party opponents of 
presidential candidate Martin Torrijos have given documents 
to reporters that they hope will link him to a 1985 
drug-related kidnapping.  Apparently rattled by a potentially 
damaging story that could break just before the May 2 
election, the Torrijos team has used Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) influence with the local media to prevent it from 
being published.  Containing allegations of unproved 
veracity, the documents (available on a website) tell a 
tangled tale that attempts to connect Torrijos with sordid 
individuals from the worst days of Manuel Noriega\'s 
dictatorship.  The documents strongly suggest that Torrijos 
had questionable friends but they go further, purporting that 
he associated with and aided known criminals.  The evidence 
against Torrijos is circumstantial, probably less than enough 
to convict him in a court of law, but more than enough, his 
opponents hope, to convince voters not to elect him.  This 
story reads like a Panamanian soap opera and it is difficult 
to determine whether there is any real substance to this 
convoluted tale.  A search of DEA and other Embassy files has 
turned up no evidence of Martin,s complicity in any crime. 
The PRD,s apparent power to control Panama,s weak-willed 
media -- at least to this point -- is a troubling portent, 
should Torrijos win the election.  End Summary. 
 
 
Was Martin Involved? 
-------------------- 
2.  (C) On April 7, 2004, according to Embassy sources, 
Martin Torrijos, his lawyers, and his Chilean consultants 
scrambled to study allegations about Martin,s alleged 
complicity in a 1985 drug-related kidnapping that later were 
posted on a website (www.ornstein.org), the day after the 
documents on the website were distributed to reporters. 
Public records show that the then 22-year-old Torrijos signed 
a sworn statement acknowledging that he lent his car to an 
acquaintance, Raul Mata Zuniga, who was involved in the 
kidnapping.  In his July 1985 statement to a judge, Torrijos 
swore that he was not aware of the kidnapping plan.  The 
kidnappers apparently did not use Torrijos\' car to abduct the 
victims.  The recent PRD strategy session was called after 
the kidnapping victim, Judy Hidalgo de Watson, apparently 
told the Torrijos campaign that Solidarity Party legislative 
candidate Abraham Martinez had offered her $50,000 to speak 
publicly about the case.  Ms. Watson declined the offer, 
evidently to protect her children from a politically 
motivated media frenzy. 
 
 
A Big Cocaine Heist Gone Wrong 
------------------------------ 
3.  (SBU) The complicated story, which reads like the script 
to Scarface, goes something like this.  In May 1985 
Noriega,s drug pilots Floyd Carlton Caceres and Teofilo 
Watson apparently stole more than half a ton (538 kg or 1184 
lbs) of cocaine from the Medellin drug cartel.  According to 
documents on the website, which Embassy has partially 
corroborated from September 1986 DEA reporting (86 DEA HQS 
WASHDC 029870), four Colombians came to Panama City to look 
for Carlton and Watson but, unable to find them, kidnapped 
Watson,s wife, her daughter, and two brothers, both minors, 
on June 30, 1985. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) According to Panamanian investigation records, a 
Panamanian accomplice, Raul Mata Zuniga, brought the 
kidnappers and their victims in several cars to a farm 
outside Colon owned by Eric Abrego.  Torrijos was at the 
farm, where he was a weekend guest, according to his 
statement to police.  When Mata\'s car got stuck in mud near 
the farm, Mata walked to the farm, with gun in hand, to ask 
for help.  Torrijos agreed to let him borrow his Nissan 
Patrol.  When Mata failed to return, Abrego and Torrijos went 
looking for him in Abrego\'s Jeep, whereupon they came upon 
Torrijos\' Nissan, which was also stuck.  They also met Mata, 
the Colombians, Ms. Watson and her children, and several 
vehicles, including a BMW and a Mercedes.  After getting a 
tractor to pull the cars out, everyone wound up back at the 
farm with Torrijos and Abrego.  After some time, Torrijos and 
Abrego left but Mata and the other kidnappers stayed.  After 
Torrijos and Abrego left, according to the documents, the 
kidnappers interrogated Ms. Watson about the whereabouts of 
her husband, and at one point staged a mock execution of Ms. 
Watson,s daughter. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Mata Zuniga and another witness alleged in their 
1985 sworn statements that Martin Torrijos later attempted 
several times to intervene with Panamanian authorities on 
behalf of the same group of Colombians when they were 
arrested in Chiriqui Province in western Panama on 
immigration charges.  Allegedly, Torrijos called Romulo Abad, 
a good friend of Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) Major Luis 
\"Papo\" Cordoba, and PDF Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera, a 
cousin of Omar Torrijos, Martin\'s dictator father.  Neither 
Cordoba nor Diaz Herrera would agree to release the 
Colombians.  There is no evidence to corroborate Mata,s 
allegations, but they could hurt Torrijos if aired publicly 
on the eve of elections. 
 
 
The Darkest Years of Noriega 
---------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Diaz Herrera, Cordoba, and Abad are bad apples who 
evoke images of the darkest years of the Noriega regime for 
those who lived through them, the last people the Torrijos 
team wants voters to associate with Martin while trying to 
convince Panamanians that Martin represents a \"new PRD.\" 
(See Reftel B.)  Diaz Herrera was fingered as the number two 
in Noriega\'s drug-running operation and also a accomplice in 
the 1985 torture and murder of dissident Hugo Spadafora. 
Luis Cordoba was a close Noriega associate that U.S. 
authorities arrested in January 1990 for his participation in 
the Spadafora murder and sentenced to twenty years in prison. 
 Among other things, Romulo Abad is a known alien smuggler. 
The Department revoked Abad\'s nonimmigrant visa along with 
that of former President Ernesto Perez Balladares in 2000. 
 
 
PRD Blocks Dissemination, Alleges Smear Campaign 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
7.  (C) A PRD source told POL Specialist April 7 that former 
PRD Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto Arias had pushed TVN 
(Channel 2) board member Stanley Motta to discourage 
journalist Lucy Molinar from reporting the case on her 
morning program, as she was planning to do.  Motta warned her 
(falsely as it turned out) that she might create \"legal 
problems\" for herself and the station if she went ahead. 
Molinar, reportedly upset at what she saw as censorship, 
evidently bought the legal argument.  Torrijos supporter and 
salsa star Ruben Blades used the April 7 11 p.m. news on 
Channel 13 (Telemetro - owned by the PRD Gonzalez-Revilla 
family) to warn of an impending \"dirty tricks campaign\" 
against Torrijos as the election approaches.  The Torrijos 
team is apparently resigned that the story probably will get 
out despite their intense efforts to spike it.  The 
Arnulfistas, our sources say, at one point were trying to 
have the story published abroad to be later \"copied\" in local 
press. 
 
 
Emergency Pow-Wow on Strategy 
----------------------------- 
8.  (C) During the emergency April 7 meeting at Martin\'s home 
(with his legal team, plus Hector Aleman and Hugo Torrijos), 
according to Embassy sources, the lawyers found no 
exercisable legal recourse against someone who publishes 
factual reports of the case.  The file in question is a 
matter of public record in Panama\'s National Archives.  When 
consulted, Torrijos\' Chilean image consultants supposedly 
told him that if the case surfaces in the local press, Martin 
should stick to his 1985 statement to police that he was 
unaware of the ongoing kidnapping.  Hugo and Hector 
reportedly agreed to dig for dirt on Aleman and his 
associates that they can hold in reserve in case things get 
nasty. 
 
 
COMMENT: News behind the News 
----------------------------- 
9.  (C) Most of the allegations linking Martin Torrijos and 
the kidnappers in the 1985 case are not substantiated.  On 
June 30, 1985, Torrijos admitted he lent his car to Mata, one 
of the kidnappers.  There is no proof that he was aware of or 
involved in any criminal activity.  What is not clear is why 
Torrijos was at Abrego\'s house when Mata arrived, gun in 
hand, as the documents state, with the kidnapping party close 
behind.  The question of Martin\'s guilt or innocence probably 
would not be as important in the court of Panama public 
opinion as his association with known criminals. 
 
 
10.  (C) Torrijos opponents, noting Martin\'s substantial lead 
in the polls, are desperate to sully Martin\'s personal 
reputation, but no one has been able to make any accusation 
of wrongdoing stick on Martin.  Anti-Martin attacks tend to 
resonate most with voters who already are anti-PRD, who 
cannot believe Martin really has neutralized the PRD old 
guard, who were frequently involved in shenanigans like this 
during the Noriega years.  Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman has been Martin\'s most aggressive assailant, although 
the Endara camp no doubt would like to discredit Torrijos, 
given Endara\'s consistent message that the PRD has not 
changed and will never change. (See Reftel A.) 
 
 
11.  (C) The apparently craven attitude of Panama\'s press in 
choosing, so far, not to publish the documents is 
disappointing, but whether it amounts to \"omerta\" (the 
Sicilian Mafia\'s code of silence), as the website claims, 
probably is an exaggeration.  If Torrijos were President of 
Panama, Panama\'s media would likely be much more aggressive 
toward him.  For example, despite La Prensa\'s pro-Martin bias 
during the 1999 and 2004 campaigns, it has criticized 
Arnulfista and PRD administrations alike, inspiring the 
indignation of Panama\'s current and previous Presidents for 
its investigative reporting.  Once Martin is \"on the inside,\" 
public scrutiny of everything he does will increase. 
 
 
12.  (C) While Torrijos public relations team has shown its 
power to control the media, Embassy believes that the other 
three presidential campaigns have similar resources and 
influence to wield in a comparable situation.  Controlling 
the media probably does not come cheap.  For instance, 
Stanley Motta, whose powerful family controls COPA airlines, 
a large bank, and an import-export firm, as well as several 
Panamanian insurance companies, may simply see his 
involvement as good politics in dealing with the likely next 
president (Torrijos).  Motta probably believes that building 
goodwill with the probable next President is a prudent 
business move.

SUBJECT: USG SUCCESS STORY: PANAMA REGAINS CATEGORY 1 FOR 
AIR SAFETY OVERSIGHT 
 
 
REF: SECSTATE 82097 
 
 
 1.  Summary: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
downgraded Panama in 2001 for not complying with 
international air safety standards.  Over the past 18 months, 
the Embassy has worked to focus the GoP\'s highest levels on 
making needed changes to its aviation authority to regain the 
status.  The GoP signed a technical agreement with the FAA 
last year to strengthen its oversight efforts.  Based on the 
successful implementation of that agreement, the FAA reviewed 
Panama\'s entire oversight program on April 14 and found it to 
be once again in compliance.  The economic benefits to both 
the United States and Panama are significant: local airline 
Copa may now exercise an option to purchase as much as $354 
million of aircraft from Seattle-based Boeing.  Continental 
Airlines, which owns 49% of Copa, will also profit from 
increased codesharing opportunities.  This success is a prime 
example of USG teamwork to strengthen safety of the traveling 
public, with significant benefits to U.S. companies.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Panama\'s Air Safety Program Starts out Dismal 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  In April 2001, the FAA determined that Panama was not 
complying with minimum international standards for air 
safety, and downgraded Panama to Category 2 under the 
International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) program, 
freezing Panamanian carriers\' routes and frequencies to the 
United States and banning U.S. carriers form codesharing with 
Panamanian ones.  The GoP\'s aviation laws and regulations 
were seriously out of date; the AAC had poor infrastructure 
and its personnel lacked proper training; inspector guidance 
and records of airline certification, of surveillance, and of 
corrective actions were inadequate and disorganized.  In 
essence, the AAC was deficient in all aspects of airline 
safety oversight, and local airlines simply ignored the 
Authority. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Ambassador and Embassy Bring Political Pressure to Bear 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
3.  Immediately after arriving at Post in December 2002, the 
Ambassador and Econoffs pressed Panamanian President Moscoso 
and Ministers of Economy and Finance (MEF), Commerce (MICI), 
and Government and Justice (MOGJ), plus the Comptroller 
General to provide the political and financial support 
necessary for Panama,s Civil Aviation Authority (AAC) to 
better its infrastructure, human resources, and oversight 
generally.  The Ambassador emphasized the importance of 
keeping the flying public safe through appropriate oversight, 
and pointed to the clear economic benefits that would result 
by maintaining high levels of safety.  She added the air 
safety oversight issue to the list of investment disputes 
before the Embassy-GoP Ad Hoc Investment Committee that she 
chairs with the Minister of Commerce, which ensured that the 
issue received recurring and intensive review in succeeding 
months. 
 
 
4.  She also urged members of the board of directors of Copa 
Airlines (Panama\'s leading airline) to change the carrier\'s 
culture of unwillingness to comply with AAC directives, 
pointing out that the long-term profits from increased 
traffic to the United States would far outweigh the 
short-term costs of implementing changes that the AAC might 
demand--no matter how frivolous the airline felt those 
demands to be.  In addition, the Embassy,s economic section 
maintained almost daily contact with key working level 
contacts in the GoP and COPA to ensure constant focus on the 
issue, and also communicated regularly with the FAA. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
FAA Technical Assistance Agreement Signed 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  Converting political will into finite action takes more 
than the power of fiat, however.  Recognizing the FAA as the 
clear experts, the GoP formally requested a technical 
assistance program with the FAA in May 2003.  Through careful 
coordination at FAA Headquarters\' Flight Standards Division 
and Office of International Aviation, the FAA Southern Region 
division and the associated Miami International Field Office 
(IFO), and the Eastern Region Flight Standards Division 
Technical Branch, the FAA provided a comprehensive technical 
assistance package for one week per month for six months in 
specific areas where the AAC was especially deficient.  In 
December 2003, the FAA and AAC agreed to extend the 
assistance program through June 2004. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
FAA\'s Successful Efforts Result in Formal Consultations 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
6.  From March 23-26, an FAA legal team reviewed Panama\'s new 
and improved civil aviation law (passed in 2003) and 
regulations (refined as a direct result of the technical 
assistance program), and found both to be in compliance with 
international standards.  During the March 29-April 2 
technical visit under the terms of the agreement, FAA 
inspectors witnessed the AAC certification of Copa and also 
closed out all remaining action items.  During March 29-31, 
senior officials from the Miami IFO conducted a management 
review of the AAC and determined that a formal IASA review of 
Panama,s air safety program would be appropriate. 
 
 
7.  On April 14, the USG via the Embassy requested formal 
bilateral consultations in accordance with Article 6 of the 
1997 Air Transport Agreement between the USG and GoP.  Senior 
officials from FAA\'s Southern Region and from FAA HQ 
conducted an IASA program review of the AAC.  Based on the 
clear technical standards laid out in the IASA program, the 
team determined that Panama was ahead of the game in many 
areas of flight safety, and had implemented innovative 
systems that were far ahead of neighboring countries.  All 
major concerns noted in the April 2001 downgrade notice had 
been addressed, and in many cases, Panama\'s standards far 
exceeded minimum requirements.  On this basis, the FAA 
advised the AAC of its decision to return Panama to Category 
1 status. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Follow Up and Next Steps 
------------------------ 
 
 
8.  During the consultations, the FAA and AAC agreed to 
extend the technical assistance agreement through January 
2005 to ensure that the AAC does not backslide from its 
success, and also to provide technical continuity in the 
period following Panama\'s May 2 general elections that may 
have some effect on the AAC,s political leadership after the 
new government assumes office on September 1.  The continued 
agreement will also help address the very minor areas for 
improvement observed during the last review, such as ensuring 
operations inspectors increased their attention to detail; 
that the inspectors received some additional training on how 
to write simpler enforcement reports, to strengthen guidance 
and refine \"On-the-Job\" training for inspectors, to implement 
a system to apply constant changes in international law 
directly to the AAC\'s regulations, and to raise fines for 
noncompliance to higher levels. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Economic Impacts of Panama\'s Category 1 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
9.  Though strictly a technical issue, the economic impacts 
of Panama\'s return to Category 1 cannot be overlooked.  Copa 
officials have told the Embassy that as a result of Panama\'s 
designation that they intend to begin daily flights to New 
York-JFK on June 17, and also plan to add two more daily 
frequencies (for a total of four) to its lucrative Miami 
route soon.  U.S. carriers also will benefit.  Continental 
Airlines, which also owns 49% of Copa, will begin codesharing 
on Copa flights soonest (Copa estimates that the codeshare 
will bring $12 million in immediate revenue to Continental 
with the potential for much higher returns soon after), and 
Delta and Northwest also intend to codeshare with Copa later 
this year.  Copa and Continental also announced on April 19 
that they intend to acquire a controlling interest in 
Colombian airline Avianca.  Colombian cities such as 
Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, Medellin, and Bogota provide 
important feeder traffic to Copa and Continental on 
continuing flights to the United States, and Copa is looking 
to increase the frequencies it flies on each of these 
Colombian routes. 
 
 
10.  In order to service these new routes and frequencies, 
Copa is expected to exercise a contract option with Boeing 
for four 737-700\'s and two 737-800\'s. Boeing, whose sole 
current commercial customer in Latin America is Copa, 
estimates the deal to be worth $354 million. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Comment: A Win for the United States and Panama 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
11.  Panama\'s return to Category 1 is a win for both Panama 
and the United States.  Though implementing international 
safety standards the ultimately the decision of the GoP, it 
was truly a USG team effort that effectively focused the GoP 
on achieving and maintaining these standards to protect the 
traveling public.  The FAA\'s professionalism and adherence to 
strict technical guidelines and the Embassy\'s constant work 
at the political level achieved the right result. These 
actions will reap substantial economic benefits not only in 
Panama, but also for U.S. businesses like Boeing and 
Continental.  This is a successful and significant example of 
USG efforts for U.S. business promotion.

SUBJECT: PRE-ELECTION VIEWS FROM THE FIELD: NEW 
REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE POOREST OF THE POOR--PANAMA\'S 
INDIGENOUS 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (U)  EmbOffs recently visited the western Panama 
reservation (or Comarca) of the Ngobe-Bugl indigenous group 
as part of our pre-election coverage.  The Comarca will elect 
three new representatives on May 2 to the 78-seat unicameral 
Legislative Assembly.  The new seats could provide some 
important political clout for this largely forgotten and 
impoverished people.  Continuing lack of social services, 
horrendous roads, and general malnutrition plague the area 
and were evident on this trip.  Indications point to a likely 
sweep of all three legislative seats for the main opposition, 
the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) - 
Popular Party (PP) alliance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
WHERE WE WENT AND WITH WHOM WE SPOKE 
------------------------------------ 
2.  (U)  During April 13-15, EmbOffs visited election 
officials and candidates from three of the major political 
parties in and around the western Panama reservation (or 
Comarca) of the Ngobe-Bugl indigenous group.  EmbOffs 
visited communities inside and outside the Comarca in 
Veraquas and Chiriqui provinces and in two of three Comarca 
electoral circuits.  Meetings (both scheduled and ad-hoc) 
were held with local Electoral Tribunal officials, 
candidates, campaign managers, teachers, mayoral candidates, 
students, and any Panamanian who wanted to share their 
opinions with EmbOffs. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
THE COMARCA: POLITICAL HISTORY, POLITICAL PLAYER? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3.  (U)  At about 6,944 square kilometers (9% of Panama\'s 
area), the Comarca Ngobe-Bugl is slightly larger than the 
state of Delaware.  Created in 1997, the Comarca has an 
estimated population of 120,000, over 95% of whom are from 
the Ngobe and Bugl indigenous groups. (Note: The national 
population of the Ngobe-Bugl, including those living outside 
the comarca, is an estimated 180,000.  End note.)  The 
Comarca comprises several hundred small and isolated towns 
and villages, mostly reachable only on foot, sometimes hours 
or days from any road, and only a handful have electricity. 
 
 
4.  (U)  At its creation in 1997, the Ngobe-Bugl Comarca 
gained three dedicated seats in the unicameral legislature. 
Previously, Comarca residents voted as part of larger 
electoral circuits and their interests received little 
attention.  All the candidates for the three new circuits 
(12-1, 12-2 and 12-3) are Ngobes.  If these new legislators 
act in concert, by no means an easy assumption in Panama\'s 
fractured political culture, they could become a political 
force by serving as a key swing vote in the legislature. 
This is especially true given Panama\'s history of closely 
divided government.  (Note: Current Ngobe-Bugl legislator, 
Enrique Montezuma (PRD) is from the Comarca and the only 
Ngobe representative.  End note.)  For the most part, 
contacts said that the elections will be relatively fair and 
clean, but some suggested the potential for isolated cases of 
fraud in remote villages. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
PROBLEMS ABOUND, NGOBE-BUGLE ARE POOREST OF PANAMA\'S POOR 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
5.  (SBU)  The Comarca faces staggering problems. According 
to the latest United Nations Development Program (UNDP) 
survey, about 95% of the residents live at the poverty level 
or below, and about 86% live in extreme poverty. 
Unemployment, malnutrition, hunger, lack of roads, and 
isolation plague the entire Comarca.  EmbOffs were stunned by 
the evident malnutrition and lack of physical development 
among Ngobe children.  The isolation further hampers 
provision of social services - schools, clinics and economic 
activity in general.  Even with a 4WD vehicle, EmbOffs found 
it challenging to reach those villages served by roads that 
locals considered \"good.\"  Isolation has a multiplier effect 
in that it represents lost opportunities in education, health 
care, and economic activity. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Many villages have a primary school, but further 
schooling necessitates hours of travel by foot, or arranging 
to live far away from family.  Children drop out of school at 
a young age to join their parents in the fields and have 
children themselves, and the cycle of poverty continues. 
Culturally, the Ngobe-Bugl confront the dilemma of 
indigenous people all over the world.  They face the tough 
choice between continuing their difficult life, or accepting 
modernity and losing more of their culture. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
OMAR TORRIJOS, PRD LEGACY LIVES ON 
---------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU)  Virtually every person EmbOffs spoke with during 
this pre-election tour pointed to a strong showing for the 
center-left opposition alliance of the PRD-PP  (Note: The 
only area that the PRD won in 1999 elections was the 
indigenous comarcas of Kuna Yala,  End note.)  Many people 
fondly recalled current PRD presidential candidate Martin 
Torrijos, father, former strongman and General Omar Torrijos 
(1968-1981), as a politician who \"helped\" with schools, 
roads, clinics and employment.  They are hoping for the same 
if the PRD-PP alliance wins. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  (SBU)  Despite the evident hardships, it is encouraging 
to see \"democracy in action\"  Most Comarca residents with 
whom EmbOffs spoke are generally aware of the issues and 
candidates.  With luck, the Comarca might receive some badly 
needed roads, jobs, social service projects, and increased 
governmental attention.  More attention could increase 
political power, although the cultural bias against the 
indigenous communities will remain an impediment to broader 
influence.  If the Ngobe win as a block (probably under the 
PRD banner), it is possible the Ngobe-Bugl might generate as 
much political clout as the Kuna tribe in northeast Panama, 
who have aggressively harnessed their political power to 
obtain schools, infrastructure, and jobs.

Summary: Behind and fighting the Anti-Moscoso Vote 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
1.  (C) Arnulfista Presidential Candidate Jose Miguel Aleman, 
a distant third in most public opinion polls, seeks to emerge 
from President Moscoso\'s shadow to place first in Panama\'s 
May 2 elections.  Neutralizing Aleman\'s greatest logistical 
asset, the three-party coalition that backs him and its 
political machine, President Moscoso has become his greatest 
liability.  While Aleman\'s opponents blame the Moscoso 
Administration for Panama\'s every woe and promise to remedy 
all, Aleman has to tiptoe around Moscoso\'s policies, 
particularly those that he helped implement as her Foreign 
Minister (September 1999 - January 2003).  Post-election, 
Aleman must also break Moscoso\'s grasp on the Arnulfista 
Party, over which she currently presides with an iron grip. 
Many political insiders believe that the party\'s strong 
grass-roots structure will propel Aleman past current number 
two, former President Guillermo Endara, but few deny that 
Endara and Aleman will compete for the same voters, who 
dislike Martin Torrijos and his Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD).  In the unlikely case that Aleman is elected, 
the USG can expect continued close law enforcement 
collaboration from the GOP, the same direction on trade and 
foreign policy as Moscoso, and a focus on Panama\'s 
maritime/transportation infrastructure.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Who is Jose Miguel Aleman? 
-------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) Arnulfista Party presidential candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman is a successful lawyer with extensive exposure to the 
U.S. and a track record of activism in the Arnulfista Party. 
Jose Miguel is the son of Roberto \"Chato\" Aleman, a veteran 
political activist for the now-defunct Liberal Party.  His 
mother renounced her U.S. citizenship during the negotiation 
of the Torrijos-Carter treaty.  Aleman\'s first public sector 
appointment was as Vice-Minister of Government and Justice 
under President Guillermo Endara (1989-94), now his campaign 
opponent.  During the Endara Administration, Aleman 
represented Panama in negotiating a Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty (MLAT) with the United States.  More recently, Aleman 
served as President Moscoso\'s Foreign Minister from September 
1999 to January 2003.  Born on May 8, 1956, Jose Miguel 
Aleman obtained a 1978 B.A. from Ripon College in Wisconsin 
and a 1981 J.D. from Tulane University.  Married to the 
former Victoria Eugenia Dutari, Aleman has two sons.  In 
addition to his native Spanish, he speaks English fluently. 
 
 
3.  (C) Aleman is a true politician, ready to squeeze 
political mileage out of non-issues.  Many critics claim that 
Jose Miguel began campaigning for the Arnulfista Party\'s 
nomination for President from the time he entered the Foreign 
Ministry.  Aleman himself sheepishly admitted to DCM that he 
was planning his campaign well before leaving the Foreign 
Ministry.  That tendency made dealing with Jose Miguel as 
Foreign Minister occasionally problematic for Embassy Panama 
when he turned tired issues like unexploded ordnance (UXO) on 
former U.S. military facilities or weapons testing on San 
Jose Island (SJI) into political footballs to win over 
Panama\'s electorate on perceived hot-button issues. 
 
 
Who supports Jose Miguel? 
------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) Estimating support for Jose Miguel Aleman is tough, 
because public opinion polls are unreliable (Reftel B) and 
Arnulfista and MOLIRENA loyalists are split between Endara 
and Aleman.  Jose Miguel Aleman is running as the candidate 
of a three party coalition representing the Arnulfista Party 
(PA - 194,207 members), the National Liberal Republican 
Movement Party (MOLIRENA - 108,663 members) and the Liberal 
National Party (PLN - 51,369 members).  With a maximum 
backing of 354,239 registered party members, Jose Miguel 
needs votes from independents and dissidents from the parties 
that oppose his candidacy to become Panama\'s next President. 
Aleman will have difficulty tying down Arnulfista and 
MOLIRENA votes because his opponent, Guillermo Endara, is a 
founding member of the Arnulfista Party whose running mate, 
Guillermo Ford, helped found the MOLIRENA Party. 
5.  (SBU) In addition to his six siblings (one sister and 
five brothers) and Arnulfista stalwarts from the Moscoso 
cabinet, Aleman receives strong support from others, like 
Carlos Raul Piad and Maria Alejandra Eisenmann.  Piad, 
Aleman\'s Campaign Manager is a dedicated Arnulfista loyalist 
who is currently the Party\'s Secretary General and served as 
the General Manager of the state-owned savings bank (Caja de 
Ahorros) from September 1999 until late 2003.  Eisenmann, a 
successful attorney and social activist, was Secretary 
General of the Aleman Foreign Ministry.  Eisenmann eventually 
resigned from her MFA position, alleging that there was too 
much corruption in the Moscoso Administration.  She helped 
Jose Miguel focus the areas of his platform that address 
women and children. 
 
 
What obstacles does Aleman face? 
-------------------------------- 
6.  (C) Aleman\'s number one liability is President Mireya 
Moscoso.  Moscoso angered Aleman\'s opponents for the 
Arnulfista presidential nomination by publicly declaring her 
support for Aleman well before the party\'s June 2003 
convention.  Two other substantial negatives for Jose Miguel 
are Moscoso\'s open campaigning on his behalf and that of 
other Arnulfistas, which many contend violates a 
constitutional prohibition, and the perception that her 
administration is both inept and corrupt.  As noted in Reftel 
C, the Endara camp is banking on votes from Anti-PRD voters 
who want a candidate who has broken ties with President 
Moscoso and the Arnulfista Party under her leadership. 
 
 
7.  (C) Aleman\'s number-two liability is the psychological 
weight of public opinion polls that consistently show a wide 
gap between him and frontrunner Martin Torrijos.  For 
instance, an April 6 La Prensa poll showed PRD candidate 
Torrijos at 48%, Solidarity candidate Endara at 29%, and 
Aleman at 16%, with Ricardo Martinelli trailing even further 
behind at 7%.  Earlier editions from the same series of polls 
won Jose Miguel the dubious honor of being the most disliked 
candidate from November 2003 through February 2004 (the last 
month that question was included). 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Finally, critics question whether Aleman will have 
the political will to follow through with his promises to be 
more transparent than President Moscoso.  Jose Miguel is the 
only candidate who has presented a sworn declaration of 
assets for public scrutiny, but most believe he did it only 
to highlight questions about the source(s) of Martin 
Torrijos\' wealth.  If elected, Aleman has promised to 
immediately eliminate President Moscoso\'s regulating decree 
that crippled Panama\'s Transparency Law, but critics note 
Aleman was on the cabinet that approved that decree.  In an 
April 16 RPC News interview, Aleman also promised to publish 
on the internet copies of all checks drawn on public funds, 
but Moscoso too promised to subject all expenditures to 
public scrutiny during her campaign, but has refused to do 
so.  Ironically, despite Aleman\'s pro-transparency stance, it 
was not until well after he left the Foreign Ministry that 
his old office\'s internet portal began providing even basic 
information on Panama\'s diplomatic activities. 
 
 
What would an Aleman presidency mean for the USG? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
9.  (C) The USG could expect continued excellent law 
enforcement and security cooperation with the GOP under an 
Aleman administration despite the fact that Aleman took 
several politically driven stances as Foreign Minister that 
created headaches for this Embassy.  For instance, to earn 
political mileage, he revived the dead issues of Unexploded 
Ordnance (UXO) and San Jose Island (SJI).  Despite this 
populist pandering, Aleman and the Arnulfistas are not 
anti-American nationalists like some of the PRD old guard. 
The Arnulfistas tend to view security cooperation 
pragmatically as a way to build goodwill with the United 
States while obtaining logistical and/or financial support. 
 
 
10.  (C) Jose Miguel Aleman\'s populist rhetoric is second 
only to Endara\'s.  For instance, Aleman proudly takes credit 
for Panama maintaining WTO-maximum tariff levels on selected 
agricultural products.  Nevertheless, the Aleman campaign 
team still views trade liberalization and an FTA with the 
U.S. as major pluses.  Taking advantage of the mistaken 
perception among Panamanian voters that privatization 
inherently brings with it greater cost and poorer service, 
Aleman opposes privatizations of any type because they would 
violate (paternalistic) Arnulfista doctrines.  Aleman has 
also vowed not to privatize Panama\'s water utility or Social 
Security fund. 
 
 
11.  (C) Current Panama Canal Authority (ACP) Administrator 
Alberto Aleman Zubieta is Jose Miguel\'s cousin and there is 
no indication that Jose Miguel would seek to replace him. 
Jose Miguel Aleman also has a comprehensive plan for 
infrastructure development.  He wants to expand Panama\'s 
Atlantic and Pacific Canal-area Ports and those near its 
western border with Costa Rica, as well as upgrade the roads 
between them, particularly the Panama-Colon highway. 
 
 
Comment: Behind the skirt? 
-------------------------- 
12.  (C) Like Panamanians, including Martin Torrijos, who 
accused Aleman of \"hiding behind President Moscoso\'s skirt,\" 
Emboffs are curious whether as president Jose Miguel Aleman 
would be able to sufficiently distance himself from President 
Moscoso to run a clean and transparent government.  He has 
made attractive promises to create jobs, improve education, 
reduce utility costs, and increase government transparency, 
but so did President Moscoso in her 1999 campaign.  Her 
tolerance for graft and her administration\'s meddling in 
legislative, judicial, and environmental matters show 
Moscoso\'s disregard for fundamental principles of 
transparency, separation of powers, and due process. 
 
 
13.  (C) A growing movement within the Arnulfista Party led 
by banker Alberto Vallarino and Legislator Jose Blandon 
Figueroa, among others, seeks to remove Moscoso and those 
close to her from party leadership.  Vallarino left the 
Arnulfista Party in 1999 and obtained an unprecedented 17% of 
the nationwide vote as a third-party candidate.  Many 
Panamanians looked for Vallarino to run again in 2004, but he 
dropped out of the race in January 2003, creating the vacuum 
that Endara filled.  Vallarino decided not to seek the 
Arnulfista Party nomination after Moscoso announced her 
decision to hold a nominating convention instead of 
primaries.  Vallarino knew he stood a good chance of winning 
a nationwide secret vote among all registered party members, 
but Moscoso could easily twist arms among Party delegates 
before a nominating convention. 
 
 
14. (C) The Alberto Vallarino/Mireya Moscoso rivalry within 
the Arnulfista Party has been divisive.  In 1998, Aleman 
supported Vallarino\'s failed bid for the Arnulfista\'s 1999 
presidential nomination, but quickly backed Moscoso when she 
came out on top.  Perhaps with Moscoso no longer running the 
government and people like Vallarino and Blandon to back him 
up, Aleman might be able to convince her to run the party in 
a more transparent and democratic manner.  However, the 
likelihood of Moscoso changing her \"caudilla\" top-down style 
is remote, even if (as expected) Aleman loses the election on 
May 2.  Many observers believe that Moscoso is more willing 
to concede such a defeat than loosen the tight reins she 
holds over the Arnulfista Party leadership.

Six Sentences 
------------- 
1.  (SBU) On April 20, Panama\'s Fifth Penal Court convicted 
six anti-Castro conspirators, including three AmCits, for 
endangering public safety and sentenced them to seven and 
eight-year jail terms for a November 2000 plot to kill Fidel 
Castro.  (See Refs A and B.)  Luis Posada Carriles, currently 
stateless, and AmCit Gaspar Jimenez Escobedo were sentenced 
to eight years; one year was tacked on for carrying 
fraudulent passports.  AmCits Pedro Crispin Remon and 
Guillermo Novo Sampoll, and Cuban-Panamanian Cesar Matamores 
were sentenced to seven years, while Panamanian Jose Hurtado 
Viceros received four years.  All six men have been in prison 
for around 40 months and will receive credit for time served. 
 (See Ref. C)  The Court acquitted the defendants of 
possession of explosives.  Attempted murder charges had been 
dropped early on.  The Venezuelan government continues to 
publicly seek the extradition of the stateless Posada 
Carriles, who was convicted and imprisoned for the 1976 
bombing of a Cuban airliner which killed 73 people.  (See 
Refs A and B for background on this case.) 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
Public Statements Slowly Emerging 
--------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) The court and, initially, the attorneys have been 
tight-lipped, despite Embassy\'s efforts to learn more about 
the judge\'s decision.  On April 21, Rogelio Cruz (lead 
defense attorney) spoke with the Embassy\'s American Citizen 
Services (ACS) staff and said an appeal will be filed within 
10-15 days.  Cruz claimed the convictions were \"poorly 
supported\" and the forthcoming publication of the judge\'s 
decision will demonstrate this.  Cruz expressed appreciation 
on behalf of the defense team and the defendants for the 
Embassy\'s calls and follow-up on this case.  La Prensa quoted 
the Cuban Ambassador to Panama, who said the sentence 
\"proves\" the prisoners are terrorists. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
No Extradition for Posada Carriles 
---------------------------------- 
3. (C) At a April 20 meeting with the POL Counselor, Minister 
of Government and Justice Arnulfo Escalona said that a formal 
GOP decision to deny Venezuela\'s extradition request for 
Posada Carriles would be forthcoming soon. Escalona added 
that the GOP is considering whether to release Posada 
Carriles and the others when they finish two-thirds of their 
terms (including time served) and whether to permit Posada 
Carriles, who entered Panama on a fraudulent Salvadoran 
passport and is currently stateless, to remain in Panama 
after his release.  (Note: The possibility of a prison 
transfer to a US prison under our bilateral prisoner exchange 
agreement for the Cuban-Americans was not discussed but 
remains a potential option.)  Escalona hinted that he would 
like to discuss options with the USG after the May 2 
Panamanian election.

FIRST ROUND OF U.S.- PANAMA FTA NEGOTIATIONS (APRIL 26-30) 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
1. (U) I warmly welcome your April 25-30 visit to Panama. 
The USDEL\'s visit marks the culmination of a long campaign by 
the GoP to move forward on an FTA with the U.S.  You will 
have the opportunity to reiterate USG commitment to expanding 
trade and investment between our two countries, and to press 
for continuing focus on predictability for investors and 
transparency and anti-corruption within Panama\'s 
institutions.  Your visit highlights our governments\' mutual 
interest in the strategic issues of expanding open markets 
throughout the hemisphere and strengthening democracy. 
Panama\'s upcoming May 2 national elections will reign 
paramount in the minds of many of your interlocutors.  It is 
worth noting Panama was an early member of the Coalition of 
the Willing, has signed and ratified a bilateral Article 98 
Agreement, is a strong anti-narcotics ally, a strong 
supporter of U.S. maritime security/trade-security 
initiatives, and has sided with the USG in regional and 
multilateral trade fora.  Panama has proven itself a good 
friend and ally. 
 
 
--------------- 
A Brief History 
--------------- 
 
 
2. (U) From its founding in 1903 until 1968, the Republic of 
Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a 
commercially oriented oligarchy focused on Panama as an 
entreport for international trade.  In October 1968, Dr. 
Arnulfo Arias Madrid -- the deceased husband of current 
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso -- was elected to and 
deposed from the presidency for the third time.  General Omar 
Torrijos  (d. 1981) -- the deceased father of current 
opposition leader and leading presidential candidate Martin 
Torrijos -- became dictator in 1969 and was succeeded in 
infamy by General Manuel Noriega.  On December 20, 1989, 
President George H.W. Bush ordered the U.S. military into 
Panama to restore democracy, protect AmCits and their 
property, fulfill U.S. treaty responsibilities to operate and 
defend the Canal, and bring Noriega to justice.  Noriega is 
still serving a 30-year sentence in Miami for drug 
trafficking.  Since 1989, Panama has twice held free and fair 
elections, transferring power from/to opposition parties in 
1994 and 1999. 
 
 
------------------ 
May 2004 Elections 
------------------ 
 
 
3. (U) Panama will hold national elections on May 2, 2004, 
with the incumbent Moscoso Administration leaving office 
September 1.  Four campaigns are vying for the presidency, 78 
legislative seats, and all mayoral and local representative 
positions.  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate 
Martin Torrijos maintains a substantial lead over third-party 
candidate and former Panamanian President Guillermo Endara 
(1989-1994).  The ruling Arnulfista party candidate, former 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman (1999 to 2003), seems to 
be closing the gap with Endara.  Minor Democratic Change (CD) 
party candidate Ricardo Martinelli is a distant fourth.  A 
recent poll shows Torrijos with 47 percent support, followed 
by Endara with 27 percent, Aleman with 19 percent, and 
Martinelli with 6 percent.  Panama\'s elections are expected 
to be free and fair and should not warrant extensive 
monitoring or observation.  All candidates want to maintain a 
close and cooperative relationship with the US and are 
strongly supportive of an FTA with the US; however, the 
agricultural lobby and Panama\'s rural populace weighs 
particularly heavy with Endara. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Towards a Democratic Culture 
---------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) My September 29 speech to Panama\'s Chamber of 
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, launching Embassy\'s Good 
Goverance Initiative (GGI), resonated with Panamanians and 
generated front-page headlines.  Venality, conflict of 
interest, nepotism, and lack of transparency are ingrained in 
Panama\'s political culture and institutions.  Panama\'s 
\"spoils system\" allows politicians to use the entire state 
bureaucracy as a patronage base.  The country\'s criminal 
libel laws, left over from military rule, impose enormous 
costs and risks on journalists and whistle-blowers. 
Legislative immunity is often abused, as elsewhere in the 
region.  The Embassy currently supports good goverance 
activities directed toward judicial reform, civic education, 
business ethics, and strengthening anti-corruption 
prosecutors\' institutional capacity, and is reviewing 
implementation of President Bush\'s initiative to cancel visas 
to the United States of corrupt public officials. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
A Mixed Macroeconomic Record 
---------------------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under USG administration.  Canal-related 
industries, especially cargo transshipment through ports at 
both ends of the Canal, have boomed, as have visits by U.S. 
cruise ships, which will surpass 200 port calls in Panama 
this year.  Panama\'s overall economy went flat when nearly 
30,000 U.S. military personnel and their dependents left 
during the late 1990s, privatizations slowed, and the 2001 
global recession took hold which  perpetuated the country\'s 
estimated 13.4% unemployment.  Also, Panama has failed to 
attract large investments into the former Canal Zone. 
Poverty, income disparity (2nd only to Brazil in the 
Hemisphere), an actuarially bankrupt social security system 
and a heavy sovereign debt load are arguably the biggest 
internal challenges facing Panama today.  Since mid-2003, 
however, economic growth has picked up, primarily as a result 
of tax incentives given to a booming construction sector, low 
interest rates, and a global economic recovery.  Panama\'s 
growth rate for 2003 came in at around 4 percent. 
 
 
6. (U) Panama\'s $12 billion economy is based primarily on a 
well-developed services sector that accounts for 
approximately 78 percent of GDP.  Services include the Panama 
Canal, banking and financial services, legal services, 
container ports, the Colon Free Zone (the 2nd largest in the 
world), and flagship registry.  Panama also maintains one of 
the most liberalized trade regimes in the hemisphere. 
Bilateral trade with Panama came to $2.1 billion in 2003. 
U.S. exports were $1.85 billion and imports were $301 
million.  The stock of U.S. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
in 2002 was $20 billion, down 20 percent from 2001.  U.S. FDI 
is primarily concentrated in the financial sector. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the United 
States.  First, for political and economic reasons, the 
Moscoso Administration is pleased the first negotiating round 
for the bilateral FTA will be held prior to the May 2 
national elections.  (Comment.  While the GOP argues that the 
timing of the talks will send the right signal that this is a 
\"state project\" rather than a political one, the Moscoso 
Administration is hoping for some pre-electoral political 
advantage.  End comment.) Panama is also satisfied with the 
current negotiating schedule as it provides for completion of 
an agreement prior to the November U.S. elections and the 
July 2005 expiration of TPA.  The GoP views the FTA as a 
vehicle to lock in the status quo or better (CBI, GSP), 
improve market access in niche areas (e.g., banking, 
maritime, and sugar), and most importantly to attract 
investment. GoP Minister Jacome was not pleased with recent 
public remarks by Costa Rica\'s Trade Minister that they would 
welcome Panama into CAFTA.  Jacome told ECON Chief that from 
Panama\'s perspective this was a bilateral, but he was not 
closing the door on any options. 
 
 
8. (U) The GoP has long argued for Panama\'s re-designation 
from a \"near foreign port\" to a \"distant foreign port\" under 
the U.S. Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA), to capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying 
the possibility of a re-designation.  The GoP estimates that 
up to U.S. $50 million per year could be gained for Panama\'s 
growing tourism sector.  Over the past year, we have seen a 
marked improvement in the GoP\'s willingness to make progress 
on a number of U.S. investment cases, to address bilateral 
trade issues, including agricultural concerns, and to enhance 
cooperation/coordination in regional and multilateral trade 
fora.  The USG has asked Panama to continue its progress on 
resolving investment disputes and improving its investment 
climate through responsiveness to investor concerns, clear 
rules of the game, predictability, and transparency in 
decision-making.  Agriculture protectionism is still vexing, 
however; US beef imports from the recent BSE scare have not 
resumed, and we fight recurring skirmishes on pork, poultry, 
potatoes, and other products.  (Comment: In part due to 
upcoming elections.  End Comment.) 
 
 
9. (U) After several years of effort, Panama was elevated to 
\"Category 1\" for air safety oversight on April 14, 2004. 
This was the result of efforts by the Federal Aviation 
Administration and Embassy to focus the GoP on implementing 
needed changes to its aviation authority in order to ensure 
the safety of the traveling public.  The designation allows 
Panamanian air carrier COPA to increase flights into the U.S. 
 COPA (49 percent owned by Continental Airlines) may now 
exercise an option for Boeing aircraft, valued at more than 
$354 million, to service new routes, thus directly 
benefitting these two key U.S. companies.  Lastly, sometime 
next year the GoP is expected to move forward with a national 
referendum on expansion of the Canal through the construction 
of a third set of locks.  If, given the green light, the 
project\'s value is estimated to be between USD 4-9 billion 
and would take around 10 years to complete.  Substantial 
opportunities for U.S. service providers is expected. 
 
 
 
 
----------------- 
Maritime Security 
----------------- 
 
 
10. (SBU) The 9/11 attacks called significant attention to 
the potential for terrorist exploitation of Panama\'s leading 
maritime position.  Panama has the world\'s largest flag state 
registry with approximately 6300 vessels over 500 gross 
metric tons and approximately 300,000 seafarers. 
Additionally, approximately two-thirds of Canal traffic 
originates or terminates at U.S. ports, roughly 13% of U.S. 
seaborne trade.  Nearly, 27 percent of foreign-flagged cargo 
ships arriving at U.S. ports are Panamanian.  Moreover, 
approximately 125 U.S. military vessels, including 
nuclear-powered U.S. submarines (\"high value transits\"), 
visit Panamanian ports and/or transit the Canal each year. 
Port services have grown dramatically from about 200,000 
containers per year in the early 1990s to almost two million 
by 2002, giving Panama Latin America\'s leading port complex. 
(Note: Although a large number of containers transit the 
Panama Canal, the number that actually are shipped and 
transshipped from Panama are substantially less -- around 90 
thousand.  End note.) 
 
 
11. (SBU) Given these equities, the Embassy, through its 
Maritime Security Working Group and in coordination with 
Washington agencies, has undertaken a broad Maritime Security 
agenda with the GoP.  We have seen a strong willingness on 
the part of the Moscoso Administration for Panama to meet its 
responsibilites as a major maritime player.  Progress has 
been particularly good since President Moscoso\'s appointment 
in June 2003 of Panama\'s Public Security and National Defense 
Council (\"the Consejo\") Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis to 
coordinate maritime security matters.  Key components of the 
agenda include: making Panama\'s seafarer document more 
secure, protecting U.S. forces, port security (including for 
cruise ships), container security, export controls, 
proliferation security, and strengthening GOP institutions. 
Progress by the GoP has been good on all of the fronts; 
however, we will have to keep the pressure on the GoP to 
follow-through, in particular, on meeting new IMO requirement 
regarding ship and port security. 
 
 
12. (SBU) Panamanians have also become increasingly willing 
to accept military-to-military security training, equipment 
and other assistance to enhance their capabilities to protect 
the Canal and borders.  Although the present terrorist threat 
to the Canal is considered low and Panamanian planning, 
layered defenses and security resources are generally well 
regarded, the Canal remains vulnerable.  Continued U.S. 
training, equipment and other assistance are vital to preempt 
a major terrorist attack. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Fighting International Crime 
---------------------------- 
 
 
13. (SBU) Law enforcement cooperation with Panama is 
excellent.  The Moscoso Administration set up a new, 
GOP-interagency counternarcotics vetted unit; expanded upon 
the basic shiprider agreement to facilitate maritime/air 
operations in pursuit of drug, arms and explosives smuggling 
(and may soon include WMD); expedited thirty-eight maritime 
drug prisoner transfers to USG custody (saving U.S. taxpayers 
U.S. $1 million per event); and captured and transferred to 
U.S. custody seventeen fugitives from U.S. justice (most 
recently, on January 14, Colombian drug kingpin Arcangel de 
Jesus Henao Montoya, wanted in New York for smuggling five 
tons of cocaine).  Panama is working much more closely with 
Colombian President Uribe\'s government against 
narco-terrorists.  The GOP has also welcomed USG assistance 
-- DOD special operations forces (training National Police 
(PNP) border units) and AID community development (enhancing 
productive capacity and governmental presence in the Darien 
border province). 
 
 
14. (SBU) The GOP revamped its legal and administrative 
structures to fight money laundering, becoming a model for 
other countries, such as Russia, that are trying to bring 
their regimes up to grade.  Panama assisted the USG in the 
prosecution of money laundering cases and provided crucial 
information against former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo 
Aleman.  However, at the 2004 Summit of the Americas in 
Monterrey, Mexico, several hemispheric neighbors chided 
Panama for recently granting \"asylee\" status to a former 
Ecuadorian cabinet minister, who is charged with embezzlement 
of government funds.

Summary/Comment: Activity up. Still no problems 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
1. (SBU) As campaigning hits a feverish pace, candidates 
Torrijos and Endara decided to skip the final, April 20 
debate.  Two final public opinion polls with conflicting 
results have generated controversy, as has another group of 
Endara supporters who made their support publicly known. 
The Electoral Tribunal (ET) announced that it has completed 
85% of the necessary preparations for the May 2 elections. 
At the same time, observers are making the final 
arrangements for their May 2 assignments.  Amid the 
blistering array of activity, Embassy has yet to note any 
elements of significant concern.  Emboffs will cover final 
campaign events this weekend and next week. 
 
 
Election Day preparations 85% complete 
-------------------------------------- 
2.  (U) The Electoral Tribunal announced that they have 
completed 85% of the necessary preparations for the May 2 
General Elections.  Twenty-seven electoral committees have 
carried out their assigned tasks, detailed in the General 
Election Plan.  Those tasks have included arranging 
transportation for voting materials and officials, training 
volunteer electoral officials to administer voting and 
vote-counting, establishing a nationwide communications 
network to transmit voting results, and informing voters 
how to register and how to vote. 
 
 
Observers preparing & arriving 
------------------------------ 
3.  (SBU) International and domestic observers are 
preparing for their May 2 role.  During a two-day program 
funded by the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights, 
the Electoral Tribunal trained observers from Panama\'s 
Ombudsman\'s Office on electoral processes in Panama and 
other related issues.  Embassy\'s 28 volunteer observers 
gathered for a group training and orientation session on 
Friday 4/23.  Also, three representatives from the Japanese 
Embassy will observe Panama\'s elections.  Finally, team 
leaders of the OAS observer mission arrived in Panama on 
Wednesday, 4/21.  The rest of the 30-member delegation 
arrives next week.  Ambassador Watt will meet with OAS 
representatives on Tuesday 4/27. 
 
 
Torrijos and Endara skip national debate 
---------------------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) When the two leading candidates declined at the 
last minute to participate in a highly anticipated April 20 
national debate, only the three smallest TV networks 
(Catholic Church, Evangelical Church and the state-owned TV 
channel) covered it.  Evidently fearing the last debate 
could dent his frontrunner status, PRD-PP candidate and 
poll leader Martin Torrijos announced his decision on April 
19.  His campaign coordinator said he withdrew to avoid 
unfair attacks from the other candidates as in the previous 
debate.  For instance, Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman \"reminded\" Torrijos of a controversial presidential 
pardon he co-signed while briefly acting as Government and 
Justice Vice Minister during the Perez Balladares 
administration, and of extensive PRD embezzlement from the 
Social Security Fund during the military dictatorship. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) The other candidates reacted quickly to Torrijos\' 
move. Endara, second in all polls, followed Torrijos\' lead 
and added that he \"did not want to waste his time\" with the 
remaining two candidates.  Endara made fun of Torrijos\' 
\"weaknesses\" and called him a \"crybaby\" (lloron).  Endara 
said there was no use debating with the other two 
candidates since \"they have no chance to win.\"  Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman said Torrijos\' position was 
disrespectful to voters.  Aleman continued that he would 
honor his commitment to the Panamanian people and 
participate in the debate.  CD Martinelli remarked that 
Torrijos \"couldn\'t care less\" (\"no le importa tres 
pepinos\") about the people and suggested that if Torrijos 
had backed out in such a manner from a \"cock fighting pit\" 
(\"gallera\") he would have been \"stabbed\" (\"acuchillado\"). 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Sources indicated that the Arnulfistas might have 
been planning during the April 20 debate to \"break\" the 
story of a 1985 drug-related kidnapping to which Torrijos\' 
opponents have tried to link him.  (Note: The story finally 
did break on April 22 and will be reported Septel.  For 
background, see reftel A.  End Note.)  While civil society 
leaders criticized Endara and Torrijos for not living up to 
their pledge to participate, media across the board only 
justified Torrijos\' absence.  The Arnulfistas then held a 
press conference (which no TV channel broadcast) accusing 
Torrijos of \"being afraid of his past.\"  For the second 
time, Arnulfistas distributed CDs containing copies of 
Public Ministry records on the case to press 
representatives.  Except for the Catholic Church Channel\'s 
news (which barely mentioned the case) no other media 
reported the story. 
 
 
The final polls 
--------------- 
7.  (U) Two polls were published this week with very 
different results.  La Prensa\'s Ditcher & Neira poll 
continues to show PRD-PP candidate Martn Torrijos well in 
the lead at 47%, followed by Solidarity candidate Guillermo 
Endara at 28%, each one point down from the week before. 
Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman, a distant third at 
19%, was the only candidate whose popularity increased 
since the last month (16%).  Fourth place Cambio 
Democratico (CD) candidate Ricardo Martinelli ended up at 
6%, also losing a point.  In a paid advertising insert in 
Panama dailies, the Arnulfistas published the first and 
only poll that showed their candidate, Jose Miguel Aleman, 
winning.  That poll shows Aleman winning with 39.7% of the 
vote, followed by Torrijos at 38.1%, Guillermo Endara at 
14.3%, and CD Ricardo Martinelli at 3.5%.  Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis opened an investigation into this 
poll because Electoral Tribunal regulations requiring that 
polling methodology are certified before results are 
published.  The dailies that published the poll could each 
be fined up to $25,000. 
 
 
8.  (U) As stipulated in Panama\'s electoral law, Thursday, 
April 22 was the deadline for publishing public opinion 
polls.  The measure is intended to prevent candidates from 
using doctored polls to influence voters.  The Electoral 
Tribunal is looking to strengthen the democratic system by 
encouraging Panamanians to cast informed votes rather than 
just voting for the frontrunner, or the number two if the 
frontrunner is unattractive.  Anyone publishing polls after 
April 22 will be fined. 
 
 
Aleman and Endara stage caravans 
-------------------------------- 
9.  (U) On Sunday, April 18, Arnufista candidate Jose 
Miguel Aleman and his coalition allies staged a caravan 
along key avenues of Panama City.  The caravan, with 
approximately 14,000 vehicles, surpassed Aleman\'s own 
estimate of possibly 7,000 cars.  No serious incidents were 
reported despite the fact that the caravan passed Endara 
and Torrijos supporters.  The Endara supporters were 
actively campaigning for their candidates along part of the 
Arnulfistas\' route.  Followers of Martin Torrijos actually 
came out of their residences with PRD-PP paraphernalia to 
taunt those participating in the caravan. 
 
 
10.  (SBU) Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara decided 
not to hold a large public gathering to top off his 
campaign, opting instead for a six-day caravan through 29 
communities from the Western province of Chiriqui on the 
Pacific coast to the Atlantic province of Colon.  The 
caravan began with a poor turnout on April 22 in Puerto 
Armuelles, Chiriqui.  Endara team sources in Chiriqui 
recently told PolOff, \"we\'ve got no chance in Puerto 
Armuelles.\"  One of Solidarity\'s legislative candidates, 
Mayra Fuentes, was an active PRD member until the PRD\'s 
alliance with the Partido Popular (PP) frustrated her bid 
for a legislative candidacy, prompting her to defect to 
Endara\'s camp.  Fuentes had also backed recently ousted and 
thoroughly disliked labor leader Jose Morris in a bitter 
dispute over control of the region\'s banana production. 
 
 
Rift in MOLIRENA 
---------------- 
11.  (U) The National Liberal Republican Movement 
(MOLIRENA) is considering expelling five party members who 
have expressed public support for Solidarity Party 
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara instead of 
MOLIRENA\'s \"official\" candidate, Jose Miguel Aleman. 
(Party by-laws allow expulsion of those who disobey Party 
guidance.)  The members to be expelled are Raymundo Hurtado 
Lay, a former legislator and until recently Panama\'s 
Ambassador to Paraguay; Gisela Chung, a former legislator 
and until recently Panama\'s diplomatic representative to 
the People\'s Republic of China; Plutarco Arrocha, former 
Governor of Panama Province and former Consul General in 
Vietnam; Luis B. Rosas, a former Deputy Comptroller General 
and Marilyn Vallarino, sister of Panama\'s current Vice 
President, Arturo Vallarino.  Hurtado, Chung, Arrocha and 
Rosas all served their first public offices under President 
Guillermo Endara (1989-1994).  COMMENT: When Guillermo 
\"Billy\" Ford joined the Endara Team, his departure from 
MOLIRENA accentuated an existing division in the party. 
The five siding with Endara show Ford\'s continued pull 
within MOLIRENA, as well as the \"defectors\'\" support for 
Endara.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PARM, PREL, KNNP, EWWT, EAIR, PM, LABOR, HUMAN RIGHTS,POLMIL 
SUBJECT: PSI: ANSWERS TO KEY QUESTIONS ON CARGO HANDLING 
 
REF: STATE 55415 
 
 
Per reftel, please see below PSI-related questions and 
answers on Panamanian laws regarding cargo handling. 
 
 
 
 
I.  Shipping/Cargo Manifests 
 
 
-- Are cargo manifests (or similar documentation) required in 
connection with the shipment of goods onboard ships and 
aircraft: 
i.  departing the country; 
ii. entering the country; 
iii.  transiting in the country\'s territorial sea and/or 
airspace? 
 
 
BY SEA: Cargo manifests are required in all three situations. 
 
 
BY AIR: Cargo manifests are required in all three situations. 
 
 
 
 
-- Are cargo manifests required to be completed by sea and 
air carriers registered within subject country, even if they 
are engaged in trade outside of the country? 
 
 
BY SEA: Cargo manifests are required.  Specifically, when 
cargo is going to a US port, the carrier is required to 
submit a declaration for all cargo onboard to the US 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Bureau of 
Investigations and Criminal Enforcement (BICE) no later than 
24 hours prior to the time the cargo is loaded on the 
carrier\'s vessel in the non-US port. 
 
 
BY AIR: Cargo manifests are required. 
 
 
 
 
-- When completing manifests, what level of detail is 
required in describing cargo being carried, including type 
and quantity? 
 
 
BY SEA: Cargo manifests must include a description of the 
cargo or the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) number 
under which the cargo is classified, weight of the cargo and 
quantity of the cargo (expressed in the lowest external 
packaging unit). 
 
 
BY AIR: Cargo manifests must include name of the 
airline/owner operator, nationality and registration, flight 
number, date, points of departure/arrival, number and type of 
packages, nature of goods, gross weight, and destination of 
master airway bill. 
 
 
 
 
-- What, if any, civil and/or criminal penalties exist in 
connection with the following (and do they allow for seizure 
of cargo as one potential penalty): 
i.  failing to prepare a manifest; 
ii.  failing to properly complete a manifest; 
iii.  misrepresenting items listed on, or fraudulently 
completing, a manifest? 
 
 
BY SEA: Fines may be levied depending on how serious and how 
often the failure to properly reflect cargo on manifests. 
There are no criminal penalties. 
 
 
BY AIR: Fines may be levied depending on how serious and how 
often the failure to properly reflect cargo on manifests. 
There are no criminal penalties. 
 
 
 
 
-- Does the subject country\'s law permit officials from 
another country, with the consent of the subject country, to 
detain individuals on vessels operating under the subject 
country\'s flag in international waters, based upon suspected 
violations of (a) the subject country\'s law?; (b) the other 
country\'s law? 
 
 
BY SEA: Yes, on a case-by-case basis, the GOP can (and has) 
permitted another country, specifically the USG, to detain 
individuals on vessels operating under the Panamanian flag in 
international waters. 
 
 
 
 
-- In cases where such detentions occur, are there any 
specific requirements concerning how the subject country, or 
the other country, could assume jurisdiction over such 
individuals (e.g., would extradition or similar formal 
transfer process required)? 
 
 
Embassy is currently negotiating a bilateral memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) to define such procedures; however, in 
practice, in the past, Panama\'s National Maritime Service 
(SMN) authorizes boardings, and its Maritime Authority (AMP) 
authorizes detentions.  The USG has never requested waiver of 
jurisdiction from the Foreign Ministry (MFA). 
 
 
-- What limitations exist in the subject country\'s criminal 
justice system on the introduction at trial against an 
accused of evidence that has been gathered by officials of 
another country (e.g., situations in which officials of the 
other country would be required to testify or submit 
affidavits in order for such evidence to be admissible)? 
 
 
No limitations exist per se, as allowed under the bilateral 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). 
 
 
 
 
II.  Hazardous Cargo Requirements 
-- Is the country implementing and enforcing mandatory 
international standards for cargo handling, stowage, marking, 
placarding, and labeling related to the shipment of dangerous 
goods by sea or air? 
BY SEA: Shippers must provide all information 24 hours prior 
to a vessel\'s arrival, such as the Container Packing 
Certificate and a Certified Hazardous Materials Shipping 
Paper with container number, name/status, 
company/organization of signatory, place, date, and signature 
on behalf of the packer.  All containers with dangerous goods 
must have placards on lateral, front and back of the 
container, according to hazard type. 
 
 
BY AIR: The shipment of dangerous goods must meet 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards. 
 
 
 
 
-- What reporting requirements exist in subject country to 
report hazardous cargo onboard vessels entering subject 
country\'s ports/airports/territory? 
 
 
BY SEA: All information mentioned above should be provided to 
a vessel\'s chief mate by the customer.  The chief mate 
presents the same to the port upon entering/departing the 
country or transiting the Panama Canal. 
 
 
BY AIR: In order to handle \"dangerous goods,\" a country is 
required to have a Shipper\'s Declaration, an IATA license and 
two employees registered to handle such materials.  Materials 
must be labeled according to IATA regulations. 
 
 
 
 
-- What types of cargo are covered by such reporting 
requirements? 
 
 
BY SEA: Most dangerous goods are permitted, except as 
classified under the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) Inter-Modal Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code class 2 and, at 
Balboa Port, as classified under the IMO IMDG Code class 1.1, 
1.2 and 1.3. 
 
 
BY AIR: Dangerous goods and restricted items, as classified 
in IATA\'s directory. 
 
 
 
 
-- What penalties exist for failure to report such cargo when 
entering port/airport/territory (e.g., seizure of the vessel, 
seizure of the cargo, criminal penalties against the ship\'s 
Master or crew, etc)? 
 
 
BY SEA: Fines may be levied for failure to report hazardous 
cargo.  Seizure of such cargo is permitted if it is not 
properly authorized by Panamanian authorities. 
 
 
BY AIR: Fines may be levied for failure to report hazardous 
cargo.  Seizure of such cargo is permitted if it is not 
properly authorized by Panamanian authorities. 
 
 
 
 
-- What, if any, reporting requirements exist in subject 
country law for vessels transiting the territorial sea, 
airspace, or territory to report hazardous cargo? 
 
 
BY SEA: No reporting requirements exist. 
 
 
BY AIR: No reporting requirements exist. 
 
 
 
 
-- What type of cargo and quantities thereof are covered by 
such reporting requirements? 
 
 
N/A 
 
 
-- What sanctions exist for failure to report such cargo when 
transiting the territorial sea, airspace, or territory (e.g., 
seizure of the vessel, seizure of the cargo, criminal 
penalties against the ship\'s Master or crew, etc)? 
 
 
N/A 
 
 
-- Can any of the sanctions identified in the questions above 
be applied against the registered owner or operator of the

Summary: Torrijos On Top 
------------------------- 
1. (C) Martin Torrijos and his Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD), well ahead by most indicators, are poised to win the 
presidency and a plurality of legislative seats in Panama\'s 
Sunday, May 2, 2004 general elections.  The American-educated 
Torrijos has marginalized the PRD\'s \"old guard\" and has shown 
that he intends to work closely with U.S. officials, 
especially on bilateral security and law enforcement issues 
of mutual concern.  Backed by a base coalition of nearly 
one-quarter of Panama\'s two million registered voters, 
Torrijos has a solid margin over his nearest competitor, 
Panama\'s 1989-94 President Guillermo Endara.  Endara, running 
on the Solidarity Party ticket, and Arnulfista candidate Jose 
Miguel Aleman, continue to compete for the anti-PRD vote. 
Torrijos is a little known quantity in governing style; how 
he will reduce corruption, for instance, is far from clear. 
Embassy expects a free and fair election and will dispatch 28 
volunteer observers throughout the country to watch it 
develop.  End Summary. 
 
 
The Numbers Game: Final Installment 
----------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) Recent public opinion polls show Torrijos with a 
substantial lead, followed by Endara and Aleman.  They 
probably correctly rank the candidates but do not reveal the 
true margins between them.  An April 20 La Prensa poll and an 
April 22 El Panama America poll both show Martin Torrijos 
well ahead of second-place candidate Guillermo Endara with 
third and fourth-place candidates Jose Miguel Aleman 
(Arnulfista Party) and Ricardo Martinelli (Democratic Change 
Party) well behind: 
 
 
Candidate      La Prensa (4/20)    El Panama America (4/22) 
---------      ----------------    ------------------------ 
Torrijos             47%                     45% 
Endara               28%                     27% 
Aleman               19%                     10% 
Martinelli            6%                      6% 
undecided             0%*                    12% 
 
 
*La Prensa\'s poll was based on simulated voting by \"probable 
voters\" who all cast \"virtual ballots.  Therefore, no one was 
\"undecided\" in the results. 
 
 
Legislative Head Count 
---------------------- 
3.  (SBU) All seven of Panama\'s officially recognized 
political parties will likely claim at least one of 
seventy-eight total seats in Panama\'s unicameral Legislative 
Assembly when it reopens on September 1, 2004.  The PRD on 
its own probably will not win an absolute majority of 40 
seats.  The PRD-PP electoral alliance could have a shot at 
controlling the legislature, but the alliance may not survive 
election day.  Also, several likely PRD winners for 
legislative seats are not loyal to Torrijos or other party 
leaders.  With several races too close to call, Emboffs have 
identified the following probable outcomes:

Democratic Change Party (CD)                    1-2 
 
 
Comment: Wild Card? 
------------------- 
4.  (C) The wild card in this election is the actual extent 
of support for ex-president Endara, who some observers think 
could attract far more votes from undecided voters and 
Panama\'s 100,000 government workers than opinion polls 
suggest.  Some interlocutors, including Endara\'s foreign 
policy specialist and former Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino, have suggested that if Endara were to win the 
presidency, he would create a new party, attracting numerous 
Arnulfistas.  Emboffs expect the substantial Solidarity 
contingent noted above to ride into the Assembly on Endara\'s 
coattails, but quickly split rather than forming a unified 
front.  Most Solidarity legislative candidates were either 
originally members of other parties or are newcomers to the 
political scene. 
 
 
Divided Conquerors 
------------------ 
5.  (C) A internal PRD struggle for positions and influence 
in a new government may quickly become Torrijos\' first major 
challenge.  Torrijos campaign finance manager Ubaldino Real 
told POL Counselor April 1 that the Torrijos campaign team 
has postponed showing its intentions on job assignments in a 
Torrijos government.  Real confided that the choices, once 
announced, would surprise and anger Perez Balladares 
supporters and others of the old guard.  Although the 
Torrijos inner circle is comfortable shutting out the old 
guard after election day, Real denied that Torrijos would owe 
political \"debts\" to them.  Real, a management consultant, 
explained that the campaign team had defined profiles for key 
cabinet positions and had identified at least three people 
who fit the profile for each one.  He said that Torrijos 
probably has names in mind for cabinet appointees, but added 
that Torrijos has not shared them with anyone. 
 
 
The young lions 
--------------- 
6.  (C) The emergence of young leaders like Torrijos and 
Panama Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro, likely to be re-elected in 
a landslide, has not purged the PRD of followers of former 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares (1994-99) but it has 
rejuvenated party membership and offers much better examples 
to follow.  Like their closest friends and advisors, Torrijos 
and Navarro are US-educated modernists, well-versed in doing 
business with Americans.  If \"change comes from the top\" in 
Panama\'s top-down political structure, their leadership from 
positions of authority could greatly improve US-Panama 
relations in the long run by improving governance in Panama. 
But much will depend on how truly committed they are to 
change, and how well they can keep the old Guard at bay in 
the post-election scramble for plum positions in the next 
government.

Summary/Comment: Almost Showtime 
-------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Presidential candidates staged campaign closing 
rallies throughout the final week before Panama\'s Sunday, 
May 2 General Elections.  EmbOffs met OAS observers to 
discuss Election Day plans on April 27.  Electoral 
authorities announced final logistical arrangements and 
accepted control of Panama\'s Public Forces from President 
Moscoso in an April 26 protocol ceremony.  On Election Day, 
Embassy will log and report observer feedback from the field 
and keep Washington abreast of preliminary and final 
results, as well as provide background on the presidential 
and vice-presidential winners. 
 
 
Aleman\'s last shebang 
--------------------- 
2.  (SBU) In a packed but listless gathering in downtown 
Panama City, the Administration-backed alliance candidate, 
Arnulfista Jose Miguel Aleman held his final rally on 
Sunday, April 24.  While the event was crowded and colorful, 
the masses liked the concerts more than the speeches.  At 
least 200,000 Arnulfista, National Liberal Republican 
(MOLIRENA) and Liberal National Party (PLN) followers were 
bussed in from throughout the country to participate. 
Responding to PRD claims that the Arnulfistas would try to 
manipulate voting results (an extremely remote scenario), 
Aleman shot back that the PRD were the \"masters of electoral 
fraud\" and insisted that Arnulfistas be attentive on 
Election Day. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) First Presidential candidate Jesus Rosas reminded 
the multitudes of the opposition PRD\'s history of 
wrongdoing, even mentioning names of people who disappeared 
during the military regime of late General Omar Torrijos, 
Martin Torrijos\' father.  EmbOffs spoke to several GOP 
authorities at the event, many of whom were surprisingly 
enthusiastic about an Aleman win.  On the other hand, GOP 
legislative candidates were positive about being re-elected, 
but confided that Aleman\'s is losing on their turf. 
 
 
Torrijos says \"yes we can\" 
------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) As well as successful 4/24 and 4/25 rallies 
outside the capital, Martin Torrijos and the PRD staged an 
energetic 4/28 campaign-closing rally in the same Panama 
City venue that their Administration opponent Jose Miguel 
Aleman used just 3 days earlier.  PolOff spoke to several 
Torrijos team members at the event, who were unanimously 
optimistic about a Torrijos win and relieved that the 
campaign is almost over.  None of the mud that opponents 
have thrown at Torrijos in the past weeks has stuck, they 
claimed.  Everyone, including Torrijos supporter, salsa 
superstar, and aspiring cabinet member Ruben Blades, used 
the campaign slogan \"yes we can\" (si se puede in Spanish) to 
animate the crowd. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Martin\'s speech was full of crowd-pleasing sound 
bites, but many critics, particularly his Arnulfista 
opponents, considered it devoid of substance.  Torrijos took 
aim at the Arnulfistas, but insisted that he wants to defeat 
corruption, poverty, and unemployment, not just the 
Arnulfistas.  Torrijos\' evident appeal to the crowd of over 
100,000 (but not bussed in from other parts of the country) 
exceeded that of highly popular Panama City Mayor Juan 
Carlos Navarro, who spoke first.  Martin\'s support among 
young Panamanians is unmatched by any of his opponents. 
Several PRD legislative candidates in their early 30s 
remarked to PolOff that they represent the new face of the 
PRD.  One expressed concern that, much like in the U.S., 
young Panamanians are most likely not to vote.  (Comment: 
The untested supposition is that they would vote for 
Torrijos if they do show up at the polls. End Comment.) 
 
 
Endara tops off his tank 
------------------------ 
6.  (SBU) Former President Guillermo Endara refuted claims 
by his Arnulfista and PRD opponents that he is physically 
and electorally weak.  Garnering popular support for his 
frugal campaign, Solidarity candidate Guillermo Endara ended 
his six-day caravan on April 27 in Colon, his strongest 
province, by repeating that he is not beholden to campaign 
donors, unlike his opponents.  Endara, who started the 
caravan in the Western Province of Chiriqui, transited the 
provinces of Veraguas, Herrera, Los Santos, Cocle, and 
Panama before arriving in Colon.  Though not a glitzy 
extravaganza, Endara\'s caravan drew a significant following 
along its course despite a slow start.  Turnout in Colon was 
strong, but small compared to Torrijos and Aleman\'s Panama 
City rallies. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Panamanians old enough to remember Endara\'s 
presidency tend to recall him fondly, identify with his 
\"ordinary guy\" image and respect his reputation for honesty. 
Random EmbOff taxi-driver polls still show him as the 
frontrunner.  In his final speech, Endara shouted, \"I\'m 
going to win damn it!\" (\"Voy a ganar, carajo!\")  That sort 
of vulgarity is an advantage with Panamanian masses, but 
cause for others to worry about the international image that 
Endara would project.  In his promise to be accountable, 
Endara told voters to \"yank on my ears,\" (\"jalar mis 
orejas\") if as President he does not live up to his campaign 
promises. 
 
 
OAS Observers discuss plans with Embassy 
---------------------------------------- 
8.  (SBU) Chief of OAS\' Observer mission to Panama Moises 
Benamor met Ambassador Watt on 4/27 to discuss observation 
plans.  The OAS intends to focus on two issues: (i) hard to 
access areas of the country, and (ii) the role of collective 
actors like the government, the political parties, and the 
press in the electoral process.  In addition to a quick- 
count for TE consumption of presidential votes, the OAS will 
interview voters and electoral officials on their views 
about the electoral process.  Benamor and his colleagues 
also trained OAS international observers and Panamanian 
electoral authorities on election observation.  Emboffs 
exchanged numbers with Benamor and his team and will 
communicate with the OAS delegation throughout Election Day. 
 
 
TE in command of Panama\'s Public Forces 
--------------------------------------- 
9.  (SBU) On 4/26, President Moscoso and Minister of 
Government and Justice Arnulfo Escalona transferred control 
over Panama\'s Public Forces (National Police (PNP), National 
Maritime Service (SMN), National Air Service (SAN) and the 
Institutional Protection Service (SPI)) to the Electoral 
Tribunal (TE) in a ceremony attended by the entire Moscoso 
cabinet as well as political party and Public Forces 
representatives.  As set forth in Electoral Code Article 197 
control over Public Forces will revert to the executive 
branch after the TE has issued credentials to the President- 
elect (usually a few days after Election Day).  This part of 
Panama\'s electoral process is a holdover of the transition 
from dictatorship to democracy.  Since the TE has 
coordinated every step of the electoral process with the 
Public Forces, the transfer ceremony was just a formality. 
 
 
Final Electoral Data 
-------------------- 
10.  (U) Panama\'s seven political parties have accredited 
57,766 of their members nationwide to represent them at the 
polls.  Also, 20,124 electoral volunteers will staff polls 
throughout the country.  The Electoral Tribunal (TE) has 
hired, trained, and accredited 4,162 management and support 
staff and 3,243 members of vote counting boards.  Finally 
the TE has rented 7 helicopters, 5 small planes, 8 large 
boats, 160 smaller boats, 1,219 horses and 1,843 vehicles to 
transport staff and materials on election weekend. 
 
 
Moscoso promises smooth transition 
---------------------------------- 
11.  (SBU) President Mireya Moscoso announced that soon 
after Election Day she would appoint a commission to 
coordinate transition issues with the President-elect\'s 
representatives.  Former President Endara appointed a 1994 
transition commission that worked closely with his 
successor, Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB), but EPB did not 
do the same in 1999 for Moscoso representatives.  Perez 
Balladares\' commission ignored meeting and information 
requests, generating a bitter transition.  EPB even used the 
Legislative Assembly he controlled to pass a law exempting 
him from attending Moscoso\'s inauguration.  (Note: Prior to 
1999, the outgoing President participated in installing the 
new President by transferring the official sash and 
delivering a farewell speech.  End Note.)  When the Moscoso 
government took over they found erased hard drives in 
several government offices and had to hire computer 
specialists to restore lost data. (Comment: Embassy plans to 
press GOP leaders to fulfill Moscoso\'s pledge to ensure a 
smooth transition.)

---------------- 
1.  (C)  According to GOP police reports, an alleged child 
prostitution ringleader, Elizabeth Archibold Diaz, 
surrendered herself to the Policia Tecnica Judicial (PTJ) on 
April 14, 2004.  She was accompanied by her attorney and, to 
date, remains in custody.  Archibold is alleged to be the 
mastermind of a child prostitution ring that was broken up in 
late January 2004.  Two Colombian nationals, David Aguirre 
Obregon and Wilson Aguirre Obregon, were arrested during the 
initial PTJ raid.  Information obtained during the raid and 
subsequent arrests indicated that Archibold was the head of 
the ring and a warrant was issued for her arrest.  Panamanian 
minors as young as twelve were working in this ring (See Ref. 
A).  Archibold\'s arrest and on-going questions should bolster 
the case against all involved in this ring. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT TOUGH ON ILLEGAL PROSTITUTION 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2.  (U)  Panama\'s Immigration department continues its 
efforts to eliminate illegal and unlicensed prostitution.  In 
raids conducted from April 19-21, 2004, Immigration officials 
arrested 29 foreign women working illegally (without work 
permits) at numerous nightclubs and bars in Panama City.  All 
of the women were from Colombia or the Dominican Republic. 
Many of their passports indicated that they had just arrived 
in Panama.  These women will be deported to their respective 
countries.  (NOTE:  The Immigration Department says that 
their officers resolutely try to ascertain if the women are 
TIP victims.  Immigration officials have shown EmbOffs the 
form they give to arrested women which allows them to claim 
that they are TIP victims.  In addition, Immigration has 
included third-party observers on raids.  End Note.) 
 
 
3.  (U)  The Immigration Department as conducted a number of 
raids throughout Panama, which are part of a a larger, 
coordinated regional effort to combat illegal immigration. 
Entitled \"Gallo Pinto\" it promises increased cooperation 
between regional immigration authorities.  There has been 
some criticism of the raids by a local left-wing 
organization, Caritas Panama.  Caritas-Panama claims that the 
arrests and deportations violate the illegal immigrants\' 
human rights.  (NOTE:  Caritas Panama is not related to the 
Catholic Church relief and social service organization, 
Caritas Arquidiocesana.  The local leader of Caritas, 
Monsignor Duran has told EmbOffs repeatedly that 
Caritas-Panama is not part of the Caritas network. End Note.) 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU)  The GOP is sustaining its heightened efforts to 
combat TIP, recognizing that more investigations, arrests, 
and prosecution are necessary to fully combat TIP in Panama. 
An upcoming high-level regional immigration conference (May 
17-21) hosted by the GOP will include a substantial anti-TIP 
component.  Embassy will continue to work closely with the 
GOP to ensure that on-going efforts are sustained and that 
areas for improvement (i.e. victim identification) are 
addressed.

SUBJECT: PANAMA RESULTS: MARTIN TORRIJOS IS PRESIDENT 
 
 
(SBU) In a smashing victory that validated the opinion polls 
and probably will give him a popular mandate, Martin Torrijos 
swept to victory in Panama\'s May 2 national elections.  With 
more than 45% of precincts reporting at 9:00 p.m., Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) standard bearer Torrijos had 47-48% 
of the vote, followed by Solidarity Party candidate former 
president Guillermo Endara with 30-31%, and 
Arnulfista-MOLIRENA-National Liberal candidate Jose Miguel 
Aleman with 17-18%.  Democratic Action Party candidate 
Ricardo Martinelli was last with 4-5%.  Panama\'s Electoral 
Tribunal president called Torrijos at 7:40 p.m. local time to 
tell him that he was the unofficial winner.  Aleman and 
Endara both conceded defeat and both said that Torrijos had 
won fairly, adding that they would give him their full 
support.  There were isolated allegations of fraud and vote 
buying in several legislative races, although it may take 
several days for the charges to be investigated.  OAS 
observer mission chief Moises Benamor told PolOff that he had 
congratulated the Electoral Tribunal and added that Panama 
did an excellent job compared with other electoral processes 
in the region.  All newly elected officials will take office 
on September 1, 2004.  Embassy will report comprehensive 
election results on May 3 by septel.

SUMMARY: MARTIN TORRIJOS WINS MAY 2 GENERAL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
1. (SBU) At 7:35 p.m. local time (8:35 p.m. Washington time), 
Panama\'s Electoral Tribunal declared Martin Erasto Torrijos 
Espino the winner of Panama\'s May 2, 2004 General Elections. 
It appeared that voter participation would exceed 75%. 
Torrijos\' five-year term as President will commence September 
1, 2004.  Torrijos\' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
joined forces with its historical opponent, the Popular Party 
(PP) to propel him to victory.  Torrijos has surrounded 
himself with young, primarily US-educated professionals like 
himself and has changed the face of the PRD by marginalizing 
\"old guard\" supporters of former President Ernesto Perez 
Balladares (1994-99).  Torrijos is a little-known quantity in 
governing style, largely because his government experience is 
minimal.  Torrijos and those closest to him have shown strong 
indications that they intend to work closely with U.S. 
officials, especially on security, law enforcement, trade and 
investment.  Torrijos is married and has three children.  His 
wife, the former Vivian Fernandez Bello, whose parents were 
born in Cuba, is a successful professional woman in public 
relations.  Like her husband, Mrs. Torrijos speaks English 
well.  End Summary. 
 
 
PERSONAL BACKGROUND 
------------------- 
2.  (SBU) The son of former Panamanian dictator Omar Torrijos 
and Xenia Espino, a former Air Panama flight attendant who 
was not Omar\'s wife, Martin Torrijos was born on July 18, 
1963.  Torrijos\' maternal grandparents raised him during his 
early years in the town of Chitre, 251 km. west of Panama 
City in Herrera Province since his mother traveled often for 
work.  At approximately age 12, Torrijos moved to a Panama 
City apartment with his mother.  Torrijos has publicly 
praised his mother and maternal grandparents for raising him. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Omar Torrijos only recognized Martin Torrijos as 
his son when he was in his teens, and sent him to St. John\'s 
Military Academy in Wisconsin to attend high school with his 
half-brother Omar Jr., under the \"parental\" supervision of 
Colon-born business Cirilo McSween, who later \"adopted\" 
Martin and Omar after their father\'s 1981 death in a plane 
crash.  Torrijos, who spent ages 15-29 (1978-1992) mostly in 
the United States, earned bachelors degrees from Texas A&M in 
political science (1986) and economics (1988).  During 
1989-91, before Ernesto Perez Balladares (EPB) called 
Torrijos back to Panama to help reorganize the PRD in 1992, 
Torrijos helped manage several McDonald\'s franchises owned by 
McSween\'s Cirilo Incorporated, as well as insurance and 
banking interests in the Chicago area. 
 
 
4.  (C) Torrijos is a quiet deliberator who has only recently 
come out of his shell as a decisive leader.  Many interpret 
his reserve as a sign that he lacks substance and is easy 
prey for manipulation.  Torrijos, who considers himself a 
\"self-made man,\" is exceedingly self-conscious about giving 
the appearance that others maintain or manipulate him. 
Opponents\' probes during the campaign regarding the source of 
Torrijos\' personal wealth angered him greatly because he 
understood that they sought to \"prove\" the supposition that 
he owes all of his wealth to proceeds of Panama\'s corrupt 
21-year dictatorship.  Torrijos\' Campaign finance manager 
Ubaldino Real, who met him at Texas A & M, noted that 
Torrijos\' reluctance or inability to describe his assets and 
business interests tends to exacerbate rumors of ill-gotten 
wealth by making it appear that he is trying to hide 
something. 
 
 
5.  (C) Martin Torrijos married Vivian Fernandez Bello, whose 
parents are Cuban, in 1990.  They have three children, 
Daniella, Martin Jr., and Nicolas.  Vivian has a successful 
public relations firm, but has stated that she will take time 
off to support Martin\'s five-year presidency.  Both Martin 
and Vivian have a profound interest in programs to assist the 
handicapped.  Their ten-year-old daughter Daniella has 
spastic cerebral palsy, but thanks to the best medical care 
available, she has developed only slightly slower than other 
children her age. 
POLITICAL/GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE 
------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) After officially registering with the PRD on May 
14, 1993, Martin became PRD Youth Committee chairman in 1994. 
 When EPB became president in 1994, he named Martin as Vice 
Minister of Government and Justice.  Torrijos kept a low 
profile as Vice Minister, which led his opponents to 
criticize his apparent lack of governing experience, 
particularly during the recent campaign.   While 
Vice-Minister during EPB\'s 1994-99 term Torrijos also served 
on the Board of Directors of several government entities, 
including the now-privatized Civil Aviation Authority and 
state-owned telephone utility INTEL, and the Prison 
Modernization Commission. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) After EPB lost a 1998 referendum to permit him to 
run for another term, Martin competed against and defeated 
current Panama City Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro and several 
others for the PRD\'s 1999 presidential nomination.  Viewing 
Martin as the least threatening to his future prospects, EPB 
grudgingly made way for Torrijos\' 1999 run for president. 
Rumors have circulated for over a year in Panama that EPB, 
eyeing a 2009 comeback for himself, even surreptitiously 
backed Torrijos opponent Guillermo Endara. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Since his May 1999 loss to Mireya Moscoso, 
Torrijos\' sole purpose was winning the presidency in 2004. 
When Torrijos (38% of vote) lost the 1999 election to Moscoso 
(44% of vote), he dedicated himself full time to recruiting 
new PRD Members and consolidating his control over the party. 
 Some of Torrijos\' closest associates have estimated that up 
to half of the PRD\'s 474,000 registered voters as of January 
2004 joined the party to follow him.  Regardless of the exact 
figure, Torrijos has tremendous appeal with Panamanian youth 
and has managed to break some of the anti-PRD stigma, 
particularly with those who are too young to remember the 
harder years of Panama\'s 1968-89 military dictatorship. 
 
 
LIKELY POLICIES 
--------------- 
9.  (SBU) In addition to \"yes we can,\" Torrijos\' campaign 
mantra was \"more jobs, more security, zero corruption.\" 
Torrijos has proposed creating jobs by \"revitalizing\" 
export-capable economic sectors, such as agriculture and 
manufacturing; increasing productivity and competitiveness 
(through training, education, and investment in 
infrastructure); prioritizing tourism, maritime services and 
ports, transport, fisheries, communications, and financial 
services such as \"growth industries\"; concluding a 
Panama-U.S. free trade agreement; and rationalizing public 
finances, reducing regulations, and completing the 
Colon-Panama highway.  First Vice President-elect Samuel 
Lewis Navarro has asserted that a U.S.-Panama bilateral Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) is about investment, not trade.  He 
touted the FTA for its positive effects on procurement and 
contracting as the main lever to get foreign financing for 
Canal expansion, which will be the biggest infrastructure 
project in the Hemisphere. 
 
 
10.  (C) Martin Torrijos made platform proposals on public 
security (delinquency and criminal behavior) and national 
security (protecting Panama\'s borders and Canal).  Torrijos 
said his platform will include six areas on which his 
administration would focus to improve overall security: (1) 
social and education programs, (2) Public Force (PPF) 
structural reforms, (3) administration of justice efficiency, 
(4) prison system improvements, (5) territorial and border 
security and (6) civil society participation.  Torrijos has 
his pick of trained security professionals from the 
now-defunct Panamanian Defense Forces who can help him 
structure his plans, and he has reached out to the Embassy as 
a potential partner in advancing some areas of mutual 
interest. 
 
 
11.  (C) Torrijos will have to back up his pledge to reduce 
corruption with concrete action, beginning with the selection 
of individuals with solid reputations to serve in key 
positions.  The prior PRD administration under EPB was 
notably corrupt and after five years out of power, PRD 
stalwarts are hungry for power and its perquisites, observers 
say.  Torrijos\' first cousin, Hugo Torrijos, until recently 
Torrijos\' campaign manager and finance chief, is heavily 
implicated in a multi-million dollar scandal involving Ports 
Engineering and Construction Company (PECC), but remains 
close to him.  Many observers think that Torrijos himself may 
be implicated in the multi-million dollar CEMIS scandal 
(although we have not seen any evidence yet to support those 
allegations).  Torrijos skillfully handled the PRD primaries, 
but opponents have criticized him for promising government 
jobs to primary losers to keep them in the party.  Embassy is 
looking forward to seeing how well Torrijos keeps his promise 
to revitalize the government transparency law by eliminating 
President Moscoso\'s restrictive implementing decree, which 
effectively gutted the law. 
 
 
KEY CHALLENGE: STRUGGLE WITHIN THE PRD 
-------------------------------------- 
12.  (C) An internal PRD struggle for positions and influence 
in a new government may quickly become Torrijos\' first major 
challenge.  Several sources close to Torrijos insist that he 
held off showing his cards on key job assignments in a 
Torrijos government, believing that his likely decisions 
would anger Perez Balladares supporters and others of the old 
guard.  Although the Torrijos inner circle is comfortable 
shutting out the old guard after election day, many have 
insisted that Torrijos would owe political \"debts\" to them. 
 
 
13.  (C) The emergence of young leaders like Torrijos has not 
purged the PRD of its \"old guard\" or followers of former 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares (1994-99), but it has 
rejuvenated party membership and offers much better examples 
to follow.  Like his closest friends, his running mates (See 
Septel), and advisors, Torrijos is a US-educated modernist, 
well-versed in doing business with Americans.  In fact, 
Torrijos has cast himself as \"Panama\'s Tony Blair,\" a free 
market liberal with strong social conscience.  If \"change 
comes from the top\" in Panama\'s top-down political structure, 
his leadership could greatly improve US-Panama relations in 
the long run by improving governance in Panama.  But much 
will depend on the durability of his resolve to change, and 
how well he can keep the \"old guard\" at bay in the 
post-election scramble for plum positions in the next 
government.

Summary: The \"Gringo handler\" and the politician 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
1.  (SBU) Martin Torrijos chose a seasoned businessman with 
strong political connections as his First Vice President and 
a soft-spoken, but seasoned politician as his Second Vice 
President.  First Vice President-elect Samuel Lewis Navarro 
is the son of former Noriega foreign minister (later 
anti-Noriega exile) Gabriel Lewis Galindo.  The Torrijos 
team\'s chief \"Gringo handler,\" the articulate, intelligent, 
pro-U.S. Lewis Navarro is a successful businessman with 
multi-national interests in fruit and packaging.  Many have 
speculated that Lewis Navarro will serve double duty as 
Torrijos\' Foreign Minister.  Second Vice President-elect 
Ruben Arosemena is the President of the Popular Party (PP), 
which joined forces with the PRD for the 2004 campaign.  Many 
campaign observers have suggested Arosemena, a second-term 
legislator from an influential political family, will 
spearhead President-elect Torrijos\' anti-corruption 
initiatives. 
 
 
Vice President-elect Lewis: The Businessman 
------------------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) Born on July 15, 1957, Samuel Lewis Navarro is a 
non-politician who is extremely well-connected politically. 
He was the frequent companion of his father, Gabriel Lewis 
Galindo, during the latter\'s long career -- which included 
assignment to Washington as the Panamanian Ambassador to the 
U.S. (1977-78), a period of exile in the US during the 1980s, 
founding support work in the National Civic Crusade against 
Noriega, and finally a term as Foreign Minister (1994-96) 
during the Perez Balladares administration.  Lewis Navarro 
has maintained his father\'s high-level political connections 
in the US.  Former President Jimmy Carter and members of the 
Kennedy family have visited his home on Contadora Island off 
the Pacific coast of Panama. 
 
 
3.  (C) Samuel Lewis Navarro is a close personal friend of 
Martin Torrijos.  He was the Vice President of the Solidarity 
Party until February 2003 when he withdrew his support from 
that party (his uncle, Samuel Lewis Galindo, is the party 
president) due to its choice of 2004 second-place finisher, 
former President Guillermo Endara as its presidential 
candidate.  Vice President-elect Lewis had wanted Solidarity 
to back Torrijos after 1999 third-place finisher Alberto 
Vallarino (17%) dropped out of the race in January 2003. 
Lewis Navarro only made the formal break with Solidarity 
almost a year later when he announced his candidacy as Martin 
Torrijos\' running mate.  (Comment: Vice President-elect Lewis 
was not alone in his desire that Solidarity support Torrijos. 
 Allegations appear farfetched that Samuel\'s opportunistic 
uncle used his party to support Endara only to split anti-PRD 
votes between Endara and 2004 third-place finisher Arnulfista 
candidate Jose Miguel Aleman, thus ensuring a Torrijos win. 
End Comment.) 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Lewis Navarro worked on behalf of the Solidarity 
Party for the presidential campaigns of his uncle, Samuel 
Lewis Galindo in 1994 and also that of Alberto Vallarino in 
1999.  In addition to his political connections, Samuel Lewis 
Navarro has also consistently focused his efforts on running 
his family business CIACSA, a holding company that controls 
the Lewis family\'s numerous domestic and international 
business interests focused primarily on boxes/paper products 
and fruit processing.  Appointed to the Board of Directors of 
the Panama Canal Authority by former President Ernesto Perez 
Balladares (1994-99), Lewis Navarro was replaced in May 2001 
by a Moscoso appointee. 
 
 
5.  (U) Lewis Navarro has an undergraduate degree in business 
from Georgetown University.  He is married to his second 
wife, with whom he has two children.  He also has a son and a 
daughter from his first marriage.  Panama City Mayor Juan 
Carlos Navarro is Samuel\'s first cousin; the two have a close 
relationship. 
 
 
Vice President-elect Arosemena: The Politician 
--------------------------------------------- - 
6.  (SBU) Ruben Eloy Arosemena Valdez was born on April 11, 
1960.  After attending the prestigious Panama City catholic 
high school Colegio La Salle, Arosemena obtained an 
undergraduate law degree at the Universidad de Santa Maria La 
Antigua (USMA), also in Panama City.  Later, Arosemena 
obtained a Masters in International and Comparative Law from 
Southern Methodist University. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Ruben Arosemena, the son of Christian Democratic 
Party (PDC)-founder Ruben Arosemena Guardia, is the President 
of the Popular Party (PP), which replaced the PDC.  After his 
first position as Provincial Secretary General, Arosemena 
advanced through the ranks of the PDC to become national 
Joint Secretary General for the PDC\'s youth wing.  Ruben was 
the PDC Secretary General in 1994 and a member of the Party\'s 
Executive Committee.  Before moving on to the Legislative 
Assembly, Arosemena\'s first elected position was as local 
representative (Representante de Corregimiento) for the 
Panama City area of Bella Vista from 1984-89. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) The pinaccle of Arosemena\'s legislative career was 
his 2001-02 position as President of Panama\'s Legislative 
Assembly.  He began working in the assembly as an alternate 
to Carlos Arrellano Lennox from 1989-94 in the upper-middle 
class 8-8 electoral circuit.  During the same period, Ruben 
was also the Assembly\'s Secretary General. In 1994, Arosemena 
succeeded Arrellano to win the legislative seat that he now 
holds.  He won re-election to the same seat in 1999. 
 
 
9.  (U) Prior to entering politics, Arosemena practiced law 
at the family law firm, R.R. Arosemena and Associates.  He is 
married to the former Pilar Arias, niece of PDC co-founder 
Ricardo Arias Calderon who served as Endara\'s First Vice 
President.  The couple has two young daughters.  Ruben speaks 
fluent English and is a member of the Panamanian Association 
of Business Executives (APEDE) and the Rotary Club.  He 
enjoys fishing. 
 
 
10.  (C) Comment: The Vice Presidents-elect, like Martin 
Torrijos, represent the same new generation of political 
leaders, one that all hope will leave behind the rampant 
patronage and nepotism that characterized the old.

1. (C) On April 22, PolOffs met with Russian Embassy 
Counselor (DCM) Oleg Ostrovskiy and First Secretary Evgeny 
Lebedev for our first tete-a-tete.  Both GOR diplomats are 
Americas specialists and have already served in Panama for a 
year or more.  Noting the good relationship between our 
countries\' heads of state and foreign ministries (Ref A) and 
our mutual interest in the war against global terrorism, he 
thanked PolOffs for reaching out to them regarding Ref A.  He 
offered to assist Embassy with the GOP in any 
counter-terrorism (CT) component that we may identify.  He 
commented on the bilateral information-sharing agreement 
between the GOR\'s Finance and Monetary Commission and the 
GOP\'s Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) to fight money 
laundering.  (Comment: We believe that agreement may be 
Russia\'s principal bilateral link with the GOP.  End 
Comment.)  At a February 2 mini-CT Action Group (CTAG) 
meeting, Ostrovskiy requested that the Embassy ask the GOP to 
brief the group on terrorist threats to Panamanian 
infrastructure.  (See Ref B.) 
 
 
-------------------- 
Making(-up) missions 
-------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Ostrovskiy admitted that the Russian Embassy has weak 
ties with the GOP, saying that Russia-Panama relations still 
were \"under development\".  The embassy is relatively small 
with only 15 personnel, all Russian nationals, including 
eight diplomats.  In the region, the GOR has embassies in 
Costa Rica and Nicaragua and is establishing an embassy in 
Guatemala, supposedly because of economic interests. 
Ostrovskiy claimed no regional representational 
responsibilities, though Lebedev stated that he and 
Ostrovskiy travel to Mexico and Cuba on a regular basis. 
When pressed, Ostrovskiy named growing export and investment 
opportunities and natural-disaster response assistance as 
Russian-Panamanian agenda items.  However, their Embassy\'s 
Economic Counselor position was just eliminated, and 
Ostrovskiy could not elaborate on any recent aid projects.

3.  Ostrovskiy confirmed Russia\'s plans to build a new

Contrary to local newspaper reports, it would not be adjacent 
to our own new embassy compound in Clayton.)  Also, he stated 
that the GOR has yet to allocate funds for construction, 
though a lease agreement on the land has been finalized. 
Groundbreaking for the new embassy compound was held November 
1, 2003, according to press reports, and would comprise 1.5 
hectares (3.6 acres).

4. (C) We pursued this meeting with the Russians because of 
comments made earlier to Ambassador Watt by former Russian 
ambassador Nikolay Vladimir, to the effect that Russia has 
plans to establish a Panama hub for its regional operations 
to replace Mexico, and would scale down its commercial and 
other activities in Mexico as it moves officers to Panama. 
After speaking with Ostrovskiy, it does not appear that 
changes in Russia\'s regional focus are imminent.

Summary: Voters embrace Torrijos and snub Moscoso 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
1.  (C) President-elect Martin Torrijos and his Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) won a commanding popular mandate in 
Panama\'s May 2, 2004 elections, sweeping all provinces but 
one.  The results were a stinging rebuke of President Mireya 
Moscoso, whose five-year term will end on September 1, 2004. 
Youth and women strongly backed Torrijos, whose \"new PRD\" was 
the only one of Panama\'s seven legally-recognized parties to 
hold primaries before the May 2004 elections.  Embassy\'s 28 
volunteer election observers, including Ambassador and DCM, 
watched the orderly and extensive (over 75%) May 2 polling 
throughout the country.  Torrijos finished with 47% of the 
vote, the strongest showing for a PRD candidate since 1989. 
Second-place finisher Guillermo Endara took 31.0% of the 
vote, leaving Arnulfista candidate Jose Miguel Aleman 
(Moscoso\'s former Foreign Minister) a distant third with 16%, 
the weakest showing ever for the Arnulfista Party. 
Perceptions of the Moscoso administration\'s image of 
corruption and ineffectiveness dragged Aleman down, but 
Arnulfista dissident Guillermo Endara\'s reputation for 
honesty and integrity attracted many votes.  The PRD won a 
plurality of at least 36 of Panama\'s 78 legislative seats and 
could win up to four more.  The PRD also won the mayoral 
seats in Panama\'s three largest cities, Panama, Colon, and 
David.  End Summary. 
 
 
Torrijos\' PRD on Top 
-------------------- 
2.  (C) Martin Torrijos\' triumph won him every Panamanian 
province but the small indigenous \"comarca\" of Kuna Yala 
(Aleman\'s only victory).  Torrijos\' persistent campaigning 
since his May 1999 loss to Mireya Moscoso brought him backing 
from young, energetic voters and attracted several members of 
other parties and independents.  Torrijos\' youth supporters 
joined his campaign through the PRD\'s \"Team Martin.\" 
Torrijos has marketed himself as a modern leader and used the 
PRD primaries to show that the PRD, once the political 
vehicle of military dictators, may indeed be Panama\'s most 
democratically-run party.  The PRD was so organized that 
rather than handing out campaign souvenirs like caps and 
T-shirts, they were able to sell them to finance the 
campaign.  (Comment: The Torrijos team\'s ability to stifle 
press coverage of Martin\'s tangential involvement in a 1985 
kidnapping is one of the few elements reminiscent of the 
PRD\'s old profile.  (See Reftel A for details.) End Comment.) 
 
 
Moscoso in the doldrums 
----------------------- 
3.  (C) President Mireya Moscoso, reeling from her party\'s 
greatest defeat ever, was clearly stunned and hurt when she 
conceded victory to Torrijos on May 2.  Running on a 
third-party ticket, Guillermo Endara, who left Moscoso\'s 
Arnulfista Party in early 2003 claiming that it had strayed 
from its roots under her leadership, nearly doubled 
Arnulfista Jose Miguel Aleman\'s anemic showing.  The sting of 
Endara\'s strong showing would have been bad enough without 
the massive support that Panamanians gave to Torrijos and his 
party, the Arnulfistas\' arch-enemies.  Endara\'s slogan, \"A 
Real President\" spoke to Panamanians disgruntled with the 
Moscoso administration\'s perceived incompetence and its 
failure to halt corruption or spur employment.  Voters also 
rejected Moscoso\'s arrogant refusal to make her government 
more transparent as they embraced Torrijos\' \"more jobs, more 
security, zero corruption\" message. 
 
 
What will happen to the Arnulfista\'s? 
------------------------------------- 
4.  (C) The Arnulfista Party\'s sound May 2 defeat could 
encourage either turnover in party leadership or exodus from 
the party.  In his May 2 concession speech, Aleman said he 
would not run again, to make way for other candidates like 
Carlos Raul Piad (his campaign manager), Marco Ameglio 
(Arnulfista\'s losing candidate for Mayor of Panama), and 
Alberto Vallarino (1999 third-party candidate who obtained 
17% of the vote).  Relations between Moscoso and the latter 
two, particularly Vallarino, are extremely tense.  If Moscoso 
refuses to loosen her iron grip on the Arnulfista Party, some 
observers have speculated that Endara (who could not himself 
return to the Arnulfistas having been expelled) will start a 
new party, attracting traditional Arnulfistas as he did for 
the May 2 general election.  The four months that remain in 
Moscoso\'s presidency might well indicate which way the party 
will go. 
 
 
What about the Legislature? 
--------------------------- 
5.  (SBU)  Although not all results have been tallied, 
non-official results published on the Electoral Tribunal 
website (http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa) point to 
winners in 74 of 78 legislative seats and tendencies for the 
other four.  Incumbents did rather badly.  The net results 
are:

Popular Party (PP)                               1 
 
 
6.  (SBU) The four remaining seats are in hotly-contested and 
heavily-populated multi-legislator electoral circuits subject 
to Panama\'s complicated proportional representation formula 
to identify winners.  The PRD could win all four remaining 
seats and thereby gain an absolute majority in Panama\'s 
unicameral legislature.  Given the Popular Party\'s poor 
showing in the legislature, it is in danger of being 
dissolved if it does not obtain at least 4% of the votes for 
President as set forth in Panama\'s Electoral Code. 
Statistics to confirm the PP\'s survival or demise are not yet 
available.  (Note: The Popular Party is Panama\'s former 
Christian Democratic Party. End Note.) 
 
 
What observers saw 
------------------ 
7.  (SBU) Embassy Panama\'s twenty-eight volunteer observers, 
disbursed throughout the country on May 2, noted a largely 
orderly and civil process.  Like OAS observers and 
Panamanians working for the Ombudsman\'s Office and the 
Catholic Church\'s Peace and Justice Commission, we saw a 
record number of Panamanians (approximately 77% of registered 
voters) turn out to vote.  OAS Observer Chief Moises Benamor 
told PolOff that he considered Panama\'s electoral process to 
be exemplary in the region.  As they return to the office, 
Embassy observers are turning in questionnaires that they 
completed at each voting place about the process.  Embassy 
will analyze the results of the questionnaires to assess the 
technical aspects of the process.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) Martin Torrijos, a 40-year-old politician with little 
national policy experience, scored a crushing electoral 
victory on May 2, while his Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) is positioned to control Panama\'s unicameral 
legislature.  After it takes office on September 1, the new 
government\'s foreign policy will focus on relations with the 
United States and Colombia, the Torrijos campaign has told 
us, and on maintaining, if not improving, the excellent 
cooperation we now enjoy with the government of Panama (GOP) 
on security and law enforcement matters.  Senior campaign 
officials have strongly suggested that Torrijos will take 
into account maintaining good bilateral cooperation in mind 
when making key appointments.  The PRD and Torrijos probably 
are closest to our views on trade and investment among 
Panama\'s political parties, and Torrijos likely will send 
observers to the next bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
round.  The decade-long, $8-10 billion Canal expansion 
project, which will soon become a priority for the new 
government, has already heavily involved the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers in concept-design planning and will likely offer 
sizable commercial prospects for U.S. firms.  The GOP no 
doubt will ask U.S. \"advice\" to secure financing from 
commercial lenders.  We doubt that a Torrijos government will 
prove more congenial to our positions on Cuba or Israel in 
the United Nations than prior Panamanian governments have 
been.  Nonetheless, we hope to maintain positive momentum in 
our overall relationship with the new government.  Embassy 
plans frequent meetings with transition team officials in 
coming months.  End Summary. 
 
 
An Eye on Key Appointments 
-------------------------- 
2.  (C) Winning 47% of the vote in Panama\'s May 2 national 
election, while his PRD appears to have won a majority of the 
78 seats in Panama\'s unicameral legislature, Martin Torrijos 
proved his mastery of the Panama political scene and claimed 
a strong mandate to govern.  Torrijos, an unknown quantity in 
governing style and substance, has emphasized an interest in 
issues -- law enforcement, security, trade and investment -- 
that we share.  We have every reason to believe that Torrijos 
will prove responsive to our attention to key appointments, 
especially in security and foreign policy.  (Comment: We have 
made clear to Torrijos that the appointment of certain 
Noriega and Perez Balladares-era officials to sensitive 
positions could cause problems in our bilateral relations. 
Transition team officials understand that and pledged to 
avoid such appointments.  End Comment.)  The evidence is 
growing that the so-called \"Friends of Martin\" -- a high 
proportion of whom are Texas A&M grads -- will dominate 
ministerial positions.  A Texas Aggie collective in power in 
Panama will offer an obvious Texas connection for Washington. 
 
 
Law Enforcement and Security Policy 
----------------------------------- 
3.  (C) We expect to maintain or improve the already 
extraordinary level of access and cooperation we now enjoy 
with Panamanian officials on law enforcement and security 
policy.  The transition team has assured us that, if there is 
a change in the level of cooperation, it will be a change for 
the better.  We are currently assessing how to mitigate 
slowdowns in the first few months of the new administration 
due to transitions and learning curves.  In coming weeks and 
months, we plan to enhance and exploit our excellent contacts 
with Torrijos officials and to give the transition team as 
much detailed knowledge of our programs and policy priorities 
as is practicable.  Our core country team group charted 
Embassy\'s approach to the new government in an internal 
strategy meeting on May 7. 
 
 
Pol-Mil 
------- 
4.  (C) Some of our current Pol-Mil arrangements with the GOP 
are based on informal and ad-hoc understandings, which we 
will have to explain at length during the transition period. 
The PRD harbors a relatively large number of skilled maritime 
lawyers, who can be expected to place a premium on those 
issues, which include the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI - due to be signed in Washington on May 12), High Seas 
Crimes, seafarer identification, etc.  We also have briefed 
the transition team on USG concerns regarding the Colon free 
trade zone. 
 
 
Darien, Atlantic Coast 
---------------------- 
5.  (C)   Torrijos is known to have a more pro-active 
attitude toward security on the Darien-Colombian border and 
the Atlantic coastal region and has proposed establishing a 
greater GOP presence in both regions.  The aim is to improve 
civilian-police relations in the Darien and to boost security 
in both areas.  The transition team has told us of plans to 
rehabilitate 20-30 WWII-era landing strips on the Atlantic 
Coast, along with a shift away from the use of helicopters to 
a much greater reliance on cheaper-to-operate single-engine 
airplanes.  By ensuring security at the landing fields, by 
improving communication with remote areas, and with plans to 
increase the number of rural teachers and medical personnel, 
the transition team hopes the new government will create 
goodwill in rural areas and gain an important intelligence 
capability and control that is now all but non-existent.  The 
Atlantic Coast is now in the hands of outlaws, the team has 
told us. 
 
 
Foreign Policy 
-------------- 
6.  (C) Torrijos has made clear that his foreign policy 
priorities are the United States and Colombia, and he has 
traveled recently to Bogota to meet president Uribe.  (He 
traveled to the United States in October as a presidential 
candidate to meet with State Department and Pentagon 
officials.)  One negative item on the agenda with Colombia is 
illegal immigration, estimated in excess of 100,000 people. 
The transition team believes that ordinary Panamanians are 
growing resentful of illegal Colombians because of job 
displacement, and team officials have said the new government 
will end illegal immigration practices. 
 
 
UN General Assembly 
------------------- 
7.  (C) In the UN General Assembly, we expect little change 
in Panama\'s basic voting patterns, which will conform to the 
broader NAM trajectory be generally uncongenial with U.S. 
positions on Cuba and Israel.  Nonetheless, we will work with 
the new government to make our case on the importance of UN 
voting patterns in our bilateral relations. 
 
 
No Change in Taiwan-PRC Relations 
--------------------------------- 
8.  (S/NF) Despite clandestine reporting to the contrary, we 
believe that Torrijos will continue Panama\'s long-standing 
official relations with Taiwan, and not with the People\'s 
Republic of China.  Torrijos probably accepted campaign 
contributions from both sides, and will probably continue 
Panama\'s policy of playing both sides of the fence to extract 
maximum advantage. 
 
 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
9.  (C) The first order of domestic business for the Torrijos 
government that concerns U.S. interests is Canal expansion. 
Now under active consideration, the Panama Canal Authority 
(ACP) is expected to announce its recommendations this summer 
for a project that could cost $8-10 billion in borrowed funds 
and take a decade to complete.  The Torrijos transition team 
sees Canal expansion as a motor for job creation and economic 
development for 10-15 years.  Canal expansion cannot be 
postponed if the viability of the all-water route between 
East Asia and the eastern U.S. seaboard is to continue, as 
the Canal may hit its maximum capacity by 2010.  Panama\'s 
constitution requires a referendum to approve a change of 
that magnitude in Canal finance, construction, and 
operations, which could involve new dams, new lakes, a higher 
water level, and displacement of hundreds of people. 
 
 
Commercial Loans 
---------------- 
10.  (C) Borrowing for the project is expected to be on 
commercial terms, assuming that the ACP and the GOP can 
convincingly separate their finances, as the Canal\'s own cash 
flow should cover most of the costs.  Local analysts say that 
the GOP must first overcome the imposing hurdle of fixing the 
growing insolvency of the Social Security fund (CSS), long 
overdue for painful and unpopular reform.  Doubtless the GOP 
eventually will request U.S. \"advice\" (and support) when 
approaching lending institutions. 
 
 
Commercial Opportunities 
------------------------ 
11.  (C) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is assisting the 
ACP in an advisory role at present (with the concept/design 
of a third set of locks on the Atlantic side) and probably 
can expect more future work when/if the project is approved. 
The Canal expansion project will offer large opportunities 
for U.S. contractors and exporters. 
 
 
Free Trade Agreement 
-------------------- 
12.  (SBU) The transition team has said that it plans to use 
the U.S.-Panama FTA to boost trade, investment, and market 
access, but also as a lever to increase transparency and rule 
of law, and to push an environmental agenda.  Team members 
confirmed that president Moscoso invited Torrijos to send 
representatives to the bargaining table at the next round. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
13.  (C) All four of Panama\'s presidential candidates had 
their blemishes, but the Panamanian people gave Torrijos the 
largest electoral margin of victory in modern history.  They 
clearly expect great things from him, an expectation that the 
transition team seems to take very seriously.  He also was 
the most modern and most U.S.-oriented of the candidates. 
PRD leaders acknowledge that their party has a lot of baggage 
in its past relations with the United States but they insist 
that the policies and government appointments will prove that 
the \"new PRD\" is indeed a valuable ally.  Assuming no ghosts 
from the past get in the way, and he takes concrete measures 
early on to convince the electorate that he will run a 
considerably more honest government than his predecessors, he 
is in a position to accomplish a great deal.  As First Vice 
President-elect Samuel Lewis Navarro has told us, \"We can\'t 
just run a good government...  The people are expecting a 
transformation.\"

VIVIAN FERNANDEZ DE TORRIJOS 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Panamanians widely hold Vivian Fernandez de 
Torrijos, wife of President-elect Martin Torrijos, in high 
regard.  She is well known for her active role in charitable 
and social work, as well as being a model mother and wife. 
Vivian Torrijos is an accomplished publicist and has worked 
for her father\'s advertising company (Publicis Fergo).  She 
is also the founder and President of Agencia para el 
Desarrollo (ACDE), a Panamanian NGO that promotes development 
in poor Panamanian communities, both metropolitan and rural. 
Because of her passionate commitment to Panama\'s social 
welfare, Ms. Torrijos has been successful in uniting women to 
work with her on educational, healthcare, environmental, and 
cultural programs. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Ms. Torrijos has made supporting her husband\'s 
political career a priority.  She actively supported his 
losing 1999 presidential campaign and his triumphant 2004 
campaign.  She claims not to have political ambitions of her 
own (although many Panamanians believe she has the \"common 
touch\" to succeed as a politician).  Ms. Torrijos has stated 
that as First Lady she will continue to support her husband 
in all aspects of his presidency, especially on social 
issues.  She has focused on ensuring school accessibility and 
the right to an education for all Panamanians, especially the 
poor and children with special needs.  Ms. Torrijos told La 
Prensa that she would support creating an entire section of 
the Panamanian Ministry of Education that would be dedicated 
solely to working with special education issues. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Born March 25, 1966, Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos 
is the youngest of five children of Antonio and Hilda 
Fernandez.  Antonio Fernandez, better known in Panama under 
the pseudonym \"Tony Fergo\" as a popular composer/singer and 
publicist, is a naturalized Panamanian citizen born in Cuba. 
Ms. Torrijos married Martin Torrijos Espino in 1990, and they 
have three children (Daniela Maria, Martin Omar and Nicolas 
Antonio).  Ms. Torrijos attended middle and high school at 
the Panamanian chapter of the all-girls Catholic school 
Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Colegio de Las 
Esclavas del Sagrado Corazon).  Ms. Torrijos earned a 
bachelors in Business Administration from Florida State 
University and Nova University, both in Panama City.  She 
speaks English well.

SEPTEMBER 1 
 
 
REF: PANAMA 1047 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Christopher J. McMullen for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
 
SUMMARY: Expect little until September 1 
---------------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Panamanians (current legislators included) are so 
focused on what will happen after September 1 that they 
appear to have forgotten entirely that the current Assembly 
session will continue until the end of May.  The Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), Panama\'s largest and best 
organized party, whose candidate Martin Torrijos won the 
presidency by a commanding margin, is poised to control 
Panama\'s 78-member unicameral legislature that will assume 
office on September 1.  PRD legislators won 41 seats, 
securing a massive advantage over the second-largest block, 
the Arnulfista Party\'s 17 legislators.  All seven legally 
recognized political parties won at least one seat and enough 
votes to survive as parties.  Alliances to defeat future PRD 
legislative initiatives would require opposition legislators 
to \"convert\" PRD renegades as well as join forces with each 
other, both unlikely events.  End Summary. 
 
 
Out-going legislators slump 
--------------------------- 
2.  (C) Despite bickering over constitutional reform, Embassy 
expects little substantive progress in the legislative branch 
before the new Assembly gets to work on September 1.  The 
outgoing losers, who constitute a high proportion of the 
current Assembly, just don\'t have the political will to push 
things through.  Media reports highlight legislators\' failure 
to attend sessions for the past several months.  Assembly 
President Jacobo Salas closed the Assembly weeks before 
Panama\'s May 2 elections to allow incumbents and staff, who 
had thrown their hats in the ring, to run their campaigns. 
Salas ordered extra hours in May and early June to make up 
for lost time, but the Assembly has not gathered a quorum (at 
least 50%) during several days that it was supposed to be in 
session. 
 
 
Winners and Losers 
------------------ 
3.  (SBU) The clearest winner in the May 2 elections was the 
PRD, which increased its number of seats in the Assembly from 
34 to 41, and the Solidarity Party, whose share of the 
Assembly increased from 4 to 9.  Despite their alliance with 
the PRD, the Popular Party (PP) lost big, maintaining only 
one of its five current legislative seats (that of Second 
Vice President-elect Ruben Arosemena).  Analysts have 
suggested that the PRD-PP alliance accentuated the existing 
cleavage within the PP (formerly the staunchly anti-PRD 
Christian Democratic Party), which began during the Endara 
Administration (1989-94) with a dispute between Endara and 
his First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon.  Indeed, 
three incumbent PP legislators jumped ship to the Arnulfistas 
for their re-election bid and two won.  Though not as 
severely as in the presidential race, the Arnulfistas lost 
ground in the legislature, with their share of the Assembly 
falling from 19 to 17 legislators.  The Arnulfistas owe 
several \"wins\" to incumbents who defected from other parties 
like Juan Carlos Varela (PP), Enrique Garrido (PP), Carlos 
Afu (PRD), and Sergio Galvez (Democratic Change Party). 
 
 
4. (SBU)  The most likely composition of the Legislative 
Assembly that will begin work on September 1 (subject to the 
resolution of formal challenges to results, which must be 
submitted by Friday May 13 at the latest) is: 
 
 
 PARTY                                      # Legislators 
 -----                                      ------------- 
 Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)            41 
 Arnulfista Party (PA)                           17 
 Solidarity Party (PS)                            9 
 Natl. Liberal Republican Movement (MOLIRENA)     4 
 National Liberal Party (PLN)                     3 
 Democratic Change Party (CD)                     3 
 Popular Party (PP)                               1 
 
 
Prospects before May 31 
----------------------- 
5.  (C) Embassy is following two issues of interest to the 
USG in the current legislature.  First, the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations still has to present the Palermo Convention 
to the Assembly for ratification, to which there does not 
appear to be any strong opposition.  Second, the Legislative 
Assembly will need to consider an amendment to the organic 
law of the Interoceanic Regional Authority (ARI) to permit 
non-commercial organizations to purchase reverted land in 
installments.  Successful passage of such an amendment will 
determine whether Florida State University (FSU) can afford 
to keep its Panama campus and might close a long-standing 
dispute between ARI and FSU. 
 
 
6.  (C) PRD sources have told EmbOffs that they are seeking 
Arnulfista collaboration to reform the Social Security Fund 
(CSS) before September 1, a highly unlikely scenario.  Though 
the Torrijos team says their plan would allow both sides to 
save face while resolving a critical national problem, the 
Arnulfistas don\'t appear to have the backing (or desire) to 
take the drastic steps it would require.  The CSS cannot 
continue to operate with its massive cash flow hemorrhages, 
which are eating into its reserves at an alarming rate. 
Indeed, only a consensus solution from all political corners 
has even a remote chance to be successful; however, President 
Moscoso already apparently told Martin Torrijos that her 
administration, \"just can\'t do it right now.\" 
 
 
What to look for after September 1 
---------------------------------- 
7.  (C) When the new PRD-dominated Legislative Assembly goes 
to work on September 1, 2004, it will probably begin in 
lock-step with the initiatives that President-elect Martin 
Torrijos\' launches from the executive branch.  On the other 
hand, the Assembly\'s committees may well be places where 
tensions flare between the PRD \"old guard\" and new PRD blood 
like first-time San Miguelito Legislator-Elect \"Mickey\" 
Aleman (a liquor company executive in his early 30s whose 
uncle is Arnulfista Legislator Francisco \"Pancho\" Aleman). 
Intra-PRD competition for the Assembly presidency that the 
media has publicized pits youth (Rogelio Paredes from the 
working class district of Arraijan just across the Panama 
Canal) against experience (Elias Castillo, a longtime public 
office-holder who won re-election to his legislative seat 
representing middle to upper class San Francisco and Paitilla 
suburbs).  Hector Aleman, Martin Torrijos\' \"campaign 
coordinator,\" is another seasoned political veteran 
re-elected to the Legislative Assembly who will probably be 
recognized for his service to the PRD and could be a 
contender for Assembly president. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Parties other than the PRD will have their hands 
full trying to forge alliances inside the Assembly and out. 
The Arnulfistas have already announced sweeping reforms of 
their Board of Directors and changes to the party bylaws that 
would make primaries mandatory.  Guillermo Endara has heeded 
the Solidarity Party\'s call to join and strengthen the sudden 
beneficiary of a massive electoral subsidy US$3.7M, which he 
hopes will present constructive opposition to the PRD.  The 
two heirs of Panama\'s \"liberal\" tradition, the National 
Liberal Republican Movement (MOLIRENA) Party and the National 
Liberal Party (PLN), have announced that they are discussing 
a merger.  The PLN barely survived the May 2 elections, 
capturing only 1.5% of the presidential vote and 5.23% of the 
legislative vote nationwide.  A PLN/MOLIRENA merger, would 
create a 7-legislator block to reckon with inside the 
assembly and allow those previously expelled from MOLIRENA to 
return to the flock.  (NOTE: The term \"liberal\" in this case 
corresponds to the historical Conservative / Liberal 
dichotomy in Colombian politics.  End Note.) 
 
 
COMMENT: Old faces 
------------------ 
9.  (C) Several candidates\' clear ethical and/or legal 
peccadilloes evidently did not trouble the voters who 
re-elected them.  Analysis reveals that 32 of 59 (54%) of 
incumbent legislators won re-election.  Of the 27 who didn\'t 
make it, 14 are Arnulfistas, 9 are PRDistas, and one each 
were members of the four smaller parties.  A May 11 La Prensa 
report cites former Supreme Court Justice Edgardo Molina 
Mola\'s understandable disdain for the re-election of two 
controversial politicians -- Sergio Galvez and Carlos Afu. 
Arnulfista behemoth Galvez, who abandoned CD almost 
immediately after it helped him win his seat in 1999, freely 
admits that he never attends legislative sessions.  He also 
continues to deny widespread charges that he sells contraband 
rice by using his legislative immunity.  Former PRD turned 
Arnulfista Afu became (in)famous by waving $6,000 cash in the 
air on national TV that he said he received as a bribe from 
promoters of the controversial CEMIS project. 
 
 
10.  (C) The PRD was not without their winners of 
questionable repute, led by Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, wanted by 
U.S. authorities for his role in the 1992 murder of U.S. Army 
Sergeant Zak Hernandez.  Pedro Miguel\'s re-election campaign 
was rife with irregularities, including allegations of 
rampant vote-buying and the alleged participation of 
relatives of Erasmo Pinilla, one of Panama\'s three Electoral 
Magistrates, in his campaign.  The Electoral Tribunal (ET) 
aggressively pursued rumors of irregularities in that 
electoral circuit, pre-emptively removing several apparently 
biased officials after the Arnulfista party lodged a formal 
complaint.  Arnulfista Jose \"Pepe\" Gomez, who lost to 
Gonzalez by a very narrow margin, has not lodged a formal 
complaint with the ET. 
 
 
11.  (C) An angel compared with Gonzalez is Elias Ariel 
Castillo, a PRD legislator who won re-election and seeks to 
become Assembly President.  Castillo served 17 months hard 
time while being investigated for embezzling approximately 
US$1 million of government funds to fund 1989 political 
campaigns for Manuel Noriega supporters when he was municipal 
treasurer of Panama City.  He was never convicted of any 
crime because the judge dismissed charges against him based 
on investigators\' failure to follow established procedures.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) Martin Torrijos and his inner circle, due to take 
power on September 1, are pushing an energetic and ambitious 
transition agenda featuring clear-cut goals in foreign policy 
(priority to the U.S. and Colombia), security (cooperation 
with U.S. objectives, new attention to the Caribbean coast), 
the economy (free trade agreement, Canal reconstruction, 
social security reform, making Panama a regional focal point 
for investment, eco-tourism, and transshipment), and politics 
(constitutional reform).  (See Refs B and C for background.) 
They have publicly named only a few cabinet members (see Ref 
A) so far but have floated names for Minister of Government 
and Justice and for Ambassador to the U.S.  The Torrijos 
inner circle -- Vice President/Foreign Minister-designate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro, Minister of the Presidency-designate 
Ubaldino (\"Uba\") Real, and Minister of Commerce-designate 
Alejandro (\"Andy\") Ferrer -- all FOMs (\"Friends of Martin\"), 
have repeatedly told us that the new government will take a 
strong anti-corruption stand that will begin with cleaning up 
Panama\'s notoriously deficient Supreme Court (Ref D) and have 
asked for our \"help,\" without being more specific.  If the 
new Torrijos government prevents officials from using their 
offices for personal gain, and if it makes an attempt to run 
a clean government and establishes a respected, politically 
neutral Supreme Court that would mark a change of 
revolutionary proportions in Panama.  Despite the good 
intentions of the Torrijos inner circle, anticipated 
pressures from a well-entrenched oligarchy could frustrate 
these plans.  End Summary. 
 
 
\"Don\'t Step Out of Line\" 
------------------------ 
2.  (C) The Ambassador\'s late-May meeting with Martin 
Torrijos (Ref E) and numerous subsequent Emboff discussions 
with FOMs have confirmed the Embassy\'s view that the new 
government is pursuing an energetic, ambitious agenda that 
aims at making permanent changes and improvements in Panama. 
At that meeting Torrijos made clear that he would not 
tolerate deviations by cabinet members from his pro-U.S., 
anti-corruption policies, and he will not hesitate to fire 
those who step out of line.  Public expectations are high, 
perhaps impossibly so, that Torrijos will break decisively 
with the now-discredited, out-going Moscoso government\'s 
corruption and inefficiency.  Torrijos has done nothing so 
far to disappoint in his few cabinet appointments and in his 
intensive strategic planning during the transition period. 
Following is a subject-by-subject analysis of issues that the 
Torrijos team has emphasized in private conversations with 
Emboffs. 
 
 
Foreign Policy -- A Focus On the U.S. 
------------------------------------- 
3.  (C) As the Torrijos team has emphasized many times, 
relations with the United States will be the new government\'s 
top foreign policy priority, with emphasis on security and 
law enforcement matters.  Frederic \"Freddie\" Humbert Arias is 
the probable nominee for ambassador to the U.S.; the Torrijos 
team plans to ask the current government to send an agrement 
request ASAP.  (Strictly protect -- this is still 
close-hold.)  Humbert, a long-standing FOM and La Prensa 
newspaper president with interests in shipping and shrimp 
fishing, is young, energetic, and has excellent connections 
with US press and international organizations.  Torrijos 
believes that Humbert has the personal skills to network 
Congress and other power centers in Washington.  (Note: 
Following a request from Samuel Lewis during his May 2004 
visit to Washington, NSC is exploring whether a 
Torrijos-President Bush meeting may be possible before 
September 1.) 
 
 
Colombia is a Priority 
---------------------- 
4.  (C)  Torrijos has traveled as candidate and as 
president-elect to Spain (where he met former president 
Aznar), Mexico (where he recently met President Fox), Costa 
Rica, and Brazil.  (Note: Torrijos plans to travel to Paris, 
Madrid, Brussels, and Berlin in mid-July.  He will also 
travel to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in mid-August.) 
Torrijos traveled to Colombia to meet with Colombian 
President Uribe shortly before and shortly after Panama\'s May 
2 election.  Panama\'s most important issues with Colombia are 
security, illegal immigration and job displacement, and drug 
trafficking.  The Torrijos-Uribe personal chemistry was 
described as \"very good,\" (as was the Torrijos-Fox 
chemistry).  Uribe and Torrijos discussed possible fallout 
from Colombia\'s \"Plan Patriota,\" a Colombian military 
offensive currently focused on Colombia\'s south.  Uribe 
pledged to warn Torrijos when the offensive moves north, 
where it could affect security on the Panamanian side of the 
border.  Uribe reportedly was shocked when Torrijos told him 
that between 250,000 and 300,000 Colombians are living in 
Panama, most of them illegally.  (Colombian estimates were 
one-third of that number.)  The ELN peace negotiations 
figured prominently in their recent talks, and Torrijos has 
left open the possibility that Panama may serve as a neutral 
site for the GOC/ELN negotiations.  Uribe pitched the idea of 
building a highway and an electrical transmission line 
through Panama\'s eastern Darien province.  Torrijos promised 
to \"study\" the matter. 
 
 
5.  (C) (Comment: The two nations never have had a road link. 
 For environmental and security reasons, the Panamanians 
probably will want to keep it that way.  Currently, the Pan 
American Highway ends in Yaviza in Panama\'s Darien province, 
not far from a national park that skirts the border. 
Electrical power reportedly is cheaper in Colombia than 
Panama, which lacks adequate investment in power generation, 
two reasons why a cross-border transmission line may be 
attractive to the Torrijos government.  But power line 
construction probably will bring a road along with it, which 
the Panamanians want to avoid.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Security 
-------- 
6.  (C) This Embassy, in conjunction with the Center for 
Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and the Torrijos team, is 
organizing an August 11-13 bilateral \"National Security 
Planning Workshop\" to encourage the new GOP to focus on 
security issues in general (such as border, canal, police, 
and narcotics) and on cooperation with the USG in particular. 
 Reception by both sides to the workshop has been highly 
positive and planning is already well advanced.  (See 
Septel.)  Torrijos\'s Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is 
the Panamanian party traditionally most focused on security 
matters, but Torrijos planners admit that they have not 
progressed very far in terms of their overall security 
strategy.  Torrijos contacts for security planning are 
(legislator) Hector Aleman and (former PDF officer) Daniel 
Delgado.  In private, even these members of the PRD \"Old 
Guard\" have pledged close cooperation with the USG on 
national security and law enforcement issues.  To enhance GOP 
control over its Caribbean north coast and improve its 
intelligence, and attract more teachers and doctors to the 
area, FOMs have floated the idea of starting regular 
fixed-wing air service to selected World War Two-vintage air 
strips near the coast. 
 
 
The Economy 
----------- 
7.  (C) The Moscoso Administration is leaving a strongly 
growing economy.  Growth last year was 4.1% (vs. 0.6% in 
2001); the optimistic forecast for 2004 is 4.5%.  Nominal GDP 
in 2003 was $12.8 billion or around $3,900 per capita.  The 
incoming Torrijos government initially will face tight budget 
constraints, with short-fuse imperatives to make Panama\'s 
Social Security Fund solvent and launch a strategy on Canal 
expansion.  FOMs often have expressed concern about the state 
of public finances after September 1 and are worried that 
they could inherit up to $300-600 million in accounts payable 
from the Moscoso administration.  (The year-end budget 
deficit could top 3%, exceeding the 2% legal maximum.)  The 
Finance Ministry\'s (MEF) welcome decision to cut spending by 
$361 million ($125m in current expenditures, $113m in capital 
expenditures, and $123 million in public enterprise 
expenditure) was probably already vitiated by the Moscoso 
administration\'s pre-election spending (e.g., subsidizing 
electricity) and below-forecast tax revenues.  Torrijos\'s 
party (with its previous populist focus) vastly increased 
public employment in the 1970s and 1980s, now would like to 
reduce the government\'s role.  One senior Torrijos insider 
noted that the GOP currently employs 181,000 people, quite 
extraordinary for a country of 3.1 million. 
 
 
Debt Service Unaffected 
----------------------- 
8.  (C) Rating agencies agree that the deficit will not 
affect Panama\'s ability to service its large debt load, which 
Panamanian governments treat as a priority.  International 
observers will only be concerned if Torrijos does not act 
soon to reform the actuarially bankrupt social security 
system and appoint competent leadership at MEF, which he 
plans to do.  Currently, the leading candidate for minister 
is Ricaurte \"Catin\" Vasquez, now Deputy Canal administrator. 
(Note: Vasquez would bring considerable experience and 
expertise to the job, having served as Minister of Planning 
and Economic Policy 1984-1988, and as chief negotiator for 
Panama\'s debt refinancing program in 1995.)  Although it will 
be costly in political capital, the Torrijos inner circle 
plans to make social security reform a top priority early on, 
to get rid of a millstone that could destabilize Panama\'s 
finances by 2010-2014. 
 
 
Free Trade Agreement 
-------------------- 
9.  (C) Led by Minister of Commerce and Industries-designate 
Alejandro Ferrer, the new GOP will be pro-trade 
liberalization, strongly supportive of a bilateral FTA, and 
less beholden to agricultural interests than the Moscoso 
government.  But for now they are willing to let the current 
government carry the flag for now.  The new GOP will have the 
task of ratifying the FTA.  The new GOP plans to have a 
coherent overall economic policy, which will include making 
Panama an investment, eco-tourism, and transshipment magnet, 
where trade policy will be one important component. 
 
 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
10.  (C) The new GOP expects this $5-10 billion (estimates 
vary widely), 10-year project to be a transforming event for 
Panama that will provide jobs and set the tone economically 
for years to come.  It plans to make Canal expansion a top 
priority.  A national referendum on the issue is likely in 
2005; we are told Torrijos wants the referendum to take place 
as early as possible.  Actual groundbreaking, if the 
referendum passes, could be three years off. 
 
 
Political Reform 
---------------- 
11.  (C) In mid-June, Torrijos publicly announced ambitious 
ideas for constitutional reform (see septel), which crucially 
involve the cooperation of the out-going Moscoso government 
and legislative assembly.  (The constitution can be amended 
if two consecutive legislatures back the same provisions.) 
Somewhat surprisingly, following a meeting with Torrijos, 
Moscoso called a special legislative session starting July 5 
to consider the wide-ranging proposals: 
 
 
-Reduce the size of the legislative assembly; 
 
 
-Eliminate one (of two) vice presidents and limit each 
legislator to one alternate (from two); 
 
 
-Reduce legislative immunity; permit the Supreme Court to 
remove a legislator from office without asking the Assembly 
to lift immunity; 
 
 
-Permit independent legislative candidates to run for office; 
 
 
-Halve the transition period between governments to two 
months; 
 
 
-Make the Electoral Tribunal financially independent and not 
subject to Supreme Court oversight; 
 
 
-Fix the number of Supreme Court justices by law, rather than 
in the constitution;  Note: Critics have charged that 
Torrijos will be able to \"pack\" the Court if the number of 
justices is set by law because laws are much more easily 
changed than the constitution.) 
 
 
-Ban active politicians from serving on the Supreme Court; 
 
 
-Require greater qualifications for would-be justices and 
legislators; 
 
 
-Establish a clear constitutional requirement for referendums 
on Canal expansion; 
 
 
-Establish procedures for convoking constitutional 
conventions. 
 
 
Strategy Seminar 
---------------- 
12.  (C) Showing that he is serious about planning an 
efficient government (and despite his lack of haste to 
announce appointments), in mid-June Torrijos convened a 
week-long strategy seminar for PRD leaders.  The retreat 
produced good results, insiders said, with 13 working groups 
(mirroring 13 ministries) hammering out 100-day and one-year 
action plans, complete with specific goals and benchmarks. 
Torrijos plans to monitor each minister\'s progress in meeting 
his respective objectives. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
13.  (C) Even more intriguing than the incoming team\'s 
confident enthusiasm and apparent efficiency is its avowed 
and oft-repeated intention to bring lasting change to Panama, 
especially in eliminating government corruption.  FOMs insist 
that efforts to make the government more honest will founder 
without a credible, effective, politically neutral Supreme 
Court.  They are entertaining various expedients to cleanse 
the Court, from mass impeachment to packing it.  Expectations 
of the new government\'s ability to end corruption are 
sky-high (and unrealistic).  A serious attempt to run an 
honest government would have revolutionary implications in 
Panama, overturning the long-accepted consensus among the 
political class that using one\'s office for personal gain is 
acceptable behavior, if not the name of the game.  Officials 
in Panama almost never go to jail for corrupt acts.  In a 
small country, where practically everyone is related by 
blood, marriage, or friendship a presiding official or 
magistrate typically finds himself deciding cases that 
involve relatives or friends.  In Panama, \"official\" actions 
are construed personally.  Government decisions are seldom 
viewed as solely motivated by a desire to uphold the law, as 
based on objective facts, or devoid of caprice or 
arbitrariness.  To be willing to act in disregard of personal 
and political ties implies tremendous change, and will 
require great courage because it will bring tremendous 
dissension, even within Torrijos\'s own party.  Until the 
evidence is in, skepticism of the new government\'s ability to 
bring about such sweeping change is justified.  (Septel will 
address Torrijos\'s proposed constitutional reforms.)

1.  (C) DCM, accompanied by Polcouns, delivered reftel 
talking points to Panamanian Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias 
Cerjack on June 30, 2004.  With two months left for this 
government, Arias was (not surprisingly) noncommittal on 
whether the GOP would be willing to accept protected Cuban 
and Haitian migrants for resettlement.  Arias said he would 
have to discuss the matter with President Moscoso and Foreign 
Minister-designate Samuel Lewis Navarro before offering a 
definitive reply. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Comment: President Moscoso and FM Arias will likely 
leave this decision to President-elect Martin Torrijos when 
he takes office on September 1.  For our part, we have 
serious concerns about Panama\'s ability (both the GOP and the 
local NGO community) to provide the necessary follow-on 
support that is required for successful resettlement.  We 
continue to grapple with major obstacles in the case of Ramon 
Aguilar Hernandez, whose status remains unresolved, despite 
repeated Embassy demarches on his behalf.  Panama granted 
Aguilar asylum on July 8, 2003, but GOP stonewalling delayed 
his actual arrival in Panama until March 2004.  Since his 
arrival. the Embassy and the local chapter of CARITAS have 
been struggling to complete Aguilar\'s resettlement.  Aguilar 
still has no work permit despite repeated GOP promises and 
countless Embassy interventions with senior GOP 
decision-makers over the past three months.  (Note: DCM 
raised this problem again on June 30 with FM Arias, who again 
promised to try to resolve Aguilar\'s work permit request with 
the Minister of Labor.  End Note.) 
 
 
3. (SBU) In addition to the GOP\'s bureaucratic inefficiency 
and inexplicable obstructionism, Aguilar\'s travails also 
highlight the fact that Panama\'s NGO community has no real 
capacity to assist with resettlement cases.  CARITAS, the 
only NGO willing to sponsor Aguilar, has told Embassy in no 
uncertain terms that it will never take on another 
resettlement case.  Meanwhile, Aguilar is running out of 
money and CARITAS is bitter, exhausted, and frustrated. 
Based on this experience, Embassy has deep reservations about 
the efficacy of trying to resettle any migrants in Panama, 
even if the GOP were to give the green light - a decision 
that will likely not be made for months.

SUBJECT: PANAMA: PRESIDENT-ELECT TORRIJOS PUSHES 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM - HIS WAY 
 
 
Summary: Extraordinary sessions and hot debate 
--------------------------------------------- - 
1.  (SBU) In a surprise move, President Moscoso ordered 
\"extraordinary sessions\" of the Legislative Assembly to 
discuss constitutional reform.  The move drew cheers from 
some civil society groups and criticism from those like 
former president and second-place 2004 candidate Guillermo 
Endara who favor convoking a constituent assembly 
(constituyente).  By signing Executive Decree No. 68 on June 
30, 2004 to officially call for extraordinary legislative 
sessions from July 5-20, President Moscosos surrendered 
major ground to Torrijos and the PRD. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) President-Elect Martin Torrijos held a June 18 
press conference to announce that his party, the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), would propose a package of 
constitutional reforms to the Legislative Assembly.  Since 
the Moscoso administration and its allies currently control 
the Legislative Assembly, Torrijos had to convince Moscoso 
during a June 21 meeting to convoke the extraordinary 
sessions.  Moscoso had announced earlier that there was no 
time to discuss such reforms and pro-Administration 
legislators had also told Poloffs there seemed to be no 
interest in the GOP or the opposition PRD to discuss them. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Critics, first among them civil society 
representatives, have taken issue with several of the 
reforms that the PRD has proposed.  The PRD\'s chief 
political opponent, the Arnulfista Party, has followed suit. 
President Moscoso, also Arnulfista Party President, has only 
\"accepted\" Torrijos\' proposal inasmuch as she agreed to 
order the legislature to review it.  Most recently, 
President Moscoso delivered a short televised message asking 
Panamanians to remain alert to ongoing legislative debate. 
While some of the PRD\'s proposed reforms have merit, others 
appear to be driven by political expediency.  In any event, 
we share public (and PRD) skepticism that President Moscoso 
is truly committed to pushing through these reforms before 
she leaves office on August 31.  End Summary. 
 
 
The package 
----------- 
4.  (SBU) The 90-page document that PRD Legislator Jerry 
Wilson submitted proposes extensive amendments to Panama\'s 
constitution.  After offering initially positive feedback on 
Torrijos\' announcement, local lawyers, including a former 
Supreme Court Justice, and pro-administration legislators 
quickly labeled some reforms \"dangerous\" for the democratic 
system.  Though the PRD (Torrijos included) assured that the 
reforms were open to debate, several proposed reforms have 
raised eyebrows and called the PRD\'s \"good faith\" into 
question with Panamanian observers. 
 
 
The process 
----------- 
5.  (U) Pursuant to Article 308 of Panama\'s Constitution, 
the PRD-proposed constitutional reform package will be 
discussed during three rounds of debate by the entire 
legislature (rather than in small committees like other 
bills).  Before official presentation to the entire 
legislature, the legislature\'s Government Committee heard 
concerns from political party and civil society 
representatives as well as former government officials who 
oppose certain elements of the proposed reform package. 
Amending the bill is authorized during first and second 
debates, but the third round of debate will be limited to a 
yea or nay vote.  If approved, the bill will be published in 
the Official Gazette. 
 
 
6.  (U) If passed by this legislature, after the new 
administration and incoming legislators take office on 
September 1, then-President Torrijos would need to send the 
bill back to the Legislative Assembly within the first five 
working days.  The new legislature would have the 
opportunity for another yea or nay vote after a single round 
of debate.  If approved by both (outgoing and incoming) 
legislatures, the bill must be published in the Official 
Gazette within the next ten working days after executive 
ratification so that it may enter into effect. 
 
 
The fundamentals 
---------------- 
7.  (U) The proposed reform package included: 
   -Reducing the number of Vice Presidents from two to one; 
   -Reducing the number of legislators from 78 to 67 
(current Constitution stipulates one seat for every 30,000 
inhabitants); 
   -Restricting parliamentary immunity (no immunity for 
legislators in civil or labor matters); 
   -Reducing the number of legislators\' alternates 
(suplentes) from two to one; 
   -Allowing independent candidates to run for legislative 
seats (electoral law currently mandates that legislative 
candidates must be nominated by political parties); 
   -Increasing professional pre-requisites for legislative 
candidacies; 
   -Establishing a mandatory referendum for Canal expansion; 
   -Reducing the transition period between election and 
inauguration from four to two months; 
   -Eliminating centralized, pre-disbursement control of 
government expenditures (control previo); 
   -Allowing number of Supreme Court Justices to be defined 
by legislation instead of the constitution; 
   -Establishing a mechanism for convoking a constituent 
assembly to enact future constitutional reforms; 
   -Making the Electoral Tribunal\'s budget independent; 
   -Enforcing the de-centralization of municipalities; 
 
 
The Controversy 
--------------- 
8.  (SBU) Some elements of the PRD proposal have generated 
heated public debate.  Detractors accuse the PRD of ignoring 
civil society concerns that have arisen in various fora like 
the UNDP-convened dialogue \"Foro Panama 2020.\"  Critics say 
Torrijos has proposed amendments that will impair government 
functions and threaten the democratic system.  Details of 
three controversial proposals (none of which have been 
debated yet) follow. 
 
 
9.  (U) ELIMINATING \"CONTROL PREVIO\":  Article 276 of 
Panama\'s Constitution grants the Comptroller General (CG) 
the discretion to decide when to implement pre and post- 
disbursement controls on government expenditures.  This 
authority has allowed CGs in the past to exercise what some 
consider excessive power over certain government operations. 
The PRD reform calls for a new law to classify which 
expenditures require pre-disbursement control.  Three former 
CGs from Arnulfista and PRD administrations joined forces 
with current CG Alvin Weeden to uniformly reject this 
proposal.  Professor Ruben Dario Carles, CPA Jose Chen 
Barria, Dr. Gabriel Castro, and CG Weeden visited the 
legislature\'s Government Committee to express their 
opposition. 
 
 
10.  (SBU) APPOINTING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES:  Article 200 
of Panama\'s constitution divides the Supreme Court (CSJ) 
into Civil, Criminal, and Administrative Courts, each with 
three Justices.  The PRD proposal would transfer the power 
to restructure the courts to lawmakers.  Opponents claim 
that by structuring the Supreme Court based on laws rather 
than the constitution increases the danger that it would 
become over politicized.  Even some PRD lawyers have 
expressed their opposition.  One said, \"if the U.S. has nine 
justices with a 250+ million population, there is no 
justification for a country with mere 2.9 million to have 
more than the current nine justices.\" (NOTE: President 
Moscoso has appointed five Justices to ten-year terms and 
opponents have heavily criticized four of them for being 
closely affiliated with her.  Rumors already abound that 
Torrijos plans to appoint three new justices (one in each 
court) to gain control of the court. END NOTE.) 
 
 
11.  (SBU) CALLING A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY:  For years, civil 
society has called for direct citizen participation in the 
constitutional reform process.  Many would even prefer that 
Panama\'s constitution be discarded and a new one drafted 
from scratch.  Government and political party elites tend to 
oppose constituent assemblies, fearing limits to their 
control over the reform process.  Supporters of a 
constituent assembly failed to achieve the issuance of an 
additional ballot during the May 2 election that would have 
consulted voters about constitutional reform. 
 
 
12. (SBU) Torrijos and the PRD are against a constituyente, 
which would hamstring the incoming administration; however, 
to appease critics they decided to include a mechanism for 
calling one in their reform package.  The PRD proposal would 
require 25% of the voting population (about 475,000 people) 
to sign a petition calling for a constituent assembly. 
Civil society groups want to reduce that figure to 5-10%. 
If the mechanism remains part of the reform package, the end 
figure will probably be a compromise around 15-20%. 
 
 
Comment:  A familiar tune 
------------------------- 
13.  (SBU) The legislature didn\'t reform the constitution 
during regular sessions, which ended June 30, and prospects 
appear just as tough now.  Neither President Moscoso nor the 
27 legislators who lost their re-election bids have a strong 
political incentive to promote the PRD-sponsored bill. 
Arnulfistas might even get more mileage by opposing PRD 
proposals under the pretext of \"ensuring adequate civil 
society participation in the process.\"  On the other hand, 
President-elect Torrijos has current PRD legislators working 
triple-time to build buy-in for reforms in this legislature 
and the next. 
 
 
14.  (SBU) Given the outright PRD control of the next 
legislature, the greatest obstacle to passage will be 
getting the bill through this one.  A senior PRD official 
expressed concern to DCM that Moscoso has no intentions of 
supporting these reforms but instead is using this public 
debate to deflect criticism of her government\'s questionable 
record on good governance.  Embassy believes that some of 
the PRD\'s proposed reforms have merit, while others appear 
driven by political expediency.  In any event, we share 
public skepticism that the badly battered Arnulfista Party 
is really committed to pushing through this package of 
reforms, even though President Moscoso could claim some 
credit in finally carrying out her campaign pledge to reform 
the constitution.  End Comment.

(SBU) Drawing on reftel, DCM discussed USG planning for the 
Fourth Summit of the Americas with Foreign Minister-designate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro, whose initial response was to note that 
the U.S. themes looked very much like his own party\'s 
campaign platform.  Indeed, he reiterated what 
President-elect Torrijos has told us in recent meetings -- 
that the incoming PRD government will give priority to 
economic growth by encouraging greater domestic and foreign 
investment.  Lewis said that their goal was \"to transform 
employees into entrepreneurs,\" which requires reducing the 
time that it takes Panamanians (and foreigners) to open up a 
business.  He also stressed that another PRD priority was to 
improve education, which was closely tied to other themes 
like economic growth and democratic governance.  In sum, 
Lewis said the PRD government that takes power on September 1 
will work closely with the United States on these themes, 
lending whatever support is necessary during the run-up to 
the November 2005 Summit in Argentina.

Summary: Torrijos assigns a friend to Washington 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
1. (C) President-elect Martin Torrijos has selected Federico 
\"Freddy\" Antonio Humbert Arias to be Panama\'s Ambasador to 
the United States as of September 1, 2004, but has not yet 
announced the appointment.  Foreign Minister-designate Samuel 
Lewis Navarro told DCM that he already approached Foreign 
Minister Harmodio Arias about requesting agrement from 
Washington.  Humbert was President of the Board of Directors 
of La Prensa, one of Panama\'s best-selling dailies, from 
March 2001 until July 2004.  The US-educated Humbert is also 
President of the Panamanian Trucking Company and runs a 
profitable shrimp fishing business based in the port of 
Vacamonte (about a 30 minutes by car southwest of Panama 
City).  As Ambassador, Humbert would take a pro-US stance, 
following President-elect Torrijos lead in pursuing points of 
convergence in our relations, particularly in security and 
economic matters.  End Summary. 
 
 
\"Generational Change\" in U.S.-Panama Relations 
--------------------------------------------- - 
2. (C) During a July 12 meeting with Ambassador Watt, 
Ambassador-designate Humbert said the U.S. could expect a 
\"generational change\" in the new government\'s approach to 
bilateral issues.  He said that President-elect Torrijos and 
Foreign Minister-designate Samuel Lewis Navarro were both 
committed to looking forward in the relationship and would be 
seeking ways to advance what they believe are key converging 
interests between Panama and the United States.  Humbert said 
he had instructions from Lewis to pursue a coherent and 
constructive policy with the US, which means closer 
coordination on issues between Panama\'s three key envoys -- 
Humbert, their OAS Ambassador (still to be named), and their 
UN Permrep (unofficially known to be former Ambassador to the 
U.S. Ricardo Alberto Arias).  In this regard, Ambassador Watt 
stressed the importance of Panama pursuing a more 
constructive policy in the UN by avoiding knee-jerk votes 
with G-77 countries, particularly on complex and delicate 
Middle East issues.  Humbert took the point and also pledged 
that the new government would work even more closely than the 
current administration on matters of mutual interest such as 
security, law enforcement, trade and investment. 
 
 
Humbert\'s Personal background 
----------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Federico Antonio Humbert Arias is one of five 
siblings. He is married to Daphne Rusodimos de Humbert and 
the couple has four children.  Humbert attended the Catholic 
Colegio La Salle during high school and obtained a Bachelors 
in Business Administration from Notre Dame University. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Humbert\'s father, Federico Humbert Azcarraga, Jr., 
also a Notre Dame graduate, was the first individual 
businessman to sign the USDOC-sponsored Panamanian Business 
Ethics Compact (Pacto Etico Empresarial) because most 
Panamanians consider him above reproach.  The elder Humbert, 
one of Panama\'s foremost philanthropists and a generous donor 
to local charities, was a leader of the National Civic 
Crusade efforts to persuade dictator Manuel Noriega to leave 
Panama during the difficult period 1986-89.  President of 
Banco General, the elder Humbert is also a longtime supporter 
(both financially and managerially) of the former Christian 
Democratic Party (now the Popular Party (PP), that allied 
with Martin Torrijos\' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
for the May 2004 elections).  Ambassador-designate Humbert\'s 
cousin is former Panama City Mayor (1989-90) and PP activist 
Guillermo \"Willy\" Cochez, who is rumored to be a possible 
candidate as OAS Ambassador. 
 
 
Humbert at work 
--------------- 
5.  (C) Though not a politician himself, Ambassador-designate 
Humbert (unlike his father) has a reputation as a hard-nosed 
businessman who is not above using political connections with 
whoever happens to be in government to gain an advantage over 
his competitors.  For instance, long-standing 
Greek-Panamanian businesses owned by the Limberopolous and 
Papadimitriu families have accused Humbert of using his 
influence with Maritime Authority Director Bertilda Garcia. 
Garcia\'s father Augusto \"Onassis\" Garcia (currently a close 
advisor to President Moscoso) has recently tried to elbow his 
way into the shrimp fishing industry.  Ironically, Noriega 
cronies used similar tactics against the elder Humbert in the 
late 1980s, threatening to foreclose on fishermen\'s 
outstanding National Bank of Panama loans if the fisherman 
continued to do business with Humbert.   In the run-up to 
Panama\'s May 2 elections, Humbert and La Prensa board member 
Ricardo Alberto Arias played a key role in blocking 
publication of information regarding a potentially damaging 
article that Torrijos\' opponents tried to air during the 
campaign.  (See Reftel A). 
 
 
Humbert and Torrijos 
-------------------- 
6.  (C) Humbert\'s political ties with Torrijos have been 
based more on friendship than any party affiliation.  (NOTE: 
Humbert told the Ambassador that he was initially skeptical 
of Torrijos, having opposed the PRD-military alliance in the 
70s and 80s; however, Humbert said Torrijos\' commitment to 
changing business-as-usual in Panama had persuaded him to 
support Torrijos\' bid for the presidency. END NOTE.)  For 
instance, Humbert supported Torrijos\' 1999 campaign for 
President as leader of a group called the \"Independents For 
Martin Torrijos.\"  Sources close to President-elect Torrijos 
have told Emboffs that he selected Humbert to be his 
Ambassador to the United States because he is young and 
energetic, plus has strong connections with the U.S. media 
and international organizations -- all of which the Torrijos 
team feels will make Humbert good at networking Washington\'s 
various power centers (the Hill, key lobbies, etc.). 
Overall, Humbert appears committed to acting as a strong 
advocate for Panama\'s interests in a manner consistent with 
Torrijos\' desire to forge an even closer relationship with 
the United States centered on mutual security and economic 
interests.

SUBJECT: PANAMA\'S PENDING SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS: A 
CHALLENGE FOR THE INCOMING TORRIJOS ADMINISTRATION 
 
1. Summary.  Reforming Panama\'s actuarially bankrupt social 
security fund (CSS), which provides pensions, medical 
services, and workers\' compensation to over 60 percent of 
Panama\'s population, will be one of the biggest and earliest 
challenges to face the incoming Torrijos administration. 
Plagued by increasing claims and decreasing contributions, 
the system has had to rely heavily upon its reserves, leaving 
three of its four programs with large deficits.  Without 
reforms to the system, CSS\'s second largest program, 
Maternity and Health Services, will exhaust its reserves in 
three years and CSS\'s largest program, Disability, Old Age, 
and Death (IVM), will be bankrupt in an estimated 8-10 years. 
 Most of the major problems stem from current entitlements. 
For example, men can retire at 62 years and women at 57 years 
after only 15 years of contributions.  Consequently, a 
Panamanian man who retires will conservatively cost the 
program over two times what he contributed and a woman 
approximately four times what she contributed.  The incoming 
Torrijos\' administration, set to enter office on Sept. 1, has 
pledged to fix the CSS but its success will require 
considerable political will and capital.  Indeed, this is a 
hot-button issue that strikes a populist chord in virtually 
every sector of Panamanian society.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------- 
An Overview of the System 
------------------------- 
 
 
2. The Caja de Seguro Social (CSS), Panama\'s social security 
system, is composed of four programs: (1) the Disability, Old 
Age, and Death (IVM) program provides pensions to Panamanians 
who contribute a percentage of their salary for at least 15 
years as well as to disabled Panamanians; (2) Maternity and 
Health services program provides general medical care to 
Panamanians that register for the system; (3) Professional 
Risks program provides medical care and pensions for workers 
injured while on the job; and (4) Administrative program 
manages the entire system.  These programs encompass 
approximately two million people, or two-thirds of Panama\'s 
estimated 3.1 million (2003) population.  In 2003, 69.8 
percent of Panama\'s total population were members of the 
CSS\'s healthcare system.  Of these, 779,000 were active or 
retired contributors to the CSS and 1.2 million were 
dependents (i.e., spouses and children of contributors to 
CSS).  Also in 2003, 60.7 percent of Panama\'s economically 
active population of 1.25 million were members of the IVM 
program.  Panama\'s largest public entity, the CSS comprises 
20 percent of Panama\'s total budget and has an annual budget 
of approximately USD 1.3 billion.  It employs 24,000 people; 
slightly less than half (approximately 10,000) of its workers 
are doctors, nurses, and technical assistants needed to staff 
CSS hospitals and clinics. 
 
 
3. The CSS ended 2003 with a deficit of USD 67,196,177, an 
increase of over 300 percent from its 2002 deficit.  (Note: 
In 2002, the CSS had a deficit of USD 18,554,363.  End note.) 
 The only program not currently in the red is the 
administrative program; it finished 2003 with a surplus of 
USD 5,748,309, a slight decrease from its 2002 surplus of 
approximately USD 8.5 million.  IVM\'s deficit increased by 
USD 34,271,779 in 2003 to end at USD 43,693,090.  The 
Maternity and Health Services\' program ended at USD 
25,791,134, up slightly from its 2002 deficit of 23,516,657. 
The Professional Risks\' program had entered into its first 
deficit in 2003, to end the year with a loss of USD 
3,460,262.  At the end of December 2003, the CSS conducted an 
actuarial valuation of the institutional reserves for the IVM 
and Professional Risks programs.  The IVM had an actuarial 
deficit of USD 2.78 billion whereas the Professional Risks 
program had an actuarial surplus of USD 94.54 million. 
 
 
--------------- 
What Went Wrong 
--------------- 
 
 
4. The first indications of an impending financial crisis in 
the CSS were in 1980; this was a direct result of the 1975 
political decision to lower the retirement age to 55 for men 
and 50 for women.  Created in 1941, the CSS\'s original 
retirement age for both men and women was 60 years of age; 
the average life expectancy was 64 years in Panama at that 
time.  By 1975, life expectancy had risen to 69 years.  Faced 
with economic challenges because of increased demands to its 
system in 1980, GOP officials implemented a plan that used 
the money intended for Panamanian workers as the second 
payment of the required 13-month bonus and used this money to 
fund projects designed to add revenue to the IVM. 
Consequently, Panamanian workers were paid only two-thirds of 
their mandated 13-month bonus.  This measure was repealed in 
1983.  In 1990, the CSS Board of Directors announced an 
actuarial deficit of USD 800 million, with the system 
possibly collapsing in 1996.  Partial measures, including 
increasing the retirement age (62 years for men; 57 years for 
women) and eliminating anticipated retirements (those by 
nurses or teachers who may retire after 20 years of service, 
regardless of age), were passed in 1991 and have helped to 
extend the life of the system but only by a few years.  The 
GOP does contribute to the CSS but only through an annual set 
transfer of USD 50 million (or 0.4 percent of GDP); the 
government does not finance the CSS\'s below-the-line deficit. 
 The CSS finances its deficit through a reduction in its 
reserves. 
 
 
5. The IVM problems present the biggest concern for most 
Panamanians as it is their only source of retirement income. 
In 2002, program outflows increased by USD 30.5 million while 
contributions increased by only USD 5.1 million.  This breach 
continues to widen significantly.  These increasing demands 
are a result of three factors: (1) a higher life expectancy; 
(2) insufficient contributions to CSS; and (3) limited 
interest earned on the program\'s reserves.  Increased medical 
technology and access to medical facilities have caused the 
average life expectancy to rise to the current 72 years of 
age for men and 77 years of age for women in Panama. 
Panamanian law stipulates the retirement age for men to be 62 
years of age and women to be 57 years of age.  The system has 
not addressed this increase in demand; by law, Panamanians 
are required only to contribute to the CSS for 15 years in 
order to receive a pension.  Pensions are not 
inflation-adjusted.  Consequently, retirees are absorbing 
more money than they have contributed to the CSS.  For 
example, if a man who makes a USD 500 monthly salary 
contributes to the CSS for 15 years, he will have given the 
system a total of USD 13,763.  He is entitled to received 60 
percent of his salary, or USD 300 a month from CSS.  Using a 
conservative calculation of 7.5 percent interest and 72 years 
of age life expectancy, he  will receive approximately USD 
49,763 in benefits, costing the CSS USD 36,000.  A woman with 
the same salary and payment rate will cost the CSS USD 
58,237.  Finally, Panamanian law requires IVM reserves to be 
placed in the Banco Nacional rather than faster growing (and 
arguably more speculative) funds.  These sizable reserves 
earn less than 2 percent in annual interest.  While the IVM 
program maintains the largest deficit, CSS Director of 
Finances, Benigno Amaya, maintains its reserves and 
contributions can keep it operational for the next 8-10 
years. 
 
 
6. The CSS\'s healthcare programs are in severe financial and 
organizational crisis.  Both the Maternity and Health 
Services and Professional Risks\' programs are plagued by 
inefficient appointment systems, deficient and low quality 
patient service, and lack of medical supplies.  The Maternity 
and Health Services program\'s reserves of USD 75 million may 
only be sufficient for the next three years.  Experts also 
argue that CSS and Ministry of Health (MOH) healthcare 
efforts are duplicative because both maintain separate 
healthcare facilities and offer general heathcare services to 
the public. 
 
 
7. Lengthy, bureaucratic claims processes and lower pensions 
associated with the Professional Risks\' program have caused 
additional strain on the Maternity and Health Services 
program because many workers with minor on-the-job injuries 
choose to receive care under this program.  In general, these 
patients receive faster service through this fund and higher 
pensions through the IVM program.  The Professional Risks\' 
program only pays a pension equal to 60 percent of the 
affected\'s salary; typically, people can earn a higher 
pension (usually 70 percent) if they contribute more than 15 
years to IVM program.  As a result, the Professional Risks\' 
program assumes only 10 percent of all healthcare costs 
incurred by the CSS.  It encountered its first deficit in 
2003 due to increases in material and supply costs as well as 
personnel expenses.  On average, the Professional Risks\' 
program registers 17,000 cases annually with the majority 
being serious accidents or illnesses, all easily attributed 
to on-the-job injuries. 
 
 
8. Finally, while not technically \"in the red,\" the 
Administrative program is confronting a number of challenges: 
obsolete processes and systems, inefficient collection 
methods, and a seemingly endless payroll.  With a workforce 
of 24,000 and growing, experts contend the CSS could downsize 
its administrative staff without losing productivity; 
however, its medical workforce of 10,000 must be maintained 
or even augmented to continue to provide adequate care. 
 
 
---------------- 
Possible Options 
---------------- 
 
 
9. Repairing the CSS will require substantial changes and 
compromise amongst the three funding entities: the GOP, the 
employers, and the workers.  Technically, in order to reform 
the system, a proposal must go before the Board of Directors 
at the CSS for its approval.  Once obtained, the proposal is 
presented to the Executive branch (the President and his 
cabinet) for its approval.  The proposal is then presented to 
the Legislative Assembly.  This body will change or modify 
the CSS law.  The modified law is then sent back to the 
President for final approval.  Once approved, the law enters 
into force.  However, before this process can begin, a 
consensus on how to reform the system must be achieved.  In 
2001, President Moscoso created \"el Dialogo de la Mesa\" or a 
roundtable working group to assess the CSS\'s problems and 
offer solutions. 
 
 
10. The Dialogue was composed of members of the CSS, GOP, 
political parties, and civil society (including both 
employers and labor representatives).  Four working groups 
were created to correspond to the system\'s four programs. 
Consensus had to be reached before recommendations were put 
forth to the GOP.  Both the Administrative and Maternity and 
Health Services programs were able to reach consensus in some 
areas; the Professional Risks and IVM groups made advances 
but were unable to achieve consensus on any issue.  In 
December 2003, the Dialogue presented its findings to the 
Legislative Assembly.  The Assembly has not yet taken any 
steps to implement the group\'s findings. 
 
 
11.  The Administrative dialogue agreed on the need to 
modernize current practices and procedures, automate the 
CSS\'s information system, improve collection methods, and 
increase investment returns.  These changes would increase 
transparency and efficiency within the CSS.  The Maternity 
and Health Care Services working group recommended a new 
national system of health, in coordination with MOH, be 
adopted.  It also recommended a new model of patient care 
should be adopted, including direct doctor-patient 
interaction.  Finally, this group stated that modernizing and 
automating the medical records system would be integral to 
ensuring this program\'s future success. 
 
 
12. The Professional Risks\' working group made advances on 
the role of prevention, revisions of benefits, better patient 
attention, and improved administration.  However, the group 
was unable to reach a consensus on the definition of salary 
and what benefits, if any, should be included in that 
definition.  While no consensus was reached, the IVM working 
group made advances on the existence of a problem, some 
definitions, the use of actuarial tools, and the need to 
update the program\'s database.  The major source of 
contention among the group\'s members remained the key issue 
of how to finance the deficit. 
 
 
13. Various proposals to finance the IVM were addressed. 
Variables at large in these proposals included: the age of 
retirement, the minimum years required to contribute, the 
percentage of contribution, the number of years used as a 
base to calculate pension, the maximum amount of pensions, 
amongst others.  Some options include: increasing the 
contribution rate, increasing the retirement age, and 
investing reserves more aggressively.  However, most 
proposals lean heavily toward either the employer or the 
employee.  Neither group has been able to agree on a plan 
with shared transition costs.

SUBJECT: PANAMA: SCENE SETTER FOR GEN. HILL\'S AUG. 12 VISIT 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
1.  (SBU) I warmly welcome your August 12 visit to Panama. 
You will have the opportunity to reiterate USG commitment to 
expanding training programs shared between our two countries, 
and to press for continuing focus on civilian controlled 
security forces, transparency and anti-corruption within 
Panama\'s institutions.  Panama\'s negotiation of a bilateral 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US and the September 1 
inauguration of a new administration will reign paramount in 
the minds of many of your interlocutors.  It is worth noting 
that Panama was an early member of the Coalition of the 
Willing, has signed and ratified a bilateral Article 98 
Agreement, is a strong anti-narcotics ally, and a supporter 
of US maritime security/trade-security initiatives.  The 
Canal is well-run and efficient.  Although the Moscoso 
government\'s reputation has been tarnished by corruption and 
ineffectual administration, Panama has been a good friend and 
ally. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
National Security Workshop 
-------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (SBU) This Embassy, in conjunction with the Center for 
Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and representatives of the 
incoming Torrijos administration, is organizing an August 
11-13 bilateral \"National Security Planning Workshop\" to 
encourage the new administration to plan strategically its 
approach to security issues related to its borders, the 
Canal, public security (i.e. crime), and counter-narcotics, 
and focus on ways to cooperate with the USG.  Torrijos\' 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is the Panamanian party 
traditionally most focused on security matters, but Torrijos 
planners admit that they have not progressed very far in 
terms of their overall security strategy.  This workshop 
presents a unique opportunity for the USG to support Panama\'s 
strategic security planning while it is being formulated and 
position ourselves to participate in its implementation. 
Your contribution to this important endeavor is greatly 
appreciated. 
 
 
------------------ 
New Administration 
------------------ 
 
 
3.  (SBU) President-elect Martin Torrijos, due to take office 
on September 1, is pushing an energetic and ambitious 
transition agenda featuring clear-cut goals in foreign policy 
(with a priority on the US and Colombia), security 
(cooperation with US objectives, new attention to the 
Caribbean coast), the economy (employment generation, a Free 
Trade Agreement with the US, Canal expansion, social security 
reform, and making Panama a regional focal point for 
investment, eco-tourism, and logistics), and politics 
(constitutional reform).  Torrijos campaigned on a strong 
anti-corruption platform and hopes to clean up Panama\'s 
politicized Supreme Court.  Thus far, Torrijos\' cabinet 
appointments have been respected professionals without 
excessive baggage from the PRD\'s close ties to Panama\'s 
21-year dictatorship and its anti-US faction, a promising 
sign.  Despite the good intentions of the Torrijos 
administration, anticipated pressures from a well-entrenched 
oligarchy could frustrate its reform plans. 
 
 
--------------- 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The Torrijos team plans to make Canal expansion a 
top priority.  It expects this $4-10 billion (estimates vary 
widely and the Canal Authority has been deliberately silent), 
10-year project to be a transforming event for Panama that 
will provide jobs and set the tone economically for years to 
come.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has provided 
feasibility and engineering studies for one set of locks for 
the proposed expansion and looks forward to further 
involvement with the ACP (Authority of the Canal of Panama) 
as the project moves forward.  A national referendum on the 
issue is likely in 2005.  Actual groundbreaking, if the 
referendum passes, could be three years off. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
International Ship and Port Facility Security Code 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
5.  (SBU) On July 1, Panama announced that it had met the 
deadline for implementing its International Ship and Port 
Facility Security Code (ISPS) obligations.  According to 
Captain Luiz Perez Salamero, the departing Deputy 
Administrator of Panama\'s Maritime Authority (AMP), all ships 
that call on US ports have completed the International Ship 
Security Certification (ISSC) process; however some will have 
onboard either a short-term certificate (valid for five 
months) or an interim certificate during the first months 
after July 1.  Final ISSCs will be issued to those ships as 
quickly as possible and prior to expiration of the 
Interim/Short-term certificates.  The AMP has developed an 
on-line database (www.amp.gob.pa) listing all Panamanian 
flagged vessels with issued ISSCs, which is intended to 
assist countries with the certificate validation process. 
Controversy dogged this process, as some maritime lawyers and 
shipping companies protested the designation of a sole firm 
as Panama\'s ISPS certifier. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Toward a Democratic Culture 
--------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) The recent visa revocation of a US visa to the 
former Minister of Public Works as a result of President 
Bush\'s initiative to deny US visas to corrupt public 
officials, has captivated the press.  This is only the latest 
in a series of high-profile media coverage of 
transparency-in-governance issues.  Last month, my speech 
concerning poverty and the need for government action 
generated a series of positive responses as well as a pro 
forma rebuttal from the Foreign Minister.  Last year, my 
September 29 speech to Panama\'s Chamber of Commerce, Industry 
and Agriculture, launching this Embassy\'s Good Governance 
Initiative (GGI), resonated with Panamanians and generated 
front-page headlines.  Venality, conflict of interest, 
nepotism, and lack of transparency are ingrained in Panama\'s 
political culture and institutions.  To encourage public 
demand for reform in the judicial sector, AID Panama has 
extended grants totaling US$150,000 to civil society 
organizations for projects designed to address structural 
barriers to the administration of justice and other Embassy 
sections promote good governance as a focused mission-wide 
priority. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
A Mixed Macroeconomic Record 
---------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under USG administration.  Canal-related 
industries, especially cargo transshipment through ports at 
both ends of the Canal, have boomed, as have visits by US 
cruise ships, which surpassed 200 port calls in Panama this 
year.  Panama\'s overall economy went flat when nearly 30,000 
US military personnel and their dependents left during the 
late 1990s, privatization slowed, and the 2001 global 
recession took hold which perpetuated the country\'s estimated 
13.4% unemployment rate.  Also, Panama has failed to attract 
large investment into the former Canal Zone.  Poverty, income 
disparity (second only to Brazil in the Hemisphere), an 
actuarially bankrupt social security system and a heavy 
sovereign debt load are arguably the biggest internal 
challenges facing Panama today.  Since mid-2003, however, 
economic growth has picked up, primarily as a result of tax 
incentives given to a booming construction sector, low 
interest rates, and a global economic recovery.  Panama\'s 
growth rate for 2003 reached about 4%. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the United 
States.  The fourth round of bilateral free trade 
negotiations will take place in Florida in August.  There are 
several outstanding obstacles to closing the agreement, 
including agricultural protections and Intellectual Property 
Rights.  Should additional rounds be necessary, the two sides 
hope to finish the negotiations by October.  The GOP views 
the FTA as a vehicle to lock in the status quo or better in 
US import programs for agricultural and manufacturing 
products, improve market access in niche areas (e.g., 
banking, maritime, non-traditional agricultural products and 
sugar), and most importantly to attract significant US and 
other foreign investment. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Passenger Vessels Services Act concern 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
9.  (SBU) The GOP has long argued for Panama\'s re-designation 
from a \"near foreign port\" to a \"distant foreign port\" under 
the US Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA), to capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying 
the possibility of a re-designation, but US domestic maritime 
interests are creating political impediments.  The GOP 
estimates that Panama\'s growing tourism sector could gain up 
to US$50M annually from such a re-designation.

1. IN A BREAKFAST MEETING ON JULY 29, PANAMA\'S VICE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT (AND PRESUMPTIVE FOREIGN MINISTER) SAMUEL 
LEWIS NAVARRO TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT THE INCOMING TORRIJOS 
GOVERNMENT IS FAR FROM MAKING A DECISION ON THE POSSIBILITY 
OF DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION OF CHINA. REFERRING TO LEWIS\' JUNE 
30 INQUIRY TO THE AMBASSADOR AS TO U.S. VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT, 
SHE INFORMED HIM THAT SHE HAD DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH SENIOR 
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS DURING RECENT CONSULTATIONS IN 
WASHINGTON, AND WAS AUTHORIZED TO SAY THAT THE U.S. VIEWED 
THIS AS A SOVEREIGN PANAMANIAN DECISION.  SHE URGED HIM TO 
CONSIDER ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF A CHANGE, OR LACK OF 
CHANGE, IN DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, AND NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE 
VIEWED IN A BROADER CONTEXT IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE. 
 
 
2.  LEWIS NAVARRO SAID THAT THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION IS 
UNDER HEAVY PRESSURE BY BOTH CHINA AND TAIWAN REGARDING 
DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, BUT THAT PANAMA\'S INCOMING GOVERNMENT 
WOULD VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE ISSUE BEFORE COMING TO ANY 
DECISION.  \"WE ARE NOT LEANING IN EITHER DIRECTION AT THIS 
TIME\", SPECIFICALLY ASSURING THE AMBASSADOR THAT IN ANY EVENT 
TORRIJOS WOULD DO NOTHING PRIOR TO THE U.S. ELECTIONS TO 
AVOID HAVING THIS SUBJECT BECOME A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.  HE 
ADDED THAT HE WOULD HOPE TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH US 
OVER THE NEXT MONTHS AS THEY CONSIDER THE OPTIONS. 
 
 
3.  THE AMBASSADOR INQUIRED AS TO ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE 
PLANS FOR CANAL MODERNIZATION AND THE QUESTION OF 
CHINA/TAIWAN RECOGNITION.  LEWIS DENIED ANY LINK; INDEED, HE 
AFFIRMED THAT THE TORRIJOS ADMINISTRATION IN NO WAY WISHED TO 
RESURRECT THE NOW MORIBUND ACCUSATION OF ALLEGED \"CONTROL OF

PANAMA CANAL ADMINISTRATOR ALBERTO ALEMAN ZUBIETA HIS VIEWS 
ON THE RECOGNITION OF CHINA VERSUS TAIWAN.  ALEMAN, WHILE 
ACKNOWLEDGING TAIWAN\'S SHIPPING INTERESTS AND ITS UBIQUITOUS

5. COMMENT: WHILE IT IS TOO SOON TO TELL, WE ASSESS THAT THE

SUBJECT: Panama\'s legislature approves constitutional 
reform package in record time; concurrence by next 
legislature required 
 
 
REF: Panama 01764 
 
 
C O R R E C T E D COPY OF PANAMA 1957 - TEXT 
 
 
Summary/Comment: Reform package surmounts apathy 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Although many thought them dead a month ago, in 
only 21 calendar days Panama\'s Legislative Assembly 
approved a package of 67 constitutional reforms that most 
Panamanians view favorably.  They began as legislator Jerry 
Wilson\'s 90-page proposal on behalf of the opposition 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). (NOTE: The PRD will 
control the presidency and a majority of legislative seats 
after September 1.  END NOTE.)  The final package 
incorporates additions from ruling Arnulfista Party 
legislators, plus input from others who approached the 
Government Committee before plenary discussions.  Per 
Article 308 of Panama\'s constitution, President-elect 
Torrijos (PRD) must present the reform package to the newly 
elected legislature immediately after taking office on 
September 1.  The legislators who take over on September 1, 
must then ratify the reform package that their predecessors 
approved for it to be implemented.  We expect this to 
happen. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) The poorly attended July 5-28 \"extraordinary 
sessions\" captivated public attention much less than the 
USG revocation of a former cabinet minister\'s tourist visa 
for corruption.  One normally vocal advocate of 
constitutional reform told PolOffs that she gave up trying 
to contribute to the debate because her concerns were not 
reflected in changes made to the original proposal. 
Several legislators have used the reform process to air 
petty internal party disputes inappropriate for a plenary 
debate in the Legislative Assembly.  End Summary/Comment. 
 
 
What\'s changed -- the short version 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Only about 20 of the 67 reforms are substantive. 
Most just refine previous Articles with updated 
terminology, clearer drafting and formatting, and better 
punctuation. Substantive reforms go from reducing the 
number of elected officials to establishing a \"Tribunal de 
Cuentas.\"  Among other things, the reform package: 
 
 
---reduces the number of elected officials and the inter- 
regnum period between administrations, 
---reduces legislative immunity, 
---prohibits the President from appointing Supreme Court 
Justices directly from his/her Cabinet or the legislature, 
---mandates a referendum to ratify any plan for Canal 
expansion, 
---maintains the Comptroller General\'s right to exercise 
pre-disbursement control over government expenditures, and 
---defines a mechanism for convoking a Constituent Assembly 
(Constituyente). (NOTE: Closed-door PRD and Arnulfista 
negotiations led to this response to the most consistent 
civil society constitutional reform demand.  The new text 
prohibits a Constituyente from cutting the term of elected 
officials, alleviating PRD fears that it could be hurt if 
one were convoked during the next five years. END NOTE.) 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The constitutional reform package calls for 
several cuts to reduce the GOP payroll as well as 
government bloat, such as: (i) cutting the number of Vice 
Presidents from two to one, (ii) cutting the number of 
legislative seats to 71 (fixed) from 78 (variable, tied to 
population), (iii) reducing the number of legislators\' 
alternates from two to one each, and (iv) reducing the 
number of Deputy Mayors from two to one.  If the reforms 
were implemented, the reduced depth chart would take effect 
from 2009 (the next election) forward. 
 
 
5.  (U) Most Panamanians welcome elements of the reforms 
that impact the terms served by elected officials.  The 
reforms would cut the transition period between 
administrations in half to two months, making Inauguration 
Day July 1 instead of September 1.  Legislative sessions 
would be from January 2-April 30, and July 1-Oct 31 
(instead of March 1-June 30 and Sept 1-Dec 31).  Under the 
reformed constitution, all officials elected on May 2, 2004 
(from President-elect Torrijos down) would finish their 
terms two months \"early\" on June 30, 2009.  The reforms 
stipulate that the Executive must submit the national 
budget to the Assembly within the first legislative 
sessions of the year instead of in October. 
 
 
Recount of legislative debate 
 
 
6.  (SBU) From July 5-19, amidst a lamentable hush from 
civil society, the Assembly discussed constitutional 
reforms in first debate sessions that barely made a quorum. 
On average, 40 of 71 sitting legislators approved each of 
71 proposed reforms during the first of three required 
debates.  A key Assembly staffer expressed concern to 
PolOffs about the lack of commitment and true interest by 
the majority of the legislators.  \"Only about 20% of the 
legislators are following the debate and the rest are 
sending their alternates (suplentes) to attend sessions,\" 
he claimed.  Rumors of secret negotiations between the 
Moscoso administration and the PRD overshadowed plenary 
discussions and exasperated proponents of a Constituyente, 
who called for a new presidential decree ending debate. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) After a two-day impasse, President Moscoso agreed 
to extend \"extraordinary\" legislative sessions to permit 
the required second and third rounds of debate.  Moscoso 
used Catholic Church and the University of Panama 
complaints as a pretext to stall, but internal Arnulfista 
spats were the real cause for the delay.  Only 67 reforms 
passed second and third debates.  Of note, the Assembly 
eliminated a contentious reform submitted by the 
Arnulfistas that would have allowed legislators to summon 
Justices to be questioned on court-related issues. Plenary 
consensus on the latter provision was impossible even 
though it barred Justices being summoned based on specific 
decisions.  Chief Justice Cesar Pereira Burgos warned 
Assembly President Jacobo Salas after first debate that 
such a reform would violate the separation of powers. 
 
 
Legislative immunity reduced 
 
 
8.  (SBU) One of the most welcome reforms was the reduction 
of legislative immunity, considered by many to be a shield 
to protect legislators involved in unethical and/or illegal 
actions.  If the reform is implemented, the Supreme Court 
could investigate legislators without Assembly clearance. 
Except for one notorious 1994 case when a legislator was 
caught in the act bribing businessmen, all other requests 
from the Public Ministry to investigate legislators have 
been rejected.  Sadly, the list of Assembly refusals to 
waive immunity includes Carlos Afu, who waved what he 
claimed was bribe money in the air on national television. 
 
 
Changes affect the Comptroller General 
 
 
9.  (SBU) A passionate appeal from several former 
Comptrollers General (Reftel) saved pre-disbursement 
control (\"control previo\") from the chopping block.  A 
revised Article 276 would establish a \"Tribunal de Cuentas\" 
to investigate, prosecute and rule on mal/misfeasance in 
the management of government accounts.  Currently, the CG 
him/herself has those roles, but the reforms dictate that 
the CG would have to submit the cases to a special court. 
If implemented, the reform mandates legislation to define 
the composition and operations of such a court, plus the 
pre-requisites for its magistrates. 
 
 
Changes to the Judicial Branch 
 
 
10.  (SBU) The most publicized judicial reform would forbid 
appointments to the Supreme Court of anyone currently 
holding a legislative or Cabinet seat.  The reform targets 
President Moscoso\'s most recent appointments to the Court, 
but would allow Presidents (including Torrijos) to appoint 
individuals who have served as legislators or cabinet 
members in previous administrations.  Rumored future 
Justices include hardline PRDs who President-elect Torrijos 
wants to reward for their service to the party, to distance 
from his administration, or both. 
 
 
11.  (SBU) Another reform would require that alternates 
(\"suplentes\") for Justices be appointed from within the 
judicial branch, whereas currently the President appoints 
them (like the principals).  (NOTE: Suplentes are often 
active members of prominent law firms, not full time 
judicial employees.  Their firms may have an interest in 
the very cases the suplentes are ruling on.  END NOTE.) 
Some constitutional lawyers disagree with this provision, 
claiming that it could alter the \"internal independency\" of 
the judicial branch.  It could also lead subordinate judges 
to feel intimidated by their absent superiors when ruling. 
The proposal that Justices be assigned to the Court by law 
rather than the Constitution didn\'t pass for fear that a 
sitting President could pack the court to his/her 
advantage. 
 
 
12.  (SBU) Article 221 establishes that the Attorney 
General (AG) and the Solicitor General (SG) will no longer 
have appointed alternates.  The AG and the SG will appoint 
his/her alternates from within his/her offices to fill in 
during absences.  Some fear that this reform will increase 
the AG\'s ability to influence the alternate.  Alternates in 
the past (including the recent past) have rebelled when the 
principal was absent, in several instances for the better. 
 
 
Electoral Tribunal gains Independence & Stability 
 
 
13.  (SBU) Reforms approved to Article 137, paragraph 9 
would allow the Electoral Tribunal (TE) to prepare its own 
budget and present it directly to the Legislative Assembly 
instead of seeking Executive Branch approval.  The 
Comptroller General\'s Office would audit TE expenditures 
after the fact.  The reforms would also prohibit Supreme 
Court oversight of electoral matters.  (NOTE: The case of 
legislator Carlos Afu\'s ejection from the PRD was never 
resolved after the Supreme Court snatched it away from the 
TE on questionable grounds.  Afu\'s \"defection\" to the 
Arnulfista Party eliminated the basis of the case. END 
NOTE.)  A reformed Article 159 would allow the TE to 
present bills directly to the Legislative Assembly for 
consideration rather than through the executive branch. 
Finally, to avoid all three electoral magistrates leaving 
simultaneously, the revised constitution stipulates that 
they be appointed for staggered 10-year terms.  To achieve 
this, when all three magistrates leave in 2006 one new 
magistrate would be appointed for ten years, another for 
eight and a third for six.  Their successors would be 
appointed for ten-year terms. 
 
 
Contempt out and wiretaps in 
 
 
14.  (SBU) The reforms would eliminate Paragraph 1 of 
Article 33, which allows judges and justices to impose a 
sanction (either jail or penalties) without trial to anyone 
they considered has \"offended them or shown no respect for 
them\".  One outrageous case came to light several years ago 
when then-Chief Justice Arturo Hoyos sent a lawyer to jail 
because he considered that the lawyer had \"disrespected\" 
him verbally.  (COMMENT: This item is similar in spirit to 
contempt provisions in the US, but capricious application 
has made it problematic.  END COMMENT.)  On a related 
issue, the Arnulfistas were unable to garner PRD votes to 
support the elimination of criminal charges for libel and 
slander as that reform fell victim to short-sighted party 
politicking. 
 
 
15.  (SBU) The current constitution forbids wiretapping; 
however after passing the anti-money laundering bill in the 
1990\'s, the Attorney General\'s office has allowed 
wiretapping in certain cases.  Many lawyers and even judges 
and justices had widely different positions on the 
practice, ranging from vehement criticism to quiet 
applause.  The reform would allow wiretapping with prior 
authorization for a specific purpose.  If not, information 
obtained from wiretaps would not be admissible as evidence 
and whoever eavesdrops on telephone conversations without 
prior authorization would be subject to criminal charges. 
 
 
Political parties democratized -- sort of 
 
 
16.  (SBU) One reform would require political parties to 
have a democratic internal structure and operating 
procedures.  The change reflects Arnulfistas\' concern about 
the way that President Moscoso has imposed her will on the 
party and PRD criticism of the same.  On the other hand, 
despite the widespread belief that it is a liability to the 
democratic system, the Assembly maintained the 
constitutional norm that allows a political party to unseat 
one of its members from the legislature (\"revocatoria de 
mandato\").  (COMMENT: This is a convenient way for large 
and small parties alike to enforce voting along party 
lines.  Then again, the reformed constitution would allow 
constituents to \"recall\" independent legislators under 
certain conditions.  This may discourage independents from 
running for the Assembly. END COMMENT.) 
 
 
Reforms with presidential fingerprints 
 
 
17.  (SBU) The first two reforms in the package clearly 
reflect President Moscoso\'s and President-Elect Torrijos\' 
personal interests.  Article 11 of the Panama\'s 
constitution states that foreign adopted children of 
Panamanian nationals can only become Panamanians when they 
\"reach 18 years and clearly state their wish to keep 
residing in Panama.\"  The reform would drop the age 
requirement, which means that Moscoso\'s 13-year-old son, 
adopted in Costa Rica, could soon be naturalized.  The 
Reformed Article 19 would prohibit discrimination based on 
disabilities.  President-elect Torrijos\' daughter Daniela 
is a child with special needs. 
 
 
Comment: Fallout and follow-up 
 
 
18.  (SBU) Despite concerns that a lack of political will 
(particularly from the Moscoso administration) would stop 
the reforms, closed-door negotiations once more prevailed 
to move things along. The PRD and the Arnulfistas (as 
applicable) may now exalt President-elect Torrijos\' 
\"initiative\" and trumpet GOP \"cooperation.\"  Critics 
believe that the reforms were not studied carefully and may 
challenge at least one before the Supreme Court.  For 
instance, the reform to Article 141 that caps the total 
number of legislators grants a fixed number of seats to the 
Kuna (2) and Ngobe-Bugle (3) indigenous groups.  Since 
those legislators would represent smaller populations than 
the others, their influence in the Assembly would be 
disproportional, allowing 4% of Panama\'s population to 
control 7% of its legislators.  Their privileged positions 
would violate Article 19 of Panama\'s constitution if 
considered racially discriminatory. 
 
 
19.  (SBU) Civil society has lukewarmly welcomed the 
establishment of a procedure for calling a Constituent 
Assembly (Constituyente).  The reformed Article 308 of the 
Constitution would allow a Constituyente to be convoked: 
(i) by the executive branch (with the approval of the 
Legislative Assembly), (ii) by a 2/3 Legislative Assembly 
vote, or (iii) at the petition of 20% of the population age 
18 or greater (about 380,000 people) whose signatures were 
collected within six months.  In a six to nine month 
period, the Constituyente (composed of 60 elected 
representatives) could reform part or all of the 
constitution, but not introduce retroactive changes or 
alter the terms of sitting elected officials.  Constituent 
Assembly reforms would then be submitted to a national 
referendum.  Those who feel that the reform package is not 
enough are rumored be waiting for a September ratification 
by the new Legislative Assembly to start collecting 
signatures.

NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING WORKSHOP AUG. 10-14 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
1.  (SBU) US Embassy Panama welcomes the USG delegation to 
the National Security Planning Workshop, Aug. 11-13, which is 
designed to assist the incoming PRD government headed by 
President-elect Torrijos who assumes office September 1.  You 
will have the opportunity to reiterate USG commitment to 
improve security cooperation, expand training programs shared 
between our two countries, continue focus on civilian 
controlled security forces, and enhance transparency and rule 
of law within Panama\'s institutions.  Panama was an early 
member of the Coalition of the Willing, has signed and 
ratified a bilateral Article 98 Agreement, is a strong 
anti-narcotics ally, and is a strong supporter of US maritime 
security/trade-security initiatives.  The Canal is well-run 
and efficient.  Although the Moscoso government\'s reputation 
has been tarnished by corruption and ineffectual 
administration, Panama has been a good friend and ally. 
Demonstrations protesting Panama\'s negotiation of a bilateral 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US have made front-page 
news here in recent weeks. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
National Security Workshop 
-------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (SBU) This Embassy, in conjunction with the Center for 
Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) and representatives of the 
incoming Torrijos administration, is organizing an August 
11-13 bilateral \"National Security Planning Workshop\" to 
encourage the new administration to plan strategically its 
approach to security issues related to its borders, the 
Canal, public security (i.e. crime), and counter-narcotics, 
and focus on ways to cooperate with the USG.  Torrijos\' 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) is the Panamanian party 
most focused on security matters, but Torrijos planners admit 
that they have not progressed very far in terms of their 
overall security strategy.  This workshop presents a unique 
opportunity for the USG to support Panama\'s strategic 
security planning while it is being formulated and position 
ourselves to participate in its implementation.  Your 
contribution to this important endeavor is greatly 
appreciated. 
 
 
------------------ 
New Administration 
------------------ 
 
 
3.  (SBU) President-elect Martin Torrijos, due to take office 
on September 1, is pushing an energetic and ambitious 
transition agenda featuring clear-cut goals in foreign policy 
(with a priority on the US and Colombia), security 
(cooperation with US objectives, new attention to the 
Caribbean coast), the economy (employment generation, a Free 
Trade Agreement with the US, Canal expansion, social security 
reform, and making Panama a regional focal point for 
investment, eco-tourism, and logistics), and politics 
(constitutional reform).  Torrijos campaigned on a strong 
anti-corruption platform and hopes to clean up Panama\'s 
politicized Supreme Court.  Thus far, Torrijos\' cabinet 
appointments have been mostly respected professionals without 
excessive baggage from the PRD\'s close ties to Panama\'s 
21-year dictatorship and its anti-US faction, a promising 
sign.  Despite the good intentions of the Torrijos 
administration, anticipated pressures from a well-entrenched 
oligarchy could frustrate its ambitious reform plans. 
 
 
--------------- 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The Torrijos team plans to make Canal expansion a 
top priority.  It expects this $4-10 billion (estimates vary 
widely and the Canal Authority has been deliberately silent), 
10-year project to be a transforming event for Panama that 
will provide jobs and set the tone economically for years to 
come.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has provided 
feasibility and engineering studies for one set of locks for 
the proposed expansion and looks forward to further 
involvement with the ACP (Authority of the Canal of Panama) 
as the project moves forward.  A national referendum on the 
issue is likely in 2005.  Actual groundbreaking, if the 
referendum passes, could be three years off. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
International Ship and Port Facility Security Code 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
5.  (SBU) On July 1, Panama announced that it had met the 
deadline for implementing its International Ship and Port 
Facility Security Code (ISPS) obligations.  According to 
Captain Luiz Perez Salamero, the departing Deputy 
Administrator of Panama\'s Maritime Authority (AMP), all ships 
that call on US ports have completed the International Ship 
Security Certification (ISSC) process; however, some will 
have onboard either a short-term certificate (valid for five 
months) or an interim certificate during the first months 
after July 1.  Final ISSCs will be issued to those ships as 
quickly as possible and prior to expiration of the 
Interim/Short-term certificates.  The AMP has developed an 
on-line database (www.amp.gob.pa) listing all Panamanian 
flagged vessels with issued ISSCs, which is intended to 
assist countries with the certificate validation process. 
Controversy dogged this process, as some maritime lawyers and 
shipping companies protested the designation of a sole firm 
as Panama\'s ISPS certifier. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Toward a Democratic Culture 
--------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU) The recent US visa revocation of the former 
Minister of Public Works as a result of President Bush\'s 
initiative to deny US visas to corrupt public officials, has 
captivated the press.  That is only the latest in a series of 
high-profile media coverage of transparency-in-governance 
issues.  Last month, the Ambassador\'s speech on poverty and 
the need for government action generated a series of positive 
responses as well as a pro forma rebuttal from the Foreign 
Minister.  The Ambassador\'s September 29, 2003 speech to 
Panama\'s Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, 
launching this Embassy\'s Good Governance Initiative (GGI), 
resonated with Panamanians and generated front-page 
headlines.  Venality, conflict of interest, nepotism, and 
lack of transparency are ingrained in Panama\'s political 
culture and institutions.  To encourage public demand for 
reform in the judicial sector, AID Panama has extended grants 
totaling US$150,000 to civil society organizations for 
projects designed to address structural barriers to the 
administration of justice. Numberous Embassy sections and 
agencies promote good governance as a focused mission-wide 
priority. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
A Mixed Macroeconomic Record 
---------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Since the turnover of Canal operations and US 
military bases in 1999, Panama has had a mixed record of 
economic success.  The Canal is run more efficiently, safely 
and profitably than under USG administration.  Canal-related 
industries, especially cargo transshipment through ports at 
both ends of the Canal, have boomed, as have visits by US 
cruise ships, which surpassed 200 port calls in Panama this 
year.  Panama\'s overall economy went flat when nearly 30,000 
US military personnel and their dependents left during the 
late 1990s, privatization slowed, and the 2001 global 
recession took hold which perpetuated the country\'s estimated 
13.4% unemployment rate.  Also, Panama has failed to attract 
large investment into the former Canal Zone.  Poverty, income 
disparity (second only to Brazil in the Hemisphere), an 
actuarially bankrupt social security system and a heavy 
sovereign debt load are arguably the biggest internal 
challenges facing Panama today.  Since mid-2003, however, 
economic growth has picked up, primarily as a result of tax 
incentives given to a booming construction sector, low 
interest rates, and a global economic recovery.  Panama\'s 
growth rate for 2003 reached about 4%. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Economic issues are prominent in Panama\'s agenda 
with the United States.  The fourth round of bilateral free 
trade negotiations will take place August 9-13 in Tampa, 
Florida.  Negotiators will try to overcome several 
outstanding differences, including agricultural protections 
and Intellectual Property Rights.  Should additional rounds 
be necessary, the two sides hope to finish the negotiations 
by October.  The GOP views the FTA as a vehicle to lock in 
the status quo or better in US import programs for 
agricultural and manufacturing products, improve market 
access in niche areas (e.g., banking, maritime, 
non-traditional agricultural products and sugar), and most 
importantly to attract significant US and other foreign 
investment. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Passenger Vessels Services Act concern 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
9.  (SBU) The GOP has long argued for Panama\'s re-designation 
from a \"near foreign port\" to a \"distant foreign port\" under 
the US Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA), to capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The USG is studying 
the possibility of a re-designation, but US domestic maritime 
interests are creating political impediments.  The GOP 
estimates that Panama\'s growing tourism sector could gain up 
to US$50M annually from such a re-designation.

PANAMA STRATEGIC DIALOGUE

1. (SBU) Summary.  Senior members of Panama\'s newly elected 
leadership met with counterparts from the Embassy and other 
USG interlocutors in an August 11 - 13 workshop to discuss 
the incoming PRD administration\'s national security 
strategy.  With the assistance of facilitators from the 
Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, USG and Panamanian 
officials discussed responses to threats to maritime 
security, border security, citizen security, and counter 
narcotics and terrorism. Coming just weeks prior to their 
taking office on September 1, this NAS-sponsored event 
provided a unique and timely opportunity for the incoming 
administration to discuss national security strategy, both 
internally and with U.S. counterparts. Discussion focused on 
the need to provide strategic leadership, ensure interagency 
and international cooperation, and provide adequate 
resources and performance measurement when planning security 
policy. The event received widespread and positive press 
coverage, with both sides looking forward to a close 
bilateral security relationship. End Summary. 
 
 
National Security Planning Workshop Comes Together 
 
 
2. (SBU) As previewed reftels, a group of 35 senior national 
security officials from the incoming PRD government met with 
Embassy and USG counterparts August 11 - 13 outside Panama 
City for a workshop on National Security planning sponsored 
by the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) in collaboration with 
the National Defense University\'s Center for Hemispheric 
Defense Studies (CHDS).  Panama\'s President-elect Martin 
Torrijos and Ambassador Watt opened the workshop on August 
11 heralding a common desire for a closer and more mature 
security relationship between Panama and the United States 
in the coming years. 
 
 
3. (SBU) The Panamanian team was coordinated by Minister of 
Government and Justice designate Hector Aleman, and included 
other members of the incoming cabinet, including both Vice 
Presidents elect, and the future Ministers of the Presidency 
and Finance. Other participants included Panama\'s Ambassador- 
designate to the U.S., the heads of Panama\'s Public Force 
and other agencies with a national security and/or law 
enforcement focus. While not all participants had yet been 
formally appointed to positions in the new government, it 
was clear that this group represented the PRD\'s national 
security braintrust. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The U.S. side included members of the Embassy\'s 
law enforcement and security working group as well as 
several senior Washington representatives. Prominent among 
the latter were Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Roger 
Pardo-Mauer and Coast Guard Director of Operations Policy 
Rear Admiral J.W. Underwood. Southcom Director of Operations 
BG Benjamin Mixon also addressed the group and held 
discussions with President-elect Torrijos.  Representatives 
from the Department of State, Department of Defense, and 
Department of Homeland Security rounded out the U.S. side. 
 
 
Discussion Focuses on Priority Areas 
 
 
5. (SBU) At the request of our Panamanian counterparts, the 
U.S. and Panamanian participants were broken down into four 
working groups that corresponded to the pillars of the 
Torrijos administration\'s national security policy. These 
included Citizen Security, Border Security, Maritime and 
Canal Security, and Counter Narcotics and Counter Terrorism. 
Minister-designate Aleman further developed these themes and 
their centrality in the Torrijos Administration\'s governing 
plans in a speech to the group August 12.  Each working 
group developed proposed courses of action for the new 
administration that will be further refined by the Ministry 
of Government and Justice in the coming weeks. 
 
 
6. (SBU) The participants were aided in their discussions by 
presentations organized by CHDS experts in the areas of 
Strategic Leadership, Interagency Coordination, 
International Cooperation, and Budgeting and Performance 
Measurement. The CHDS presenters and facilitators guided the 
Panamanian participants in translating their strategic 
objectives into concrete policy options.  Discussion in both 
the open sessions and the working groups was lively, with 
participants clearly grappling with the complexity of the 
issues involved. While many of the Panamanian participants 
came into the workshop with some National Security 
experience, others did not. For both groups, however, this 
was a unique opportunity to discuss the inter-relationship 
of the issues confronting the new government. 
 
 
Building Teamwork 
 
 
7.  (SBU) In addition to the substantive discussions, the 
workshop had been intended as an opportunity to build 
personal and professional relationships between Panamanian 
and U.S. participants. The consensus from participants on 
both sides following the event was that this goal had been 
realized. Given the complex history of the PRD and its 
relationship with the United States, it was particularly 
gratifying to see barriers beginning to come down between 
some of the party\'s \"old guard\" and USG counterparts. The 
workshop also succeeded in helping to build the Panamanian 
team and will hopefully set the tone for positive working 
relationships after September 1. 
 
 
Looking Towards the Future 
 
 
8.  (SBU) From the beginning, Ambassador Watt and other 
participants emphasized that this workshop would only be the 
beginning of a strategic dialogue between the United States 
and the Torrijos government. The event received widespread 
and positive press coverage from both the print and 
broadcast media, who interpreted the event as a USG vote of 
confidence in the Torrijos administration.  As the 
government takes office on September 1 and the individuals 
who participated in the workshop take over their ministries 
and agencies, we will look for future opportunities to 
engage with them on issues of mutual concern.  Embassy would 
like to express its appreciation to all those involved in 
making this workshop a success, in particular our colleagues 
from CHDS.

REF: 03 PANAMA 2773 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR LINDA WATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
1.  (SBU) On behalf of Embassy Panama, I want to express our 
warmest welcome on your upcoming September 1, 2004 visit to 
Panama\'s Presidential Inauguration.  Following your November 
3, 2003 visit to Panama\'s Centennial celebrations (reftel), 
your presence here as the government of Martin Torrijos takes 
power strongly signals the great interest of the United 
States in expanding further our excellent relations with the 
Panamanians.  Our cooperation on a wide range of issues -- 
including law enforcement and security policy -- promise to 
reach new levels under the new government.  Elected on a 
reform and anti-corruption platform by the largest post-1989 
plurality on record, Torrijos has made clear that his 
government\'s most important foreign policy priority will be 
relations with the United States and that he intends to 
deepen our mutual focus on counter-terrorism capabilities, 
combat international criminal networks, and expand trade and 
investment.  The new president and his Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) -- largely purged of its 
anti-democratic, anti-U.S. tendencies and which holds an 
absolute majority in the Legislative Assembly -- will face 
large challenges from the outset: a serious budget shortfall 
and tide of red ink left by the out-going government; 
urgently required action to right the nation\'s foundering 
retirement and medical system (the Social Security Fund); 
completing the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the 
United States; launching a more activist and \"coherent\" 
foreign policy (closer relations with Western Europe and a 
review of Panama\'s relations with Taiwan and China); and a 
decision on how to proceed on Canal expansion, leading to a 
2005 national referendum.  The new government\'s principal 
domestic priorities will be sustainable economic development, 
attracting investment, and job creation. 
 
 
The Political Landscape: Torrijos and a New Generation 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
2.  (SBU) Martin Erasto Torrijos Espino won Panama\'s May 2, 
2004 general elections with 47% of the popular vote, a 16% 
margin over his nearest competitor.  Torrijos\'s Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) joined forces with its historical 
opponent, the Popular Party (PP) to propel him and its 
legislative candidates to victory.  Torrijos has surrounded 
himself with young, primarily US-educated professionals like 
himself and has changed the face of the PRD by marginalizing 
\"old guard\" supporters of former President Ernesto Perez 
Balladares (1994-99).  Torrijos and those closest to him have 
indicated that they intend to work closely with U.S. 
officials, especially on security, law enforcement, trade and 
investment.  Overall, his cabinet appointments have been 
inspired choices -- mostly young technocrats with a pro-U.S. 
outlook.  Most of Torrijos\'s cabinet appointments are 
respected professionals without excessive baggage from 
Panama\'s 21-year military dictatorship or the PRD\'s anti-U.S. 
faction, a promising sign.  Anticipated pressures from a 
well-entrenched oligarchy could frustrate the Torrijos 
administration\'s reform plans. 
 
 
Promoting Good Governance 
------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Torrijos campaigned on a \"zero-corruption\" 
platform, promises to run a clean government, and hopes to 
clean up Panama\'s politicized Supreme Court.  This Embassy 
launched a strong Good Governance initiative with Ambassador 
Watt\'s 2003 speech against corruption in government.  That 
speech resonated firmly with Panamanians from all walks of 
life and generated front-page headlines.  More recently, the 
Ambassador followed up with a speech about the dangers that 
poverty and skewed income distribution pose to democracy, 
factors that exacerbate social conflict and increase the 
appeal of unscrupulous populist demagogues.  The Embassy 
currently supports good governance activities directed toward 
judicial reform, civic education, business ethics, and 
strengthening anti-corruption prosecutors\' institutional 
capacity.  Another key element of the Embassy\'s Good 
Governance initiative is its visa revocation program.  Based 
on Embassy recommendations, the State Department recently 
revoked the U.S. visas of two former senior GOP officials, 
which provoked a spate of mostly favorable press commentary 
and huge support (85% according to one poll) from average 
Panamanians. 
 
 
Law Enforcement and Security Policy 
---------------------------------- 
4.  (C) President-elect Torrijos comes to office with clear 
focus on security matters, largely because his Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) is the most security-oriented of 
all Panamanian parties.  We expect to maintain or improve the 
already extraordinary level of access and cooperation we now 
enjoy with Panamanian officials on law enforcement and 
security.  Last May\'s signing in Washington of a 
counter-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction amendment 
to our basic shipriders agreement with Panama under the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) underscores our 
excellent cooperation, which the Torrijos transition team has 
assured us will continue or improve.  During August 11-13 the 
Embassy organized an offsite bilateral National Security 
Planning workshop, which Torrijos and virtually the entire 
new cabinet attended, along with high USG officials.  The 
conference gave us an excellent opportunity to get to know 
the incoming officials on a personal level and to begin 
concrete discussions on security matters. 
 
 
Darien, Atlantic Coast 
---------------------- 
5.  (C) Torrijos plans to introduce strengthened security 
policies and a greater GOP presence in the Darien-Colombian 
border and Atlantic coastal regions.  The aim is to improve 
civilian-police relations in both areas, improve intelligence 
gathering, and boost security.  The transition team has told 
us of plans to rehabilitate WWII-era landing strips in the 
Darien and on the Atlantic Coast, along with a shift away 
from the use of helicopters toward a greater reliance on 
cheaper-to-operate single-engine fixed wing aircraft.  By 
improving the landing fields and communication with remote 
areas, Torrijos hopes to lure more teachers and medical 
personnel to serve in remote areas, which will create local 
goodwill and give the government more intelligence capability 
and control.  The Embassy has been working to convince the 
Torrijos team that more attention needs to be paid to the 
Atlantic coast city of Colon, where a vacuum of state 
authority has attracted organized violent crime, drug 
smugglers, and money launderers 
 
 
Our Third Border 
---------------- 
6.  (SBU) Panama\'s \"sovereignty sensitivities\" are slowly 
receding.  Panama early on joined the Coalition of the 
Willing and signed and, on October 8, 2003, ratified a 
bilateral Article 98 Agreement.  On May 12, 2004 the U.S. and 
Panama signed a Proliferation Security Shipboarding 
Agreement.  Related to Canal and border security, Panamanians 
have become increasingly willing, even eager, to accept 
mil-to-mil security training, equipment and other assistance. 
 The Canal\'s viability remains essential to our domestic 
security and economic interests. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Panama\'s ship registry blossomed from the third 
largest in the world in 1990 to the largest -- currently 
comprising around 5,525 large commercial vessels or 
one-quarter of the world\'s ocean-going vessels.  About 13% of 
US ocean-going cargo transits the Canal each year.  Panama\'s 
seafarer registry currently licenses over 264,000 
crewmembers.  Panama has privatized and developed some former 
U.S. military ports and other related facilities.  Port 
services grew dramatically from about 200,000 containers per 
year in the early 1990s to two million by 2003.  Panama now 
boasts the leading complex of port facilities in Latin 
America.  Although the present terrorist threat to the Canal 
is considered low, Panamanian planning, risk assessment, 
layered defenses and security resources are generally well 
regarded.  Continued U.S. training, equipment and other 
assistance are vital to preempt a terrorist attack.  To 
protect water resources, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has 
committed to match dollar-for-dollar AID\'s three-year US$2.5 
million integrated watershed management program.  Panama 
committed to a maritime security agenda, which has led to its 
timely adoption of the new International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) International Shipping and Port Security 
(ISPS) Code, which entered into force July 1, 2004. 
 
 
Foreign Policy 
-------------- 
8.  (C) Torrijos has made clear that his top foreign policy 
priority is the United States.  Foreign Minister-designate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro traveled to Washington in May to meet 
with the Deputy Secretary and other senior officials in the 
Department and the NSC.  Next on the priority list is 
Colombia, Panama\'s giant, troubled neighbor, and Torrijos 
twice has traveled to Bogota to meet president Uribe.  One 
negative item on the bilateral agenda is undocumented 
Colombia immigrants in Panama, conservatively estimated in 
excess of 100,000 people.  Torrijos transition team officials 
believe that ordinary Panamanians are growing resentful of 
illegal Colombians because of job displacement, and the new 
government has pledged to put an end to illegal immigration 
practices.  Torrijos and his team have already toured 
capitals in Western Europe and South America and promise a 
new, more activist, more \"coherent\" foreign policy that will 
support Panama\'s global interests.  Specifically, Panama 
would like to attract investment from France, possibly in 
Canal enlargement, and expects a visit from French President 
Jacques Chirac in the near future. 
 
 
Taiwan/China Rivalry over Panama 
-------------------------------- 
9.  (C) Panama is Taiwan\'s most important formal diplomatic 
relationship.  Rivalry between the PRC and Taiwan in Panama 
has been intense and seems likely to grow hotter after 
September 1.  In the past Panama has been quite skillful in 
leveraging its diplomatic relations with Taiwan to extract 
maximum resources from both sides, in particular from Taiwan. 
 The incoming Torrijos government will have another 
opportunity to milk Taiwan during the upcoming September 1 
visit of Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, who may discuss 
proposals for Taiwan\'s participation in Canal reconstruction 
financing.  Both Taiwan and China have made 
less-than-transparent contributions to Panamanian political 
campaigns. 
 
 
10.  (C) During the election campaign, then-candidate Martin 
Torrijos said that he would not immediately change Panama\'s 
Taiwan-PRC diplomatic orientation but also implied that a 
review of relations was warranted.  Indeed, there are strong 
currents within the PRD that favor the PRC over Taiwan.  And 
Panama must determine how best to serve its own interests. 
As Torrijos mentioned on August 12 at the National Security 
workshop,  Panama wants to foster its growing commercial 
relationship with the PRC, as more and more China trade 
passes through the Canal, and as China is poised to become 
the Canal\'s number-two user nation.  Following PRC Vice 
Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong\'s June 18 meetings with Panama 
government (GOP) and PRD transition team officials, on June 
30 Foreign Minister-designate Samuel Lewis asked the 
Ambassador how the United States would view a switch of 
diplomatic recognition by Panama to the PRC.  The 
Ambassador\'s reply was that the United States is \"strictly 
neutral\" on such matters but would not fail to note any hint 
of direct PRC involvement in Canal matters.  Lewis recently 
told PolCouns that \"no internal discussions\" on the issue had 
yet taken place and assured us that Panama would consult 
closely with the Embassy when and if such discussions occur. 
 
 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
11.  (C) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the United 
States.  President Moscoso pushed to move forward quickly on 
a bilateral FTA.  Negotiations began in April 2004, and to 
date the U.S. and Panama have held four negotiating rounds 
(the last one in Tampa was cut short by Hurricane Charley). 
A fifth round is scheduled for October 18-22.  The incoming 
Torrijos administration has attended the talks and views a 
bilateral FTA as imperative for attracting investment and not 
being disadvantaged by the CAFTA countries.  While strong 
advances were made during the last round in the areas of 
industrial market access and banking services, areas 
important to both economies, substantial work remains. 
Politically sensitive issues remaining include Panama\'s 
requests for expanded access to the U.S. sugar market and 
designation as a \"distant foreign port\" and U.S. requests for 
improved agricultural access and specific inclusion of the 
Panama Canal Authority under the FTA. 
 
 
12.  (C) The GOP has long lobbied the USG to re-designate 
Panama as a \"distant foreign port (it is now a \"near foreign 
port\") under the U.S. Passenger Vessels Services Act (PVSA) 
-- most recently by raising it in the FTA negotiations. 
Panama believes that a redesignation will help it capture a 
larger share of the cruise ship trade.  The U.S. regulation, 
administered by U.S. Customs, prevents foreign flag vessels 
from carrying passengers (thus interfering with cruise 
operations) between two points in the United States via 
Panamanian ports, which are considered \"nearby\" for the 
purposes of the Act.  The GOP estimates that a change in 
designation could gain up to US$50 million annually for 
Panama\'s growing tourism industry.  While a 2004 Commerce 
Department study found that a change in designation would not 
negatively affect U.S. shipbuilding, important elements of 
the U.S. maritime industry are vehemently opposed and have 
vigorously expressed their opposition in letters to 
Administration principals and the Hill.  While the USG has 
not totally closed the door on this issue in the FTA context, 
it has noted that the Panamanians have not yet worked 
effectively to get the necessary support for the 
redesignation. 
 
 
13.  (SBU) Over the past year, the Moscoso administration has 
shown marked improvement in settling investment disputes 
involving U.S. companies, to address bilateral trade issues, 
and to enhance cooperation/coordination in regional and 
multilateral trade fora.  We believe that the incoming 
Torrijos administration will show us the same level of 
cooperation or better, as well as greater transparency, 
predictability, and openness for U.S. investors. 
 
 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
14.  (SBU) The Torrijos team plans to make Canal expansion a 
top priority.  It expects this $2-7 billion, nine-year 
project to contruct a third set of Canal locks to be a 
transforming event for Panama that will provide jobs and set 
the tone economically for years to come.  Given the driving 
forces of international shipping -- \"containerization\", 
construction of \"post-Panamax\" mega-ships currently unable to 
traverse the Canal, and growing trade between East Asia and 
the U.S. eastern seaboard, the expansion is central to 
maintaining the Canal\'s future viability.  The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) has provided feasibility and 
engineering studies for one set of locks for the proposed 
expansion and looks forward to further involvement with the 
ACP (Panama Canal Authority).  A constitutionally-required 
national referendum on the issue is likely in 2005.  Actual 
groundbreaking, if the referendum passes, could be three 
years off.

2. (U) While Panama imports over half of its oil from 
Venezuela, it does not do so under the terms of either the 
San Jose or Caracas Accords.  Panama is a signatory to both 
Accords; however, it did not/not renew the Caracas Accords 
after the initial year.  Panama purchased oil using the San 
Jose Accords in the 1980s (until 1989) because, at that time, 
the GOP controlled the oil industry in Panama.  Panama\'s last 
refinery closed at the end of 2002 and today the country only 
imports refined oil.  In 2003, Panama imported 7,654,366.78 
barrels.  Fifty-one percent was imported from Venezuela, 27 
percent from the United States, 5 percent from Trinidad, and 
17 percent from other countries. 
 
 
3. (C) Panama does not consider Venezuela to be a stable 
supplier of petroleum because delivery dates and schedules 
are not met consistently.  In the past, Panama received its 
oil directly from refineries in Venezuela.  However, these 
refineries began to have production problems and could not 
accommodate demand.  Consequently, Panama receives its oil 
from Venezuela after it has been refined in Aruba.  Venezuela 
maintains that this is the only refinery available to meet 
Panama\'s demand.  The GOP has not/not received any formal 
proposal from the Government of Venezuela regarding 
PetroAmerica.  (Comment.  From post\'s conversations with GOP 
hydrocarbon experts, it does not seem likely Panama would be 
interested in this initiative.  End comment.)

---------- 
Summary 
---------- 
 
 
      The GOP made progress toward eliminating the worst 
forms of child labor in 2004. It worked with ILO/IPEC to 
begin to identify the worst forms of child labor, enacted a 
new law aimed at combating child commercial sexual 
exploitation, and created a regional subcommittee to combat 
the use of children as household servants.  In response to 
Reftel A, this cable summarizes last year\'s child labor cable 
(Reftel B).  As requested in Reftel A, copies of all original 
data sources will be sent to DOL via diplomatic pouch.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
A.  Does Panama have adequate laws and 
regulations proscribing the worst forms of 
child labor? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
- Panama ratified ILO Convention 182 in May 2000. 
 
 
- The minimum age for basic employment in Panama is 14 years, 
although children between 13 and 14 years may work under 
certain conditions in agriculture and light domestic 
labor.  Minors under the age of 18 years may not engage in 
hazardous labor. 
 
 
- Panama\'s labor laws cover all sectors. 
 
 
- Panama\'s labor code prohibits minors from engaging in work 
that may be dangerous to the \"life, health or morality\" of 
the child.  This includes work in businesses which serve 
alcohol, all forms of transportation, work with electricity, 
work with explosive or flammable material, work in mines, and 
work with radioactive substances. 
 
 
- The ability to work at age 14 is contingent upon completion 
of primary school.  If this condition is not met, the limit 
is 15 years of age.  Children under 16 may not work overtime. 
 Children under 18 may not work at night. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
      1.  Has the GOP developed a list of 
occupations considered to be the worst forms 
of child labor? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
-  In 2002, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) fully funded a 
$1 million program with the International Labor 
Organization/International Programme on the Elimination of 
Child Labor (ILO/IPEC) to work with the GOP to create a 
Country Program to Combat Child Labor and to define the worst 
forms of child labor in Panama.  The program aims to remove 
1,000 children from the worst forms of child labor by the 
program\'s end in December 2005. 
 
 
-  Through the program, the Ministry of Labor\'s Committee for 
the Eradication of Child Labor and ILO/IPEC have organized a 
series of workshops to create the Country Program to Combat 
the Worst Forms of Child Labor.  Also, ILO/IPEC and the 
Ministry of Labor\'s National Labor Inspection Directorate 
have conducted consultative seminars to identify the Worst 
Forms of Child Labor in Panama in two provinces.  ILO/IPEC 
believes the GOP will have finished the consultative process 
and have identified the worst forms of Child Labor by 
December 2004. 
 
 
-  The Inspection Directorate and ILO/IPEC have also studied 
child domestic labor in Panama, child commercial sexual 
exploitation in Panama, and child labor in the coffee 
industry in Panama.  The Inspection Directorate and ILO/IPEC 
have analyzed the results of a 2000 survey on Child Labor 
conducted by the GOP Statistics Office.  The GOP is also 
studying child labor in car washes in Panama. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
B.  Does Panama have adequate laws 
and regulations for the implementation 
and enforcement of such measures? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
-  Businesses that employ underage children or violate in 
other ways the laws regarding employment of minors can face a 
$50 - $700 fine. 
 
 
-  If a child\'s work is found to be abusive (defined as any 
activity that may affect the physical or mental health of a 
child), the employer may face a two-to-six year prison 
sentence. 
 
 
-  Children over 12 are permitted to do light work as 
household servants only if the Ministry of Labor authorizes 
the work and the work is done outside of school hours.  Many 
employers are not aware of this provision and children often 
work as household servants without permission. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
      1.  Have there have been any recent 
governmental or judicial initiatives to 
strengthen or enforce child labor legislation 
and regulations? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
-  On March 31, 2004, the GOP enacted Law 16 to strengthen 
proscriptions against child sexual exploitation by 
criminalizing and/or increasing penalties for (a) corruption 
of minors; (b) pimping; (c) maintaining sexual relations with 
a child; (d) paying minors for sex; (e) use, exhibition, or 
distribution of pornography containing minors (including 
internet porn); (f) internet sexual predation; (g) showing 
pornography to children; and (h) promotion of sex tourism 
that includes minors. 
 
 
-  Law 16 contains several important measures to increase 
enforcement of these proscriptions.  First, it eliminates the 
need for a formal complaint before the police and 
prosecutor\'s office can investigate sex crimes.  Under 
certain circumstances, the law also permits undercover 
operations and phone and computer wiretapping in sex crimes 
cases.  In addition, the law delays the running of the 
statute of limitations in cases of sex crimes against minors 
until the victim is an adult.  Finally, the law eliminates 
bail in sex crime cases in which a minor is a victim. 
 
 
-  The new law also creates and imposes taxes to fund the 
National Commission for the Prevention of Sex Crimes and 
Sexual Exploitation (CONAPREDES).  CONAPREDES studies the 
mechanisms for the prevention and eradication of crimes of 
sexual exploitation and includes: 
 
 
      a.  The Attorney General; 
 
 
      b.  The Minister of Youth, Women, Family, and Children; 
 
 
      c.  The Minister of Government and Justice; 
 
 
      d.  The Minister of Economy and Finances; 
 
 
      e.  The Ministry of Education; 
 
 
      f.  The Ministry of Health; 
 
 
      g.  The President Judge of Juvenile Court; 
 
 
      h.  The President of the Commission of Women\'s Issues, 
Children\'s Rights, Youth, and Family of the Legislative 
Assembly; 
 
 
      i.  The Director of The Judicial Technical Police; 
 
 
      j.  A coordinator designated by the Executive; 
 
 
      l.  A representative of the Ombudsman\'s Office; 
 
 
      m.  A representative of the National Network of Youth 
and Children; 
 
 
      n.  A representative from the National Counsel of Youth 
and Adolescence; and 
 
 
      o.  A representative of the lawyers\' union. 
 
 
-  By executive decree on March 31, 2004, the Ministry of 
Government and Justice created a commission to make 
recommendations regarding the problem of Trafficking in 
Persons (TIP). 
 
 
-  By executive decree on September 24, 2003, the Ministry of 
Labor created the Network of Security and Health Against 
Unhealthy and Dangerous Child Labor to increase government 
coordination and compliance with norms against child labor. 
The network includes: 
 
 
      a.  Ministry of Labor; 
 
 
      b.  The Ministry of Health; 
 
 
      c.  The Ministry of Education; 
 
 
      d.  The Ministry of Youth, Children, Women, and Family; 
 
 
      e.  Social Security; 
 
 
      f.  Council of Health, Security and the Environment of 
Panama; 
 
 
      g.  The Panama Canal Authority; 
 
 
      h.  Panama Fire Department; 
 
 
      i.  National System of Civil Protection; 
 
 
      j.  National Police; 
 
 
      k.  Maritime Authority; 
 
 
      l.  Legislative Assembly; and 
 
 
      m.  an institute, a foundation, and two universities. 
 
 
-  In March 2004, the GOP (with ILO/IPEC and the Canadian 
government) created the first regional Subcommittee to 
Eradicate Child Labor in the Province of Veraguas.  According 
to an ILO/OIT technical report, through the Subcommittee nine 
girls have been retired from domestic (household servant) 
labor, three inserted in formal education, and five in 
informal education.  In addition, the Subcommittee discovered 
recruiters who were charging at least $10-$20 per head to 
find young girls for domestic work in Panama City and other 
parts of the country, sometimes in conditions of near 
slavery.  Generally, the girl would need to pay the money 
herself, often through a deduction from her first two weeks 
of pay.  The Subcommittee worked with a local transportation 
company to deny service to girls brought by recruiters if the 
girls did not have a parental permission card and work 
authorization from the Ministry of Labor. 
 
 
-  The Technical Secretary of the Committee to Eradicate 
Child Labor conducted weekly meetings to coordinate programs 
during harvest time. 
 
 
-  The GOP toured coffee plantations in Chiriqui Province. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
      2.  Has the GOP designated an 
authority to implement and enforce child 
labor laws and regulations? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
-  The Ministry of Labor\'s National Labor Inspection 
Directorate has the responsibility, along with its Ministry 
of Labor\'s Child Labor Unit, of enforcing all the laws in 
Panama\'s Labor Code and Family Code, as well as ILO 
Conventions 138 and 182.  The Child Labor Unit is charged 
with conducting inspections; informing employers, parents, 
and children who solicit work permits of their rights and 
responsibilities; soliciting sanctions from the Inspection 
Directorate; coordinating with the Ministry of Youth, Women, 
Children, and Family in child labor cases; and collaborating 
and participating in studies. 
 
 
-  The GOP also uses or gives authority to the Committee for 
the Eradication of Child Labor and the Protection of Child 
Workers, the Network of Security and Health Against Unhealthy 
and Dangerous Child Labor, the Technical Judicial Police\'s 
Sex Crime Unit, and the Public Ministry\'s Sex Crimes 
Prosecutor\'s Office. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
      3.  What are the mechanisms for receiving, 
investigating, and addressing child labor complaints? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
-  The Child Labor Unit of the National Labor Inspection 
Directorate investigates complaints and violations as follows: 
 
 
a.  A complaint is received, either from the child, a 
guardian, or other person involved. 
 
 
b.  The complaint is sent to the Labor Inspector to determine 
if any laws have been broken. 
 
 
c.  If a law has been broken, the Labor Inspector makes 
recommendations to fix the problem. 
 
 
d.  A follow-up investigation is performed to determine if 
the recommendations were implemented. 
e.  If not, the Inspector turns the case over to the 
judiciary for action. 
 
 
-  The Child Labor Unit has a hotline for complaints. 
According to ILO/IPEC, the Child Labor Unit accomplishes its 
job under difficult conditions, since the Child Labor Office 
lacks privacy and the interviewer needs to ask others to 
leave in order to take a complaint. 
 
 
-  The GOP is working with ILO/IPEC to create a procedures 
manual for cases involving child household servant labor 
because, among other complicating factors, the cases involve 
personal residences. 
 
 
- With respect to commercial sexual exploitation of children, 
The Technical Judicial Police\'s Sex Crimes Unit receives 
complaints.  The Sex Crimes Unit has social workers and 
psychologists who interview minors.  Under the new Law 16 
(see above), the GOP can conduct its own investigations 
without receiving a formal complaint.  If a complaint is made 
or an individual is charged, the Public Ministry\'s Sex Crimes 
Prosecutor coordinates the case.  In sexual abuse cases, 
minors are also interviewed by a psychologist and a 
psychiatrist at the GOP\'s Forensic Center.  The Forensic 
Center lacks a separate victims reception area, so victims 
wait in the same room with criminals sent for examinations. 
If the psychologist or psychiatrist determines that a minor 
is medically unable to continue being questioned, the 
Prosecutor cannot talk to the victim.  The case can still be 
prosecuted based on the evidence already collected, including 
the examinations by social workers, psychologists, and 
psychiatrists. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
      4.  What level of resources does the GOP 
devote to investigating exploitative 
child labor cases throughout the country? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
            a. Technical and Human Resources: 
 
 
-  The Child Labor Unit has an interdisciplinary team 
composed of three social workers, one psychologist, and three 
child labor inspectors.  The Child Labor Unit also has the 
help of 10-15 inspectors from other departments for raids in 
the urban and rural areas. 
 
 
            b. Information Resources: 
 
 
-  The Child Labor Unit has two computers, two printers, one 
telephone line, and one internet line.  The Unit also has an 
additional computer that is used to maintain a child labor 
database for Panama.  The Unit has many books about child 
labor, legislation, statistics, and national and regional 
action plans. 
 
 
            c.  Economic Resources: 
 
 
-  The GOP funds inspection trips to potential and probable 
child labor areas within Panama and the monthly salaries of 
inspectors, social workers, psychologist, secretaries, and 
statistic technicians. 
 
 
-  Of the $599,659 that the Government of Panama estimates as 
its contribution of the Country Program to Eradicate Child 
Labor (the ILO/IPEC Program funded through DOL discussed 
above), approximately $173,901 are budgeted for direct action 
programs, which include investigation and development of 1000 
cases of the most dangerous forms of child labor. 
 
 
-  According to ILO/IPEC, the Technical Judicial Police and 
the Public Ministry spends approximately $8,000-$10,000 per 
month on the investigation of sexual exploitation cases in 
general. 
 
 
-  According to ILO/IPEC, the Technical Judicial Police 
estimates that the GOP\'s program to implement Law 16 (see 
above) by investigating commercial sex crimes (both child and 
adult) will cost $958,690.  This program is not yet funded. 
 
 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
      5.  How many child labor inspections 
are conducted annually in Panama? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
-  From October 2003 to May 2004, the Child Labor Unit 
conducted 130 routine inspections of children working, 
interviewed 418 minors, reviewed 356 requests for work 
authorizatioon, and granted 89 requests for work 
authorization. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
      6.    How many inspections have resulted in 
fines, penalties, or convictions in Panama? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
-  The GOP\'s penalty regime for child labor is directed at 
the formal sector and fining businesses.  However, according 
to a 2003 analysis by ILO/IPEC of the GOP Statistics Office\'s 
2000 Survey of Child Labor, more than half of the children 
and adolescents employed in Panama are employed in the 
informal or semi-formal sectors. 
 
 
-  In the half year period from September 2003 to February 
2003, the Child Labor Unit requested penalties from the 
Inspection Directorate against five businesses for child 
labor violations.  The Inspection Directorate fined two of 
the businesses and dismissed the other two cases for lack of 
documentation. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
      7.    Has the GOP provided awareness raising 
and/or training activities for government 
officials in charge of enforcing child labor laws? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
-  The GOP has trained its personnel in the following 
subjects through forums, workshops, classes, meetings, and 
conferences: 
 
 
a.  Domestic child workers from the perspective of different 
churches; 
 
 
b.  Treatment of child victims of sexual exploitation; 
 
 
c.  Second Report regarding the Implementation of the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child before the National 
Committee of Children\'s Rights; 
 
 
d.  Creation of the Network of Security and Health in 
Dangerous Child Work in Latin America (regional); 
 
 
e.  Child Domestic Work (11 sensitivity workshops); 
 
 
f.  Creation of the Network for Security and Health in 
Dangerous Child Work; 
 
 
g.  Child commercial sexual exploitation (four sensitivity 
workshops); 
 
 
h.  Progressive elimination of child labor in Panama; 
 
 
i.  National Legislation related to child domestic work with 
ILO/IPEC, the Ombudsman\'s Office, and the Ministry of Labor; 
 
 
j.  Intervention in Child Commercial Sexual Exploitation with 
ILO/IPEC and the Ministry of Youth, Women, Children, and 
Family; 
 
 
k.  Study with ILO/IPEC regarding child packers in 
supermarkets and meeting with supermarket management; 
 
 
l.  Child Labor in its Worst Forms; and 
 
 
m.  Coffee growers and indigenous comarcal authorities 
(meetings). 
 
 
 
 
-  The judiciary, the Public Ministry, the National Police, 
and the Ministry of Labor have participated in the above 
training. 
 
 
-  The GOP has also been training the National Technical 
Police, the Public Ministry, The Judiciary, the Ministry of 
Youth, Women, Children, and the Family, the Ministry of 
Health, the Ministry of Education, and non-governmental 
organizations in the new Law 16 (see above) regarding child 
sexual exploitation.  In July 2004, the GOP, with assistance 
from the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Inspection 
and ILO/IPEC, conducted two, week-long training programs for 
the Judicial Technical Police in child sexual exploitation. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
C.  Do social programs exist in Panama to 
prevent the engagement of children in the worst 
forms of child labor and to assist in the removal 
of children engaged in the worst forms of child 
labor? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
-  The Ministry of Youth, Women, Children, and Family 
maintains training and assistance centers for children living 
in urban and rural areas.  The centers provide health care, 
educational opportunities, and vocational and social skills 
training to children and their families in an effort to 
prevent child labor. 
 
 
-  The Ministry of Education conducts a program for youth in 
the provinces of Panama and Colon called, In Search of a 
Better Tomorrow, which aims to encourage children to finish 
primary school. 
 
 
- The NGO Casa Esperanza, which receives about 3% of its 
budget from the GOP, contacted 1,344 children and adolescent 
workers in the provinces of Panama, Colon, Cocle and Chiriqui 
in 2003.  In August 2004, Casa Esperanza announced that 
during the past four years, it had retired 1,000 children 
under the age of 14 from work in 13 different coffee 
plantations. 
 
 
- The Subcommittee for Eradication of Child Labor in Veraguas 
removed nine children from domestic work between March and 
July 2004 (see above). 
 
 
- Primary schooling is widely available in Panama.  Primary 
schools can usually be found even in small, remote villages. 
 
 
- School is compulsory for all children through grade 6 and 
available publicly through grade 12. 
 
 
- Primary and secondary education in Panama is free, but many 
rural areas do not have access to secondary education, and 
the GOP does not cover transportation costs. 
 
 
-  In 2003, according to the GOP Statistics Office, 419,903 
students enrolled in primary school in Panama.  413,067 
finished the school year. 
 
 
-  As part of the Country Program to Eliminate Child Labor 
(see above), in 2004 ILO/IPEC surveyed 515 child and 
adolescent workers not employed as domestics in two urban 
areas of Panama.  Only 391 (70.1%) of the surveyed attend 
school.  Girls attended at a higher level than boys.  For 
5-14 year olds, 13.7% did not attend school.  47.7% of boys 
and 62.5% of girls between the ages of 15-17 did not attend 
school.  Approximately one half of the children and 
adolescents surveyed stated that they worked all day, 
suggesting that they worked full time and went to school 
simultaneously. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
D.  Does Panama have a comprehensive policy to 
eliminate of the worst forms of child labor? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
-  Through the Country Program for Combating the Worst Forms 
of Child Labor in Panama (funded by USDOL), the GOP is 
working to create a program document and to identify the 
worst forms of child labor.  ILO/IPEC expects the GOP will 
have identified the worst forms of child labor by December 
2004, even accounting for delays because of the change in 
government on September 1. 
 
 
-  The GOP\'s policy to eliminate child labor includes not 
just the Ministry of Labor, but also the Ministry of 
Education; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Youth, 
Women, Family, and Children; the Technical Judicial Police\'s 
Sex Crimes Unit; the Public Ministry\'s Sex Crime Prosecutor; 
other ministries; a national commission; a national network; 
a national committee; churches; and nonprofit organizations. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
E.  Is Panama making continual progress toward 
eliminating the worst forms of child labor? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
-  The child labor situation in Panama includes commercial 
sexual exploitation, agricultural labor, child labor as 
domestics, and urban work by grocery car washers, grocery 
baggers, and bus assistants. 
 
 
-  A survey of Child Labor by the GOP Statistics Office in 
October 2000, indicated that 7.6% (57,524) of children 
between the ages of 5 and 17 are economically active with 
83.4% of them employed and 16.6% of them unemployed.  Of 
those employed, 76.8% were boys and 23.1% were girls. 
 
 
-  As discussed above, in 2004 the GOP made progress toward 
eliminating the worst forms of child labor through its work 
with ILO/IPEC to begin identifying the worst forms of child 
labor; by enacting Law 16 on March 31, 2004 and training the 
Technical Judicial Police and other agencies in this law; by 
creating the Subcommittee for the Eradication of Child labor 
in Veraguas province to combat child labor as domestics; and 
by studying the problem of child labor in two urban areas. 
 
 
-  The GOP supported DOL efforts to begin a Child Labor 
Education Initiative Program in Panama in the agricultural 
sector.  An NGO, partially funded by the GOP, continued to 
remove children from agricultural labor.  The Ministry of 
Youth, Women, Family, and Children maintained its training 
and assistance centers.

Classified By: DCM Christopher J. McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Late on August 25, outgoing President Mireya 
Moscoso signed an executive decree pardoning four anti-Castro 
Cuban prisoners -- Luis Posada Carriles and AmCits Gasper 
Jimenez, Guillermo Novo, and Pedro Remon (see Reftels) and 
163 others, as one of her final acts as president.  The GOP 
immediately transported the four Cubans to Tocumen Airport, 
where they departed on two chartered aircraft at 0650 August 
26.  The three AmCits arrived in Miami before noon.  The 
other prisoner, Posada Carriles, reportedly traveled to 
Honduras. 
 
 
2.  (U)  Panama recalled its ambassador in Havana on August 
23 and expelled the Cuban Ambassador on August 25.  Those 
actions followed a strongly worded August 22 Cuban 
communiqu, threatening an \"automatic\" rupture of diplomatic 
relations if Panama released the prisoners. 
 
 
3.  (C)  GOP sources stated that Moscoso made all decisions 
regarding the anti-Castro prisoners, only consulting a small 
circle that included Minister of Government and Justice 
Escalona and confidants including her sister First Lady Ruby 
Moscoso de Young and National Police Director Carlos Bares. 
Bares reportedly made all travel arrangements for the four 
prisoners. 
 
 
4.  (U)  The press and many commentators speculated that 
Mireya and Ruby Moscoso both received bribes from Cuban 
Americans in Miami.  Other speculation focused on Moscoso\'s 
alleged aim to curry favor in Miami and with USG officials, 
possibly as an insurance policy against visa revocation 
(under 212-f) for official corruption.  A lawyer linked to 
the incoming party claimed to have the name of the European 
bank where the millions of dollars in bribes would be 
deposited. 
 
 
5.  (C)  Incoming Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro told 
Ambassador August 26 that he had no prior notice of the 
pardons, which he said \"interrupted the judicial process.\" 
He added that the Torrijos administration would try to repair 
relations with Cuba.  President-elect Torrijos stated 
publicly August 25 that he would restore any break in 
diplomatic relations with Cuba. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Also on August 26, Colon governor Gassan Salama 
resigned in protest of Moscoso\'s pardons.  Although a member 
of Moscoso\'s party, the governor reportedly accused Moscoso 
of  keeping common people in prison but freeing \"terrorists.\" 
 (Comment: Other critics have called attention to Moscoso\'s 
ongoing \"Mano Dura\" operations, which involve police sweeps 
through poor neighborhoods.  Cuba also has $250 million in 
arrears in the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), which has worried some 
CFZ proprietors who fear the rupture could further complicate 
their efforts to collect their Cuban debts.  End Comment.) 
 
 
 
 
7.  (U)  On August 26, two groups of University of Panama 
students demonstrated peacefully against the pardons more 
than a mile from the Embassy.  A group of 200 students 
blocked four lanes of traffic on the Transistmica Highway and 
another group blocked traffic in the neighborhood of Curundu. 
 
 
 
 
8.  (U)  Moscoso stated publicly that she released the 
prisoners for \"humanitarian\" reasons, implying that the 
incoming Torrijos administration would extradite them to 
Venezuela or Cuba, where they would be executed.  Moscoso 
called the August 22 Cuban note \"insulting,\" although she 
added that was not a reason for her decision. 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  Moscoso\'s pardon also included prominent 
newspaperman Roberto Eisenmann, and many other prominent 
Panamanian journalists, who had been accused under Panama\'s 
dictatorship-legacy libel and slander laws. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (C)  Speculation abounds as to Moscoso\'s motives in 
pardoning the four anti-Castro Cubans.  Both Moscoso and her 
sister have strong ties in Miami, where they own real estate 
and spend a considerable amount of time.  Coming at the end 
of her term in office, the pardons cause few problems for 
Moscoso but leave a mess for the incoming Torrijos 
government, whose Democratic Revolutionary Party historically 
has had stronger ties to Cuba.  Even incoming FM-designate 
Lewis told Emboff that the language of Cuba\'s August 22 note 
shocked him, and Mireya has taken advantage of that insult to 
Panamanian honor to act the staunch Panamanian patriot. 
Also, by pardoning the Cubans and the journalists 
simultaneously, Moscoso somewhat softened the shock of 
pardoning convicted felons, while responding to what her 
critics have called her hypersensitivity to press criticism. 
The Colon governor\'s resignation and the recall of Panama\'s 
ambassador to Cuba will also cost them little because they 
both would have left office along with Moscoso on September 
1.  The controversy will likely be aired by the press during 
Secretary Powell\'s visit to the inauguration, especially 
 
SIPDIS 
because Cuba has accused the Secretary of requesting the 
release.  (See Reftel A).

1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Summary.  While Panama\'s remote and 
economically-underdeveloped Darien Region remains vulnerable 
to incursions by paramilitary groups and drug traffickers 
from Colombia, the region\'s security under Panama\'s outgoing 
Moscoso administration has improved.  Over the past two 
years, the GOP increased the Panamanian National Police (PNP) 
presence in the region, especially along the Colombian 
border, improved PNP training, and instituted better 
communication with its Colombian counterparts.  However, few 
measures have been taken to protect the region against 
environmental degradation and to promote sustainable 
development.  Embassy Panama has created a two-pronged 
strategy predicated primarily upon continued USG security 
assistance and sustainable community development programs. 
Our engagement strategy with the Torrijos administration, 
which took office on Sept. 1, will promote this approach to 
developing the Darien Region.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
The Darien Region: Ethnically Diverse Yet Isolated 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
3. (SBU) The Darien region is approximately three-fourths the 
size of Connecticut (16,671 square miles) and is composed of 
the Darien Province and the Comarca Embera-Wounaan (an 
indigenous reservation).  Its estimated population of nearly 
50,000 is comprised of three ethnic groups: Afro-Darienitas 
and Afro-Chocoanos (16%), Indigenous (34%), and 
Colonos/campesinos that migrated from central and western 
Panama (50%).  The region is densely forested, extremely 
isolated, and sparsely populated.  The region\'s Pan-American 
highway, constructed in 1972, helped to bring some 
modernization to the region; however, the road ends at 
Yaviza, 30 miles from the Colombian border, and the last 50 
miles are dirt and gravel.  This road is often impassable 
during Panama\'s rainy season (mid-March to mid-November). 
The Panamanian and Colombian governments continue to discuss 
the feasibility of completing the road link between the two 
countries, although no formal agreement has been reached.  In 
October 2003, Panama and Colombia approved a 250-mile 
electric power interconnection, pending completion of 
feasibility and environmental impact studies.  It is still 
undetermined whether the cable would run under sea or on 
land.  The project is expected to come online in 2007.  The 
region is Panama\'s main national timber supplier.  Other 
natural resources within the region include biological 
diversity and fishing resources.  However, rapid population 
growth, expanding \"slash and burn\" agriculture and ranching, 
and illegal logging threaten the future of the region. 
 
 
----------------------- 
USG Security Assistance 
----------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Our security efforts, funded primarily through DOD 
and State programs, have  focused upon providing training and 
equipment to the PNP in order to improve its mobility, 
communications, and small unit tactics.  The Embassy\'s 
offices of Defense Cooperation (ODC) and Narcotics Affairs 
(NAS) provide the bulk of USG security assistance.  ODC 
trains PNP border units and, in coordination with NAS, 
sponsored police small boat units, improving the GOP\'s 
ability to patrol inland and coastal waterways.  Between USD 
1.5 and 2 million of NAS\'s total USD 6.5 million budget for 
FY 2004 will go to programs devoted to the Darien province. 
These programs are aimed at helping enhance border security. 
NAS has provided trucks and boats to help improve GOP 
mobility.  NAS primarily coordinates with the PNP, Panama\'s 
National Maritime Service (SMN) and National Air Service 
(SAN).  NAS is also working on a communications upgrade 
project to better internal communications within Panama by 
improving interoperability between Panama\'s Public Forces 
(PPF) and to improve HF and VHF networks of the PNP and the 
SMN.  In addition, NAS recently hired a Personal Services 
Contractor Counter Narcotics Advisor to coordinate NAS 
activities in the region. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Sustainable Community Development Programs 
------------------------------------------ 
5. (U) As the security situation in the region continues to 
improve, our efforts continue to expand into programs aimed 
at improving the productive and social infrastructure of 
Darien communities while conserving local resources and the 
environment.  The USAID Community Development Program in the 
Darien works to improve the organization and access of 
indigenous communities to the forest resources in the Darien 
as well as to implement sustainable forest management and 
trade activities.  Peace Corps Volunteers focus on economic 
development, environmental conservation, and environmental 
health.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) operates a successful 
foot and mouth disease control project and screwworm 
eradication program in the area. 
 
 
6. (U) USAID selected 55 communities, comprised of 28 
indigenous groups (23 Embera, 4 Wounaans, and 1 Kuna group), 
20 campesino groups, and 7 afro groups, to implement its 
Community Development Program for the Darien in 2003.  This 
three-year, USD 6.0 million program benefits 20,599 people, 
or approximately one-third of the Darien\'s total population 
(7,447 campesinos, 5,782 afros, and 7,370 indigenous).  The 
integrated program includes all themes necessary for 
successful sustainable forest management and trade: technical 
forestry, organizational and business development, 
production, markets and private sector relationships, and 
sales.  Program components include improving social 
infrastructures, strengthening local organizations, and 
developing productive infrastructures.  Social infrastructure 
projects include the construction of community centers with 
libraries, rural water systems using new technologies, 
latrines, transportation centers, and landfill and recycling 
centers. 
 
 
7. (U) USAID also provides technical assistance and training 
to beneficiary communities for the development of \"community 
strategies\" and planning and implementation of social and 
productive infrastructure projects.  These projects have been 
chosen by the communities and USAID emphasizes local 
management, self-help, and sustainability.  Finally, projects 
aimed at improving productive infrastructure include the 
construction of agricultural storage, processing, and 
packaging facilities, slaughterhouses, plant and tree 
nurseries, rice mills, and transportation centers.  Other 
activities include the promotion of eco-tourism (visitors\' 
centers, hiking trails, foot bridges, cultural center-dances, 
and handicrafts) and the rehabilitation of production roads. 
 
 
8. (U) Currently, the USAID Community Development Program for 
the Darien is in the stage of full field implementation. 
Twenty-nine infrastructure projects have been completed and 
delivered to the communities, two are under implementation 
and five are on hold because of the weather (Panama is 
currently in the \"rainy\" season causing the Pan-American 
highway to be frequently impassable).  Fifty-eight new 
projects have been identified and are in the approval 
process.  By the end of September, USAID Panama expects to 
have completed 40 community strategic plans.  The next step 
is to provide technical assistance to help these communities 
start designing their own projects and looking for alternate 
sources of funding. 
 
 
9. (U) The Peace Corps has significantly increased its 
presence over the past year in the Darien.  Currently, 12 
Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) serve in the region and Peace 
Corps plans to add four additional PCVs to the region in 
September 2004.  Over half of the PCVs work on environmental 
health projects that support the creation or maintenance of 
45 aqueducts in partnership with Panama\'s Ministry of Health 
(MOH) and small U.S.-based NGOs.  PCVs also work to support 
USAID\'s Community Development Program for the Darien. 
Presently, security concerns limit the placement of 
volunteers from the Panama Este border to Meteti; however, 
Peace Corps hopes to place PCVs further south and west as the 
security situation improves. 
 
 
------------ 
A Look Ahead 
------------ 
 
 
10. (SBU) Comment. We believe this strategy is appropriate 
for the Darien region as it addresses the current security 
situation and should improve the region\'s longer term 
capacity for self-sustainability.  As we begin to build a 
partnership with the incoming Torrijos Administration, we 
plan to encourage the GOP to find the Darien\'s competitive 
advantage and apply a rational use of natural resources to 
help develop the region.  Embassy Panama will also educate 
new GOP leaders of the dangers of environmental abuse and 
encourage the GOP to adopt systems for environmental permits 
and land titling.  We also will continue to promote interest 
in the Darien by international organizations.  End Comment.

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
1.  (C) With a new, more PRC-friendly Panama government in 
office on September 1, the question of whether newly 
inaugurated President Martin Torrijos might drop Panama\'s 
long-standing diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China 
(Taiwan) in favor of the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) 
continues to simmer.  Taiwan, Panama, and the PRC all agree 
that Panama is Taiwan\'s most important formal diplomatic 
relationship, and the PRC would like to pluck it out of 
Taiwan\'s grasp (Ref B).  Panama has deftly leveraged its 
relations with both sides to extract maximum resources, in 
particular from Taiwan.  As a modernizing Panamanian 
government (GOP) with a heavy economic agenda that includes 
expanding the Panama Canal takes power, Panama will 
increasingly see PRC-vs.-Taiwan through the prism of its 
global interests, which include Canal traffic, shipping, 
container ports, trade, and investment, all areas where the 
PRC is becoming increasingly prominent. 
 
 
2.  (C) The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) of President 
Torrijos (who took office on September 1) is closer 
historically to the PRC than the Arnulfista Party of outgoing 
President Mireya Moscoso.  Torrijos and his team have sent 
mixed messages on PRC-vs.-Taiwan, sometimes seeming to lean 
toward the PRC (saying that he would \"reevaluate\" PRC-Taiwan 
relations), then backtracking and leaning the other way 
(saying that he has no intention of changing relations). 
Despite showing clear interest in the issue, Torrijos has not 
signaled that he actually is considering derecognizing 
Taiwan.  Also, the incoming foreign minister has assured that 
he will consult the Embassy if and when serious internal 
discussions on PRC-vs.-Taiwan take place.  The Embassy\'s 
bottom line has not changed: We do not expect Panama to 
derecognize Taiwan in the near future.  (See Reftel C.)  In 
the medium term (during the 2004-2009 Torrijos 
administration), we only would expect Panama to derecognize 
Taiwan if Panama\'s cost/benefit analysis of PRC-vs.-Taiwan 
relations also changes.  For now, the calculus still favors 
Taiwan.  This message will analyze the issue and report 
recent Embassy meetings with the main players.  End 
Introduction. 
 
 
June 2004 Visit of PRC Vice FM Zhou Accomplishes Little 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
3.  (C) PRC Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong\'s June 18, 
2004 pre-Presidential-inauguration visit to Panama was 
disappointing from the PRC perspective, apparently 
accomplishing little besides raising speculation.  In a 
recent meeting, China-Panama Commercial Development 
Representative Yang Fajin told PolCouns that Zhou got 
noncommittal responses from the Torrijos inner circle on his 
pitch to derecognize Taiwan and was denied access to top GOP 
policy makers. 
 
 
4.  (C) Torrijos and Foreign Minister-designate Lewis both 
refused to meet with VFM Zhou, Yang said.  Instead, Zhou met 
with (now Minister of the Presidency) Ubaldino Real (former 
foreign minister Jorge Ritter and former Torrijos campaign 
manager (and first cousin) Hugo Torrijos also may have been 
present).  With the Panamanians in listening mode, Zhou told 
them that the PRC wants to establish formal diplomatic 
relations with Panama, if Panama will cut all official 
contacts with Taiwan, although Panama could still maintain 
\"civil\" relations with Taiwan.  Zhou also suggested that 
formal Panama-PRC relations would bring increased economic 
cooperation. 
 
 
5.  (C) In response to a question from PolCouns, Yang denied 
reports that the PRC was willing to assist Panama with Canal 
expansion but emphasized recent newspaper reporting that 
Taiwan would provide Panama US$ 7 billion in private and 
government financing for Canal expansion.  Yang added that 
Vice FM Minister Zhou met with 22 members of the local 
Chinese expatriate community to discuss the peaceful 
reunification of China.   (Comment: Reports about the PRC\'s 
willingness and deep pockets to finance Canal expansion 
appeared in the Panama press last March, during the 
presidential election campaign.  End Comment.) 
 
 
PRC Vice FM Zhou Meets Minister Jacome 
-------------------------------------- 
6.  (C) If anything, Zhou\'s interaction with the Moscoso 
government was even less satisfying.  Yang\'s negotiations 
with then-Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias only yielded a 
meeting for Zhou with then-Minister of Commerce and 
Industries Joaquin Jacome -- but as Zhou only wanted to talk 
politics, Jacome replied that was not his area of competence 
and expertise but promised to forward Zhou\'s comments to 
President Moscoso. 
 
 
7.  (C) According to Yang, the 20-minute Zhou-Jacome meeting 
was a one-way tirade of complaints about the Moscoso 
government\'s \"poor treatment\" of the PRC.  Zhou criticized 
the Moscoso administration for failing to invite Yang to 
official events in Panama and for shunning PRC-hosted 
functions, such as China national day celebrations. 
Reminding Jacome that PRC officials regularly attend events 
hosted by Panama\'s \"unofficial\" representatives in Beijing, 
Zhou blamed Panamanian former Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Nivia Rossana Castrellon for enacting and enforcing 
the Moscoso government\'s \"anti-PRC\" policy.  Zhou also 
complained that Panama was denying visa applications of PRC 
citizens unless the applicants already had U.S. visas in 
their passports, which he blamed on Taiwan pressure on 
President Moscoso. 
 
 
Will Relations Hinge on Chen Shui-bian\'s Visit? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8.  (C) Yang believes that President-elect Martin Torrijos 
has not yet decided anything about PRC-vs.-Taiwan and is 
waiting to see what kind of inducement package Taiwan 
President Chen Shui-bian may offer during his August 
31-September 1 visit to Panama\'s September 1, 2004 
inauguration.  Yang noted that an August 13 La Prensa story 
reported that President-elect Torrijos had announced the 
formation of a Panama-Taiwan working group to study Taiwan\'s 
interest in investing in Canal expansion and \"alternative 
financing\" options. 
 
 
9.  (C) Yang added that the Taiwan Ambassador and his staff 
in Panama are politically linked to Taiwan\'s former 
Guomintang government and may not enjoy close relations with 
the present government in Taipei.  The PRC has no plans for 
ministerial visits in the near future, Yang continued, but 
PRC commercial delegations will continue to come to Panama. 
Yang added that the PRC government is encouraging Chinese to 
invest overseas, adding that Panama is a location of much 
interest.  According to Yang, President Torrijos has visited 
the PRC twice, but not since the mid-1980s. 
 
 
A \"Non-Substantive\" Meeting 
--------------------------- 
10.  (C) Samuel Lewis Navarro, now Foreign Minister, 
corroborated much of Yang\'s account, in a recent meeting with 
PolCouns.  Lewis described Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou\'s 
June 18 meeting with Ubaldino Real as \"non-substantive\" and 
sought to downplay its importance.  \"He\'s the same as the 
other Chinese who come through here.  They always say the 
same thing: \'You\'re on the wrong side of the issue.\'  They 
want to intensify relations,\" he explained.  Prior to 
Panama\'s May 2, 2004 national elections, Lewis continued, 
Martin Torrijos said there is no reason to change our 
relations with Taiwan, \"and that was it.\" 
 
 
No Plans, No Discussions... 
--------------------------- 
11.  (C) Lewis insisted that Panama has no plans, imminent or 
otherwise, to alter its current formal diplomatic 
relationship with Taiwan in favor of China, adding that the 
Torrijos team had not yet held any discussions on the matter. 
 He assured PolCouns that the United States is Panama\'s most 
important foreign relationship and that his government would 
consult closely with the Embassy if discussions on China and 
Taiwan take place.  (Comment: Lewis\'s denial of \"internal 
discussions\" somewhat contradicts his June 30 query to the 
Ambassador asking for U.S. views on such a change.  See 
Reftel C.  End Comment.) 
 
 
But Lots of Pressure... and \"Shrinkage\" 
--------------------------------------- 
12.  (C) Asked whether Panama is one of Taiwan\'s most 
important diplomatic relationships, Lewis said he thought it 
is the most important one.  Both sides had placed a lot of 
pressure on the Torrijos team, Lewis said.  He added that 
some of Taiwan\'s methods made him uncomfortable, implying 
that Taiwan had made some \"non-transparent\" offers. 
 
 
13.  (C) In a separate meeting with Ambassador, Lewis claimed 
Taiwan had given US$ 75 million in official and non-official 
contributions to Panama during the Moscoso administration and 
noted that significant \"shrinkage\" had occurred.  Lewis 
recounted that at a recent meeting he had attended with 
then-First Lady Ruby Moscoso (President Moscoso\'s sister) and 
Taiwan Ambassador David Hu, Amb. Hu had vocally insisted 
several times that the funds that Taiwan had donated to the 
Office of the First Lady must remain after Ruby Moscoso 
departs.  Apparently Ruby Moscoso wanted to keep those funds 
for her private foundation, Lewis explained, while in-coming 
First Lady Vivian Torrijos equally wanted to ensure that the 
funds remained available for her use after September 1. 
 
 
Taiwan Ambassador Clams Up 
-------------------------- 
14.  (C) In a separate meeting with PolCouns, Taiwan 
Ambassador David Hu apparently was unwilling to reveal 
anything of substance.  He called the formation of a 
Panama-Taiwan Canal Working Group \"a fiction\" and cast doubt 
on Taiwan\'s intention to help finance Canal expansion.  (See 
para 16.)  Besides confirming that a Chen-Torrijos meeting 
would take place, Hu claimed to know nothing about President 
Chen\'s plans for discussions with the Torrijos government. 
Also, Hu denied that Panama was Taiwan\'s most important 
formal diplomatic relationship, saying all the Central 
American countries that recognize Taiwan are equal.  (Note: 
Taiwan\'s embassy in Panama has 13 officers, Hu said, and 
15-16 Taiwanese technical cooperation volunteers working in 
Panama.  End note.)  Hu betrayed some uneasiness about the 
incoming PRD government, trying to paint it as having 
\"socialist\" sympathies and organization.  (Note: The PRC\'s 
Commercial Development Office in Panama was established under 
the 1994-1999 PRD administration of Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
 End note.) 
 
 
15.  (C) Hu called relations with Panama \"excellent\" and 
cooperation \"marvelous,\" though he acknowledged that his 
Embassy traditionally had had little contact with the PRD, 
Panama\'s new ruling party.  He noted that many countries 
(including France, China, and Brazil) have interests in the 
Canal but suggested that the PRC would seek to increase its 
\"influence\" in the Panamanian government (GOP).  Hu doubted 
the PRC government had the ability to support expanding the 
Canal or that was prepared to offer significant sums to aid 
Panama in financing Canal expansion.  The new Torrijos 
government will be occupied with economic issues, Hu said. 
(Comment: In a later meeting with PolCouns, 
Chinese-Panamanian Cultural Center President Jose Chong-Hon 
suggested that Ambassador Hu is reluctant to share 
information with U.S. officials because the lack of 
diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan.  For 
instance, Chong-Hon affirmed the existence of the bilateral 
working group.  End Comment.) 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
16.  (C) Successive Panamanian governments skillfully have 
used the carrot and stick of diplomatic recognition to 
extract maximum resources from both sides of the Taiwan 
straits.  (See Reftels D and E.)  The GOP is aware that it 
will lose the ability to play one side off against the other 
if it derecognizes Taiwan.  Despite the recent conclusion of 
a Panama-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement, some observers believe 
Panama may derecognize Taiwan due to burgeoning PRC-Panama 
commercial relations but others disagree.  The skeptics point 
out that PRC trade with the eastern U.S. seaboard has no 
alternative to using the Panama Canal, whatever Panama\'s 
diplomatic orientation.  Also, they dismiss suggestions that 
lack of formal relations with Panama would deter serious PRC 
investors and point out that a Hong Kong company (Hutchinson 
Whampoa) already owns 51% of two of Panama\'s large container 
ports.  According to Yang, the primary obstacle to PRC 
investment in Panama is the PRC\'s ban on investment by 
Chinese state-owned enterprises in countries which have 
relations with Taiwan. 
 
 
17.  (C) Panama has a large, widely dispersed ethnic Chinese 
population, estimated to comprise up to 5% of Panama\'s 3 
million people.  The local Chinese community traditionally is 
oriented toward Taiwan (increasingly because of Taiwan\'s 
democracy), but the community is politically inactive and 
probably would play a minimal role in any GOP decision to 
switch sides. 
 
 
18.  (C) PRC officials will find many more sympathetic ears 
in the new Torrijos government than under President Moscoso 
and may well be able to increase their influence and access. 
For instance, PRC Representative Yang noted that he has many 
influential Panamanian friends, who include: Hugo Giraud (now 
PRD Presdient), Juan Jose Amado (former ambassador to Japan 
and the U.S., former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and former 
Minister of Commerce and Industry), Marco Ameglio (Arnulfista 
legislator, former Assembly President, former Foreign 
Relations Commission President), and Arturo Vallarino 
(out-going First Vice President).

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) In a September 7 meeting with Foreign 
Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro, Ambassador Watt 
discussed the Secretary\'s recent visit to Panama 
and President Torrijos\' travel plans to the UN 
General Assembly in New York.  The Ambassador also 
discussed ways Panama could contribute to the 
corruption case of former Nicaraguan President 
Aleman, proposed Uighur resettlement, Panama\'s 
disrupted relations with Cuba and Venezuela, 
student visas, a U.S. Desk at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA), and Panama\'s opposition to 
whaling.  End Summary 
 
 
Secretary Powell\'s Visit 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------ 
2.  (SBU) Accompanied by acting DCM, the 
Ambassador congratulated Foreign Minister Lewis 
September 7 on Secretary Powell\'s successful 
September 1 visit to Panama and highlighted the 
Secretary\'s positive reaction to President 
 
SIPDIS 
Torrijos\' inaugural address.  She also shared the 
Secretary\'s impression of Panama\'s potential for 
 
SIPDIS 
achieving the goals -- pension reform, anti- 
corruption, economic growth, and Canal expansion) 
set out by President Torrijos.  Lewis shared the 
positive evaluation of the Secretary\'s visit and 
expressed appreciation for his attendance. 
 
 
Foreign Minister\'s Upcoming U.S. Travel 
--------------------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Lewis noted that 
President Torrijos and he would travel to New York 
for the U.N. General Assembly in September and 
they are planning to attend a reception hosted by 
President Bush.  Lewis added that he will be 
available for bilateral meetings in Washington if 
necessary, as he also plans to attend the 
swearing-in of Panama\'s new Permanent 
Representative to the OAS.  (NOTE: After the 
meeting, the Torrijos administration announced the 
appointment of former President Aristides Royo 
(1978-82) to the OAS seat.  END NOTE.) 
 
 
Torrijos Visit to Washington 
---------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) Recognizing that the U.S. Presidential 
election would present some complications, the 
Foreign Minister highlighted President Torrijos\' 
interest in an early visit to Washington to meet 
President Bush to discuss matters of mutual 
interest, such as Canal Expansion, investment 
opportunities, and political and security 
cooperation. 
 
 
Agrement Request 
---------------- 
5.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Lewis presented 
Panama\'s formal request for Agrement for 
Ambassador-designate Humbert, noting that this was 
the first agrement request made by the Torrijos 
government.  Ambassador Watt promised to forward 
the request to Washington and to process it as 
quickly as possible.  (see Reftel A.) 
 
 
Nicaraguan Ex-President Aleman Corruption Case 
--------------------------------------------- - 
6.  (C) The Ambassador followed up on A/S 
Noriega\'s discussions during the Secretary\'s visit 
and provided additional background material on the 
corruption case pending in Panama against 
Nicaraguan ex-President Aleman.  The Ambassador 
urged Panama to move forward with its case against 
Aleman, noting that it would send a strong signal 
of Panama\'s interest in fighting corruption. 
Lewis said that President Torrijos had already 
told him that he wanted to pursue the matter and 
do \"everything Panama could\" in that regard.  The 
Ambassador and Foreign Minister agreed that on the 
need to convince Attorney General Sossa to move 
ahead.  Foreign Minister Lewis added that the 
Torrijos Government was following closely a 
developing corruption case involving Costa Rica\'s 
former President and another case involving Banco 
Nacion, an Argentine-owned bank.  With regard to 
the latter, the Foreign Minister expressed his 
concern about corruption allegations involving 
Panama\'s judicial system, in particular the 
Supreme Court. 
 
 
Uighur Resettlement 
------------------- 
7.  (C) The Ambassador asked the Foreign Minister 
for an update on Panama\'s thinking regarding 
possible resettlement of Uighur detainees from 
Guantanamo Bay, which she had discussed with him 
previously.  The Foreign Minister candidly replied 
that it would be difficult for Panama to agree to 
accept those individuals given the lingering 
controversy over former President Moscoso\'s pardon 
of the four Cubans accused of plotting to 
assassinate Cuban President Castro.  He said that 
in his view accepting the Uighurs would not be 
good for either Panama or the U.S. at this time. 
He feared that resettlement of the Uighurs would 
be seen as incompatible with the strong stand 
against terrorism that had been expressed by the 
Torrijos government in the wake of those pardons. 
The Foreign Minister said he hoped the USG would 
understand that position.  (See Reftel B.) 
 
 
Relations with Cuba and Venezuela 
--------------------------------- 
8.  (C) The Foreign Minister noted that he would 
make no more public comments about re-establishing 
relations with Cuba in the wake of the pardons. 
He added that the Torrijos administration had done 
a good job of distancing itself and the USG from 
Moscoso\'s decision to pardon the four individuals. 
At the same time, relations with Venezuela were 
back on track, and Panama was preparing an 
agrement request for its Ambassador-designate to 
Caracas. 
 
 
Student Visas 
------------- 
9.  (SBU) The Ambassador encouraged Lewis to 
consider extending the validity of visas issued to 
American students in Panama.  Reciprocally, the 
USG would be able to consider extending visa 
validity for Panamanians studying in the U.S. 
Lewis, a Georgetown University grad whose son 
studies at Georgetown, said he had already begun 
working on this and would follow up with concerned 
GOP agencies.  The Ambassador and Foreign Minister 
agreed that it would be beneficial to increase the 
number of U.S. students in Panama. 
 
 
Central America Chief of Mission Meeting 
---------------------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) Lewis reiterated his and President 
Torrijos\' interest in meeting with participants in 
the upcoming CentAm Chiefs of Mission meeting.  He 
offered full cooperation in ensuring the success 
of the meeting. 
 
 
U.S. Desk at MFA 
---------------- 
11.  (SBU) Lewis said he would establish a United 
States Desk at the MFA, dedicated to responding to 
routine Embassy requests (such as diplomatic 
notes, extradition requests, etc.)  The Ambassador 
noted that she wanted to establish smooth working 
relationships between the Embassy and the Ministry 
but not overburden the Foreign Minister. 
 
 
Whaling Issue 
------------- 
12.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Lewis said that 
Panama\'s opposition to whale hunting was \"non- 
negotiable.\"  He cited it as an example of the 
need for consistency in Panama\'s foreign and 
domestic policy.  Since Panama is trying to 
encourage tourism in the Bay of Panama (a breeding 
ground for whales) it would be inconsistent to 
encourage/allow hunting. 
 
 
Relations with the Dominican Republic 
------------------------------------- 
13.  (SBU) Lewis said that the meetings between 
Torrijos officials and the Dominican Republic 
delegation at the September 1 inauguration had 
gone very well.  The Ambassador and Foreign 
Minister agreed that the two new governments 
shared similar challenges and also had much in 
common that could be a basis for collaboration. 
 
 
Parlacen 
-------- 
14.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Lewis told the 
Ambassador that Parlacen is ineffective and very 
expensive but contained \"all the vices\" for 
Panamanians, including immunity for former 
officials.  He said that other Central American 
countries were also critical of Parlacen, with the 
exception of El Salvador, which saw the body as 
providing space for the political opposition. 
While the Torrijos Administration would consider 
proposals to reform Parlacen, Lewis thought major 
changes during the next five years are unlikely. 
 
 
Challenges of New Government 
---------------------------- 
15.  (SBU) The Foreign Minister said that the 
Torrijos Administration is confronting the 
challenges of governing and the need to maintain 
fiscal discipline.  He estimated that the Moscoso 
government had added 50,000 government jobs in the 
past five years.  Within the Foreign Ministry 
alone, he estimated 25% of the payroll was in 
excess of requirements.  He vowed to cut those 
positions despite the political pressures to 
provide as many jobs as possible to party 
supporters. 
 
 
Priorities for U.S. Assistance 
------------------------------ 
16.  (C) In response to a question from the 
Ambassador, Lewis predicted that Minister of 
Government and Justice Hector Aleman would be a 
good friend to the U.S.  The Foreign Minister 
encouraged the Embassy to work closely with Aleman 
and supported an early Aleman visit to Washington. 
He expressed interest in maximizing the 
effectiveness of USG assistance programs targeted 
at the Panamanian Public Forces and shared the 
Ambassador\'s desire for complementarity between 
U.S. and Panamanian resources devoted to security. 
 
 
ILEA 
---- 
17. (SBU) With regard to the proposed 
International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) for 
Central America, the Foreign Minister said he 
thought the best way forward would be for the 
academy to fall under the umbrella of the Ciudad 
del Saber (City of Knowledge).  The Ambassador 
said that the ILEA issue was currently on hold, 
but promised to keep this in mind.  The Ambassador 
and Foreign Minister agreed that the Ciudad del 
Saber could be more effective if it were better 
focused and marketed. 
 
 
18. (C) Comment:  This was VP/Foreign Minister 
Lewis\' first bilateral courtesy call, taking place 
prior to his formal greeting to the diplomatic 
corps on September 10.  Throughout the tour 
d\'horizon, Lewis emphasized the desire of 
President Torrijos to foster a very close and 
collaborative relationship with the United States. 
Reflecting that commitment, Lewis joined the 
Ambassador\'s 9/13 courtesy call to the Minister of 
Government and Justice and met separately with 
Embassy officers for a briefing on the nuts and 
bolts of extradition requests, force protection, 
and related issues. He intends to speak frankly 
and asks the same of us.  Lewis will capitalize on 
his family\'s business and political connections in 
Washington to promote Panama\'s interests.  We 
expect a more dynamic, well-run, and coherent 
foreign ministry and foreign policy under his 
direction.

SUMMARY: CASTILLO DEFEATS MILANES 
--------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Geovany Castillo of President Torrijos\' Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) defeated Arnulfista Party (PA) 
legislative incumbent Haydee Milanes de Lay by an 11% margin 
in 9/12 partial elections in Panama\'s easternmost province of 
Darien.  Castillo will represent the La Palma region 
(electoral circuit 5-1) in Panama\'s Legislative Assembly. 
Milanes won the seat in the May 2, 2004 general election, but 
the Electoral Tribunal annulled her election due to 
indications that she had used government funds to \"purchase 
votes,\" thus gaining an unfair advantage.  With the Castillo 
win, the PRD/Popular Party (PP) legislative majority has 
increased from 42 to 43 (42 PRD   1 PP) of 78 legislators. 
The PA has the largest minority contingent of 16 and the 
remaining 19 legislators from four other parties have united 
to form a single front.  Barring major PRD defections to the 
opposition, the PRD/PP coalition should have smooth sailing 
for the near future.  The Castillo win opens the door for a 
new investigation of Milanes, exactly what Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis has proposed. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
WHAT DID MILANES DO? 
-------------------- 
2.  (C/NF) Haydee Milanes de Lay won the May 2004 election in 
all probability thanks to the use of public funds to 
encourage voters to support her. The brief that Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis submitted to Panama\'s three 
Electoral Magistrates (based on evidence that Geovany 
Castillo collected) asserts that Milanes benefited from the 
emission of National Bank of Panama (BNP) checks issued 
immediately prior to the May 2 election by the La Palma 
Community Council.  According to media reports, an estimated 
600 of those checks were cashed the day after the election. 
One Electoral Magistrate told EmbOffs that Solis\' brief 
indicted wrongdoing, but did not contain sufficient evidence 
to convict Milanes of an electoral crime.  While there is no 
way to know the exact correlation between the BNP checks and 
Milanes\' win, the Electoral Tribunal annulled her election 
because she only defeated Castillo on May 2 by 148 votes. 
 
 
 
 
COMMENT: WILL MILANES LOSE MORE THAN HER SEAT? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
3.  (C) Critics have lambasted the Electoral Tribunal (TE) 
decision not to proceed with formal charges against Milanes, 
but all they had to do was wait.  On September 13, Electoral 
Prosecutor Gerardo Solis requested that the TE lift Milanes\' 
immunity to authorize an investigation based on new evidence 
presented to his office.  Solis considers immaterial the fact 
that President Moscoso \"pardoned\" Milanes \"for any crime for 
which she was being investigated\" in August 2004 since a new 
investigation, by definition, wouldn\'t have been ongoing at 
the time of the August 2004 pardon.  Solis\' decision to 
investigate Milanes (an Arnulfista) may not be thoroughly 
objective due to his strong PRD affiliation before becoming 
Electoral Prosecutor.  Based on an argument that neither the 
PRD nor the PP raised, Solis also sought (unsuccessfully) to 
have the Electoral Tribunal transfer a seat to the PRD that 
it had awarded to the PP in May 2004 based on a written 
PRD/PP agreement (which differed from the formula stipulated 
in Panama\'s convoluted electoral law). 
 
 
4.  (C) Particularly as they approach the second semester 
2006 end of their ten-year terms, none of the Electoral 
Magistrates are looking to anger the political class.  (NOTE: 
The executive, legislative, and judicial branch each appoint 
one Electoral Magistrate.  END NOTE.)  Prosecuting Milanes 
for an electoral crime could spur the Arnulfistas to 
blacklist the magistrates for re-appointment and would have 
opened a Pandora\'s box for the TE.  \"Why,\" critics would ask, 
\"did Gerardo Solis not investigate the PRD candidates accused 
of buying votes?\"  They might also ask why the TE didn\'t 
further investigate other cases of vote-buying on behalf of 
Arnulfista candidates, including one instance in the 
heavily-populated San Miguelito district of Panama City where 
businessmen admitted having bought and distributed 
supermarket gift certificates to voters less than a month 
before the election.  Unfortunately, the latter 
transgressions, albeit thoroughly unethical, did not violate 
any law.

------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) The Torrijos administration plans to run a much more 
ambitious foreign policy than its predecessor, aiming to sell 
the Panama \"brand\" to the world.  First Vice President and 
Foreign Minister Samuel LEWIS Navarro has repeatedly 
indicated to the Ambassador and EmbOffs that the Torrijos 
team intends to establish a \"coherent\" foreign policy that 
will feature especially close cooperation with the United 
States and Colombia and higher profile relations with 
important Western European countries, such as France and 
Spain.  \"We need to make Panama a world player,\" he told 
PolCouns in a recent meeting.  Lewis and other GOP officials 
have emphasized that Panama\'s most important international 
partner is the United States.  To that end, MFA intends to 
establish a wholly new North America Desk solely responsible 
for managing Panama\'s relationship with the U.S. and Canada. 
(Note: Canada currently maintains a two-person Embassy in 
Panama.  End Note.) 
 
 
2.  (C) Also with an eye on closer cooperation with Mercosur 
and on attracting Western-European investors and tourists, 
the Torrijos administration has sought high-level 
consultations with European and Latin American leaders even 
before winning the May 2 election, and more intensively in 
the transition period before Torrijos\' September 1 
inauguration.  Both the President and the FM see Panama\'s 
foreign relations program as a motor to drive to their 
domestic agendas of increasing tourism, local employment, 
economic growth and investment, security and Canal expansion. 
 Lewis also has spoken of making Panama\'s UN votes more 
\"predictable\" although we doubt that they will be more U.S. 
or Israel-friendly than in the past.  End Summary. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
FM\'S FOREIGN POLICY VISION 
-------------------------- 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Lewis mapped out the Torrijos 
administration\'s determination to make Panama a \"global 
player\" to attract foreign investment and create jobs. 
\"Panama has not had a foreign policy for years,\" Lewis 
complained during a recent meeting with PolCouns.  \"One day 
it\'s one thing, the next day it\'s different.\"  Lewis 
described the recent whirlwind of foreign visits that 
Torrijos has made, saying, \"We just wanted to touch base with 
all these (foreign leaders) to begin to form a coherent 
policy, and make Panama an ally of all peaceful, democratic 
nations.\"  Today, the world ignores Panama, Lewis continued. 
Lewis and Torrijos want Panama to start playing a more 
visible role in world politics, to help Panama in Canal 
expansion, attracting investment, and creating jobs.  Lewis 
plans to use foreign policy to promote Panama as a friendly 
country, a good place to invest and to visit. 
 
 
------------------ 
PANAMA AND THE USG 
------------------ 
 
 
4.  (C) MFA Foreign Policy Director General Dario Chiru 
(Undersecretary for Political Affairs) expanded on plans for 
establishing a new Directorate General to manage Panama\'s 
relationship with the United States and Canada during a 
September 20 lunch with PolCouns.  Chiru said the MFA wants 
to establish a sole interlocutor to manage bilateral 
relations on a day-to-day basis (like a State Department 
country desk).  Noting Panama\'s oft-mentioned \"special 
relationship\" with the U.S., Chiru explained that the MFA 
should try to ensure consistent policy coordination with its 
largest and most important partner.  (Comment: Panama\'s 
strict top-down management culture makes it difficult to 
imagine that this system would be entirely effective or that 
MFA\'s not-yet-identified North America office director would 
have sufficient clout to rapidly respond to multiple daily 
USG to GOP requests.  Nonetheless, the decision to dedicate 
human resources to managing Panama\'s relations with the U.S. 
is a promising step consistent with FM Lewis\' vision and 
repeated overtures to EmbOffs.  End Comment.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
HONORING INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO FIGHT CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
5.  (C) The GOP has acted quickly on a U.S. anti-corruption 
priority consistent with its own \"zero corruption\" campaign 
pledge, by opening investigations against former Nicaraguan 
President Arnoldo Aleman and nine of his relatives and former 
officials.  The Aleman group is allegedly connected with 40 
Panamanian bank accounts containing some $60 million, and is 
under suspicion of money laundering.  Ambassador Watt has 
reinforced to FM Lewis the A/S Noriega September 1 message to 
Torrijos (delivered during the inauguration) that an all-out 
push on the Aleman case will help Panama show its seriousness 
on corruption.  (Reftel B) 
 
 
------------------- 
PANAMA AND COLOMBIA 
------------------- 
 
 
6.  (C) Torrijos has visited President Uribe in Colombia 
twice recently, Lewis told PolCouns, once immediately after 
the May 2 election, and discussed a possible Panama-Colombia 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  Maintaining close relations with 
its big neighbor to the southwest is crucial for Panama 
because of immigration, trade and investment, 
counter-terrorism, money laundering, and narcotics issues. 
In a Sept. 13 meeting with A/DCM and PolCouns, MFA Secretary 
General Daniel Delgado confirmed that Colombia has been 
pushing the idea of finishing the last uncompleted stretch 
(108 km) of the Pan-American highway to establish a 
high-speed link between the two countries.  Panama has agreed 
to \"study\" the idea for the new road, which would bisect its 
Darien National Park.  But Delgado signaled that Panama is 
much more interested in Colombian proposals to build 
electrical transmission lines to link the two nations, power 
grids than a road.  (Comment: Panama,s concerns about its 
150,000-200,000 illegal Colombian residents decrease its 
enthusiasm for a road.  End Comment.) 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
PANAMA AND THE AMERICAS 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Just prior to his inauguration, Torrijos and Lewis 
completed a southern cone Latin America tour (using Lewis\' 
private executive jet), meeting with five presidents in six 
days. They discussed participation in Mercosur in meetings 
with President Kirchner in Argentina and President Da Silva 
(\"Lula\") in Brazil.  Also in Argentina, Torrijos and Lewis 
met with Uruguayan President Batlle.  They stopped in Chile 
to meet with President Lagos.  During a fuel stop in Lima, 
they met unexpectedly with President Toledo when he invited 
them to the Palace.  Prior to his July 2004 visit to Europe, 
Torrijos stopped in Mexico to meet President Fox, Lewis said. 
 (Note: President Fox has announced his intention to visit 
Panama for its 101st birthday, November 3.  Torrijos and Fox 
apparently intend to resurrect a previously failed attempt at 
a Free Trade Agreement during the visit. End Note.)  Torrijos 
also has met with Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco. 
 
 
8.  During an August 6 press conference in Buenos Aires, 
Torrijos detailed Panama\'s interest in playing a more 
prominent role in Mercosur, drawing on its strengths as a 
logistics, transportation and re-shipment hub.  Torrijos 
emphasized Panama\'s advantages as a natural conduit for 
channeling and processing Latin American goods intended for 
the U.S. and other nations.  Torrijos stressed Panama\'s 
service industries and security, explaining that Mercosur 
should think hard about using Panama as a hemispheric 
merchandise distribution center.  Torrijos also stressed the 
pending FTA talks with the U.S. and future FTAs with other 
nations as an added reason that Southern Cone companies 
should trust their products to Panama\'s distribution 
capabilities.  (Note: La Prensa reported September 27 that 
Panama intends to become a member of Mercosur. End Note.) 
 
 
----------------- 
PANAMA AND EUROPE 
----------------- 
 
 
9.  (C) During his summer 2004 Paris meeting with Torrijos, 
President Chirac confirmed plans to visit Panama in 2005, 
Lewis told PolCouns.  The Canal remains an investment option 
in France, Lewis explained, as a French/Belgian company has 
been involved in Canal expansion studies.  Increasing French 
tourism is important to Panama, Lewis said, and Chirac and 
Torrijos proposed the start of a new Paris-to-Panama KLM 
route.  Torrijos also met with the King Juan Carlos I of 
Spain and Spanish President Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero. 
(Note: Direct Madrid-to-Panama flights will begin in October. 
 End Note.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
IMPROVE SECURITY TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL APPEAL 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
10.  (C) The Torrijos administration is keenly interested in 
international security cooperation (read: with the USG) and 
came to power with explicit (if vague) intentions to improve 
Panama,s security posture.  Panama,s wide areas of concern 
range from Canal, port, and container security to the 
integrity of its ship registry (the world,s largest) and the 
security of its identity documents for tens of thousands of 
mariners.  For Minister of Government and Justice (MOGJ) 
Hector Aleman, the link between domestic security and foreign 
investment could not be more clear.  The GOP wants companies, 
foreign investors, and tourists to feel safe in Panama.  MOGJ 
is well aware of Panama,s current shortcomings.  \"If 
terrorists came to Panama right now, we would sell them 
candy,\" MOGJ aide Severino Mejia told PolOff September 15. 
\"Panama has never had a mind to think about security issues 
like terrorism, but we must.\"  Mejia said that MOGJ hopes to 
write or re-write organic laws to re-organize the 21 social 
and security institutions -- including the Panamanian 
National Police -- that comprise MOGJ to maximize law 
enforcement and security.  (Note: MOGJ Hector Aleman, MFA 
Secretary General Daniel Delgado, and Consejo Director (NSA 
 
SIPDIS 
equivalent and intelligence chief) Javier Martinez Acha 
traveled to Washington during the week of September 27 to 
meet Department of Homeland Security, Coast Guard, and 
Department of Defense officials, including Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Roger Pardo-Mauer.  Aleman and Acha likely will 
 
SIPDIS 
soon make concrete proposals to Torrijos on security.  End 
Note.) 
 
 
------------------------------ 
CUBA, CHINA, TAIWAN, VENEZUELA 
------------------------------ 
 
 
11.  (C) To the dismay of the Torrijos administration, Cuba 
has proved unwilling to quickly repair bilateral relations 
that were severed following President Moscoso,s August 2004 
pardon of four Cuban-born prisoners convicted in connection 
with an alleged attempt to kill Fidel Castro in 2000.  The 
prospect of renewed relations with Cuba will likely remain 
stalled for weeks, if not months.  Many are speculating that 
Castro may be trying to extract as yet unspecified favors or 
concessions from the GOP exchange for re-establishing 
relations.  Panama continues to maintain relations with 
Taiwan, although unfounded rumors of an imminent switch to 
China (PRC) continue.  Meanwhile, a political scandal is 
unfolding regarding Taiwan\'s financial support to President 
Moscoso\'s government.  The press and the new administration 
are wondering loudly, \"Where exactly did all that money go?\" 
(See Reftel D.)  The Venezuelan ambassador to Panama, Flavio 
Granados, arrived in Panama less than one week after the 
September 1 inauguration, patching the rift with Venezuela, 
also dating from the pardon of the four Cubans.  Panama has 
not yet selected a new ambassador to Venezuela. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
12.  (C) The Torrijos administration seems determined to 
multiply its options internationally, especially its economic 
and investment opportunities.  The new GOP has announced 
intention to \"clean up\" its far-eastern consulates (such as 
Hong Kong, Manila, Tokyo), long a lucrative source of graft 
from the sale of mariner identifications and ship 
registrations.  Although FM Lewis has spoken of the need to 
make Panama,s UN votes \"more predictable,\" we doubt that 
they will become notably more congenial to USG imperatives. 
With regard to Israel, for instance, Panama B,nai B,rith 
President Joseph Harari recently told PolCouns that, at a 
meeting with Torrijos and Lewis, Harari asked whether Panama 
will adopt a more pro-Israel stance at the UN.  Torrijos and 
Lewis replied that doing so could make Panama a 
higher-profile target for terrorist attacks, a risk they are 
unwilling to contemplate.

TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, PTER, SNAR, PM, ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
SUBJECT: UNDERSTANDING PANAMA\'S COLON FREE ZONE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Linda E. Watt, Reasons 1.4(b) and (e) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: An important pillar of Panama\'s service-based 
economy, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) is the largest duty free 
zone in the hemisphere and the second largest in the world. 
Offering much more than just duty-free wholesale shopping, 
however, the CFZ draws upon the strengths of Panama\'s 
world-class shipping and financial services to offer cargo 
services and credit to its customers throughout Latin 
America.  The \'value added\' provided by Zone merchants has 
frequently amounted to helping customers skirt customs duties 
and exchange rate laws in the importing country, and law 
enforcement in the zone is weak.  In such an environment, it 
can be easy to turn a blind eye to more serious criminal 
activities.  In order to improve its prospects for future 
growth, the CFZ must address its security and law enforcement 
weaknesses as well as re-examine its entrepot service 
offering in the context of today\'s more liberal and globally 
integrated business environment.  The incoming Torrijos 
administration has already begun to focus on the CFZ\'s 
weaknesses by naming a highly respected community activist to 
the top slot at the Zone, and the Embassy is focusing assets 
on better understanding CFZ financial flows and exploring 
ways to work with the CFZ administration to strengthen 
enforcement.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Background and Introduction 
--------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) In 1948, the GOP set aside a 370-acre area adjacent to 
the Atlantic port city of Colon for the creation of a free 
trade zone.  Half a century later, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) 
is the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and 
second only to Hong Kong in the world.  Originally conceived 
as a way to modernize Panama\'s economic infrastructure and 
encourage regional trade, the CFZ has since developed into a 
major international merchandise distribution center and a 
pillar of Panama\'s service-based economy.  Today, the CFZ 
covers 1,000 acres full of showrooms and warehouses run by 
hundreds of individual companies.  Although the CFZ 
contributes 7.4% of Panama\'s GDP, CFZ businesses employ less 
than 2% of Panama\'s labor force (17,760 people directly and 
another 7,000 indirectly).  Exempt from many taxes, the CFZ 
also contributes little to GOP revenues.  Zone merchants have 
vociferously opposed recent proposals to apply even nominal 
business taxes to CFZ firms. 
 
 
3. (U) In 2003, the CFZ imported $3.990 billion worth of 
merchandise and exported $4.478 billion.  By comparison, the 
rest of Panama imported 3.070 billion and exported $808 
million.  The vast majority of CFZ merchandise comes from 
Asia for distribution throughout Latin America.  Broken down 
by individual countries, the United States is the third most 
important supplier (9.8% of CFZ imports by value), but a 
minor customer (4.5% of CFZ exports).  Electronics and 
clothing are the main exports, followed by a wide range of 
products, including watches, cosmetics, shoes, jewelry, and 
textiles.  Unlike export processing zones which proliferated 
in Latin America during the 1990s, or truly modern logistics 
centers like Puerto Rico, the CFZ contributes very little 
value-added to the physical products it sells, aside from 
some packaging and labeling for mainly pharmaceutical 
products. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
More than Duty-Free Shopping: Logistics is Now the Key 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Currently some 30% of CFZ cargo comes from large 
logistics operations, and this sector is steadily growing. 
These are companies who use the CFZ to consolidate products 
in one place from all their production facilities.  For 
example, Nike brings shoes from various manufacturing centers 
in Asia and Latin America to the CFZ, and then ships onward 
to Europe or the United States.  However, the CFZ has grown 
by drawing on the strengths of the financial sector and 
providing services to smaller merchants in the region.  A 
major international banking center for Latin America, Panama 
offers CFZ customers unparalleled access to credit in a 
stable, U.S.-dollar based economy.  Likewise, CFZ commerce 
benefits from Panama\'s strengths in shipping, including four 
world-class container ports, shipping agents, freight 
forwarders, and, of course, the canal.  Adjacent to the CFZ, 
Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT) is now the largest 
container port in all of Latin America (in 2003 over 1 
million containers in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units, 
or TEUs passed through MIT).  Also nearby are Hong Kong-based 
Hutchison-Whampoa\'s Cristobal facility and Taiwan-based 
Evergreen\'s Colon Container Terminal.  Approximately 60% of 
CFZ businesses specialize in cargo consolidation, which means 
that customers can tailor their purchases by buying smaller 
quantities at wholesale prices and packing them together into 
single container loads.  By comparison, a Bogota merchant 
buying directly from a Taipei factory would typically 
confront significant challenges:  language barrier, exchange 
rate risk, no credit, and container lots only. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Financial Woes Lead to Criminal Activities? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (SBU) There is a symbiotic relationship between the CFZ 
and Panama\'s well-developed banking center.  Between 80% and 
90% of all CFZ business is done on credit of some kind. 
Twenty-five banks have physical branches in the CFZ.  In 
2003, banks issued approximately $742 million in credit lines 
to CFZ companies and buyers.  Leaders include HSBC Bank,s 
portfolio at $133.5 million, Banco Aliado at $62.3 million, 
BNP Paribas at $60 million, Bank Leum-Le Israel at $50 
million, and Bank Boston at $44 million.  Accumulated debts 
within the CFZ approach $1 billion.  Buyers from Cuba are 
most likely to default with more than $200 million in 
outstanding loans, and Venezuelan merchants have $100 million 
in CFZ-related debts.  As banks have started to tighten their 
lending controls because of the danger of default, the 
250,000 buyers that visit the Zone every year have 
increasingly looked to other finance channels.  CFZ merchants 
commonly offer the advantage of \"flexible invoicing\" and 
90-day, direct &merchant to merchant8 interest-free credit 
to help customers to evade import duties and exchange rate 
laws at the final destination.  Anecdotal evidence points to 
some companies receiving payments in large amounts of 
cash*no questions asked.  Indeed, much of the \'value added\' 
provided by Zone merchants frequently amounts to helping 
customers skirt customs duties and exchange rate laws in the 
importing country.  In such an environment, it becomes easy 
to turn a blind eye to more serious criminal activities. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Company and Religious/Ethnic Compositions 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (C)  There are 2388 registered companies in the CFZ, and 
1716 of those are owner operated.  The other 672 are 
represented by those owner-operated companies.  Though no 
official statistics exist, most observers agree that the 
companies are broken down along ethnic/religious lines as 
follows: 30-40% Jewish, 40-50% Muslim Arab, and the remaining 
20% equally between Indians/Pakistanis, Chinese, and 
Panamanian Christians.  In general, Arab and Chinese 
businessmen live in Colon, while Jews and Christians live in 
Panama City and commute to Colon daily.  The Arab businessmen 
in the CFZ also have maintained historical ties to Arabs in 
Isla Margarita, Venezuela, Maicao, Colombia, and the 
Tri-Border Region of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.  These 
ties have raised concerns about possible terrorist financing 
links, an issue that the Embassy has focused on in the past 
year.  In fact, the Embassy recently created an inter-agency 
task force to analyze these ties to see if there are 
terrorist finance links. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
A Bad Reputation; Few Resources; But Some Successes 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
7. (SBU) CFZ businesses have grown and prospered with little 
GOP supervision.  The GOP\'s Colon Free Zone Administration 
has traditionally done the merchants\' bidding and lacked 
resources to implement serious security, law-enforcement, and 
intellectual property programs, had it been so inclined.  In 
practice, the strongest deterrent to crime--particularly 
trademark violations or counterfeiting--has been pressure by 
legitimate merchants in the Zone whose business is affected 
by illicit activity.  Since 2002, the CFZ administration has 
tried to implement reforms on the law-enforcement and 
security fronts however, despite counting on just a small 
staff of lawyers, with only one dedicated full-time to 
investigating money-laundering and intellectual property 
rights (IPR) violations and a security department that 
numbers only some 80 full time patrollers (four groups of 20 
plus 4 bikes and 3 motorcycles), which must control 12 
entrances during business hours.  Nevertheless, they have 
played a role in several significant cases, in collaboration 
with other GOP law enforcement entities and with USG 
assistance.  On the money-laundering front, in the 1999 
landmark \'Speed Joyeros\' case developed jointly by the GOP 
and USG over two years, a CFZ jewelry merchant pled guilty to 
U.S. money laundering charges, forfeited $16 million in 
seized assets, and opened the door to dozens of arrests in 
Colombia and elsewhere.  The CFZ has also been the source of 
some very large IPR cases, including the seizure of seven 
million pirated music and Sony \'Playstation\' CDs which were 
destroyed in December 2003 and nine containers of counterfeit 
Marlboro cigarettes--over 400,000 cartons valued at $5 
million--seized in November 2003.  In both cases, counterfeit 
goods came from Asia transiting the CFZ for distribution 
throughout Latin America.  The large volumes of merchandise 
trade combined with weak local law enforcement capabilities 
have made the CFZ an ideal place to conceal criminal activity. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
The Black Market Peso Exchange: Narcotrafficking Connection 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
8.  (C) According to Panama\'s Customs Authority, every year 
travelers declare more than $400 million in U.S. currency at 
Panama\'s main port of entry, Tocumen International Airport. 
This number represents declared, \"legitimate\" currency, and 
does not/not include smuggled cash.  Colombia is the main 
source of these U.S. dollars at $5 million per month, 
followed closely by Mexico at $4 million per month, then by 
other countries in Central American and the Caribbean.  The 
Embassy believes that most of this cash ultimately comes from 
the United States, possibly in large part as drug proceeds, 
and is destined to pay off credit lines in the CFZ, and could 
form part of the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE).  In this 
system, a Colombian merchant buys goods in the CFZ on credit 
in dollars and sells those goods in Colombia in pesos.  The 
merchant then approaches a currency dealer in Colombia who 
receives the pesos on very favorable terms and arranges for 
payment of the merchant\'s debt in the CFZ in dollars from 
drug proceeds in the United States. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Little Diversification Means Tough Times 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
9. (U) Lack of diversification in its supplier and customer 
base is a serious concern for the CFZ.  Two-thirds of CFZ 
merchandise comes from Asia, particularly Hong Kong (23.8%), 
Taiwan (15.2%), and Mainland China (13.0%).  The CFZ\'s 
customer base is even more concentrated, with most CFZ 
exports going to Latin American countries, particularly 
Andean countries: Colombia (14.1%), Ecuador (7.9%), and 
Venezuela (5.6%).  As these Colombia and Venezuela have faced 
political and economic challenges, so has the CFZ--exports to 
Venezuela have dwindled by two-thirds since 2001.  The 
relative stability in the past few months in the Andean 
region has led to a strong rebound in the first half of 2004 
for the CFZ however, as exports and imports in the first half 
of 2004 are up almost 18% and 20% respectively over the same 
period last year. 
 
 
10. (C) A particular sore spot is Cuba, which is a 
disproportionately large customer.  Cuban government 
businesses bought $208 million worth of merchandise in 2003 
from the CFZ.  Recently, CFZ merchants have paid dearly for 
doing business with Cuba in the form of large overdue 
accounts receivable, now officially at $200 million, although 
some unofficial estimates peg the debt as high as $500 
million.  These debts are so large and touch so many 
businesses in Panama that CFZ merchants pressure the GoP to 
restrain its criticism of Castro\'s policies and even 
cooperate with the regime in some limited ways, including a 
bilateral investment agreement, just to ensure continued 
interest payments and to stave off a Cuban default.  In fact, 
the late August 2004 break of diplomatic relations between 
the two countries led to immediate protest from CFZ merchants 
who feared the non-payment of outstanding debts. 
 
 
11. (U) Weaknesses in its supplier and customer base caused 
the CFZ to shrink by 20% in 1999 after the Asian financial 
crisis and the Mexican peso crisis.  The CFZ is still far 
from recovering to previous levels due to economic downturns 
in its principal customer countries like Venezuela and 
Colombia.  In 2003, imports decreased by 10.4% and exports by 
7.1%, resulting in an overall 9% contraction on 2002.  So 
far, attempts to promote the CFZ among potential users in the 
U.S., Canada, and Europe have met with little success, in 
part due to its reputation for weak law enforcement. 
12. (U) Since much of CFZ trade is from Asia to Latin 
America, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and the 
ever-increasing sub-regional FTAs do not constitute an 
immediate threat to the CFZ.  Moreover, as the duty-free 
nature of the CFZ,s trade with regional customers is only 
one of various CFZ attractions (easy credit and cargo 
consolidation being more important), a general lowering of 
tariffs across the region should not hurt the CFZ terribly. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Multi-Modal Hub of the Americas: Caught in Corruption 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
13. (SBU)  In 2000, CFZ Administrator Jorge Fernandez began 
promoting an ambitious plan to double the size of the CFZ to 
include the adjacent MIT and Evergreen ports, the 
newly-opened Panama Canal Railway cargo terminal, and an 
international airport with a high-tech industrial park to be 
developed on the site of the current France Field municipal 
airstrip -- all in one duty-free customs area.  Eschewing 
normal competitive bidding procedures, the GOP drafted a 
concession through direct negotiations with the San Lorenzo 
Consortium (CSL) to develop both the industrial park (CEMIS) 
and a major international airport (CIASA) that would 
eventually require over $400 million in new private 
investment.  The CSL concession sparked much controversy. 
Shortly after it was given final approval by the National 
Assembly in 2002, a legislator publicly accused the project 
promoters of bribing a handful of his colleagues (including 
himself!) in the legislative Assembly.  The resulting 
investigations and media frenzy have all but halted project 
implementation, and more than two years later the case is no 
closer to real resolution. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Comment: Embassy Actively Engaged; CFZ Future Unclear 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
14. (C) The Embassy has increasingly focused on the CFZ; 
making it a key part of our broader initiative to engage the 
Colon community in the past year.  We have assisted with law 
enforcement training, resources, and help with police 
expenses related to IPR court cases.  NAS has donated 
computer equipment to help the CFZ administration to 
computerize all transactions and thus more effectively screen 
for suspicious activity.  As noted, the Embassy\'s recently 
formed, interagency financial task force is focused on 
getting a better understanding of the monetary transactions 
that take place in the Zone. 
 
 
15.  The CFZ remains an important pillar of Panama\'s 
service-based economy, but its future is uncertain.  The CFZ 
has been slow to change old business patterns that rely on 
unstable markets and has turned a blind eye to possible 
criminal activities.  Surely, most of CFZ\'s multi-billion 
dollar commerce is legitimate, but the temptations are great 
when CFZ merchants sell on razor-thin margins and so much CFZ 
trade comes from Asian countries (adept at mass production of 
counterfeit goods) and goes to Andean countries (eager to 
launder their illicit drug proceeds).  CFZ merchants will 
continue to give into these temptations until the perceived 
risk is greater than the very lucrative payoffs.  Indeed, CFZ 
merchants have staunchly resisted proposals to reduce 
criminal activity by increasing security, claiming that they 
cannot afford the increased user fees that such security 
improvements would require.  That is changing though*in 2003 
the CFZ opened doors to the Business Anti-Smuggling Coalition 
(BASC), as the zone recognizes that without transparency, 
companies may be further exposed to liability.  Also helping 
is the new PRD Torrijos administration,s anti-corruption 
efforts, and naming of highly respected Colon activist Nilda 
Quijano to the administrator post at the CFZ.  Finally, the 
relative stability of Venezuela and Colombia in recent months 
is leading to rebounding imports and export.  Until the CFZ 
merchants overhaul their business model and the CFZ 
administration addresses its security and law enforcement 
weaknesses, the Zone,s reputation for lawlessness will cloud 
its future by discouraging potential new customers and 
investors needed for expansion.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Dan Fisk\'s October 5-7 
meetings with President Torrijos and key cabinet officials 
brought friendly and productive exchanges on security and law 
enforcement cooperation; foreign policy; economic and trade 
policy; and good governance/anti-corruption.  DAS Fisk 
emphasized that the USG wants to continue close collaboration 
with Panama on security matters, especially on transnational 
crime and emerging regional threats, such as gangs.  DAS Fisk 
spent October 6 near the Colombian border touring Panama\'s 
Darien province with Ambassador Watt and Panama National 
Police (PNP) Chief Gustavo Perez (to be reported septel) and 
attended a dinner with Panamanian business leaders. 
 
 
2.  (C) DAS Fisk\'s meetings with President Martin Torrijos, 
Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis, Minister of the Presidency 
Ubaldino Real, Minister of Commerce and Industries Alejandro 
Ferrer, and Minister of Government and Justice Aleman touched 
on the following issues: 
 
 
-(security) proposals to centralize public forces, form a 
specialized police border unit, found a maritime 
academy/training center, and establish an International Law 
Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Panama; 
 
 
-(foreign policy) Haiti, Colombia, and Venezuela; 
 
 
-(economic and trade policy) bilateral Free Trade Agreement, 
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), Canal expansion, and 
enhancing Panama\'s comparative advantage as a trade 
crossroads; 
 
 
-(anti-corruption and good governance) Aleman/Portillo 
corruption cases and a soon-to-be-named anti-corruption 
commission. 
 
 
In an October 7 meeting, FM Lewis told DAS Fisk that the GOP 
had decided to turn down the USG\'s proposal to base an ILEA 
for Latin America in Panama, for fear that it would attract 
too much political heat. 
 
 
End Summary. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
President Torrijos Outlines Ambitious Agenda 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
3.  (C) At an October 5 luncheon with DAS Fisk and other 
participants attending a U.S. Embassy Panama-hosted Central 
America chiefs of mission conference, President Torrijos 
discussed his government\'s ambitious agenda.  Torrijos, 
accompanied by his ministers of foreign affairs (Samuel Lewis 
Navarro), trade (Alejandro Ferrer), and the presidency 
(Ulbadino Real), noted that his government plans to pursue an 
integrated strategy aimed at combating corruption, 
establishing clear rules of the game and enhancing 
transparency in order to attract greater domestic and foreign 
investment, which will in turn generate employment and reduce 
poverty. 
 
 
4.  (C) Torrijos said his government seeks to capitalize on 
Panama\'s comparative advantage as a strategic crossroads for 
commerce.  Thus, a central component of his government\'s 
strategy is the expansion and modernization of the Canal, 
along with the development of Panama\'s seaport and airport 
facilities, which serve as critical regional hubs. 
Elaborating on Canal expansion, Torrijos and his ministers 
explained that this 10-to-12-year modernization project would 
cost an estimated $5 billion, which would likely be funded 
through a combination of Canal revenues (which are robust and 
rising), new user fees for major shipping companies, and 
bridge loans to finance any gaps. 
 
 
5.  (C) Torrijos underscored the importance of cultivating 
closer relations with the United States, pointing to our 
mutual economic and security goals.  In this context, Trade 
Minister Ferrer stressed the importance of reaching a free 
trade agreement (FTA), ideally by early December.  He noted 
that the GOP seeks an FTA that takes into account Panama\'s 
sensitive agricultural sector.  Ferrer pointed out that seven 
or eight key agricultural products generate significant 
employment in Panama\'s impoverished rural areas (where he 
cited an estimated 70% of the population lives in poverty). 
Minister of the Presidency Real highlighted the serious 
security implications of this issue, observing that a restive 
rural sector could threaten domestic stability.  In this 
regard, Torrijos added that while Canal expansion would 
attract important ancillary service sector businesses, it 
would not generate significant employment for Panama\'s 
working classes.  (Comment: Construction during the 
decade-long project is expected to generate considerable 
well-paid temporary employment.  End Comment.) 
 
 
6.  (C) On foreign policy, Torrijos said Panama is 
reassessing its relations in the region, including the issue 
of integration with other Central American countries. 
Torrijos said his government is currently considering a more 
realistic approach to regional issues that would stress 
shared interests -- such as cooperation on common customs and 
transportation policies -- rather than a top-down approach 
focused on political integration, which he averred had been 
undermined by intractable problems within Parlacen. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Aleman/Portillo, Security, Free Trade, Zak Hernandez 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
7.  (C) In a pull-aside following lunch, DAS Fisk told 
Torrijos that the USG looks forward to developing an even 
closer relationship with Panama based on a broader range of 
issues.  For example, the USG seeks Panama\'s cooperation in 
the corruption case involving former Nicaraguan President 
Aleman as well as in any cases which develop involving former 
Guatemalan President Portillo.  Fisk noted that the USG does 
not want to interfere in the judicial aspects of these cases 
but views them as important precedents that would send a 
strong message throughout the region.  In response, Torrijos 
pledged Panama\'s cooperation but noted that returning 
Aleman\'s ill-gotten money to the Nicaraguan government is 
complicated because the GOP and Panamanian banks are 
navigating uncharted legal waters.  Nonetheless, Torrijos 
suggested that the Nicaraguan Attorney General send a formal 
request seeking the repatriation of Aleman\'s accounts in 
Panamanian banks.  Torrijos stressed that the GON needs to 
state explicitly in its request that these accounts belong to 
the Nicaraguan government. 
 
 
8.  (C) Fisk underscored that the USG would like to enhance 
security and law enforcement cooperation with Panama.  He 
also urged Panama to think more expansively about its role in 
the region and to play a more prominent role in discussions 
of security issues.  Fisk noted that Panama could help other 
Central American countries whose military establishments 
remain mired in outdated Cold War thinking.  Panama, 
unburdened by a military, could help re-focus other Central 
American countries on current challenges such as gangs and 
transnational threats. 
 
 
9.  (C) Turning to trade, Fisk noted that President Bush 
remains committed to pursuing a vigorous free trade policy in 
the hemisphere, including the conclusion of an FTAA. 
Torrijos agreed with Fisk\'s assessment that the FTAA has more 
life to it than some countries in the region are willing to 
acknowledge. 
 
 
10.  (C) In closing, Fisk stressed the importance that the 
USG attaches to the GOP pursuing legal measures to achieve 
justice in the case of U.S. serviceman Cpl. Zak Hernandez, 
who was murdered while stationed in Panama in 1991.  Fisk 
said this issue would remain a bilateral irritant unless the 
GOP pursued effective legal measures against those 
responsible for Hernandez\'s murder.  (Note: Former Panamanian 
President Perez Balladares stage-managed the acquittal of PRD 
legislator Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, who is wanted by U.S. 
authorities for his role in the Hernandez murder.  End Note.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Meeting With Foreign Minister Focuses on Regional Security 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
11.  (C) In a detailed October 7 discussion, FM Lewis told 
DAS Fisk and Ambassador Watt that President Torrijos had 
decided not to accept the USG\'s proposal to establish an ILEA 
in Panama because it could generate unwelcome political heat 
at a moment when the GOP must husband its political capital 
before taking potentially unpopular decisions to reform 
Panama\'s Social Security Fund and making budget and personnel 
cuts.  (Note: Also, the GOP plans to ask voters to approve a 
referendum on Canal expansion during 2005.  End Note.) 
 
 
12.  (C) Lewis also was cautious when DAS Fisk proposed 
establishing a Coast Guard international training facility in 
Panama.  He explained that the GOP currently is studying an 
unrelated Texas A&M University proposal for a maritime 
institute in Panama to train merchant seamen and to undertake 
related initiatives.  Although the two ideas are dissimilar, 
Lewis proposed exploring whether the Coast Guard might want 
to participate under the (civilian) umbrella of Texas A&M. 
(Note: Torrijos and Minister of the Presidency Ubaldino Real 
are Texas A&M graduates.)  The Texas A&M proposal would not 
need approval by the Legislative Assembly, Lewis noted. 
Panama is keen to greatly increase employment opportunities 
for Panamanians aboard Panamanian-flagged vessels, Lewis 
said, but currently lacks the means to train them. 
 
 
13.  (C) DAS Fisk said the USG is pleased by the high level 
of cooperation it enjoys with Panama on security issues. 
Many of the same transnational crime and security concerns 
affect all of Central America, such as drugs and undocumented 
immigrants (which flow north toward the United States) and 
arms (which flow south toward Colombia).  The USG would like 
to see greatly improved cooperation among Central American 
nations on all aspects of regional security and transnational 
crime that affect the entire region.  As an example, Fisk 
pointed out that drug running pilots often fly directly over 
the borders of two countries, confident that each country\'s 
air authorities will be reluctant to chase an airplane that 
may move into the other country\'s airspace.  The same problem 
obtains on the sea.  A welter of bilateral problems and 
inhibitions is getting in the way, Fisk said. 
 
 
14.  (C) Panama wants to \"play a role,\" Lewis said, promising 
to raise those topics at a meeting of Central American 
nations in El Salvador during the week of October 11-15.  The 
region probably should concentrate on improving, customs, 
roads, electricity transmission, and security.  Panama will 
host a Caribbean summit in July 2005, Lewis said, adding that 
Caribbean nations are interested in concluding a multilateral 
shipboarding agreement, which would accord with Fisk\'s 
suggestion. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Colombia-Venezuela-Haiti 
------------------------ 
 
 
15.  (C) Lewis said that President Torrijos would go to 
Colombia to attend a November 1 three-way 
Colombia-Venezuela-Panama summit with presidents Uribe and 
Chavez.  The meeting would discuss Chevron proposals to 
integrate Colombian and Venezuelan natural gas fields and 
possibly build a gas pipeline to Panama.  Lewis noted 
estimates of up to 300,000 Colombians living in Panama, 
mostly illegally.  On Haiti, Lewis said Panama was interested 
in contributing where it could, such as helping to organize 
the electoral process, using resources of Panama\'s highly 
respected Electoral Tribunal. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Meeting with MOGJ Hector Aleman 
------------------------------- 
 
 
16.  (C) At an October 5 meeting that the Ambassador 
attended, Minister of Government and Justice Aleman told DAS 
Fisk that the GOP is determined to establish a stronger 
official and police presence in the Darien border region with 
Colombia.  Panama\'s most ethnically diverse province, the 
Darien is beset by land disputes between settlers from other 
Panamanian provinces, Afro-Panamanians, and indigenous 
groups, Aleman explained.  Aleman said the GOP is giving 
serious thought to proposals to create a specialized police 
border unit with a new law to clearly codify its mission and 
to staff it with more police than are now assigned to duty 
there.  (Note: At present approximately two companies -- 
about 150 effectives -- of militarized police in the Darien. 
End Note.)  The GOP\'s aim is to take back areas now 
controlled by criminals and guerrillas and to improve 
security for the population, as well as to interdict flows of 
weapons, narcotics, and undocumented aliens.  Increasing 
numbers of undocumented Ecuadorians, Peruvians, and Chinese 
are using the Darien and Panama to head north toward the 
United States. 
 
 
17.  (C) The challenge to improve security extends as well to 
sea and air.  Panama has more seacoast to defend than land. 
Vast stretches of coast are currently unpatrolled as are 
Panama\'s offshore islands.  What Panama needs is a real Coast 
Guard, instead of an understaffed National Maritime Service 
(SMN) which lacks a clear mission, Aleman said.  The National 
Air Service (SAN) also lacks capability and a clear mission. 
Radar operators daily track unidentified, illegal flights in 
Panama\'s airspace but the SAN lacks the means to intercept 
them.  That\'s very frustrating, Aleman said. 
 
 
18.  (C) Under the previous GOP, the Panamanian National 
Police (PNP) was king, the Ambassador said, and got the 
lion\'s share of resources, crowding out the SMN and SAN.  DAS 
Fisk said Washington had understood, apparently incorrectly, 
that the PNP also had air and sea capabilities.  (Comment: 
The PNP does have helicopters and several \"brown water\" 
patrol vessels.  End Comment.) 
 
 
19.  (C) Shifting to personal security, Aleman outlined an 
ambitious-sounding plan to convert Panama\'s prisons to 
resocialization enterprises.  He pledged \"equal 
applicability\" of the law to all Panamanians.  Gangs in 
Panama are far from reaching Salvadoran or Guatemalan 
proportions, Aleman continued.  Even so, MOGJ has identified 
102 separate gang entities in Panama which as yet have no 
great criminality but \"if we don\'t act now, we\'ll be in 
trouble.\"  The PNP has no specific unit to deal with gangs or 
child criminals, for example. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Meeting with Minister of the Presidency Ubaldino Real 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
20.  (C) At an October 7 meeting with Ambassador Watt, MOP 
Real told DAS Fisk that he is deeply involved in the new 
GOP\'s efforts to enforce a \"zero tolerance\" anti-corruption 
policy.  President Torrijos plans to unveil the GOP\'s new 
Anti-Corruption Commission on October 18.  Confronting 
corruption means forcing cultural change in Panama, Real 
said.  People need to be educated on public sector ethics, 
for example, not to use publicly funded cars, telephones, or 
office supplies for private use.  Meanwhile, the government 
must lead by example and bring wrongdoers to justice. 
Prosecuting a \"big fish\" would make an especially big 
impression.  On the other hand, the GOP must be careful to 
follow the rule of law and avoid a \"lynch mob\" mentality.  We 
want to accuse wrongdoers of breaking the law, Real said, but 
we also will have to prove it.  We must proceed step by step. 
 
 
21.  (C) DAS Fisk told Real that Washington had \"great 
expectations\" for the Torrijos government\'s \"forward-looking\" 
agenda and on anti-corruption.  It makes sense that the 
government proceed carefully to avoid \"tying itself into 
knots\" while pursuing a corruption case.  He agreed that 
fostering a \"culture of lawfulness\" would be important for 
success and also praised the GOP for cooperating in 
investigating Panamanian bank accounts allegedly belonging to 
former Nicaraguan President Aleman.  This government is not 
the old PRD, Real said, adding that he welcomed constructive 
criticism.  Change needs time.  How could the previous 
government leave us with such a mess? he asked rhetorically, 
adding that the new GOP wants to start changing popular 
attitudes and practices toward corruption now, so that the 
next government will not inherit such large difficulties. 
 
 
22.  (SBU) At an October 6 dinner with Panamanian business 
leaders, DAS Fisk reviewed regional problems and USG 
approaches, especially regarding free trade (CAFTA) and 
security cooperation.  In general, U.S. policy has had major 
success in Central America during the past two decades, he 
said, but inequality of opportunity remains a problem. 
Collusion between business and government is unfairly 
stacking the economic deck in favor of a small number of 
privileged insiders.  Central America, Panama included, will 
need to open and democratize its economic structure to ensure 
participation by all.  Why is it that Central American 
immigrants in the United States can be highly successful as 
entrepreneurs while they seem stifled at home? he asked 
rhetorically.  Several participants spoke of the need for a 
greatly improved education system, as many Panamanians who 
complete formal public schooling find themselves woefully 
unprepared for workplace realities. 
 
 
23.  (U)  This message has been cleared by DAS Fisk.

THE CONSTITUTION OR THE LAW - WHICH COMES FIRST? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
1.  (C) Controversy continues to swirl around the issue of 
whether Panama\'s Supreme Court Chief Justice Cesar PEREIRA 
Burgos must step down after turning 75 on September 23, 2004. 
 Comptroller General Alvin Weeden and numerous Pereira 
opponents have insisted that Pereira should step down from 
the Supreme Court.  They rest their claims on a 1998 law 
known as the \"Ley Faundes,\" that requires all public 
officials to retire upon turning age 75.  On the other hand, 
Pereira himself and many others note that Article 200 of 
Panama\'s constitution grants a ten-year term to Supreme Court 
Magistrates without mention of age.  No law can trump the 
constitution.  Many Panamanians who consider Pereira a 
corrupted troglodyte would love to see him go, as would 
President Torrijos\' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), 
since Pereira is a Moscoso appointee.  Representatives of the 
Executive Branch recently punted the issue to Solicitor 
General Alma Montenegro de Fletcher (a founding PRD member), 
requesting that she opine on the applicability of the Ley 
Faundes to Pereira.  Fletcher has stated that the Ley Faundes 
should apply to all public servants, without exception.  But 
Pereira hasn\'t shown any signs of leaving.  At the same time, 
contrary to Montenegro, the Labor Committee of the 
Legislative Assembly is discussing reforming the law to 
exclude public officials with a constitutionally-mandated 
term.  Meanwhile, the presidency of the Supreme Court, one of 
the most important positions in the Panamanian government, 
and one of the most coveted prizes of political patronage, 
hangs in the balance. 
 
 
REROUTING THE PROBLEM 
--------------------- 
2.  (C) Opponents claim that the Torrijos administration\'s 
posturing on the separation of powers is insincere.  No one 
contests that Pereira\'s exit from the Supreme Court could 
pave the way for a PRD appointment, allowing President 
Torrijos to tip the balance of the Court in favor of his 
party.  (Pereira is one of five Moscoso appointees on the 
nine-member Supreme Court.)  Minister of the Presidency 
Ubaldino Real deferred to the Solicitor General when queried 
by the press on the Torrijos administration\'s position 
regarding the applicability of the \"Ley Faundes\" to Pereira. 
Granted, say Torrijos\' opponents, Alma Montenegro de Fletcher 
has a positive reputation for objectivity, but she also is a 
founding member of the President\'s political party. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) The entire debate may end up without result. 
Popular Party legislator Jorge Hernan Rubio, elected as 
Second Vice President Ruben Arosemena\'s alternate, has 
proposed revising the \"Ley Faundes.\"  Another Popular Party 
leader, Presidential Goals Secretary Ebrahim Asvat already 
pointed out that that since the constitution imposes no limit 
on the age of Supreme Court appointees, thus, there can 
logically be no maximum age either, but clarified that the 
judicial branch has the final say.  Legislator Rubio\'s 
proposal would clarify that the \"Ley Faundes\" does not apply 
to public officials whose term is fixed by the constitution. 
 
 
COMMENT: THEN AND NOW 
--------------------- 
4.  (C) As applied in the past, the \"Ley Faundes\" (Law 61 of 
1998) seems more a tool of political expediency than anything 
else.  Legal scholars argue that even the law\'s namesake, 
former Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Faundes, who had a 
penchant for the ponies and a known drinking problem, left 
because he was sick, not in compliance with the law.  Marine 
biologist Carlos Arellano Lennox was the most recent case 
study even though President Moscoso appointed him as Director 
of Panama\'s Environmental Authority (ANAM) well after his 
75th birthday.  Rumor has it that Moscoso chose to remove 
Arellano after only three weeks on the job after he refused 
to approve a shoddy environmental impact assessment of her 
controversial \"Camino Ecologico\" road project that was to be 
built through a national park in Panama\'s westernmost 
province of Chiriqui. 
 
 
5.  (C) La Prensa published a scathing editorial on October 
10 by its founder I. Roberto Eisenmann, Jr. on the Supreme 
Court.  Eisenmann states unequivocally that Magistrate 
Pereira must obey the law pointing out that Pereira himself 
has imposed on others in the past who challenged its 
constitutionality.  To many critics of Panama\'s judicial 
system, revising the \"Ley Faundes\" as Legislator Rubio has 
proposed would send the wrong message, leaving Magistrate 
Pereira and his colleagues \"above the law\" while civil 
society clamors to reduce the privileges and immunities of 
top public officials. 
 
 
6.  (C) Since President Torrijos took office on September 1, 
Panamanians have speculated about how he would get rid of 
Moscoso\'s least-liked and most criticized appointees, 
including Cesar Pereira, Winston Spadafora, and Alberto 
Cigarruista.  (NOTE: An allegation that PRD legislators were 
paid off to approve the Spadafora and Cigarruista 
appointments has not been proven.  END NOTE.)  The entire 
Torrijos administration has been very careful not to overtly 
violate the separation of powers despite the de facto synergy 
between the PRD executive and the PRD legislative majority. 
No matter whether Pereira stays or goes, to boost the 
rock-bottom credibility of Panama\'s highest court, President 
Torrijos must appoint Supreme Court magistrates who are above 
reproach.  Assuming that Pereira will stay, as he shows every 
sign of doing, Magistrate Arturo Hoyos\' December 2004 
departure when his ten-year term ends will be an early test 
of Torrijos\' resolve to make good his campaign pledge of 
depoliticizing Panama\'s highest court. 
 
 
7.  (C) In private conversations with the Ambassador, 
President Torrijos and senior members of his cabinet have 
repeatedly expressed their high level of frustration with the 
Supreme Court.  The President is clearly considering options 
as to how to ease out at least some of the most controversial 
justices.  As the new government struggles to investigate the 
well-covered tracks of Moscoso administration corruption, the 
tawdry state of the Supreme Court impedes serious judicial 
consideration of these and other corruption cases.

SUMMARY

1.  (C)  Panamanian Public Forces and Embassy Officers 
contributed to record detainee transfers and cocaine captures 
in recent weeks, as part of on-going counter-drug Operation 
Panama Express task force operations.  On September 21, 
Panama National Maritime Service (SMN) marines, Panamanian 
Public Forces (PPF) members, and EmbOffs transferred 19 
Colombian detainees and evidentiary cocaine from a 14.5 ton 
high-seas seizure to an awaiting USG aircraft at Tocumen 
International Airport.  On October 4, EmbOffs joined the PPF 
for another transfer of 16 Colombians from a 12.5 ton cocaine 
seizure.  In total the two operations reaped 35 detainees and 
27 tons of cocaine.  Each prisoner transfer operation saves 
the USG approximately $1M.  The seizures and prisoner 
transfers show that the new government (GOP) is cracking down 
on transnational crime and continuing close cooperation with 
U.S. law enforcement units.  End Summary.

transferring 35 Colombian detainees, drug and non-drug 
evidence, part of two cocaine seizures totaling 27 tons, from 
Coast Guard cutters to awaiting USG aircraft at Tocumen 
International Airport.  These operations were made possible 
by the Salas-Becker shipriders agreement and comprise part of 
an on-going counter-drug task force, called Operation Panama 
Express based out of Tampa, Florida.  Panamanian National 
Maritime Service (SMN) marines armed with AK-47s along with 
Panamanian National Police (PNP) escorts guarded the 
detainees throughout their short time in Panama.  During the 
September 21 operation, an SMN patrol boat towed the 
unflagged freighter, Lina Maria, which had been captured near 
the Galapagos Islands, into port near the Canal Entrance 
(former Rodman Naval Base).  Coast Guard law enforcement 
teams discovered 14.5 tons of cocaine concealed in a sealed 
ballast tank.  Once the cocaine was removed, the Lina Maria 
listed heavily to one side, complicating the tow.  The 
seasoned SMN sailors and marines made the operation appear 
easy. 
 
 
3.  (U)  Marking the 38th transfer conducted in Panama since 
the Salas-Becker Bilateral Agreement took effect in 2002, 
which details cooperation between the U.S. Coast Guard and 
the GOP,s SMN.  These transfers account for more than 350 
detainees and drug seizures, most involving cocaine.  Prior 
to the Salas-Becker Bilateral Agreement and others like it in 
Guatemala and Nicaragua, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard 
transited prisoners to the U.S. via ship.  The International 
Maritime Interdiction Support (IMIS) clause of the 
Salas-Becker accord details the protocols for detainee 
transfers and keeps USG ships in the transit zone, 
subsequently saving U.S. taxpayers an estimated $1M in 
operating costs for each operation. 
 
 
---------------- 
ON THE SAME TEAM 
---------------- 
 
 
4.  (C)  Lt. Angel Franco, the team leader for the Panamanian 
Maritime Marines told PolOff that the Panamanian Public 
Forces enjoy supporting counter-drug operations, but worry 
about increased illicit drug and arms trafficking in Panama. 
(Note: Recently, the  PNP seized a fishing boat with 36 
high-caliber weapons, including 33 AK-47s and ample munitions 
believed to be en route to the FARC. Emb will report in 
SepTel.  End Note).  SMN marines told PolOff the problem is 
clearly transnational, bragging (inaccurately) that \"not one 
Panamanian has ever been arrested for drug trafficking.\"  The 
SMN marines compared themselves to U.S. Marines and presented 
themselves as part of the U.S. drug enforcement effort.  Lt. 
Franco pointed out some of the limitations of the Panamanian 
marine team in that each one earns about $300 monthly before 
taxes, and each must pay for uniforms, radios and personal 
equipment.  He noted that while motivated, his colleagues are 
often under-equipped and SMN patrol boats frequently cannot 
respond due to lack of fuel.  Despite these shortages, he 
said, the SMN sees counter-drug operations as an assault on a 
scourge affecting both the USG and GOP, but one which for 
them, hits closer to home.  The new Torrijos government has 
continued seamless support for counter-drug operations which 
cost them fuel and human resources that are in critically 
short supply. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
5.  (C)  Panama PPF conduct detainee transfers with 
professionalism and little fanfare.  They have been well 
trained.  Embassy has used IMET funds to train SMN Marines in 
the U.S.  Also, U.S. military experts provide frequent 
training sessions locally via ODC, NAS or DHS (CG/ICE).  This 
breadth of training is now paying big dividends as visiting 
USG teams often comment on the PPF,s high level of 
proficiency and law enforcement knowledge.  Law enforcement 
officials working in Panama enjoy the close proximity between 
the SMN base (former Rodman Naval Base) and Tocumen 
International Airport.  Continuous governmental support and 
the professionalism of the public forces contribute greatly 
to the success of this on-going counter-drug operations.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (SBU) WHA DAS Dan Fisk and Ambassador Watt, with POL 
Counselor and NAS Director, visited three locales in Panama\'s 
rugged and remote Darien province October 6, including the 
provincial capital, La Palma.  They spent the day viewing 
Panamanian National Police (PNP) border installations, 
greeting Darien\'s newly named governor, inspecting USAID 
projects, and meeting with local representatives.  Newly 
appointed PNP Director Gustavo Perez, who assumed office on 
September 1, accompanied the Ambassador and DAS Fisk.  The 
trip provided Perez with his first opportunity to inspect PNP 
bases at all three stops and talk with his officers in the 
field.  NAS Director briefed Perez on NAS assistance projects 
in the Darien.  The visit confirmed earlier impressions that 
the PNP has enhanced its presence in the Darien in recent 
years but it will need additional resources to firmly 
establish government control in the province.  End Summary. 
 
 
Puerto Obaldia 
-------------- 
2.  (SBU) The Embassy\'s chartered plane touched down first in 
Puerto Obaldia, a Caribbean coast settlement of 500 
inhabitants about an hour by air from Panama City.  The town 
is very close to the border and is separated from Colombia by 
a high ridge.  DAS Fisk and the Ambassador accepted PNP 
Director Perez\'s offer to fly them to the border about a mile 
away at La Miel in his helicopter, which shadowed the 
chartered plane\'s movements during the day.  After inspecting 
a gun emplacement on the shore, the party visited a PNP 
barracks and command center.  Also, two armed PNP go-fast 
patrol boats were anchored in the harbor.  The Department\'s 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs 
(INL) has donated two other patrol boats to the PNP, one of 
which was in La Palma when the group arrived. 
 
 
Some Geography 
-------------- 
3.  (SBU) The northern Darien border region (on Panama\'s 
Atlantic Coast) is extremely rugged, covered with thick 
rainforest, and is the source of the north-to-south-flowing 
rivers that crisscross the province.  The province is dotted 
with many abandoned dirt airstrips, some of them 
WWII-vintage.  Taken together, the difficult, practically 
vacant terrain and shoreline (the province\'s population is 
50,000), forest cover, airstrips, and meandering rivers make 
it an ideal habitat for guerrillas, narcotraffickers, and 
people smugglers. 
 
 
La Palma 
-------- 
4.  (SBU) Next stop was La Palma, the provincial capital, 
situated on the broad, scenic Tuira River estuary.  Newly 
named provincial governor Juana Lopez and the Alcalde (mayor) 
came to greet the Ambassador and DAS Fisk at the airstrip. 
The party moved to the municipal offices where a roomful of 
local citizens were waiting.  After the Ambassador gave an 
impromptu speech, many of the citizens presented petitions 
for local projects they wanted the Embassy to consider 
funding.  The Ambassador thanked the group for their 
confidence in the United States but suggested that they bring 
their needs to the attention of Panamanian government 
representatives in the first instance.  Ambassador and DAS 
Fisk also toured PNP installations. 
 
 
Sambu 
----- 
5.  (SBU) In Sambu (also called Boca de Sabalo), the 
Ambassador and DAS Fisk inspected USAID projects designed to 
help local citizens (both indigenous Embera and 
Afro-Panamanians) build community centers to host tourists. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
6.  (SBU) Throughout the visit, 10-20 armed PNP personnel 
provided security, whether by helicopter or patrol boat. 
Their presence underscored the continuing reality that, in 
many areas of the Darien, the PNP is the Panamanian 
government\'s only presence.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Despite the continued absence of funding for the 
anti-TIP law enacted in March 2004 (see Reftel A) and a 
recent change in administration, Panama\'s Judicial Police 
(PTJ) and prosecutors have continued to push the TIP agenda. 
They have publicized the anti-TIP law, created a specialized 
section for child sexual exploitation, extended anti-TIP 
efforts to the provinces, and fostered inter-governmental 
cooperation.  Institutionalizing the anti-TIP effort within 
the PTJ and the Prosecutor\'s office at the technical level 
has created momentum in the GOP\'s anti-TIP efforts.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
PTJ PUBLICIZES NEW ANTI-TIP LAW 
------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (U)  On October 6, the PTJ publicized its new Sexual 
Exploitation Section with a launch ceremony and news 
conference.  On the same date, the PTJ\'s Sex Crimes Unit 
Chief Ana Cajar appeared on the program Caracol to publicize 
the anti-TIP law and Sexual Exploitation Section.  Since the 
anti-TIP law was passed, Chief Cajar and PTJ officials have 
spoken at several schools and two universities to publicize 
the new law and raise awareness about the problem of sexual 
exploitation of children.  The PTJ\'s Public Affairs Office 
prepared brochures for the launch ceremony explaining Sexual 
Exploitation of Minors, the cases the Sexual Exploitation 
Section handles, and the problem of sexual predation.  As 
funding under the new-TIP law (which has a designated tax 
source) becomes available, the PTJ plans to distribute the 
brochures at police intake rooms and in schools in 
cooperation with the Ministry of Education. 
 
 
------------------------ 
FOCUS OF NEW SECTION 
------------------------ 
 
 
3.  (U)  The PTJ created the Sexual Exploitation Section to 
fulfill its obligations under its new anti-TIP law.  The 
section serves both citizen and foreign minors in Panama who 
have been sexually exploited.  The Sexual Exploitation 
Section can initiate its own investigations, conduct 
undercover operations, and monitor computers with court 
approval.  The PTJ\'s already existing Sex Crimes Unit directs 
the new section, which handles cases of corruption of minors, 
pimping, international sex trafficking, child pornography, 
and sex tourism. 
 
 
4.  (U)  Through September 2004, the Sexual Exploitation 
Section opened 15 cases with eight of those cases in 
September alone.  One-third of the cases involved child 
prostitution, another third involved pimping or prostitution, 
and two cases involved sex trafficking. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
EXTENSION TO THE PROVINCES 
-------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (U)  The PTJ has extended the reach of the Sexual 
Exploitation Section outside of Panama City by naming 
investigators and support personnel in provinces to 
coordinate the new section.  Activist prosecutors in the 
provinces, especially the Darien, created greater TIP 
awareness within other ministries.  By pursuing new cases, 
the prosecutors involved more ministries through their 
efforts to protect and provide services to victims. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION 
----------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (U)  Family Court Judge President Esmeralda Arosemena de 
Troitino, Sex Crimes Prosecutor Maruquel Castroverde, Chief 
Cajar, and PTJ Director General Erick Bravo Dutary all spoke 
during the October 6 launch of the Sexual Exploitation 
Section.  Judge Arosemena explained the challenges in 
providing assistance to victims.  Prosecutor Castroverde 
spoke passionately about the new tools the anti-TIP law 
provides and encouraged witnesses to come forward. 
Prosecutor Castroverde stated that while the Prosecutor\'s Sex 
Crimes Office lacks resources, it will still get the job 
done.  Chief Cajar stressed the need to investigate cases 
using undercover operations and her belief that sexual 
exploitation of minors is linked to international crime. 
COMMENT 
7.  (SBU)  Efforts to implement and publicize the anti-TIP 
law throughout Panama indicate that the PTJ and Prosecutors 
have a strong institutionalized commitment to combat sex 
trafficking of minors regardless of agency resources.  As 
will be discussed in septel on victim protection, Minister of 
Youth Leonor Calderon expects the Attorney General to convene 
the Commission created by the anti-TIP law on November 26, 
making additional anti-TIP resources available.  The PTJ news 
conference represented an inexpensive way for the PTJ and the 
Sex Crimes Prosecutor to keep sexual exploitation on the 
agenda.  While the Torrijos administration has recently 
nominated Esmeralda Arosemena to the Supreme Court in a 
controversial move to replace Justice Cesar Pereira (see 
reftel B), anti-child exploitation advocates expect her to 
remain committed to combating TIP.  Despite the 
intergovernmental approach, the PTJ still faces coordination 
challenges in implementing the new law with the National 
Police, who require more anti-TIP training.

     B. PANAMA 1963 
 
 
Classified By: Charge Christopher J. McMullen for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
 
SUMMARY: ELECTORAL DEFEAT = REFORM DEMANDS 
------------------------------------------ 
1.  (C) Up-and-coming Arnulfista Party (PA) leaders will not 
wait for Party President Mireya Moscoso to complete her term 
in January 2006 before trying to rebuild the party, ideally 
minus her.  After the PA\'s meager third-place finish (16.4% 
of popular vote) in Panama\'s May 2004 presidential election 
and woeful showing of only 16 of 78 legislative seats, 
Moscoso opponents are calling for her head.  She probably 
will not survive the party\'s January 2005 national 
convention.  Numerous corruption scandals during Mireya 
Moscoso\'s 1999-2004 presidency violated the letter and spirit 
of her campaign promises to clean up Panamanian politics, and 
led the Party\'s coalition to disastrous defeat at the polls. 
Meanwhile, Moscoso\'s iron-fisted control of the party bred 
many enemies.  Among the Young Turks, Juan Carlos Varela has 
been her most vocal opponent.  Brothers Francisco and Marco 
Ameglio are also pushing for reform.  Legislator Jose Isabel 
Blandon and PA Secretary General Carlos Raul Piad have 
approached the situation more delicately, but also with an 
eye toward reform.  The reformers, who claim to have broad 
support within the party, call for making PA bodies and 
procedures more democratic and transparent by removing Mireya 
Moscoso as PA President and renaming the PA as \"Partido 
Panamenista.\"  They differ on which measure to prioritize and 
how to time reforms.  Embassy expects major changes in PA 
leadership and structure at its January 16, 2005 convention. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
PUSHING AND ACCELERATING REFORM 
------------------------------- 
2.  (C) Second-term legislator Jose Isabel Blandon Figueroa 
claims credit for including a constitutional clause last July 
requiring Panama\'s political parties to have \"democratic 
structures\" in the reform package now before the Legislative 
Assembly, but he is not pushing hard for Moscoso\'s ouster. 
Blandon wants the Arnulfista Party to hold mandatory 
primaries for all elected positions and internal elections 
for party leadership positions.  Blandon privately told POL 
specialist in August that he believes PA Board elections 
should come sometime after PA bylaws are reformed during the 
January 2005 national convention.  Blandon told EmbOffs at a 
September lunch with other Arnulfista legislators that 
Moscoso would step down from her PA Board position prior to 
January 2006 only if asked by the PA national convention 
delegates.  On this issue, Blandon appears to be leaving his 
options open. 
 
 
3.  (C) Businessman Juan Carlos Varela\'s lobbying efforts at 
all levels of the party hierarchy make him the most vocal 
advocate for removing the current PA Board of Directors 
(including Moscoso) well before January 2006.  In fact, the 
Varelas\' faction wants Moscoso out by January 2005.  Varela 
has proposed that reforms to PA bylaws be implemented as 
early as November 28.  He recently confided to POL Counselor 
that \"big changes would happen soon.\"  On 10/20, La Prensa 
reported that Legislator Jose Luis Varela (Juan Carlos\' 
brother) claimed that 70% of Arnulfista convention delegates 
were prepared to accept the resignation of the entire PA 
Board on November 28.  On 10/26, Marco Ameglio presented to 
PA Secretary General Carlos Raul Piad a petition signed by 
380 of 598 convention delegates (64%, much more than the 
legal minimum of 30% established in the Electoral Code) to 
hold the PA national convention on November 28 instead of 
January 16.  Ameglio brothers Marco and Francisco (both 
ex-legislators) share the Varelas\' desire to remove top party 
leadership quickly, but the two camps\' allegiance to one 
another may well end there.  (COMMENT: The Ameglios presented 
their petition with Jose Luis Varela, among others; however, 
given Marco\'s well-known desire to run for President, he is 
likely to lunge hard into the resulting power vacuum, ready 
to fight the Varelas for the 2009 presidential nomination if 
Moscoso resigns.  END COMMENT.) 
 
 
COMMENT: WHAT\'S IN A NAME? 
-------------------------- 
4.  (C) Changing the name of the Arnulfista Party would allow 
several well-known outcasts to rejoin the party leadership as 
well as rejuvenate the PA\'s group identity.  Between 1999 and 
2004, the PA expelled several strong leaders, including 
ex-President Guillermo Endara, Juan Carlos Varela, and 
Ex-Minister of Agriculture Alejandro Posse.  PA bylaws bar 
someone who has been expelled from the party from returning. 
A new party with a new Board of Directors could welcome all 
comers and perhaps build momentum based on mutually shared 
opposition to the Torrijos administration.  And PA members 
have not forgotten that former President Endara (1989-94) won 
almost twice as many votes as Moscoso\'s candidate (Jose 
Miguel Aleman) in the May 2 election, votes that PA leaders 
want back.  Moscoso opponents, including the Ameglios and the 
Varelas, believe that a name that evokes a shared mission or 
ideology rather than Moscoso\'s deceased husband Arnulfo Arias 
would reinforce their rejection of Moscoso\'s decision to 
follow in the thrice-deposed president\'s footsteps as a 
traditional \"caudillo\" in the personalist politician mold. 
Instead, they seek to make the party a model for democratic 
practices (though critics also see a good dose of 
personalismo in the ostensible goals of the would-be 
reformers.) 
 
 
COMMENT: SOON, BUT NOT JUST YET 
------------------------------- 
5.  (C) Juan Carlos Varela told POL Counselor that he and the 
Ameglios are using the November 2004 convention proposal as a 
ploy to avoid any possibility that Moscoso may postpone the 
January 16, 2005 convention.  Stepping into the trap, Mireya 
Moscoso explained in a 10/21 radio interview that, \"the Board 
of Directors of the Arnulfista Party would have to approve 
any proposal to hold the party\'s extraordinary convention 
before the scheduled date of January 16, 2005.  No such 
proposal has been presented.\"  The Varela/Ameglio faction\'s 
proposal has upped the stakes.  After nearly resigning from 
the PA Board in May 2004, Moscoso has dug in her heels at the 
helm of the party.  When asked about the movement to unseat 
her and reform the PA as recently as September, she told a 
confidant, \"This is my party and I rule it!\"  To Juan Carlos 
Varela, Moscoso shouted over the phone, \"If you want a war, 
then I\'ll give you a war.\"  Moscoso still has plenty of 
influential allies within the party who are willing to back 
her right to stay in charge until January 2006 (including 
Blandon when it suits him).  Her opponents currently claim 
60-70% support.  While we expect that mounting pressure 
within the PA will eventually persuade Moscoso to relinquish 
control of the party, we suspect that she will try to play 
one faction against the other in order to maintain a modicum 
of influence in the party leadership.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (C)  A peaceful protest in a north coast town far from 
the capital against an electric company veered into violence 
on October 24 after a radical group exploited local tensions 
and attacked the national police (PNP) with iron bars and 
Molotov cocktails, injuring 28 people including 24 officers. 
The PNP released all 22 detainees after the incident on a 
judge\'s order, who cited improper arrest procedures.  The GOP 
continues its dialog with the local community to reduce the 
prospect of more violence.  This confrontation revealed a key 
PNP vulnerability -- i.e., its inability to respond 
effectively to violence in remote areas.  It is a 
vulnerability that mischief-makers, including radical labor 
leaders, could exploit to their advantage.  End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
DISGUST WITH BANANA COMPANY\'S ELECTRICAL SERVICE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
2.  (U)  On October 22, several hundred irate residents of 
Almirante, Bocas del Toro blocked the road connecting the 
plantations of the Bocas Fruit Company (BFC) to the capital 
with burning tires and 55 gallon drums filled with stones. 
The BFC supplies Bocas residents with electricity and potable 
water.  Residents already frustrated with a thirteen-hour 
power and water outage, turned to protest when a power surge 
caused a fire that gutted several apartment buildings.  The 
power outage had disabled the town\'s water system and 
firefighters lacked water to extinguish the blaze. 
 
 
3.  (U)  Earlier this month, Almirante and other Bocas 
residents blocked the BFC road in a peaceful protest after 
the BFC raised the price of electricity.  Following 
high-level GOP intervention, the residents opened the road 
after the BFC agreed to reverse the price hike. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
BAD COPS INFILTRATE PROTEST... 
------------------------------ 
 
 
4.  (C)  According to one government account, on October 24 
the peaceful protest turned violent because former PNP 
officer and convicted drug trafficker Nazario (or Nazareno) 
Silvano Gonzalez and dozens of his cronies infiltrated the 
peaceful protesters.  Gonzalez\'s followers included other 
former PNP officers dismissed for drug offenses.  When PNP 
officers attempted to clear the road with tear gas, criminal 
elements threw Molotov cocktails, stones, and fireworks. 
They attacked PNP officers with metal bars, breaking arms and 
legs.  They also kidnapped three PNP officers and held them 
for five hours.  Some 28 people were injured, some of them 
seriously, including 24 police officers.  According to one 
governmental source, the original community marchers withdrew 
from the protest when it turned violent.  Government 
officials believe Gonzalez escaped to Costa Rica. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
...OR WAS IT A LEFTIST UNION? 
----------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (C)  According to other police and government sources, 
leftist construction workers union SUNTRACS (see reftel) 
joined the protest on October 23 and incited the group to 
violence.  Police observed the Bocas SUNTRACS leader and 
numerous red SUNTRACS flags at the scene. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DETAINEES RELEASED, CLAIM POLICE ABUSE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  The PNP detained 22 people in connection with the 
protests.  Despite Minister of Government and Justice Hector 
Aleman\'s reported vow to use a \"hard hand\" against the 
violent protesters, the PNP released the detainees during the 
evening of October 26 after municipal judge Teresa Morales 
ruled that Almirante officials did not follow proper 
procedures in making the arrests.  The released detainees 
claim that the PNP brutally beat them in detention and the 
media published pictures of their injuries. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  On October 27, SUNTRACS formally asked the 
Ombudsman\'s office to investigate.  The Ombudsman\'s office, 
which sent a fact-finding mission to Bocas del Toro to 
investigate on October 26, plans to ask the PNP\'s office of 
internal affairs and the Ministry of Government and Justice 
for a report.  The GOP is maintaining a dialog with Almirante 
residents, who acknowledge that the government has been 
helpful. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
8.  (C)  The violence reflects poorly on the PNP\'s ability to 
maintain order in one of Panama\'s more remote areas.  PNP 
officers failed to control the crowds and failed to defend 
themselves from an admittedly violent gang of thugs, leading 
to a large number of police injuries.  PNP detentions did not 
withstand judicial scrutiny.  Gonzalez and some of his 
cronies are former PNP agents.  While Gonzalez and other 
instigators do not appear to be big time traffickers, the 
PNP\'s inability to control even \"small fry\" in this 
drug-soaked region looks bad.  And one can only speculate why 
a judge freed all 22 detainees accused of aggravated assault 
after MOGJ Aleman said publicly that he would take a hard 
line with violent offenders.  To top it off, the evidence 
suggests that the detainees were abused in police custody. 
While GOP sources have portrayed the violence as an isolated 
incident caused by \"habitual criminals,\" violence could 
reemerge if the GOP cannot put an end to recurring disputes 
that pit citizens against the Bocas Fruit Company. 
 
 
9.  (C)  The alleged participation of Cuban-funded SUNTRACS 
in the violent protest could portend more opportunistic 
violence.  SUNTRACS led violent protests in Panama City in 
September 2003 following the dismissal of Social Security 
Chief Ian Jovane.  Nonetheless, fears by rank-and-file PNP 
officers that the release of the protesters augurs open 
season on PNP officers appear overblown.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) On behalf of Embassy Panama I would like to extend 
our warmest welcome on your upcoming November 13-14, 2004 
visit to Panama.  Your presence here as the government of 
Martin Torrijos enters its third month signals the great 
interest of the United States in strengthening our excellent 
relations with the Panamanians.  (Secretary of State Colin 
Powell visited Panama on November 3, 2003 to attend Panama\'s 
Centennial celebrations and on September 1, 2004 to attend 
the presidential inauguration.  See Reftel A.)  Cooperation 
on a wide range of issues -- including security and law 
enforcement policy -- promises to reach new levels under the 
new government.  Elected as a modernizing, anti-corruption 
reformer by the largest post-1989 plurality on record, 
Torrijos has made clear that his most important foreign 
policy priority is relations with the United States and that 
he intends to deepen our mutual focus on counter-terrorism 
capabilities, combating international criminal networks, and 
expanding trade and investment.  Torrijos is the first 
Panamanian president elected after the handover of the Canal 
on December 31, 1999 and the final withdrawal of U.S. forces. 
 U.S. relations with Panama are more mature than in the past, 
based on mutual economic and security interests. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) In his September 1 inaugural address, Torrijos 
clearly identified his government\'s principal priorities as 
sustainable economic development and poverty alleviation, 
investment, fiscal reform, increased government transparency, 
and job creation.  The new president and his Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) -- largely purged of its former 
anti-democratic, anti-U.S. tendencies and holding an absolute 
majority in the Legislative Assembly -- faced large 
challenges from the outset: a serious budget shortfall and 
tide of red ink left by the out-going government; urgently 
required action to right the nation\'s foundering retirement 
and medical system (the Social Security Fund); restoring 
public confidence in government institutions and the rule of 
law; completing the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with 
the United States; launching a more activist and \"coherent\" 
foreign policy (including closer relations with Western 
Europe and a review of Panama\'s relations with Taiwan and 
China); and a decision on how to proceed on Canal expansion, 
leading to a 2005 national referendum.  The GOP has responded 
to the deficit by, among other measures, proposing reductions 
in security spending, which will adversely affect Panama\'s 
ability to respond to transnational threats.  End Summary. 
 
 
The Political Landscape: Torrijos and a New Generation 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
3.  (SBU) Martin Erasto Torrijos Espino won Panama\'s May 2, 
2004 general elections by a local landslide (47% of the 
popular vote), while his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
was propelled to a lopsided victory (42 out of 78 legislative 
seats).  Torrijos has surrounded himself with young, 
primarily US-educated professionals like himself and has 
changed the face of the PRD by marginalizing \"old guard\" 
supporters of former President Ernesto Perez Balladares 
(1994-99).  Torrijos and those closest to him have indicated 
that they intend to work closely with U.S. officials, 
especially on security, law enforcement, trade and 
investment.  Overall, his cabinet appointments have been 
inspired choices -- many of them young technocrats with a 
pro-U.S. outlook.  Most of Torrijos\'s cabinet appointments 
are respected professionals without excessive baggage from 
Panama\'s 21-year military dictatorship or the PRD\'s anti-U.S. 
faction, a promising sign.  Anticipated pressures from a 
well-entrenched oligarchy could frustrate the Torrijos 
administration\'s reform plans. 
 
 
Promoting Good Governance 
------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) After campaigning on a \"zero-corruption\" platform, 
Torrijos launched numerous anti-corruption investigations and 
initiatives in the opening weeks of his administration.  His 
most controversial action was his recent removal and 
replacement of Supreme Court President Cesar Pereira Burgos, 
who had passed retirement age, in a bid to clean up Panama\'s 
politicized Supreme Court.  This Embassy launched a strong 
Good Governance initiative with Ambassador Watt\'s 2003 speech 
against official corruption.  That speech resonated firmly 
with Panamanians from all walks of life and generated 
front-page headlines.  In a more recent speech the Ambassador 
warned that poverty could pose dangers for democracy and that 
skewed income distribution and social injustice increase the 
appeal of unscrupulous populist demagogues.  The Embassy 
currently supports good governance activities directed toward 
judicial reform, civic education, business ethics, and 
strengthening the anti-corruption prosecutors\' institutional 
capacity.  An important element of the Embassy\'s Good 
Governance initiative is its visa revocation program.  Based 
on Embassy recommendations, the State Department recently 
revoked the U.S. visas of two former senior GOP officials, 
which provoked a spate of mostly favorable press commentary 
and huge support (85% according to one poll) from average 
Panamanians.  Several other corrupt officials have lost their 
visas for money laundering or related issues. 
 
 
Security and Law Enforcement Policy 
----------------------------------- 
5.  (C) President Torrijos came to office with a clear focus 
on security matters highly compatible with our own priorities 
of canal and maritime security and combating terrorism and 
transnational crime.  His government is taking steps to 
impose order, efficiency, and organization on Panama\'s 
security agencies.  On May 12, 2004 the U.S. and Panama 
signed a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) Shipboarding 
Agreement, underscoring the excellent bilateral cooperation 
that the new GOP has assured us will continue or improve. 
Despite its intentions, the Panamanian government (GOP) will 
be hard pressed to find the financial means, for example, to 
adequately patrol Panama\'s long Caribbean and Atlantic 
coastlines or to secure Panama\'s porous border with Colombia 
against guerrilla infiltration. 
 
 
Security Cooperation 
-------------------- 
6.  (SBU) Panama\'s sovereignty sensitivities are slowly 
receding with recognition that the challenge of securing the 
Canal and Panama\'s borders requires a more mature and 
collaborative bilateral relationship.  Panama early on joined 
the Coalition of the Willing.  It signed and, on October 8, 
2003, ratified a bilateral Article 98 Agreement.  Related to 
Canal and border security, Panamanians have become much more 
willing to accept mil-to-mil security training, equipment, 
and other assistance, as was shown during the August 2004 
multinational Panamax naval exercise that centered on Canal 
defense.  The GOP has welcomed Amb. Watt\'s initiative to 
increase the number of Medical Readiness Exercises and other 
DOD humanitarian programs that provide much-needed assistance 
to rural Panamanians.  During last year\'s New Horizons 
exercise both the GOP and local press praised U.S. military 
for constructing schools and clinics.  The next New Horizons 
begins February 2005.  Together, these programs highlight the 
humanitarian side of the U.S. military and foster positive 
public perceptions of the USG. 
 
 
National Security Planning Workshop 
----------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) During August 11-13 the Embassy organized an 
offsite bilateral National Security Planning workshop, which 
Torrijos and virtually the entire new cabinet attended, 
giving us an excellent opportunity to get to know the 
incoming officials on a personal level and to begin concrete 
discussions on security matters.  As a counterpoint, the GOP 
recently turned down our proposal to establish an 
International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Panama, 
fearing that political heat could derail its domestic 
legislative priorities.  This demonstrates that sensitivities 
about U.S. security and law enforcement cooperation still 
linger. 
 
 
Our Third Border 
---------------- 
8.  (C) Canal security and its continued viability remain 
essential to our domestic security and economic interests. 
Although the present terrorist threat to the Canal is 
considered low, it remains an inviting, hard-to-defend 
target.  Panamanian planning, risk assessment, layered 
defenses and security resources are generally well regarded. 
Continued U.S. training, equipment and other assistance are 
vital to preempt a terrorist attack.  To protect water 
resources, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has committed to 
match dollar-for-dollar AID\'s three-year US$2.5 million 
integrated watershed management program.  Panama committed to 
a robust maritime security agenda, which has led to its 
timely adoption of the new International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) International Shipping and Port Security 
(ISPS) Code, which entered into force July 1, 2004.  Despite 
significant progress, Panama continues to be an important 
transit point for drug smugglers, money launderers, illicit 
arms merchants, and undocumented immigrants heading north. 
We have every expectation that GOP-Embassy cooperation on 
these matters will continue to be excellent.  While the GOP 
has pressed us for closer cooperation on intelligence sharing 
on Canal and maritime issues, U.S. intelligence agencies have 
failed to respond to GOP proposals that would enhance our own 
homeland security, despite considerable prodding from this 
Embassy. 
 
 
Darien, Atlantic Coast 
---------------------- 
9.  (C) Torrijos aims to establish a greater GOP presence at 
the Panama-Colombia border and along the Atlantic coast to 
improve civilian-police relations, intelligence gathering, 
and security.  The new government has proposed rehabilitating 
WWII-era landing strips in the Darien and on the Atlantic 
Coast, lessening the use of helicopters, and increasing 
reliance on cheaper-to-operate single-engine fixed-wing 
aircraft.  By improving landing fields and communication with 
remote areas, Torrijos hopes to lure more teachers and 
medical personnel to serve there, create local goodwill, and 
give the government more intelligence capability and control. 
 The Embassy has been working to convince the GOP to pay more 
attention to the Atlantic coast city of Colon, where a vacuum 
of state authority has attracted organized violent crime, 
drug smugglers, and money launderers (including a worrisome 
Colombian element). 
 
 
Maritime Security 
----------------- 
10.  (SBU) The GOP has sent strong signals that it intends to 
clamp down on what it calls abuses countenanced by previous 
governments in administering Panama\'s open ship registry and 
mariner identification documents.  Panama\'s ship registry now 
is the world\'s largest and comprises around one-quarter of 
the world\'s ocean-going fleet (5,525 large commercial 
vessels).  About 13% of US ocean-going cargo transits the 
Canal each year.  Panama\'s seafarer registry currently 
licenses over 264,000 crewmembers.  In response to our 
homeland security concerns, the new GOP had announced 
intentions to greatly improve security and transparency in 
documenting ships and the crews that work on them.  Panama 
has privatized and developed some former U.S. military ports 
and other related facilities.  Port services grew 
dramatically from about 200,000 containers per year in the 
early 1990s to 2 million by 2003.  Panama now boasts the 
leading complex of port facilities in Latin America. 
 
 
\"Legacy\" Issue One -- Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
11.  (C) Under the 1979 Carter-Torrijos Panama Canal 
treaties, the United States was obligated to clean up the 
former firing ranges (comprising around 2% of the former 
Canal Zone) \"to the point practicable.\"  The USG believes 
that it has fulfilled that obligation.  Any further attempt 
to remove unexploded ordnance from the former ranges (or 
\"poligonos,\" as they are called locally) would be dangerous, 
prohibitively costly, and damaging to the environment, 
particularly because the former ranges often form part of the 
rainforest watershed that is critical to Canal operations. 
The GOP never responded to the USG\'s offer several years ago 
of training and technical assistance to foster responsible 
environmental management of former rangeland areas.  Areas 
where unexploded ordnance remains are not appropriate for 
development and should be permanently sealed off from human 
access.  The GOP recently built an access road for Panama\'s 
second trans-Canal bridge that skirts the former \"Empire\" 
firing range, on the west side of the Canal, an action that 
raises the possibility that people will be injured or killed 
by UXO in those areas.  Unexploded ordnance on the former 
firing ranges continues to attract comment in the local 
press.  Many Panamanians believe that the USG should be 
obligated to \"do something\" about the UXO problem.  Despite 
that, we believe the present GOP will not make an issue of 
the poligonos, fearing that doing so will harm bilateral 
relations.  Ambassador Watt has stated repeatedly in public 
remarks that the USG has fulfilled its treaty obligations. 
 
 
\"Legacy\" Issue Two -- Unexploded Chemical Weapons on San 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Jose Island 
----------- 
12.  (C) The issue of UXO in the former firing ranges near 
the Canal (see para 11 above) and the issue of unexploded 
chemical weapons on privately-owned San Jose Island often are 
conflated and confused in the public mind.  During World War 
II U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom military forces used 
San Jose Island in the Las Perlas Archipelago to test 
chemical weapons (such as mustard gas).  Several years ago, 
after local developers identified the island (which lies off 
Panama\'s Pacific coast) as a potential tourism site, the 
Panamanian government filed a complaint with the Organization 
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. 
An OPCW report, conducted during July 12-18, 2001 and dated 
Aug. 14, 2001, indicated the presence of numerous intact 
weapons (500 lb. and 1,000 lb. bombs), partially intact 
weapons, and fragments of weapons lying on the surface in 
nine separate sites.  Since that time, at least five intact 
weapons have been found.  Following months of negotiation, in 
the summer of 2003 the USG made a fair and equitable offer to 
help Panama to clean up the identified unexploded ordnance on 
the island.  The GOP refused the offer on Sept. 5, 2003, 
mainly because of the offer,s \"quit claim\" language.  The 
issue of chemical weapons on San Jose Island continues to 
attract much comment in the local and international press. 
With Panama,s rejection of our offer, the USG considers the 
matter of San Jose Island closed. 
 
 
Foreign Policy 
-------------- 
13.  (C) Torrijos has made clear that his top foreign policy 
priority is the United States.  Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis 
Navarro traveled to Washington in May 2004 to meet with 
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and other senior 
officials at State and the NSC.  Minister of Government and 
Justice Hector Aleman traveled to Washington in October 2004 
for meetings with Pentagon and State Department officials. 
Next on the priority list is Colombia, Panama\'s giant, 
troubled neighbor, and Torrijos has traveled three times to 
meet President Uribe.  One negative item on that bilateral 
agenda is the large number of undocumented Colombian 
immigrants in Panama, conservatively estimated in excess of 
100,000 people.  Many ordinary Panamanians are growing 
resentful of illegal Colombians because of job displacement, 
and the new government has pledged to put an end to illegal 
immigration practices.  Torrijos already has toured capitals 
in Western Europe and South America and promises a new, more 
activist, more \"coherent\" foreign policy to support Panama\'s 
global interests.  (See Reftel B.)  The GOP would like to 
attract European investment and tourists and is negotiating 
new direct air routes between Panama and Western European 
capitals, such as Paris and Madrid. 
 
 
Taiwan/China Rivalry over Panama 
-------------------------------- 
14.  (C) Panama is Taiwan\'s most important formal diplomatic 
relationship.  Rivalry between the PRC and Taiwan in Panama 
will continue to simmer below the surface.  In the past 
Panama has been quite skillful in leveraging its diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan to extract maximum resources from both 
sides, in particular from Taiwan.  The Moscoso 
administration\'s considerably less-than-transparent use of 
millions of dollars of Taiwan government funds now is a 
political hot potato in Panama.  Both Taiwan and China have 
made contributions to Panamanian political campaigns. 
 
 
15.  (C) Torrijos has said that a review of relations is 
warranted.  Indeed, there are strong currents within the PRD 
that favor the PRC over Taiwan.   Torrijos has mentioned that 
Panama\'s commercial relations with the PRC are becoming 
important, as more and more China trade passes through the 
Canal, and as China is poised to become the Canal\'s 
number-two user nation.  Following PRC Vice Foreign Minister 
Zhou Wenzhong\'s June 18 visit to Panama, then-VP-elect Samuel 
Lewis asked the Ambassador how the United States would view a 
switch of diplomatic recognition by Panama to the PRC.  The 
Ambassador, after conferring with Senior State Department 
officials, replied that the United States is \"strictly 
neutral\" on recognition but would not fail to note any hint 
of direct PRC involvement in the Canal.  Lewis recently told 
POL Counselor that \"no internal discussions\" on the issue had 
yet taken place and has assured us repeatedly that Panama 
would consult closely with the Embassy when and if such 
discussions occur. 
 
 
International Trade and Investment 
---------------------------------- 
16.  (C) Economic issues top Panama\'s agenda with the United 
States.  President Moscoso pushed to move forward quickly on 
a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  Negotiations began 
in April 2004; to date the U.S. and Panama have held five 
negotiating rounds.   The Torrijos administration views a 
bilateral FTA as imperative to attract investment, increase 
exports, and make Panama competitive with the CAFTA 
countries.  Substantial work remains.  Politically sensitive 
issues include Panama\'s requests for expanded access to the 
U.S. sugar market and U.S. requests for improved agricultural 
access.  Both sides hope to conclude the talks in December 
2004. 
 
 
Canal Stewardship 
----------------- 
17.  (SBU) During the past four years the Panama Canal 
Authority (ACP) has proven itself an able administrator, 
turning the Panama Canal into an efficient and profitable 
business.  Since the 1999 handover, the ACP has reduced 
average transit times by one-third (from 36 hours to 24 
hours), has reduced accidents in Canal waters significantly, 
and has overseen large-scale upgrade and maintenance 
projects, such as widening the Gaillard Cut to allow 
simultaneous two-way transits.  The ACP also has increased 
revenues, which in FY2004 exceeded US$1 billion for the first 
time. 
 
 
Canal Expansion 
--------------- 
18.  (SBU) The Torrijos team plans to make Canal expansion a 
top priority.  It expects the ten-year, $5-7 billion project 
to construct a third set of Canal locks to be a transforming 
event for Panama that will provide jobs and set the tone 
economically for years to come.  Given the driving forces of 
international shipping -- containerization, construction of 
\"post-Panamax\" mega-ships currently unable to traverse the 
Canal, and growing trade between East Asia and the U.S. 
eastern seaboard -- the expansion is central to maintaining 
the Canal\'s future viability.  The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE) has provided feasibility and engineering 
studies for one set of locks for the proposed expansion and 
looks forward to further involvement with the ACP (Panama 
Canal Authority).  A constitutionally-required national 
referendum on the issue is likely in 2005.  Actual 
groundbreaking, if the referendum passes, could be three 
years off. 
 
 
Colon Free Zone (CFZ) -- A Source of Concern 
-------------------------------------------- 
19.  (C) An important pillar of Panama\'s service-based 
economy, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) is the largest duty free 
zone in the hemisphere and the second largest in the world. 
Offering more than just duty-free wholesale shopping, the CFZ 
draws on the strengths of Panama\'s world-class shipping and 
financial services to offer cargo services and, especially, 
credit to its customers throughout Latin America.  The \"value 
added\" provided by Zone merchants has frequently amounted to 
helping customers skirt customs duties and exchange rate laws 
in the importing country.  Law enforcement in the zone is 
weak.  More serious criminal (and terrorist) activities could 
flourish in such an environment.  To improve prospects for 
future growth, the CFZ must address its security and law 
enforcement weaknesses.   The incoming Torrijos 
administration has already begun to focus on the CFZ\'s 
weaknesses by naming a highly respected community activist to 
the Zone\'s top slot, and the Embassy is focusing assets on 
better understanding CFZ financial flows and exploring ways 
to work with the CFZ administration to strengthen 
enforcement.

FACES MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE 
 
 
REF: PANAMA 2641 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Christopher J. McMullen for Reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
 
SUMMARY: FROM LOSERS TO CONCERTED OPPOSITION 
--------------------------------------------- 
1.  (C) The strong push to reform the Arnulfista Party (PA) 
after its May 2004 electoral defeat (see reftel) raises 
questions about why it occurred, who can repair the damage, 
what are the PA\'s long-term prospects, and what it all means 
for the USG.  Most observers blame Mireya Moscoso and her 
close associates for her failed leadership of the party. 
Emerging PA leaders include erstwhile Moscoso collaborators 
who are riding the fence as well as vehement anti-Moscoso 
elements who will accept nothing less than her immediate 
resignation from the PA presidency.  The PA\'s ability to 
field a successful 2009 presidential candidate and regain 
lost ground in the Legislative Assembly hangs in the balance. 
 The future prospects of Panamanian democracy also may hang 
in the balance, as the Arnulfistas are the only party 
currently capable of mustering enough strength to effectively 
oppose President Torrijos\' stronger-than-ever Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD).  Alternatively, if the Arnulfistas 
fail, the PRD could become a ruling-party dynasty reminiscent 
of Mexico\'s PRI.  Although it is too early to make such a 
prediction, Panamanian and U.S. interests will be better 
served by a viable opposition that can check any excesses of 
the governing party. 
 
 
WHENCE THE FALL? 
---------------- 
2.  (SBU) The Arnulfista Party (PA), officially recognized by 
the Electoral Tribunal in October 1991, builds on the 
political and ideological legacy of its namesake, 
thrice-deposed President Arnulfo Arias Madrid.  Arias\'s widow 
is Mireya Moscoso, President of the Arnulfista Party (until 
January 2006), who accompanied Arias into exile in 1968 and 
learned politics from him.  At its inception, the PA had 
strong pull with anti-PRD voters, creating the potential for 
new coalitions that would easily have accounted for more than 
half of the electorate.  Prompted by recent memories of 
Panama\'s 21-year dictatorship, many Panamanians rejected what 
had been the political vehicle of Omar Torrijos and Manuel 
Noriega.  Arnulfo Arias himself was a powerful symbol. 
Deposed by the October 11, 1968 coup that initiated the 
dictatorship and \"robbed\" by an electoral fraud in his 1984 
bid for the Presidency, for decades he remained Panama\'s most 
popular politician even during the dozen odd years he spent 
in U.S. exile.  At its creation, the PA attempted to reunite 
the members of its precursor, the populist Panamenista Party, 
which had lost much of its impetus due to dictatorship-era 
repression. 
 
 
3.  (C) Rifts within the Arnulfista Party revolve around its 
direction under Mireya Moscoso\'s leadership (and whether it 
has deviated from its so-called ideological roots).  Frequent 
complaints include heavy-handed top-down management, 
undemocratic selection of party officials and candidates, and 
the corrupt image of the party\'s top leaders.  During the 
2004 campaign, Moscoso went as far as to claim legal 
ownership of Arias\'s image to inhibit former President and 
Arnulfista Guillermo Endara (a friend and confidant of 
Arnulfo Arias) from using photos and films of him with Arias 
to win traditional PA votes.  Endara, together with Moscoso 
critics within the PA, wrested credibility (and many votes) 
from the party and its 2004 presidential candidate, Jose 
Miguel Aleman, who was unable to distance himself from 
Moscoso. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The PA, even counting its allies from the 2004 
election (MOLIRENA and PLN), is at statistical disadvantage 
compared to President Torrijos\' Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD).  As of 09/30/2004, a snapshot of membership in 
Panama\'s seven legally constituted parties (about half of all 
registered voters) is: 
 
 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)            428,575 
Arnulfista Party (PA)                           175,835 
Natl. Liberal Republican Movement (MOLIRENA)     99,029 
National Liberal Party (PLN)                     75,373 
Solidarity Party (PS)                            70,710 
Democratic Change Party (CD)                     54,966 
Popular Party (PP)                               49,735 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
TOTAL                                           954,223 
 
 
Between January 2004 (the peak of the campaign) and September 
2004 (Torrijos\' inauguration), Arnulfista Party membership 
dropped 9%, as the party lost over 17,000 members (many of 
them defecting to ex-PA leader Endara).  (Only four thousand 
left the PRD in the same period.) 
 
 
WHO CAN PICK UP THE PIECES? 
--------------------------- 
5.  (SBU)  Several emerging leaders have proposed fresh ideas 
to counteract the ill effects of the PA\'s lost credibility 
and waning membership.  All of them have previous campaign 
experience.  All but one have previously worked in the public 
sector.  One sits on the PA Board of Directors that has been 
so harshly criticized.  Another was expelled from the PA in 
1999, but maintains family connections on the inside. 
 
 
UP-AND-COMERS -- THE VARELAS 
---------------------------- 
6.  (C) The well-regarded Varela brothers are working 
together to reform the Arnulfista Party from inside and out. 
The Arnulfista Party expelled Juan Carlos for supporting the 
1999 presidential campaign of Moscoso\'s competitor, banker 
Alberto Vallarino. (NOTE: PA bylaws bar someone who has been 
expelled from the party from returning, but Varela would be 
free to return if the party changed its name as proposed. 
(See Reftel.)  END NOTE.)  Juan Carlos\'s brother Jose Luis 
(\"Popi\") was re-elected to a second term in the Legislative 
Assembly with the Arnulfista Party in May 2004.  Juan Carlos 
and Jose Luis are two of four sons of Luis Jose Varela Sr. 
The family owns one of Panama\'s biggest liquor distilleries 
and distributors, Varela Hermanos, S.A.  Juan Carlos manages 
liquor distribution while a third brother, Luis Jose Jr., 
manages production. 
 
 
THE AMEGLIO BROTHERS 
-------------------- 
7.  (C) Marco (DOB: 28 FEB 1961) and Francisco (DOB: 21 JAN 
1954) Ameglio are dynamic leaders who have consistently 
worked in unison.  Francisco has now willingly taken a back 
seat to Marco, a legislator during fifteen years (1989-2004) 
who was President of the Legislative Assembly at age 30 
(1991-92) and ran for Mayor of Panama City in May 2004.  A 
testament to his popularity with urban voters, Electoral 
Tribunal statistics show that Marco Ameglio won more votes in 
his mayoral bid from Panama City voters (100,322) than Aleman 
won in his presidential bid in the entire province of Panama 
(83,680).  Marco\'s current aspiration appears to be securing 
the 2009 PA nomination for president and beginning to 
campaign ASAP.  Marco, who was a pre-candidate for the 
party\'s 2004 presidential nomination, has not forgiven 
Moscoso for orchestrating his embarrassing loss during the 
June 2003 PA nominating convention from which Jose Miguel 
Aleman emerged victorious. 
 
 
LEGISLATOR JOSE BLANDON 
----------------------- 
8.  (C) Jose Isabel Blandon Figueroa (DOB: 07 JUL 1968), a 
legislator since 1999, is often considered the unofficial 
spokesman for the Arnulfista Party and continually appears in 
the media.  He became famous when dictator Manuel Noriega had 
him arrested and held hostage in 1989 after his father (Jose 
Isabel Blandon Sr.) testified against Noriega in the United 
States.  A lawyer by profession, Blandon\'s legislative 
initiatives tend to be progressive, and well seated in 
existing constitutional and legal frameworks.  Like his 
father, Blandon is a clever strategist who ably manipulates 
the political atmosphere to achieve his desired results.  PA 
opponents view most Blandon initiatives with suspicion, 
looking for the hidden agenda.  For instance, Blandon 
challenged President Torrijos to live up to his \"zero 
corruption\" campaign pledge when presenting a laudable 
package of reforms based on model legislation posted on 
Transparency International\'s website.  Among other things, 
the proposed reforms would de-criminalize libel, protect 
whistleblowers, and codify conflicts of interests, but most 
have not prospered, offering Blandon ammunition to attack the 
PRD.  (See Septel.) 
PA SECRETARY GENERAL CARLOS RAUL PIAD 
------------------------------------- 
9. (C) Even during Carlos Raul Piad\'s time as campaign 
manager for Jose Miguel Aleman in the May 2004 election, his 
frustration with President Moscoso\'s \"caudillista\" ways 
became evident.  Piad, forced by his position on the PA Board 
to remain neutral, recently told us, \"We need to make changes 
soon, but the Varelas and the Ameglios are being too 
aggressive and that could end up hurting us.\"  As Secretary 
General of the Arnulfista Party (the same position that 
President Torrijos holds in the PRD) Piad should have 
controlled the PA\'s operations, but Moscoso countermanded him 
on numerous occasions, undermining credibility with the party 
masses that he had cultivated since her 1994 electoral loss. 
Carlos Raul Piad saw firsthand how Aleman\'s inability to 
distance himself from Moscoso doomed his campaign to failure. 
 Also, Piad would have been aware of Moscoso\'s rumored 
betrayal of Aleman by channeling away campaign funds she had 
promised to him to other candidates like Legislator Pacifico 
Escalona, the brother of her paramour.  Piad\'s management and 
leadership credentials are beyond question, given his 1987 
American University finance degree, twelve years managing the 
family business, and four years managing the state-owned Caja 
de Ahorros savings bank.  His ability to maintain a 
leadership position within the PA may well be a determining 
factor in its success in the 2009 general election. 
 
 
COMMENT: WHAT COMES NEXT AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE USG? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
10.  (C) The Arnulfista Party is in no danger of disappearing 
as a political force, but internal bickering is distracting 
it from strengthening the party and recruiting new members. 
(Ironically, many observers point out that the PA probably 
has a more capable cadre of young leaders than the PRD, which 
relies on a highly disciplined but mediocre cadre of 
mid-level leaders.)  No one can predict exactly what will 
come of the Arnulfista Party, but Panama\'s recent electoral 
history yields a critical lesson.  Panama\'s 1999 and 2004 
presidential winners were its 1994 and 1999 presidential 
losers, respectively.  In both cases, they began a new 
campaign immediately after losing the first.  So far, none of 
the losing candidates  (Guillermo Endara, Ricardo Martinelli, 
or Jose Miguel Aleman) looks capable of winning in 2009. 
Also, the PA\'s prospects will improve once Mireya Moscoso is 
no longer party president. 
 
 
11.  (C) Until the Martin Torrijos administration, USG 
relations have tended to be more amicable with non-PRD 
governments.  Unlike the PRD administration of Ernesto Perez 
Balladares (1994-99), which exploited latent anti-Americanism 
left over from Operation Just Cause and a continued U.S. 
military presence in Panama to its political advantage, the 
Torrijos administration has taken a decidedly pro-USG 
posture, offering to expand and improve bilateral relations. 
Barring a crippling outcome from an expected PRD internal 
battle between pro-Martin Torrijos forces and marginalized 
old guard elements (a fight that Torrijos and those close to 
him hope to put off until internal 2006 Board elections) the 
PRD\'s size advantage and recent electoral performance may 
well propel it to another win in 2009.  Given the centripetal 
tendencies now affecting the PRD\'s opponents, the Arnulfistas 
face an uphill fight to form an effective anti-PRD coalition. 
 But forming such a coalition is their only chance for a 
strong 2009 showing.  For the USG, building on the commercial 
and cultural ties between the U.S. and Panama toward a more 
mature bilateral relationship across party lines is the best 
way to ensure continued cooperation with whoever emerges 
victorious.  In this sense, we share the same interest of 
Panamanians who want to maintain a truly competitive 
political process in which no single party dominates the 
system.

REF: A. STATE 209663 
     B. PANAMA 2252 
 
 
1.  (SBU) This message contains action requests.  Embassy 
requests Department\'s guidance on questions in paragraphs 2 
and 3.  Embassy understands that Department wants to elicit a 
formal positive response by diplomatic note no later than 
December 1.  In order to meet that deadline, Embassy would 
appreciate a timely response to the questions posed by 
Panama\'s Foreign Ministry. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) As reported Reftel B, DCM discussed proposed 
agreement to share Cooperating Nation Information Exchange 
System (CNIES -- Reftel A) data with Foreign Minister Lewis, 
who raised two key questions about Sharing of Information 
(IV): 
 
 
\"The government of Panama shall not permit third party 
access, without the specific written consent of the Embassy 
of the USA, to any information, data, or analysis that could 
be used for aerial interceptions that has been developed 
using USG assistance.\" 
 
 
The questions raised were: 
 
 
How and when will Panama receive such written consent after 
it has agreed to the conditions?  (By letter? By diplomatic 
note?) 
 
 
How and when will the Department inform the Embassy of the 
USG\'s consent to share information with third parties? 
 
 
--------------------- 
Action request: Embassy assumes that any USG communication to 
the GOP granting \"consent\" to share information will name 
specific countries, presumably on the basis of those 
countries also having agreed to the conditions in the 
diplomatic note.  Please confirm. 
--------------------- 
 
 
--------------------- 
Action request: It could be construed that consent is 
required on a case-by-case basis, which could not happen in 
real time.  The point of CNIES is to facilitate information 
sharing, to aid in \"hot pursuit,\" etc.  But the 
above-mentioned clause has ambiguities which could imply that 
the USG wants to restrict the flow of information to third 
parties.  Embassy\'s assumption is that some sort of blanket 
consent will be given.  Please confirm. 
---------------------- 
 
 
Embassy would appreciate Department clarification of these 
points. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) On October 25, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) presented a \"corrected\" version of the Spanish language

largely cosmetic drafting fixes.  (GOP-suggested phrases have 
been placed in brackets.)  Embassy believes that none of the

La Embajada de los Estados Unidos de Amrica presenta sus 
saludos al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la 
Repblica de Panam y se refiere a la cooperacin en la lucha 
antidrogas que se lleva a cabo entre el Gobierno de los 
Estados Unidos de Amrica y el Gobierno de la Repblica de 
Panam.  Especficamente, por medio del Sistema de 
Intercambio de Informacin entre los Pases Cooperantes, del 
Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos (en adelante, 
el \"CNIES,\" por sus siglas en ingls), el Gobierno de los 
Estados Unidos de Amrica proporciona al Gobierno de la 
Repblica de Panam datos de seguimiento en radar en tiempo 
real.  Con el fin de asegurar que dichos datos y otra ayuda 
relacionada con interceptacin se empleen conforme a la ley 
penal pertinente de los Estados Unidos, la Embajada propone 
formalizar un entendimiento mutuo de la ndole y la 
importacin de estos datos y de las condiciones que rigen el 
uso de dichos datos y otra ayuda relacionada con 
interceptacin.  El texto del entendimiento mutuo sigue: 
 
 
(&Con el objeto de facilitar la interrupcin de las rutas 
del narcotrfico ilcito  y el arresto de los 
narcotraficantes, el  Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de 
Amrica est dispuesto a proporcionar asistencia al Gobierno 
de la Repblica de Panam para la localizacin, 
identificacin, rastreo e interceptacin de aeronaves civiles 
 que surcan el espacio areo de esta ltima.) 
En consideracin a las relaciones mutuamente beneficiosas 
que existen entre nuestros dos Gobiernos,  respecto a las 
medidas  de aplicacin  de la ley para combatir el 
narcotrfico ilcito, la Embajada de los Estados Unidos de 
Amrica, en nombre del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de 
Amrica propone lo siguiente: 
 
 
I.    Definiciones 
 
 
El trmino &asistencia de los Estados Unidos8, abarca, 
entre otras cosas, lo siguiente:  financiamiento; datos de 
inteligencia;  informacin;  datos de radar (incluidos los 
derivados del Sistema de Intercambio de Informacin entre los 
Pases Cooperantes, CNIES); apoyo logstico; apoyo en materia 
de mando, control y comunicaciones; equipo; mantenimiento, y 
capacitacin proporcionada por el Gobierno de los Estados 
Unidos de Amrica. 
 
 
La expresin &datos del CNIES8 (se refiere a aquellos) 
datos que sealan la posicin de los rastros areos y de 
superficie (pertinentes) de inters basada en los filtros 
geogrficos. (Igualmente,) los datos del CNIES comprenden 
(la) informacin (sobre) rastros del radar relocalizable 
sobre el horizonte y mostrados automticamente, (pero) que no 
ha sido examinada para determinar la ndole legal o ilegal 
del vuelo. (De igual modo,) los rastros de inters que 
hubieran ubicado e identificado otros sistemas de vigilancia 
area, (tales como) aeronaves sospechosas de realizar 
(acciones) de narcotrfico. 
 
 
De conformidad con lo dispuesto en el Artculo 2 del Convenio 
para la Supresin de Actos Ilcitos Contra la Seguridad de la 
Aviacin Civil, realizado en Montreal, el 23 de septiembre de 
1971, del cual  tanto el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de 
Amrica como el Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam son 
Partes, las expresiones &en vuelo8 y  & en servicio8 se 
utilizan en esta Nota como sigue: 
 
 
(1)   Se considera que una aeronave est &en vuelo8 desde 
el momento en que todas sus puertas externas estn cerradas 
tras el embarque hasta el momento en que cualesquiera de 
dichas puertas se abra para el desembarque; en caso de 
aterrizaje forzoso, se considera que el vuelo contina hasta 
que (el Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam asuma) la 
responsabilidad de la aeronave y de las personas y bienes que 
se encuentran a bordo. 
 
 
(2)   Se considera que una aeronave est &en servicio8 
desde  el comienzo de la preparacin previa al vuelo de la 
aeronave a cargo del personal de tierra o de la tripulacin 
para un vuelo especfico hasta 24 horas despus del 
aterrizaje; en todo caso, el perodo de servicio durar todo 
el tiempo durante el cual la aeronave est en vuelo, segn lo 
definido en el prrafo (1) anterior. 
 
 
(Se denomina) &interceptacin8 al acto (en virtud del cual) 
aeronaves (pertenecientes) al Gobierno de la Repblica de 
Panam se aproximan a otra aeronave y permanecen cerca de la 
misma con el fin de identificarla y, si resulta necesario, 
hacerla regresar a su ruta planificada, dirigirla fuera de 
los lmites del  espacio areo de la Repblica de Panam, 
escoltarla fuera del espacio areo restringido, prohibido o 
peligroso, o darle instrucciones para que aterrice. 
 
 
II.   (Procedimiento aplicable a la) interceptacin de 
aeronaves 
 
 
(En caso de que las autoridades del) Gobierno de la Repblica 
de Panam (proceda a) interceptar una aeronave civil en 
vuelo, observar en forma coherente y estricta  los 
procedimientos  de seguridad estipulados  en el Anexo 2 del 
Convenio sobre la Aviacin Civil Internacional, firmada en 
Chicago el 7 de diciembre de 1944 (el &Convenio de 
Chicago8) y sus correspondientes enmiendas. Adems, (el 
Gobierno) de la Repblica de Panam se asegurar de que todo 
su personal (ya sea que se encuentre en el aire, en un centro 
de mando y control o en cualquier otro lugar) que participe 
en la interceptacin de aeronaves civiles  conozca a fondo 
dichos procedimientos. Al interceptar  aeronaves civiles en 
vuelo, el Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam se ceir  a las 
disposiciones sobre interceptacin  de la Organizacin  de la 
Aviacin Civil Internacional  (OACI), con inclusin de las 
contenidas en el Manual sobre la Interceptacin de Aeronaves 
Civiles. 
 
 
El Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam (notificar al personal 
y a) todo el sector de la aviacin civil de su pas (NOTAMs) 
la normativa aplicable a la materia relativa a la 
interceptacin. Mediante estos NOTAMs se pondr en 
conocimiento de los pilotos que el Gobierno de la Repblica 
de Panam no daar, destruir o inhabilitar ninguna 
aeronave civil, salvo en defensa propia. Dichas NOTAMs 
incluirn aviso adecuado de los procedimientos que el 
Servicio Areo Nacional  del Gobierno de la Repblica de 
Panam aplicar para ordenar que la aeronave interceptada 
aterrice, de tal modo que los aviadores sean conscientes de 
los procedimientos y puedan actuar en consecuencia. 
 
 
Cuando el Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam realice una 
interceptacin basado en la circunstancia de que, a su 
juicio, la aeronave se dedica principalmente al narcotrfico 
ilcito, aplicar los criterios de seleccin que se exponen a 
continuacin para determinar la ndole de la aeronave 
sospechosa. 
 
 
Al determinar si una aeronave es sospechosa razonablemente de 
dedicarse principalmente al narcotrfico ilcito, se 
considerarn los siguientes factores: 
 
 
-La aeronave no present el plan de vuelo requerido? 
-Est volando inexplicablemente fuera de la ruta designada en 
su plan de vuelo aprobado? 
-No est usando el cdigo de transpondedor adecuado? 
-Est volando a una altitud inexplicablemente baja? 
-Est volando de noche sin luces? 
-Tiene en la cola un nmero de registro falso (o no tiene 
ningn nmero)? 
-Las ventanas estn oscurecidas? 
-Se ajusta la descripcin fsica de la aeronave  a la 
descripcin de una aeronave utilizada previamente en el 
narcotrfico ilcito? 
-Existen datos de inteligencia que indiquen que la aeronave 
se dedica principalmente al narcotrfico ilcito? 
-Est la aeronave volando sin permiso en una zona de 
identificacin de defensa area (si la hay)? 
                                  -Est la aeronave 
estacionada de noche sin permiso en una pista de aterrizaje 
no vigilada? 
-Han fracasado todos los intentos de identificar a la 
aeronave? 
-No ha respondido la aeronave inexplicablemente a todos los 
intentos de comunicacin? 
-Ha hecho caso omiso la aeronave de las rdenes del Servicio 
Areo Nacional del Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam? 
-Se han arrojado objetos desde la aeronave? 
-Hay alguna otra informacin sobre la existencia de sospechas 
razonables  de que la nave se dedica principalmente al 
narcotrfico ilcito? 
-Existe informacin que descartan las sospechas razonables de 
que la aeronave se dedica principalmente al narcotrfico 
ilcito? 
 
 
III.  Abstencin de usar armas contra aeronaves civiles 
 
 
Si (de algn modo) se utiliza  la asistencia del Gobierno de 
los Estados  Unidos de Amrica para ubicar, identificar, 
rastrear o interceptar alguna aeronave civil, el Gobierno de 
la Repblica de Panam: 
 
 
a)    No daar, destruir o inhabilitar ninguna aeronave 
civil que est en servicio, y 
 
 
b)    No amenazar con daar, destruir, o inhabilitar ninguna 
aeronave civil que est en servicio. 
 
 
 i)   Esto no impide disparar tiros de advertencia  como 
medida de seal, utilizando municiones que contengan 
cartuchos trazadores para asegurarse de que el piloto se 
entere de que ha sido interceptado. 
 
 
ii)   Se podrn disparar tiros de advertencia solamente desde 
una posicin un poco adelante del travs y paralela al curso 
de la aeronave interceptada para asegurarse de que no est en 
la lnea de fuego. La aeronave que dispare los tiros de 
advertencia deber tomar todas las medidas de precaucin 
razonables para no disparar a la aeronave  interceptada, a 
ninguna otra aeronave que est en las cercanas ni a personas 
o bienes que estn en tierra. 
 
 
Ninguno de los compromisos que asuma el Gobierno de la 
Repblica de Panam al acordar ceirse a estas condiciones 
tiene el propsito de impedir o limitar la capacidad del 
mismo de utilizar armas en caso de defensa propia. 
 
 
IV.   Intercambio de  informacin 
 
 
El Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam no permitir el acceso 
de terceros, sin el consentimiento  especfico por escrito de 
la Embajada de los Estados Unidos de Amrica, a informacin, 
datos ni anlisis que pudieran utilizarse para las 
interceptaciones areas que se hayan elaborado con la ayuda 
del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Amrica. 
 
 
V.  Incumplimiento de las condiciones 
 
 
En caso de que el Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam no 
cumpla con cualquiera de las condiciones contenidas en la 
presente,  el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Amrica, a su 
discrecin, suspender o dar por terminada toda ayuda al 
Gobierno de la Repblica de Panam relacionada con la 
interceptacin de aeronaves civiles. 
 
 
Si lo que antecede es aceptable al Gobierno de la Repblica 
de Panam, la Embajada de los Estados Unidos de Amrica tiene 
el honor de proponer que esta Nota y su Nota de respuesta 
constituyan un  acuerdo entre nuestros dos Gobiernos, el cual 
entrar en vigor en la fecha de su respuesta8. 
 
 
La Embajada de los Estados Unidos de Amrica aprovecha la 
oportunidad para reiterar al Ministerio de Relaciones 
Exteriores de la Repblica de Panam las seguridades de su 
ms alta consideracin.

Summary: Change Is Not At Hand 
------------------------------ 
1.  (C) This Embassy and other observers hoped that Panama\'s 
UNGA voting patterns soon might become more congenial to U.S. 
interests, given the recent election of Martin Torrijos, a 
young, modernizing president; his avowed intent to make 
Panama\'s UN General Assembly voting \"more predictable\"; and 
the GOP\'s friendly relations with Israel and the local Jewish 
community.  In fact, the Ambassador and other Emboffs have 
pressed GOP officials to improve Panama\'s UN voting record, 
especially with regard to the Israel-Palestine issue. 
Despite Embassy efforts, as well as lobbying by the local 
Jewish community, we believe that in the short run Panama 
likely will continue its past voting pattern on 
Israel-Palestine questions.  On the positive side, Panamanian 
officials do not seem comfortable voting for empty 
pro-Palestinian resolutions.  Senior GOP officials have 
defended their stance by citing putative fears of terrorist 
attacks against the Canal.  Embassy will continue to press 
GOP officials to pursue a more constructive policy vis-a-vis 
Israel and Palestine at the United Nations.  End Summary. 
 
 
Demarche Delivered 
------------------ 
2.  (C) Delivering Ref A demarche to MFA Foreign Relations 
Director Dario Chiru at a November 12 meeting, POL Counselor 
pushed Chiru to consider instructing Panama\'s UN delegation 
to vote \"no\" or at least to abstain on the three Ref A 
resolutions, arguing that institutionalized bias in the UN 
General Assembly embodied in the resolutions poisoned the 
atmosphere against Israel at the UNGA and made the 
international body all but irrelevant to solving 
Israel-Palestine issues.  He also pointed out that the search 
for new Palestinian leadership and directions following the 
death of Yasir Arafat presented important opportunities to 
peacemakers on both sides.  Now was a good time to drop empty 
rhetoric and oppose tendentiousness at the international body. 
 
 
\"A Matter of Conscience\" 
------------------------ 
3.  (C) After listening attentively, Chiru promised to 
discuss the demarche with Minister of Foreign Affair Samuel 
Lewis.  Sounding very much like his predecessor at MFA under 
the previous government of Mireya Moscoso, Chiru said 
Panama\'s annual votes to support pro-Palestinian resolutions 
are a matter of conscience for Panama, due to a perceived 
need to maintain \"equilibrium\" on the Palestinian question. 
This is not simply a matter of voting to please an ally (the 
U.S.) or a friend (Israel), Chiru explained, but to fulfill a 
\"sense of justice when we look at the map.\"  (Read: The lack 
of a Palestinian state.)  If Israel does not feel pressure 
from the General Assembly, it may simply procrastinate on 
Palestinian rights, Chiru said. 
 
 
Present At The Creation 
----------------------- 
4.  (C) Chiru pointed out that Panama was one of the founder 
members of the United Nations, was an active participant in 
the 1945 conference that wrote the UN Charter, and voted to 
create the state of Israel in 1947.  Following Israeli 
independence, Chiru said, Panama has felt a \"debt\" to the 
Palestinians and worried that Palestinian initiatives were 
not being pushed with the same force. 
 
 
A \"Debt\" Owed To Palestine 
-------------------------- 
5.  (C) Chiru was quick to acknowledge UNGA\'s 
institutionalized anti-Israel bias; that the yearly 
Palestinian resolutions would have no practical effect on the 
issues at hand; and that uncritical international support for 
Palestine when many Palestinian terrorist groups were 
resorting to terrorist violence destabilized the UN\'s need 
for moderation.  On the other hand, while weighing friendly 
feelings toward Israel against condemnatory votes, Panama 
acts in a way it believes will best motivate peaceful and 
comprehensive negotiations on the Palestinian question, Chiru 
said.  The UNGA\'s pro-Palestinian position reflects 
Palestinian weakness and the \"debt\" that many countries, 
including Panama, feel they owe Palestine, he said. 
 
 
Comment: Practical Concerns Undercut Principled Approach 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
6.  (C) Aside from its stated sympathy for the Palestinian 
\"underdog,\" the GOP also plausibly has its eye on Canal 
security.  In a recent discussion with POL Counselor, B\'nai 
B\'rith President Joseph Harari related a meeting he had held 
with President Torrijos and Foreign Minister Lewis prior to 
the September 1 inauguration.  Torrijos turned down Harari\'s 
suggestion that Panama adopt a more pro-Israel stance at the 
UN, saying that doing so could make the Panama Canal a 
higher-profile target for terrorist attacks, a risk Torrijos 
said he was unwilling to contemplate.  (Ref B.) 
 
 
7.  (C) Former (and future) presidential hopeful Ricardo 
Alberto Arias, Panama\'s current UN Ambassador, is another 
possible complication.  A Panamanian foreign minister under 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, Arias was partly 
responsible for U.S.-Panama talks bogging down during the 
late 1990s on the proposed Multilateral Counter-narcotics 
Center in Panama.  While we do not know the extent of his 
freedom of action on the Israel-Palestine votes, Arias will 
doubtless pay strict attention to their possible political 
implications for himself personally.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) With apparent support from President Martin Torrijos, 
Minister of Government and Justice Hector Aleman is moving to 
centralize control of the Panamanian Public Forces (PPF). 
MOGJ sources contend that under the government of former 
president Mireya Moscoso, MOGJ exercised weak oversight of 
the Panamanian National Police (PNP), while the National 
Aviation Service (SAN) and National Maritime Service (SMN) 
were left to languish under poor leadership.  Aleman and MOGJ 
staffers believe that centralized management along with 
better accountability and clear missions will improve 
efficiency, discipline, and anti-corruption oversight; reduce 
duplication; save resources; and foster rational planning. 
The Embassy broadly supports those goals, which could improve 
MOGJ\'s coordination with the USG\'s law enforcement and 
counter-terrorism objectives in Panama.  The downside is that 
centralization could lead to MOGJ micro-management, red tape, 
and increased in-fighting between GOP departments.  Another 
underlying reality is that austerity may reduce already 
inadequate PPF budgets by 15%, which could adversely affect 
the GOP\'s ability to support U.S. security and law 
enforcement goals. 
 
 
2.  (C) MOGJ\'s centralizing plans come at a time when the 
local press has pilloried the Torrijos government for 
allegedly plotting to resurrect Panama\'s military, following 
a series of ill-considered miscues, which include airing 
Noriega-era military marches at public ceremonies, 
high-profile National Day parades of armed militarized 
police, the apparent creeping re-introduction of military 
ranks, and a refusal to disavow plans for a new law to permit 
the GOP to appoint a uniformed PNP head.  The USG also has 
been criticized for aiding and abetting this alleged 
\"remilitarization.\"  The recent coincidental back-to-back 
visits of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and USARSO Commander 
John Gardner have added fuel to the fire.  The local press 
has forced Torrijos and Aleman both to publicly deny that 
they are trying to re-militarize Panama. 
 
 
3.  (C) Panama has not had a military since Operation Just 
Cause ousted military dictator Manuel Noriega and the Panama 
Defense Forces (PDF) in 1989.  Panama\'s 1994 constitution 
banned the military.  The PPF\'s resulting lack of focus and 
dysfunctionality was not entirely unintentional but welcomed 
as a fail-safe system to preclude any possibility of a 
military coup.  Most Panamanians believe that Panama\'s 
military \"virus\" now is firmly eradicated.  But the strong 
sensitivities that remain mean that MOGJ will have to tread 
carefully.  So far, we have seen little evidence of the 
skillful public relations campaign the GOP will have to wage 
if it is to convince public opinion of the rightness of its 
reforms.  On the contrary, Torrijos officials seem to be 
handing their opponents a stick to beat them with.  For our 
part, Embassy is strategizing to protect U.S. equities as 
they relate to cooperation on security and law enforcement 
matters.  While we do not believe this latest media campaign 
will undermine the significant progress that we have made 
with the Panamanians over the past few years on security 
cooperation, this recent politically driven criticism of 
U.S.-GOP security re-engagement will force the Embassy to 
take a more measured approach on any security issues that 
could fuel the current feeding frenzy.  End Summary. 
 
 
Focus of MOGJ\'s New Plan 
------------------------ 
4.  (C) Minister of Government and Justice Hector Aleman, 
backed by President Martin Torrijos, is working to realign 
Panama\'s Public Forces (PPF) more firmly under his control to 
better define their missions, improve cooperation, and 
conserve limited resources.  The GOP believes that a lack of 
clear missions for the National Aviation Service (SAN) and 
National Maritime Service (SMN) and many of the 21 MOGJ 
agencies has duplicated efforts and caused insufficiencies in 
Panama\'s security that have allowed arms and drugs 
traffickers to enter Panama.  The key players in this process 
are Minister Aleman and his national security advisor, 
Severino Mejia.  A project to write new organic laws for 
almost all 21 MOGJ agencies (except the PNP, which has had an 
organic law since 1997) is one focus of the effort.  Another 
focus is MOGJ\'s recent demand for all agencies to report 
inventories and equipment condition.  MOGJ intends to hold 
managers accountable for state-owned equipment.  For each 
agency MOGJ has written 30-, 60-, 90-day plans and one-, 
three-, and five-year plans and, in some cases, 10-year 
plans.  Also, MOGJ is lobbying the Presidency for its budget 
proposals for all agencies. 
 
 
Draft Organic Laws 
------------------ 
5.  (C) MOGJ is circulating new draft organic laws for SMN, 
SAN, SINAPROC, Public Security (which controls civilian arms, 
explosives, and fireworks), fire departments, and others. 
The purpose is to assign clear missions and reduce future 
conflict between agencies.  The draft organic laws place the 
SAN and SMN for the first time on an equal footing with the 
PNP.  (Previous arrangements had subordinated them to the PNP 
and tasked them with providing transportation needs.)  The 
draft law proposes controversial, military-sounding name 
changes.  SMN would be renamed Panamanian Coast Guard Corps 
and would have sole responsibility for coastal patrol, Canal 
defense, port defense, and fishing violations.  SAN would be 
renamed Panamanian Air Guard would handle search and rescue 
and disaster response and would provide air support for the 
PNP and SMN in drug interdiction and border patrol 
activities.  (Comment: The use of the term \"Guardia\" conjures 
up negative connotations for many Panamanians who remember 
the National Guard (\"Guardia Nacional\") roots of the 
Torrijos/Noriega dictatorship.  See Para 9.  End comment.) 
 
 
Most Important Missions: Drugs, Arms 
------------------------------------ 
6.  (C) MOGJ National Security Advisor Severino Mejia 
Mosquera is Aleman\'s point man in reorganizing and 
coordinating the PPF.  He sees drug and weapons trafficking 
as the primary threats to Panama.  He becomes animated when 
speaking of Panama\'s need to have the means to combat 
terrorism, arms and drug trafficking, and criminal violence. 
To complement the draft laws, Mejia is writing a joint 
operations and training manual that provides regulations 
detailing how the SAN and SMN should carry out their duties. 
He told PolOff that MOGJ will expect the SAN and SMN to run 
joint drug and weapons interdiction efforts.  How all of that 
will play out in practice is unclear.  (Note: Air Service 
chief Fabrega has complained to PolOffs of Mejia\'s 
\"interference\" in his autonomy.  PNP chief Gustavo Perez has 
told EmbOffs that he wants no part of coordinating or 
cooperating with the SMN and SAN.  While interagency 
coordination and ministry oversight could improve management 
markedly, micro-management would not.  It is still uncertain 
how far central control will reach.  End Note.) 
 
 
Financial Weakness 
------------------ 
7.  (C) The most conspicuous weakness of the GOP\'s plan to 
modernize its public forces is financial.  The PNP, SMN, and 
SAN all require bigger budget outlays for increased equipment 
and personnel to take on the security tasks that the GOP 
wants to assign them.  (Already inadequate PPF budgets have 
faced across-the-board 15% budget cuts for the coming fical 
year.)  In addition, SMN is running an estimated $2 million 
deficit and the PNP reportedly has a $12 million deficit. 
Little wonder, then, that Mejia groused to PolOff that when 
forced to choose, the GOP ignores security in favor of its 
domestic agendas of health, social security, and other 
programs.  (Comment: Mejia\'s remark undercuts claims that the 
GOP is bent on re-militarizing Panama, although that fact is 
lost on an ill-informed, politically-driven local press.  End 
comment.) 
 
 
The Key Players: Aleman and Mejia 
--------------------------------- 
8.  (C) Minister Aleman has actively sought consultations 
from the USG during his first two months in office.  He 
participated actively in a USG-GOP bilateral security 
workshop in August, has asked for Embassy feedback on several 
organic laws, and traveled to Washington to consult with DHS, 
DOD, and USCG officials.  Most recently, he met with 
Secretary Rumsfeld during the Secretary\'s meeting with 
 
SIPDIS 
President Torrijos.  He has been actively collecting ideas 
for reinventing the structure of the agencies that fall under 
his mandate.  A former School of the Americas honor student, 
Severino Mejia makes no bones about his former close 
association with Manuel Noriega.  As a PDF captain during the 
1980\'s, Mejia was Noriega\'s aide-de-camp.  He also worked in 
Panama\'s mission to the United Nations.  (Bio Note: Mejia 
holds a University of Panama BA in International Relations 
and a master\'s degree in Business Administration.  End note.) 
 
 
Miscues and Missteps 
-------------------- 
9.  (C) Recurring public relations gaffes and/or ambiguities 
(see below) have raised questions about the GOP\'s intentions 
and have forced both Torrijos and Aleman to make public 
statements recently denying any attempt or intent to 
re-militarize the PPF. 
 
 
-The press has repeatedly speculated about plans that 
Torrijos announced prior to the May 2, 2004 election to 
appoint a uniformed chief to head the PNP, although Aleman 
recently said the plan is on hold \"for now.\"  The law 
currently bars anyone but a civilian for that job.  Torrijos 
says he wants to name a PNP chief who has \"come up through 
the ranks\" but many fear that, once the law is changed, 
Torrijos will appoint a former high-ranking Panamanian 
Defense Forces (PDF) officer. 
 
 
-During the election campaign Torrijos frequently highlighted 
his family connection with his father, military dictator Omar 
Torrijos (d.1981).  Since Martin Torrijos took office on 
September 1, press reports have alleged that 19 former 
(unnamed) officers from Noriega\'s PDF are serving in the GOP. 
 
 
 
 
-At the September 2 swearing ceremony of PNP chief Gustavo 
Perez and again during the November 3 and November 4 parades 
marking Panama Independence Day, the PPF band shocked many 
Panamanians by playing \"Todo Por La Patria,\" a military march 
that served as the PDF anthem.  The song had not been heard 
in public since Operation Just Cause toppled Noriega.  The 
song\'s composer, Antonio Fernandez Gomez (aka \"Tony Fergo\"), 
who also is Martin Torrijos\'s father-in-law, publicly 
criticized the playing of \"Todo Por La Patria,\" saying that 
he wrote it for a different time and purpose. 
 
 
-Militarized police with painted faces unnerved some 
observers when they marched in camouflage gear while holding 
automatic weapons, rocket propelled grenades, and sniper 
rifles in this year\'s Independence Day parades.  (Such units 
first appeared in the November 3, 2003 Centennial parade 
attended by Secretary Powell but caused little ruckus.) 
 
 
-The SMN and SAN draft organic laws propose military-sounding 
name changes of SMN and SAN to \"Panamanian Coast Guard Corps\" 
and \"Panamanian Air Guard.\"  One Torrijos confidant told POL 
Counselor that he had warned Torrijos that if the name 
changes go through, the PNP would soon demand to be called 
the \"National Guard\" or \"Guardia Nacional.\"  (Note: In 1953, 
the name of Panama\'s Fuerza Publica was changed to Guardia 
Nacional, an act many Panamanians regard as the start of 
militarization.  Omar Torrijos confirmed the name \"Guardia 
Nacional\" in Panama\'s 1972 constitution.  Panama\'s 1983 
constitution under Manuel Noriega dropped Guardia Nacional in 
favor of \"Fuerzas de Defensa de Panama\" or PDF in English. 
End note.) 
 
 
-The two draft laws also establish titles military sounding 
\"Comandante\" for the SMN and SAN successor chiefs.  SMN chief 
Traad is already signing official correspondence as 
\"Comandante.\"  Panamanians have complained about hearing 
former PDF officials now serving in the GOP being addressed 
as \"mi coronel,\" a military rank that does not now exist. 
Although it might have an innocuous explanation, people have 
overheard former PDF Colonel Daniel Delgado (now at the 
foreign ministry) being addressed as \"Coronel Delgado\" during 
Secretary Rumsfeld\'s visit and before, whereas before taking 
 
SIPDIS 
office he was always called \"Licenciado Delgado.\" 
 
 
-Aleman\'s aide, Severino Mejia, told PolOff that after 
meeting with USG officials, MOGJ Aleman remarked that he 
wants to emulate the role of U.S. Secretary of Defense. 
Aleman probably meant he wants to have enough authority over 
the 21 PPF agencies to improve management, efficiency, and 
inter-agency coordination.  However, such seemingly innocent 
remarks in the current climate, especially if quoted by the 
press, could reinforce fears about \"remilitarization.\" 
 
 
-USARSO Commander MG John Gardner visited Panama during 
November 16-17 to prepare for the 2005 humanitarian exercise 
\"New Horizons.\"  Nonetheless, his visit, hard on the heels of 
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld\'s November 13-14 visit to Panama, 
has added fuel to the anti-military fire, leading some to 
theorize that the U.S. is encouraging the alleged 
re-militarization. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
10.  (C) When U.S. military forces withdrew in 1999, Panama 
had to accept responsibility for border and Canal security. 
It was hardly prepared for the task then, and is only 
marginally better prepared now.  Panama\'s PPF needs a great 
deal more money, manpower, training, and equipment to 
adequately fulfill the minimum security requirements of the 
state.  The bottom line is that Panama does not have the 
money to re-militarize, even if it wanted to.  Although it 
does not need (or want) a military, Panama does need a well 
reasoned security strategy with broad public support and a 
well trained, properly funded and administered public force 
apparatus.  Panama\'s current concerns about transnational 
crime and terrorism mesh with many of our own priorities. 
Those imperatives have crashed head on with the Panamanian 
public\'s well founded mistrust of military organizations and 
its cynical expectation that local politicos will use 
military power, if they can, against their political 
opponents.  Panama\'s unsophisticated, sensationalist, and 
poorly trained press has fueled popular concerns. 
 
 
11.  (C) The new GOP under Torrijos, having downplayed those 
sensitivities in implementing its security strategy, has 
unleashed a storm of criticism, which it now is trying to 
ride out.  Panama\'s knee-jerk anti-militarism is being 
exploited by elements of the press and elite Panamanians who 
mistrust the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).  A fair 
amount of hypocrisy, not to say schizophrenia, is involved. 
For instance, no one complained when former SMN Director 
General (until 9/1/2004) Jose Isaza wore a uniform and called 
himself \"comandante.\" 
 
 
12.  (C) Despite lurid denunciations of military bogeymen 
which have been appearing daily in the local press, we do not 
believe the Torrijos government is aiming to re-militarize 
Panama, much less re-establish military rule.  What the GOP 
needs to do but what it is not yet doing is to publicize 
Panama\'s security needs in a forthright manner to build 
public support.  It is clear that the USG will be blamed in 
the public mind by any perception, false or otherwise, that 
the GOP intends to re-militarize.  The Embassy seeks to 
preserve the carefully calibrated security re-engagement 
strategy it has pursued over the past several years and must 
avoid being seen as pushing Panama toward accepting 
extraneous military responsibilities or capabilities.  To 
pursue this balancing act, to protect the USG\'s equities, and 
to avoid getting dragged down by GOP missteps, Embassy is 
working on a press strategy to protect U.S. equities in the 
bilateral security relationship.

SUMMARY: PUSHING THE AGENDA THROUGH 
----------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) President Martin Torrijos and his Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) are trying to make the most of 
their honeymoon period.  Less than 100 days into its 
five-year term, the new administration has accomplished one 
of its top domestic priorities by pushing through a 
constitutional reform package (reftel A) that became official 
on November 15, 2004.  With constitutional reform now out of 
the way, the legislature\'s PRD leadership wants to focus on 
tax reform (before the March 2005 deadline for tax payment), 
reforming Panama\'s social security system (CSS), and 
preparing a Canal expansion referendum, but opponents may 
well have other plans.  Bad blood over tough but necessary 
domestic reforms may burn PRD political capital well before 
the legislature must review ratifying a possible US-Panama 
bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA); however, the President 
of Panama\'s legislature, Jerry Wilson, has indicated no doubt 
about lawmakers\' ability to pass such an agreement.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
TAX REFORM, CSS, AND THE CANAL BEFORE FTA 
----------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) While tax reform and Social Security Fund (CSS) 
reform will be politically unpopular, lawmakers (including 
National Assembly President Jerry Wilson) insist that 
inevitable friction will not impair their ability to secure 
approval of a Canal expansion referendum (their top strategic 
priority), or ratify a possible US-Panama FTA when the time 
comes.  To \"get them out of the way,\" tax reform and 
reforming Panama\'s ailing Social Security Fund (CSS) top the 
Torrijos administration\'s immediate domestic agenda, followed 
by Canal expansion.  All have strong short-term downsides 
with Panamanian voters despite positive medium-to-long-term 
impacts.  With the service tax (ITBMS) that President Moscoso 
imposed in late 2002 fresh in their minds, Panamanians want 
nothing to do with tax reform if it means they will pay more 
taxes.  CSS reform will likely reduce benefits and Canal 
expansion threatens to displace numerous small farmers from 
the canal watershed, both easy targets for PRD opponents 
seeking political advantage in 2009. 
 
 
3. (SBU) During the campaign, President Torrijos promised to 
repeal the unpopular service tax (ITBMS) that President 
Moscoso implemented in December 2002, but his administration 
appears to have dropped the idea.  According to Florencia 
Rios Serracin, Torrijos\' Director of Revenue, the Moscoso 
administration was collecting the tax incorrectly, and lost 
revenue.  Accounting studies by the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance have shown the Torrijos Administration the tax 
potentially can generate much more revenue.  Given the 
constitutional mandate that eliminating one tax must be 
accompanied by the establishment of an equivalent tax, it 
appears that President Torrijos won\'t live up to this 
campaign promise. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Necessary belt tightening at the Social Security 
Fund (CSS) (which National Assembly President Jerry Wilson 
told POL Counselor is on the agenda for this December) will 
allow PRD opponents to paint the Torrijos administration as 
hard on the poor.  PRD leaders have expressed concerns to 
EmbOffs that the Arnulfistas in particular would oppose CSS 
reforms for short-term political mileage instead of 
considering the undeniable need for reform.  (COMMENT:  PRD 
and Arnulfista roles in the CSS saga have reversed since the 
Moscoso administration (1999-2004), but both parties share 
historical responsibility for the institution\'s problems. 
Arnulfista Party namesake Arnulfo Arias created the CSS as a 
paternalistic entitlement.  The CSS\'s actuarial woes and 
bloated roll of beneficiaries are well-known problems that no 
Panamanian government has fully addressed since Martin 
Torrijos\'s father Omar created them during the 1970s.  See 
reftel B for a discussion of CSS problems.  END COMMENT.) 
 
 
5. (SBU) The constitutional reform package mandates a 
referendum on Canal expansion (which Assembly President Jerry 
Wilson told POL Counselor will come in late 2005), but even 
PRD legislators on the Canal Affairs Committee don\'t know 
what it will look like.  PRD leaders and independent analysts 
have speculated that the referendum will be very simple (a 
yes-or-no question such as, \"Do you think the Panama Canal 
should be expanded?\") to avoid locking the Torrijos 
administration into specific engineering or financing plans. 
Contacts in the Electoral Tribunal have confirmed to Embassy 
that they are planning for a 2005 Canal referendum, but they 
do not know the date.  (COMMENT: As with other items on the 
Torrijos administration\'s agenda, PRD legislators may be the 
last to know what the canal referendum they need to approve 
will look like.  END COMMENT.) 
 
 
COMMENT: HONEYMOON WILL END 
--------------------------- 
6. (SBU) President Torrijos already has accomplished 
important reforms and seeks to pursue several others (see for 
example a summary of the anti-corruption initiatives in 
reftel C), but the Panamanian \"what have you done for me 
lately?\" attitude will catch up with him and his allies. 
Torrijos\'s tight-lipped management style may generate 
problems for him with PRD congressmen (now called \"diputados\" 
under the new constitution instead of legisladores). 
Executive-driven initiatives with little buy-in from PRD 
legislators (much less those from the opposition) may deplete 
the political capital that Torrijos will need to conserve as 
he tries to press forward with an ambitious agenda. 
 
 
7. (SBU) During recent encounters with PRD congressmen, 
EmbOffs have noted their frustration at being left out of the 
loop on important decisions.  Several remarked that having no 
funds to spend in their districts makes it nearly impossible 
for them to meet the paternalistic expectations of their 
constituents.  The congressman who drew the most votes in the 
May 2004 election put it best when he said, \"I have to go 
home every night and explain to the thirty-eight thousand 
voters who elected me why I haven\'t been able to live up to 
what I promised during the campaign.\"  This remark reflects a 
widespread perception that despite a strong electoral 
mandate, Torrijos is working in an atmosphere of high 
expectations and in a political culture characterized by 
impatience and patronage.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) In a two-day visit to Panama November 13-14, 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met with Panamanian 
 
SIPDIS 
President Torrijos and top cabinet officials, visited and 
overflew the Panama Canal, laid a wreath at the American 
Battle Monument Commission\'s Corozal Cemetary, and held a 
news conference.  President Torrijos strongly signaled that 
he would welcome closer ties with the United States.  He told 
Sec. Rumsfeld that the Panama government (GOP) is preparing a 
formal security strategy and hopes to establish a maritime 
intelligence database to share with the U.S. and other 
interested nations.  As his public and private statements 
reflected, Sec. Rumsfeld was impressed by the GOP\'s operation 
of the Canal, by what he called Panama\'s \"serious 
professional approach\" to Canal security, and by Panama\'s 
high level of cooperation with the United States on 
counter-terrorism and law enforcement.  He also praised 
Panama\'s emerging national security agenda and its 
\"comprehensive thinking\" on external threats and how to 
address them.  Sec. Rumsfeld underscored Panama\'s potential 
value as a U.S. partner on security and intelligence-sharing 
due to its unique mix of Canal, port, border and maritime 
issues, and its central hemispheric location. 
 
 
2.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld and Torrijos agreed that international 
cooperation is the key for success against terrorism and 
threats from international crime.  Aside from one 
journalist\'s question during a November 13 news conference, 
neither side discussed World War II-era chemical weapons on 
San Jose Island (SJI) or unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the 
reverted areas of the former Canal Zone.  Also, neither side 
brought up the activities of Colombian guerrillas in Panama\'s 
Darien border province.  Torrijos several times dodged 
Rumsfeld\'s probing strategic questions on the Peoples 
Republic of China (PRC), each time turning to the PRC\'s 
commercial importance as a Canal user and port operator. 
 
 
3.  (C) After Sec. Rumsfeld\'s departure several local 
newspapers attacked the GOP for its alleged plans to 
\"re-militarize\" Panama.  (See Reftel.)  Among issues strictly 
internal to Panama, reporters derided an alleged \"Plan 
Rumsfeld,\" a spurious purported U.S. drive to militarize the 
region.  Despite negative publicity in the wake of Sec. 
Rumsfeld\'s departure (spurred in part by recent GOP missteps 
that revived local fears of a \"remilitarization\" of Panama - 
see Reftel), GOP officials and Panama\'s influential business 
sectors judged the visit a clear success.  End Summary.

6.  (C) During the November 13 meeting at Panama\'s 
Presidential Palace, President Martin Torrijos told Secretary 
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that he wants closer relations 
with the United States.  Panama will establish a centralized 
intelligence and security database, based on information 
about ship movements in the Canal, ship and air passengers, 
and trade, to share with the USG and other interested 
parties, he continued.  Panama would seek U.S. 
guidance/assistance. 
 
 
7.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld liked the maritime intelligence 
database idea and promised to discuss it in Washington. 
Expressing his affection for Panama, Sec. Rumsfeld explained 
that he first saw Panama in 1955 as a naval aviator and 
returned in the 1960s as a congressman.  Sec. Rumsfeld 
emphasized Panama\'s \"uniqueness\" in terms of what it has to 
offer the United States on regional and maritime security and 
intelligence sharing. 
 
 
8.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld said that prospects for enhanced 
regional cooperation are extremely good, especially in light 
of the CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement) and the 
almost-completed bilateral FTA.  Sec. Rumsfeld believed the 
agreements would benefit Panama and the region. 
 
 
9.  (C) Turning to Panama\'s wider role in maritime security, 
President Torrijos said some 6,000 Panamanian-flagged vessels 
employ roughly 300,000 seamen (mainly Filipino and Chinese). 
Panama gradually would like to increase the number of 
Panamanian seafarers, which he said also might also help 
improve security.  About 12% of U.S. seaborne trade passes 
through the Canal, Torrijos said. 
 
 
10.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld singled out for praise the September 
2004 Panamax exercises (which involved units from nine 
countries) as a positive example of regional cooperation that 
should continue.  Expanding on the scope that he saw for 
regional cooperation, Sec. Rumsfeld said that each country 
must decide on the proper role and mission for its security 
forces.  No single country can deal with all issues.  He 
touted Colombian and Brazilian air interdiction of 
weapons/drug planes.  The Canal is important to Panama and is 
important to the entire world, Rumsfeld said.  Panama Canal 
Administrator Alemn made an excellent impression when he 
described the checklist for inspecting ships transiting the 
Canal.  According to information that Aleman distributed, 
almost 120,000 American citizens annually arrive in Panama by 
air and nearly 270,000 arrive by sea. 
 
 
11.  (C) Torrijos said the GOP would concentrate on security 
and modernizing its public forces, and on trade, economic 
growth, poverty, rule of law and anti-corruption.  He pointed 
out that Panama at present is hampered by a large fiscal 
deficit.  Rumsfeld applauded Torrijos\'s efforts, especially 
anti-corruption initiatives, which would create a climate 
favorable for investment. 
 
 
12.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld underscored that the USG wants to 
strengthen the Inter-American system.  To Rumsfeld\'s question 
about Venezuela, Torrijos said Panama wants good relations 
with every country in the Hemisphere, adding that only Cuba 
has no relations with Panama (Note: Cuba and Panama 
reestablished consular relations on November 19, 2004, but 
has not renewed full diplomatic relations.  End note.) 
Torrijos added he had spoken to Colombian President Uribe 
several times about law enforcement and anti-narcotics 
issues, and also about gas and electrical links, and recently 
signed an agreement to study a gas pipeline.  Torrijos 
outlined plans for Canal enlargement and the need to hold a 
referendum to gain public approval for the idea. 
 
 
13.  (C) Sec. Rumsfeld got bland responses to his repeated 
questions of how Torrijos viewed the Peoples Republic of 
China (PRC) and its role and influence in the region. 
Declining to speculate, Torrijos would say only that the 
PRC\'s usage of the Panama Canal and its commercial presence 
in Panama and the region are growing quickly.  Torrijos 
pointed out that the PRC is about to become second biggest 
user of the Canal and that the China trade is increasingly 
important for Canal and world trade.  As for the PRC\'s role 
in the region: \"All I see is more merchandise,\" Torrijos said. 
 
 
14.  (C) Both sides avoided controversial subjects, such as 
the security situation in Panama\'s Darien border region, and 
the issues of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the reverted areas 
of the former Canal Zone and chemical weapons on San Jose 
Island (SJI).  (Comment: Both Rumsfeld and Torrijos staked 
out distinct positions when asked about UXO or SJI in public. 
 When asked about UXO and SJI at a news conference 
immediately following his meeting with Torrijos, Sec. 
Rumsfeld said \"the case is closed.\"  Torrijos later denied a 
reporter\'s suggestion that the case was closed.  The issues 
are unlikely to remain irritants in bilateral relations.  End 
Comment.)

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (C)  Since the seizure of the \"Otterloo\" in 2001, a ship 
carrying about 3,000 weapons from Nicaragua through Panama to 
the AUC in Colombia, the Colombian armed groups (FARC and 
AUC) appear to be relying increasingly on smaller 
arms-for-drugs purchases, instead of purchasing large amounts 
of weapons with cash.  Most of the recent weapons seizures in 
Panama have been relatively small -- 30 to 50 weapons -- 
suggesting that the Colombian armed groups recognized their 
vulnerability with the Otterloo seizure.  Nonetheless, both 
the Pacific and Caribbean costs of Panama remain active 
arms-for-drugs corridors that GOP officials believe pose a 
serious threat to Panama\'s security.  Despite two impressive 
arms captures in September and November and extensive talk 
about the impact that arms trafficking has on Panama\'s 
domestic crime, budget woes and internal power struggles have 
prevented the Panamanian Public Forces (PPF) from taking a 
more aggressive stand against arms trafficking.  End Summary. 
 
 
------------- 
THE ARMS ROAD 
------------- 
 
 
2.  (C)  In a recent meeting, Panamanian National Police 
(PNP) Intelligence Officer Manuel Muy told PolOff that the 
standard arms trafficking route is by road via the 
Pan-American highway from Nicaragua through Panama. 
Traffickers then transfer the arms to boats along the Pacific 
coast of Panama to ferry them out to ships waiting in deeper 
water, ultimately for delivery to Colombian guerrilla groups, 
including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
and United Self-defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). 
Alternatively, Nicaraguan arms are sometimes smuggled by land 
into the Caribbean port city of Colon, where the arms are 
exchanged for drugs.  Indeed, Colon has become an 
increasingly dangerous city because of this arms-for-drugs 
trafficking that is run by Colombians with the assistance of 
Panamanian criminal elements. 
 
 
3.  (C)  On September 28 the PNP seized 36 high-caliber 
weapons, a grenade launcher, a Dragonov sniper rifle and 
ample munitions during a daylight raid on a dock less than 
200 yards from the Presidential palace in the center of 
Panama City.  The PNP was responsible for guarding the dock, 
but the PNP officials assigned to guard duty were evidently 
absent before the raid.  On November 5, the PNP seized a 
shipment of 40 AK-47 and a Galil rifle during a raid at a 
private residence 12 miles north of the capital.  The two 
seizures have lifted a veil from a problem that Embassy 
source say is growing steadily worse, one which has national 
security implications for Colombia and also potentially for 
Panama. 
 
 
4.  (C)  In previous discussions, Ministry of Government and 
Justice (MOGJ) Security Advisor Severino Mejia told PolOff 
that the arms trade is a grave threat to Panama because it 
increases the number of illegal weapons in the country and 
contributes to rising rates of violence and domestic crime. 
Mejia also told PolOff that the GOP believes the weapons are 
part of a routine weapons trafficking route bringing former 
Sandinista arms from Nicaragua to Colombian guerrilla groups. 
 Immediately after taking charge of the PNP, Director General 
Gustavo Perez said in a September 12 newspaper interview that 
illegal arms are a primary threat to Panama\'s public safety. 
Although Perez vowed to attack the problem, the PNP\'s meager 
resources will limit their ability to combat this 
Colombian/Panamanian criminal nexus. 
 
 
-------------------- 
THEORETICAL SOLUTION 
-------------------- 
 
 
5.  Panama\'s objective, according to MOGJ Security Advisor 
Mejia, is to prevent international arms traffickers from 
using Panama as an arms conduit.  MOGJ has proposed employing 
more PNP officers in Panama\'s western provinces closest to 
the boarder with Costa Rica where illegal arms enter Panama. 
MOGJ also would like to create 11 joint National Maritime 
Service (SMN) and National Air Service (SAN) sea and air 
defense rings off shore to make Panama uninviting to arms 
traffickers.  Severino told PolOff that his government hopes 
to force the traffickers to move off shore thereby 
eliminating the impact within Panama. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
PPF FAILS TO GUARD THE DOCKS 
---------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (C)  SMN and MOGJ sources have told EmbOffs that they 
plan to assign SMN personnel to guard docks where arms may be 
transiting.  Members of the PNP were assigned to guard the 
dock within shouting distance of the presidential palace on 
the day of the September 28 raid, but the PNP officers were 
conspicuously absent.  Embassy sources speculated that the 
PNP officers may have been bribed by the arms dealers to 
leave their posts.  PNP Director General Gustavo Perez has 
openly stated that corruption within the ranks is his 
greatest leadership challenge.  Perez has announced plans to 
investigate suspected police misconduct and improve the 
professionalism of the PNP.  SMN officials told EmbOffs that 
the SMN would take over guarding certain docks beginning in 
October, and after repeated comments, they promised the same 
for November.  Nonetheless, EmbOffs have seen no such 
reinforcement. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
7.  (C)  Panama recognizes that it must take a stronger stand 
against international arms trafficking.  In 2001, a ship 
named \"the Otterloo\" carrying about 3,000 weapons from 
Nicaragua through Panama to the AUC in Colombia was seized. 
Arms trafficking patterns between Central America and 
Colombia seem to have subsequently changed.  Instead of 
purchasing large amounts of weapons with cash, the Colombian 
armed groups (FARC and AUC) appear to be relying increasingly 
on smaller arms-for-drugs purchases.  Recent seizures in 
Panama have been small -- 30 to 50 weapons -- suggesting that 
the Colombian armed groups recognized their vulnerability 
with the \"Otterloo\" seizure.  Nevertheless, both the Pacific 
and Caribbean costs of Panama remain key corridors in an 
active arms-for-drugs trade that GOP officials believe pose a 
serious threat to Panama\'s security. 
 
 
8.  (C)  Despite an extensive platform of security promises 
and a request from the MOGJ to increase the PNP budget and 
double the SAN and SMN budgets, fiscal realities and domestic 
spending priorities have forced the Torrijos administration 
to cut financial resources for all three public forces an 
estimated 3%.  While the probability of a coordinated PPF 
air, land and sea barricade against arms trafficking is 
unlikely in the coming year, the concept illustrates the 
concern within the Torrijos administration\'s public security 
forces and the ministry that controls them.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (C)  Mexican President Vicente Fox publicly endorsed 
Panama\'s inclusion in the G3 (Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico) 
during his November 2-3 visit to Panama.  According to MFA 
Advisor Nils Castro and International Organizations Director 
Javier Bonagas, the GOP\'s primary interest in joining the G4 
is to integrate Panama\'s economy with the much bigger G3 
markets and thereby make Panama an economic bridge between 
the Andean countries and Mexico.  Panamanian policy makers 
believe joining an informal G4 grouping will help them meet 
Panama\'s foreign relations objectives (see reftel) of 
developing the economy, attracting foreign investment and 
improving job opportunities.  One drawback to joining the G4 
is that the GOP is wary of expanding economic ties with 
Mexico to the point that its farmers drown in a tidal wave of 
Mexican agricultural products.  Joining the G4 may increase 
economic ties with Colombia, but also bring unwanted 
Colombian proposals to extend the Pan-American highway 
through the Darien gap, which Panama is trying to fend off. 
Panama and Colombia are also discussing natural gas and 
electrical links with Venezuela.  End Summary. 
 
 
-------------- 
JOINING THE G4 
-------------- 
 
 
2.  (C)  During his November 2-3 visit to Panama, Mexican 
President Vicente Fox encouraged Panama to join the (G3) 
Group of Three (Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico) which began 
with a three-way FTA in 1995 and had its first summit in 
April 2001.  While Colombia initially opposed Panama\'s 
membership, at a November 5 meeting in Brazil, Panama Vice 
President Samuel Lewis Navarro joined Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez, Colombian Present Alvaro Uribe and President 
Vincente Fox to formally announce Panama\'s inclusion in the 
Group of Four (G4).  From Panama\'s view, MFA Advisor Nils 
Castro told PolOff on November 24 that while the G4 is a 
political, social and economic agreement, Panama mainly wants 
to use the G4 as a four-way FTA.  Ultimately, Panama wants to 
expand its relations to the Andes region and negotiate FTAs 
with Peru, Ecuador and possibly Chile. 
 
 
--------------- 
COURTING MEXICO 
--------------- 
 
 
3.  (C)  In truth, Castro continued, Chile is a much better 
FTA partner for Panama because the two countries cultivate 
different agricultural products making their markets 
complementary, rather than competitive.  Mexico by contrast 
produces many of the same products as Panama, but with 
greater resources and 30 times the population, so Panamanian 
farmers could not compete.  Panama must have safeguards to 
protect a large sector of its work force that relies on 
commercial agriculture, explained Castro.  Mexico is offering 
some sweeteners to Panama, for instance, extended 
professional visas for Panamanian businessmen and possible 
removal of Panama from a taxation \"black list.\"  More than a 
dozen big-name Mexican investors accompanied Fox to Panama. 
They included Carlos Slim, who owns Carso Group; Lorenza 
Zambrano, Latin America\'s richest man according to La Prensa, 
who owns Cemex (one of the world\'s largest cement 
manufacturers); Ricardo Salinas Pliego, owner of Azteca 
Television; Bernardo Quintana, founder of Civil Engineers 
Association, Inc., and others.  Fox claimed that Mexican 
investment in Panama currently totals $1.2B. 
 
 
4.  (C)  During a recent meeting, Mexican Embassy Political 
Officer Armando Obregon Jimenez told PolOff that Mexico\'s 
interest in including Panama in the G4 is linked to another 
regional initiative, Mexico\'s Inter-American Development Bank 
proposal, Plan Puebla Panama (PPP).  PPP includes eight 
counties: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico and Panama. PPP is an integrated 
social and economic proposal to spur development of Central 
American infrastructure including trade, disaster response, 
regional utilities, roads and other public works projects, 
using Inter-American Development Bank funding.  PPP began 
with the 1991 Tuxtla Agreement between Mexico and seven 
Central American nations and was formally launched ten years 
later on June 15, 2001.  Mexico sees Panama\'s inclusion in 
both the G4 and the PPP as critical for regional development 
due to its central geographical location. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
AVOID THE ROAD TO COLOMBIA 
-------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (C)  In a resolution signed November 18 in San Jose, 
Colombia joined the PPP as an observer.  Both the PPP and G4 
give Colombia more avenues to pressure Panama for a road 
through the Darien gap.  Nils Castro, the GOP\'s PPP 
representative, said that the GOP is seeking alternative 
solutions to avoid the highway discussion but continue with 
other links.  One option is sub-oceanic gas and electric 
pipelines from Venezuela, through Colombia and along the 
Caribbean coast of Panama.  That route would maintain the 
integrity of the Darien gap, which acts as a natural barrier 
against hoof and mouth disease, malaria, screw worm and other 
diseases.  Already facing problematic illegal immigration and 
narco-arms trafficking from Colombia, Panama is less than 
eager to open a new immigration route to Colombia.  Panama 
environmentalists also strongly oppose building a road 
through the Darien.  Castro explained that the GOP is working 
on alternate plans of ferry transport along the Caribbean 
coast and/or new air freight routes between the two nations 
for commercial goods.  Currently, he said Panama-to-Colombia 
air connections are passenger flights. 
 
 
6.  (C)  Eventually, Castro said, a road to Colombia will be 
built.  However, the GOP hopes to wait until they have 
developed enough of a tax base to reinforce their customs, 
immigrations and public forces to ensure security at the 
Colombia-Panama border crossing when it opens.  He voiced 
concern about public reaction to a road.  Panamanians 
currently associate Colombia with violence, drugs, 
kidnappings and illegal immigrations.  They will not tolerate 
discussion of a road now, Castro explained. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
VENEZUELAN GASOLINE AND NATURAL GAS 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (C)  Panama has high hopes of using the G4 to reduce the 
high cost of fuel.  Panamanian Public Forces (PPF) and the 
National System of Civil Protection (SINAPROC) frequently 
complain that they can not respond to floods or suspicious 
aircraft or boats due to the lack of fuel.  While the 
government is currently operating under an austerity budget, 
the additional problem is that the cost of fuel is high and 
officials have been announcing regularly in the press that 
they intend to seek assistance from Venezuela to lower the 
cost of fuel in Panama.  Castro also said that Panama must 
look for alternate fuels and mentioned natural gas-operated 
bus systems in other countries.  Castro said that GOP 
priorities for Venezuela are primarily for natural gas. 
Newspaper reports indicate that relations with Venezuela 
could lower fuel prices.  Castro said the GOP has no other 
commercial relations with Venezuela. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
6.  (C)  The GOP accurately sees Panama as a minnow swimming 
with whales and is trying to advance its foreign relations 
and economic agendas to expand its economic base without 
getting crushed in the process.  Senior GOP officials, 
including Minister of the Presidency Ubaldino Real and 
Minister of Trade and Industry Alejandro Ferrer, have 
extolled the benefits that NAFTA has brought to Mexico as a 
way of pushing a pro-free trade agenda.  Given the \"thinness\" 
of expertise at the top, the GOP risks overextending itself 
in joining the G4.  The G4, the PPP, Colombia\'s pressure for 
a road, and Mexico\'s pressure to open the Panama market all 
present positive and negative possibilities which Panama is 
struggling to manage politically.

1.  (SBU) Embassy Panama offers the following information and 
analysis in response to Reftel A tasking. 
 
 
CUBA AND PANAMANIAN POLITICS 
----------------------------- 
2.  (C) Six days before leaving office, late on the evening 
of August 25, 2004, Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso 
pardoned four anti-Castro Cubans who had been jailed since 
November 2000 and convicted in April 2004 for conspiracy, 
possession of explosives, and endangering public security 
(Reftels B and C) in connection with an alleged plot to 
assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro.  Three of the four 
pardoned prisoners are AmCits and traveled to Miami early on 
the morning of August 26.  The fourth, Luis Posada Carriles, 
reportedly traveled to Honduras. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) The pardons caused an immediate rupture in 
relations between Panama and Cuba.  Newly inaugurated 
President Martin Torrijos criticized the pardons in his 
September 1 inaugural address and vowed to restore relations, 
but Cuba was not willing to move quickly.  Consular relations 
were restored on November 19; the Cuban consulate re-opened 
in Panama City on December 2, according to press reports. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) In recent days, local newspapers have raised doubts 
about the legality of actions taken by former GOP officials 
-- Minister of Government and Justice Escalona, Police Chief 
Bares, and Immigration Chief Tapia, in particular -- who 
allegedly ignored certain legal requirements governing the 
travel of the four men and their exit from Panama. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Under the Moscoso government, Panama maintained a 
largely a neutral policy toward with the notable exception of 
the August 25 pardons and with its 2003 decision to accept 
Cuban citizen Ramon Aguilar Hernandez as a refugee after his 
failed attempt to flee Cuba to the United States and his 
subsequent detention by U.S. authorities in Guantanamo Bay 
Naval Base. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) Panama has routinely supported initiatives in 
multilateral fora to promote human rights or to condemn 
abuses worldwide.  Individual GOP representatives have 
expressed specific concerns about human rights abuses in 
Cuba; however, in the recent past the GOP has not publicly 
criticized Cuba for human rights abuses.  Panama has 
consistently joined  its neighbors in the region by following 
majority decisions on sensitive Cuba issues in multilateral 
fora, like the 2003 annual UN resolution condemning the U.S. 
embargo of Cuba.  (See Reftel D.) 
 
 
CUBA AND THE PANAMANIAN ECONOMY 
------------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) Merchandise trade with Cuba is not important for 
Panama.  In 2003, according to official figures, Panamanian 
exports to Cuba amounted to less than one-tenth of one 
percent of all Panamanian exports, while imports from Cuba 
accounted for an even smaller percentage. 
 
 
8.  (C) Cuba\'s principal economic and financial connection 
with Panama is its use of the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), where it 
is a large customer.  (See Reftel E.)  Cuban government 
businesses bought $208 million worth of merchandise in 2003 
through the CFZ, where finance is relatively easy to arrange. 
 Overdue Cuban accounts receivable probably exceed the 
official figure of $200 million.  Panamanian businesses 
holding these large debts believe they have an interest to 
restrain local criticism of Cuban government policies, if 
only to ensure continued interest payments and to stave off a 
Cuban default.  In fact, following the late August 2004 break 
of diplomatic relations between the two countries, CFZ 
merchants immediately protested, fearing Cuba might retaliate 
by not paying its outstanding debts. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) Embassy has not been able to identify Panamanian 
investments in Cuba. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
10.  (C) Cuba may be slow in paying its debts but, as the CFZ 
represents a lifeline, fears of a default are exaggerated. 
The chance of a default is low.  USG action against Cuban 
interests in the CFZ would affect a wide range of Panamanian 
business interests and would create a major foreign relations 
problem for the United States.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (SBU) PolOff recently traveled to several remote 
indigenous areas of Panama, which are among the least 
accessible, least developed, and poorest parts of the 
country.  With little economy to speak of aside from 
subsistence agriculture, indigenous groups focus on capturing 
development grants.  PolOff accompanied Inter-American 
Foundation (IAF) Representative John Reed and IAF Program 
Monitor Alexis Pino on their visit to four IAF grantees 
working with three indigenous groups: the Ngobe, the Kuna, 
and the Embera.  Whether because of dispersion, partisanship, 
or jealousy, each indigenous group presents a development 
challenge.  The IAF currently administers $2 million in grant 
projects in Panama through nine different projects (see annex 
A).  44 of Peace Corps\' 132 volunteers serve in indigenous 
areas in Panama (see annex B).  End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
NGOBE-BUGLE COMARCA: DISPERSION AFFECTS ACCESS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  About five hours west of Panama City, past 
numerous small towns with their Chinese-run local stores, 
PolOff arrived in San Felix, principal administrative seat of 
the indigenous Ngobe-Bugle comarca (reservation).  Located in 
Chiriqui province, San Felix is one of the few towns of any 
size with road access and electricity leading into the 
comarca.  Because San Felix has electricity, the coffee 
cooperative benefiting from the IAF project can use its 
coffee roaster and bag sealer.  To actually visit one coffee 
grower, PolOff struggled by Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle up a 
mountain on a steep, muddy, and rocky road for over an hour. 
One of the 29 Peace Corps volunteers in the comarca also 
worked with the coffee cooperative. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Working with in the Ngobe-Bugle comarca is a 
challenge because project specialists and the Ngobes 
themselves need to travel long distances for instruction. 
The approximately 126,000 Ngobe-Bugle comarca residents are 
dispersed throughout the 6,673 mountainous square kilometers 
of the comarca (8.8% of Panama\'s national territory) and 
neighbors are far from within shouting distance.  Although a 
Ngobe crafts group runs a $50,000 craft center off the 
highway about twenty minutes from San Felix, one Ngobe woman 
approached PolOff about creating a craft center in the 
comarca.  One accomplished Ngobe artisan said he travels a 
full day on foot through the comarca just to reach the 
current craft center.  The route from his house to the craft 
center is too rough for cars or bicycles, even if he had one. 
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
KUNAS YALA COMARCA: PARTISANSHIP 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  A week later, after about an hour flight northeast 
of Panama City in a puddle jumper, PolOff landed on a postage 
stamp with a landing strip that is the Kuna island of 
Porvenir.  The Kuna have 49 communities, 46 of them on tiny 
Caribbean islands surrounded by sparkling turquoise water 
that are sandbars with a palm tree.  But they\'re not 
deserted.  Imagine Gilligan\'s Island if a modern cruise liner 
had run aground.  Every bit of space on the islands is 
occupied by the comarca\'s 36,000 inhabitants and their 
thatched huts.  Despite having a strip of comarcal land 
approximately a hundred miles long along the malarial 
Caribbean coast (it\'s not called the Mosquito Coast for 
nothing), the Kuna live all together.  Like Gilligan\'s 
Island, about 15 minutes after the \"castaways\" presented a 
united front to PolOff, the \"Howells\" pulled PolOff aside to 
advocate their own political party and narrow interests.  A 
Kuna observer present in the comarca in the lead up to the 
May 2004 national elections confirmed this strong Kuna 
political partisanship. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  The highly organized and communal Kuna maintain 
their culture through traditional governing structures, such 
as the General Congress and the Cultural Congress. 
Both of these traditional bodies have their own NGOs to 
facilitate donors.  The IAF museum project works with one of 
these NGOs which also receives technical assistance from the 
Smithsonian\'s Museum of the American Indian.  Peace Corps 
formalized its relationship with the Kuna in an agreement 
signed in 2003, and Peace Corps had 11 volunteers working 
with the Kuna Yala in FY 2004.

6.  (SBU)  Although the Cultural Congress and General 
Congress are meant to be nonpartisan, individual members 
often have their own party affiliations.  Cultural Congress 
members lean toward the governing PRD, a left-center party. 
In the Kuna\'s open and communal society, these affiliations 
are well known and can lead to allegations that the 
Congress\'s NGO is favoring party members in project 
implementation.  Some members of the Cultural Congress\'s NGO 
are also members of the Cultural Congress.  Members of the 
Cultural Congress also confirmed that the two traditional 
Congresses coordinate only minimally with the two (non-PRD) 
national legislators from the comarca.  The Cultural Congress 
members explained that Kuna communities view the legislators 
merely as patrons for sponsoring local projects, not as 
advocates for the community as a whole.  This partisanship 
and parochialism make a voting block among all indigenous 
legislators less likely because Kuna legislators and Ngobe 
legislators are from different political parties and serve 
different communities.

EMBERA IN CHAGRES: SUCCESS BREEDS JEALOUSY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  A convenient hour-ride north of Panama City in 
birders\' paradise Chagres National Park, 300 Embera have hit 
the development jackpot, leaving jealous non-Embera in their 
wake.  After a twenty-minute trip through the lush, tranquil 
park by motorized canoe guided by two young Embera men 
dressed in tourist-freindly body paint and brightly colored 
loincloths, the people of the village Embera Drua greeted 
PolOff - in costume and ready to put on a show.  The men 
played traditional Embera music on wooden flutes.  The women, 
clad in colorful skirts, torsos bare save for body paint and 
jewelry, waved.  Embera men spoke to PolOff in good Spanish 
and the women taught PolOff some Embera phrases.  When cruise 
ship excusions visit Embera Drua, the villagers told PolOff, 
the village\'s cut is $15 a head, half of it profit.  The 
Embera Drua also sell handicrafts to visitors at good prices, 
so much so that Embera relatives in the Darien now supply the 
group with many of the crafts for sale in the village. 
Because some visitors want to give money directly to Embera 
Drua children, the Embera Drua created a foundation to use 
the money for community projects.  And Embera Drua leaders 
said that seven of ten of their children going to secondary 
school are on scholarships with Youth Ministry in Panama 
City.  Six more children will be on scholarship next year.  A 
Peace Corps volunteer worked in Embera Drua recently and two 
Peace Corps volunteers worked with the Embera in Chagres in 
FY 2004. 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  The Embera Drua have disproportionate success 
because they are easily accessible to tourists and technical 
assistance (such as the IAF funded tourism project) and hold 
a near-monopoly on the \"indigenous cultural experience\" in 
idyllic surroundings. The IAF Embera project involves 300 
people in three villages who settled within Chagres National 
Park in the 1970s, before new settlement was banned to 
protect the Canal watershed. Most of the other 20,000 Emberas 
live in more remote areas east of Panama City.  One NGO 
worker in Chagres not associated with the IAF project told 
PolOff that non-indigenous Panamanian colonists are jealous 
of the amount of attention and help the Embera receive in 
Chagres, especially because the colonists far outnumber the 
Embera. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
9. (SBU)  Jealousy remains a source of conflict between 
non-indigenous colonists (i.e., traditional Latin subsistence 
farmers) and the Embera given the Embera Drua\'s obvious 
economic success.  Colonist tensions with Embera-Wounan over 
land, not tourism, led to violence in August with 
Embera-Wounan subsistence farmers near Chiman, a remote town 
about 150 kilometers to the east of both Chagres and Panama 
City.

REF: PANAMA 813 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Since the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) established a permanent office in Panama in 
April (reftel), the GOP has cooperated increasingly with the 
UNHCR and other NGOs to assist the approximately 821 
displaced Colombians in the Darien border area.  Under the 
Torrijos administration, the Panamanian Refugee Commission 
has done an about face - convening frequently to diligently 
deliberate on its 75-case backlog.  The UNHCR expects the 
Refugee Commission\'s outstanding cooperation to decline as 
the typical refugee in Panama changes from poor 
border-crosser to middle class plane passenger and the 
Commission is flooded with applications. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
GOP ASSISTS DISPLACED COLOMBIANS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  In the last six months of the Moscoso 
administration, the GOP improved cooperation with the UNHCR 
and other NGOs in providing services to the approximately 821 
displaced Colombians in the Darien border area.  The GOP 
placed a member of the GOP refugee agency (ONPAR) in Jaque on 
Panama\'s Pacific coast and in El Tuira in central Darien. 
While still reluctant to classify them as refugees, the GOP 
worked with the government of Colombia and the UNHCR on steps 
to regularize the status of the displaced Colombians. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Under the Torrijos administration, GOP assistance 
and cooperation with NGOs consolidated.  In November, the 
UNHCR helped marry 21 mixed Panamanian/Colombian couples in 
the Darien, a step in qualifying for a visa.  For the first 
time, the GOP also helped register children born to displaced 
Colombians. 
 
 
----------------------- 
NEW TREND: ENTRY BY AIR 
----------------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  According to Panama UNHCR Representative Gonzalo 
Vargas Llosa, the face of refugees in Panama changed over the 
past year.  As the security situation along the Colombian 
border improved, poor, rural, indigenous Colombians no longer 
cross into Panama to flee violence.  Instead, small-scale 
Colombian entrepreneurs and plantation owners flee to Panama 
by air, generally after refusing to pay the \"vacunas\" 
(payoffs) demanded by insurgents.  These Colombians have no 
problem showing Panamanian immigration the $500 required in 
order to enter Panama. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
REFUGEE COMMISSION: DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  Under the Torrijos administration, the GOP\'s 
adjudicator of permanent refugee cases, the Refugee 
Commission, dramatically improved.  After receiving training 
from the UNHCR, the Commission met for a day and a half in 
November and reviewed 25 cases, approving 12 and deferring 5 
(which the UNHCR also expects to be approved).  Because of 
derivative benefits for family members, at least 50 people 
will gain legal status through the November meeting. 
Although not required by law, the Commission is scheduled to 
meet again in December to reduce the remaining backlog of 50 
refugee cases. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  UNHCR Representative Vargas Llosa was especially 
impressed with the careful attention Vice Minister of MOGJ 
Olga Golcher gave to presiding over the Refugee Commission, 
noting that her performance was \"like night and day\" compared 
with Vice Minister Perez under the Moscoso administration. 
Despite a decree requiring the Commission to meet every three 
months, under the Moscoso administration the Commission met 
only once during its last 18 months in office, reviewing ten 
cases and approving only two. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  The Refugee Commission\'s expeditious and 
successful resolution of refugee cases is not sustainable. 
The current 50% approval rate is on the high-end globally. 
Many new-trend middle class Colombian refugees are likely to 
file petitions in response to the Commission\'s favorable 
rulings.  The UNHCR expects the Commission\'s record to 
decline as the Torrijos administration becomes wary of 
placing its imprimatur on large numbers of Colombian 
applicants and their families.  Panamanians are sensitive to 
the large numbers of recent Colombian immigrants working 
illegally in Panama.

SUBJECT:  PANAMA - 2005 NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT 
 
 
1.  TRADE SUMMARY 
 
 
The U.S. trade surplus with Panama was $1.5 billion in 2003, 
an increase of $443 million from $1.1 billion in 2002.  U.S. 
goods exports in 2003 were $1.8 billion, an increase of 31 
percent from the previous year.  Corresponding U.S. imports 
from Panama were $301 million, roughly unchanged from 2002. 
Panama is currently the United States\' 42nd largest export 
market for U.S. goods. 
 
 
The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Panama 
in 2002 amounted to $20.0 billion, down from 20.5 percent 
from 2001. 
 
 
Updated trade data to be filled in by Washington agencies 
for consistency purposes. 
 
 
2.  IMPORT POLICIES 
 
 
a.  Tariffs 
 
 
Following its accession to the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) in 1997, Panama\'s import policies opened considerably 
and its tariffs ranked among the lowest in Latin America. 
Panama\'s average tariff remains low, averaging just 8 
percent.  However, in September 1999, Panama did raise 
selected agricultural tariffs, some of which reached the 
maximum amount allowed under Panama\'s WTO commitments. 
 
 
b.  Non-Tariff Measures 
 
 
In addition to tariffs, all imports into Panama are subject 
to a 5% transfer (or ITBM) tax levied on the CIF value, and 
other handling charges.  Pharmaceuticals, foods, and school 
supplies enjoy an exemption from the transfer tax. 
Currently, no import licenses are required in the country, 
provided the intending importing entity holds a commercial 
or industrial license to operate in Panama. 
 
 
c.  Free Trade Negotiations 
 
 
In April 2004, the United States and Panama began free trade 
negotiations.  A free trade agreement (FTA) with Panama 
would extend the list of countries in the Americas with 
which the United States has completed free trade agreements 
to include all of North and Central America except Belize, 
which is a member of the Carribbean Community (CARICOM).  In 
conjunction with these and a planned free trade agreement 
with the Andean countries Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and 
Bolivia, the negotiation with Panama will complement the 
goal of completing a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). 
Negotiations with Panama will increase momentum toward 
lowering trade barriers and set a positive example for other 
small economies in the Western Hemisphere. 
 
 
3.  STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING, AND CERTIFICATION 
 
 
With certain exceptions, Panama\'s application of standards 
and certification requirements generally conforms to WTO 
standards. However, restrictions have been applied from time 
to time in response to pressure to protect local producers. 
Particularly of concern has been the lack of procedural 
transparency by relevant Panamanian authorities when 
deciding whether to issue or deny phytosanitary permits. 
 
 
Panama requires certification by Panamanian health and 
agriculture officials of individual U.S. processing plants 
as a condition for the import of poultry, pork, dairy, and 
beef products. U.S. exporters have assisted Panamanian 
officials in making inspection visits to U.S. plants. There 
have been no instances of a U.S. plant failing to be 
certified, but inspections have been delayed many times for 
various reasons, including lack of personnel and budgetary 
constraints in the responsible Panamanian ministries.   The 
United States considers it a high priority to obtain 
Panama\'s system-wide recognition of the U.S. meat inspection 
system, in place of the current plant-by-plant approach. 
This effort is a primary focus during the ongoing FTA 
negotiations. 
 
 
While importers of non-agricultural products must register 
them with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before 
distribution or sale in Panama, procedures for registration 
are straightforward and evenly applied. There are no 
comprehensive labeling or testing requirements for imports, 
except for food and pharmaceutical products. 
 
 
When the United States launched FTA negotiations in 2004, it 
simultaneously initiated an active working group dialogue on 
SPS barriers to agricultural trade that meets alongside the 
negotiations and will also continue to meet and work on 
resolution of SPS issues after the negotiations conclude. 
 
 
4.  GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
 
 
Panama\'s government procurement regime is governed by Law 56 
and managed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). 
The law provides for a transparent bidding process for 
government contracts, but allows for exceptions, such as 
procurements for national defense.  The Panamanian 
Government has generally handled bids in a transparent 
manner, although occasionally U.S. companies have complained 
of mishandling of certain procedures. However, formal 
complaints have not been pursued, usually because of 
interest in other business, fear of reprisals, and lack of 
confidence in the appeals process.  While Panama make a 
commitment at the time of its WTO accession, to become a 
party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), its 
efforts to accede to the GPA have stalled.  Although the 
Panama Canal Authority (PCA) has generally followed 
transparent and fair bidding processes, the United States 
has been particularly disappointed by the Government of 
Panama\'s failure to include the PCA in its accession offer. 
The U.S. government is addressing the issue of the PCA 
within the context of bilateral free trade agreement 
negotiations. 
 
 
5.  EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
 
 
Panamanian law allows any company to import raw materials or 
semi-processed goods at a duty of three percent for domestic 
consumption or processing, or duty free for export 
production, except for sensitive agricultural products, such 
as rice, dairy, pork, and tomato products.  Companies not 
already receiving benefits under the Special Incentives Law 
of 1986 are allowed a tax deduction of up to 10 percent of 
their profits from export operations through 2005. 
 
 
Because of its WTO obligations, Panama revised its export 
subsidy policies in 1997-98. The government originally had 
stated its intention to phase out its Tax Credit Certificate 
(CAT), given to firms producing certain non-traditional 
exports, by the end of 2001. But during the WTO Ministerial 
Conference in November 2001, the Government of Panama asked 
for and received an extension for the use of CATs.  The WTO 
further extended the period of this waiver to December 2006 
for multiple developing countries, including Panama.  The 
policy allows exporters to receive CATs equal to 15 percent 
of the export\'s national value added. The certificates are 
transferable and may be used to pay tax obligations to the 
government, or they can be sold in secondary markets at a 
discount. The government has become stricter in defining 
national value added, attempting to reduce the amount of 
credit claimed by exporters. 
 
 
A number of industries that produce exclusively for export, 
such as shrimp farming and tourism, are exempted from paying 
certain types of taxes and import duties. The Government of 
Panama established this policy to attract foreign 
investment, especially in economically depressed regions, 
such as the city of Colon. Companies that profit from these 
exemptions are not eligible to receive CATs for their 
exports. 
 
 
A new domestic subsidy called the Certificate to Foment 
Industry (CFI), which would replace the CATs when that 
program ends, was signed into law by former President Mireya 
Moscoso on February 4, 2004.  Panamanian authorities have 
stated that the CFI will be consistent with Panama\'s WTO 
obligations. 
 
 
The Tourism Law of 1994 (Law 8) allows deduction from 
taxable income of 50 percent of any amount invested by 
Panamanian citizens in tourism development. 
 
 
Law 25 of 1996 provides for the development of \"export 
processing zones\" (EPZ\'s) as part of an effort to broaden 
the Panamanian manufacturing sector while promoting 
investment, particularly in former U.S. military bases. 
Companies operating in these zones may import inputs duty- 
free if products assembled in the zones are to be exported. 
The government also provides other tax incentives to EPZ 
companies. 
 
 
6.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
 
 
Protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Panama 
has improved significantly in recent years.  Specialized 
prosecutors have been created for intellectual property- 
related cases.  Intellectual property policy and practice in 
Panama is the responsibility of an Inter-institutional 
Committee. This committee consists of representatives from 
six government agencies and operates under the leadership of 
the Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade. It coordinates 
enforcement actions and develops strategies to improve 
compliance with the law. In 2000, the Government of Panama 
issued a decree mandating that all computer systems used by 
government entities be legal and licensed. 
 
 
a.  Copyrights 
 
 
Panama\'s 1994 copyright law modernized copyright protection 
in Panama, providing for payment of royalties, facilitating 
the prosecution of copyright violators, protecting computer 
software, and making copyright infringement a felony. 
Although the lead prosecutor for IPR cases in the Attorney 
General\'s Office has taken a vigorous enforcement stance 
against piracy and counterfeiting, the Copyright Office 
remains small and ineffective, and Panama\'s judicial system 
has not provided speedy and effective remedies in civil and 
criminal piracy cases brought under the law.  Given Panama\'s 
role as a transshipment point, Panama is susceptible to 
trading in pirated and counterfeit goods. 
 
 
The government of Panama is signatory to the WIPO Copyright 
Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonographs Treaty, but 
the Copyright Office has been slow to draft and implement 
further improvements to the Copyright Law.  Nevertheless, 
the office has proposed to establish new offenses, such as 
for Internet-based copyright violations, and to enhance 
border measures.  It has already raised the penalties for 
infractions.  Legislation drafted with technical assistance 
from SIECA (the Central American Economic Integration 
System) has not yet become law. 
 
 
b.  Patents 
 
 
Panama\'s 1996 Industrial Property Law provides a term of 20 
years of patent protection from the date of filing. 
However, pharmaceutical patents are granted for only 15 
years and can be renewed for an additional ten years, if the 
patent owner licenses a national company (minimum of 30 
percent Panamanian ownership) to exploit the patent.  The 
Industrial Property Law provides specific protection for 
trade secrets. 
 
 
c.  Trademarks 
 
 
Law 35 provides trademark protection, simplifies the process 
of registering trademarks and allows for renewal of a 
trademark for ten-year periods. The law\'s most important 
feature is the granting of ex-officio authority to 
government agencies to conduct investigations and to seize 
materials suspected of being counterfeited. Decrees 123 of 
November 1996 and 79 of August 1997 specify the procedures 
to be followed by Customs and Colon Free Zone (CFZ) 
officials in conducting investigations and confiscating 
merchandise. In 1997, the Customs Directorate created a 
special office for IPR enforcement, followed by a similar 
office created by the CFZ in 1998. The Trademark 
Registration Office has undertaken significant modernization 
with a searchable computerized database of registered 
trademarks that is open to the public. 
 
 
7.  SERVICES BARRIERS 
 
 
In general, Panama maintains an open regulatory environment 
for services. For some professions, such as insurance 
brokers, customs brokerage, freight forwarding, architects, 
engineers, medical doctors, lawyers, and psychologists, 
Panama requires that individuals hold a Panamanian technical 
license. 
 
 
8.  INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
 
 
Panama maintains an open investment regime and is receptive 
to foreign investment. Over the years the country has 
focused its efforts on bolstering its reputation as an 
international trading, banking, maritime, and services 
center.  However, retail activity is reserved to 
Panamanians.  The U.S. government is addressing the issue of 
the retail sector within the context of bilateral free trade 
agreement negotiations.  Until recently, the Panamanian 
government was unresponsive to several foreign investors. 
For example, a few firms that are closely regulated by, or 
hold concessions from the Government of Panama, encountered 
a lack of cooperation from certain officials and abrupt 
changes related to terms of various concessions or 
contracts.  In 2003, the Government of Panama addressed 
these problems constructively by re-opening discussions with 
the U.S. Government under the rubric of the Ad Hoc 
Investment Commission, which had been used successfully in 
the past to resolve concerns of U.S. investors.  The 
resolution of a number of these disputes during the past two 
years helped make possible the November 2003 announcement 
that both countries plan to move forward with bilateral 
negotiations for a free trade agreement in 2004. 
 
 
In accordance with the terms of the U.S.-Panama Bilateral 
Investment Treaty, Panama places no restrictions on the 
nationality of senior management. Panama does restrict 
foreign nationals to 10 percent of the blue-collar work 
force, however, and specialized or technical foreign workers 
may number no more than 15 percent of all employees in a 
business. 
 
 
A 1998 investment law aimed to enhance new investment in 
Panama by guaranteeing that investors will have no 
restrictions on capital and dividend repatriation, foreign 
exchange use and disposal of production inside a limited 
number of sectors in the economy. The spirit of the law is 
that for ten years, investors will not suffer any 
deterioration of the conditions prevailing at the time the 
investment was made. The guarantees are related to new laws 
that may be enacted in the future affecting fiscal, customs, 
and labor regimes. 
 
 
 
 
9.  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
 
 
In mid-2001, Panama became the first country in Central 
America to adopt a law specific to electronic commerce. The 
law was a collaborative effort of the public and private 
sectors, resulting from several months of detailed 
discussions and broad consultations. Panama\'s electronic 
commerce law has several important features:  it gives legal 
force to any transaction or contract completed 
electronically; it creates the National Directorate of 
Electronic Commerce to oversee the enforcement of the law; 
and it defines certification organizations and establishes a 
voluntary registration regime.  A regulatory framework was 
established in August 2004.  The law is expected to have a 
favorable impact on many sectors of Panama\'s services 
dominated economy, particularly the maritime sector. 
 
 
10.  OTHER BARRIERS 
 
 
Corruption 
 
 
The judicial system can pose a problem for investors due to 
poorly trained personnel, huge case backlogs and a lack of 
independence from political influence.  In addition, 
allegations of corruption persist, not only in the judicial 
system, but also possibly in government procurement and at 
the municipal level.

2. (SBU) Introduction:  Hoping to capitalize early on its 
campaign promises (anti-corruption, transparency, fiscal 
responsibility and economic growth), current popularity (70 
percent), and control of the legislature, the Torrijos 
Administration is poised to press ahead with a very ambitious 
economic agenda. This agenda includes fiscal reform, fixing 
the social security program, negotiation and ratification of 
an FTA with the U.S., and teeing up a political referendum on 
Canal expansion before 2005 is over. While the agenda\'s 
economic imperative is clear to most of Panama, its execution 
represents a negative agenda for many entrenched interests 
and will be a heavy lift politically.  2005 promises to be a 
defining year for the Torrijos Administration and a test of 
its willingness and Panama\'s readiness to move more firmly 
out of the corruption, clientelism, and paternalism matrix. 
This cable provides Panama watchers a snapshot of these and 
other economic developments.  End introduction.

The Fiscal Reform and Social Security Packages 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
3. (SBU) Minister of Economy and Finance (MEF) Ricaurte 
Vasquez is scheduled to unveil an over-due package of fiscal 
reform proposals this week.  However, it is not clear whether 
the proposals to fix the social security system are ready for 
prime time. In terms of timing, we expect the fiscal reforms 
to be discussed with business groups this week and then 
pushed through in an extraordinary legislative session 
sometime in January.  Reform of the actuarily bankrupt Social 
Security System (Spanish abbreviation CSS) will probably be 
taken up by the legislature during the February/March 
time-frame to seek passage before the bulk of university 
students return to regular classes mid-March. (Note: the GoP 
clearly expects heated demonstrations and possible civil 
disturbances by students and labor groups. End Note.) 
 
 
4. (SBU) Regarding fiscal reform the message is clear: those 
who can afford to pay (Panama\'s business class) are going to 
be asked to pay, and the MEF will also announce a series of 
measures to improve and simplify tax administration.  In 
talking with Panama\'s business elite it is evident that many 
of them are not enamored with the prospect of increased taxes 
(or being put in the position of having to pay taxes) as they 
feel not enough is being done to address a bloated and 
inefficient public sector.  Despite this there seems to be an 
understanding that it\'s time to try and fix the system.  As 
one senior official (and businessman) said \"this is the price 
we have to pay for being in Panama\" (read: to continue 
enjoying a low-crime, stable political and economic 
environment).  Reforming the social security system (CSS) 
will be a tougher prospect as it affects Panama\'s working 
class; however, a broad consensus seems to be developing that 
the current situation is untenable.  The GoP will likely 
manage this by picking the least offensive measures such as 
increasing the retirement ages for men and women and 
increasing the number of contributory years; rather, than 
reducing benefits or significantly increasing workers 
contributions.  See para (9) for a further discussion of the 
program woes. 
 
 
 
 
------------------------------ 
Tightening the Budgetary Belt? 
------------------------------ 
 
 
5. (SBU) Despite efforts to limit public spending by the 
Minister of Economy and Finance Ricaurte Vasquez since taking 
office -- and primarily as a result of excesses of the 
previous Moscoso Administration -- the 2004 budget deficit is 
expected to reach 5.3 percent of GDP with the overall stock 
of public sector debt increasing to around 66 percent of GDP. 
 Nevertheless, GDP grew an impressive 6 percent in 2004 
primarily as a result of export oriented growth and a 
construction boom fueled by tax incentives (and most likely 
illicit sources of funds).  Growth for 2005 is forecasted to 
be 5 percent.  While the 2005 general budget passed last 
month was trumpeted as \"austere,\" the GoP was cautious not to 
tighten too much (this would have slowed growth down and 
caused political heartburn.  As Panama has no monetary 
policy, fiscal policy is the only major policy lever 
available).  The approved 2005 budget of $6.192 billion 
mirrors the 2004 budget of $6.168 billion.  A budget deficit 
of 3.5 percent is forecasted for 2005. 
 
 
6. (U) While the GoP\'s penchant to keep taking on more debt 
is troubling (debt service represents $1.417 billion or 22.9 
percent of the 2005 budget), Panama\'s economic health is 
enviable when compared to most countries in the region. Two 
of the three sovereign credit rating agencies currently have 
Panama one notch below investment grade.  These agencies are 
also carefully watching the measures Panama takes over the 
next few months which has implications for Canal expansion. 
Separately, citing well-known excesses of the previous two 
administrations, President Torrijos has also promised to 
publicize an account of discretionary funds usage every three 
months in order to reduce corruption and increase 
transparency. 
 
 
 
 
-------------------------- 
FTA: An Easy Ratification? 
-------------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Jerry Wilson, President of Panama\'s Legislative 
Assembly, commented to EmbOffs that once negotiated the FTA 
agreement \"will pass.\"  However, Minister of Trade and 
Industries Alejandro Ferrer has remarked several months past 
to EmbOffs that ratification of the FTA could be harder to 
obtain than reform of the Social Security System.  (Comment. 
Hyperbole aside, Ferrer\'s statements may be a positioning 
tactic to emphasize to us that depending on the negotiations 
outcome (read: agriculture), ratification may not be a sure 
thing.  However, Torrijos\'s PRD party holds a majority in 
Congress and President Torrijos and his team have 
consistently signaled their strong support for a FTA.  End 
comment.)  Separately, it is also clear, both from 
discussions with senior USG officials and what we are hearing 
at Post, that the GoP is seeking to set up rice as their 
exclusion-candidate -- citing the 60 thousand-plus jobs in 
the sector. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------- 
Panama Canal Expansion 
---------------------- 
 
 
8. (SBU) The proposed Canal expansion project to construct a 
third-set of locks has an estimated price tag of $4-6 billion 
and is expected to take 8-10 years to complete.  However, the 
constitution requires a national referendum first be 
submitted to the Panamanian people for their approval. GOP 
officials have stated this referendum will most likely occur 
in late 2005 or early 2006, and not earlier, as originally 
touted.  Actual timing of the referendum will likely depend 
on how quickly the Canal can mount an educational/public 
relations campaign aimed at garnering broad public approval 
and how much heat the Torrijos Administration takes on fiscal 
and social security reform.  The GoP is very aware that 
political referendums have had a history of failure in Panama 
-- voters have used them to register general discontent 
irrespective of the issue\'s merits -- and will want to 
carefully manage the process and timing. (Comment: 
Interestingly, we hear from various sources that Canal 
personnel are still working from timelines that have the 
referendum taking place mid-2005.  End Comment.) 
 
 
9. (SBU/NOFORN) The expansion is expected to be financed 
through a combination of Canal revenues, new user fees, and 
bridge loans.  Privately, we understand that the ACP is 
looking to levy a new \"construction tax\" (paid by the Canal\'s 
customers i.e., the world\'s shippers) that would take effect 
the day after the referendum is approved to fund a 
significant portion of the project. The Torrijos 
Administration is clearly very enamored with the project and 
see it as jobs-creation machine, a vehicle to consolidate 
Panama\'s position as a premier maritime/logistical/entrepot 
venue, and solidifying their role in Panama\'s history (the 
vision thing). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Anti-Corruption Efforts: Or a Case of Too Many Straw Tails ? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
10. (SBU) Staying true to Torrijos\'s campaign promise of 
\"zero corruption,\" Vice Minister of Finance Rolando Mirones 
submitted a formal request to the Public Ministry that former 
MEF Norberto Delgado be investigated for \"illicit enrichment\" 
on Monday, November 1.  Prohibited from speaking freely about 
the evidence the current GOP has obtained, Mirones stated 
that Delgado cannot justify his current assets.  La Prensa, 
Panama\'s leading newspaper, cited marked increases in 
Delgado\'s net worth on his sworn declarations of wealth 
during the last five years.  Mirones further commented that 
this action was a direct message for former GOP authorities 
that the Torrijos Administration will file complaints when 
there is evidence.  (Note.  Delgado also contacted Embassy to 
document \"his side\" of 
the story.  Details to be provided via septel.  End note.) 
 
 
11. (SBU) Panama\'s anti-corruption prosecutor issued an 
arrest order for Bolivar Pariente, former General Manager of 
Panama\'s National Bank (BNP) for charges of approving a loan 
in violation of BNP policies.  Under Pariente\'s leadership, 
the BNP granted a loan to a corporation to build the Prados 
del Este housing development which flooded in September 2004. 
 According to the charges, BNP granted credit facilities for 
the project in violation of the law that established BNP and 
the BNP ethics manual.  Total loss is estimated to be $12 
million.  Pariente remains outside Panama.  (Note: Pariente 
was briefly in the United States but then departed.  Embassy 
has revoked Pariente\'s visa, as a \"flight risk,\" to impede 
his entry into the U.S. should he try to return.  End note.) 
 
 
12. (SBU) While these and other efforts are salutary, it 
remains to be seen how true Torrijos will be to the campaign 
promise of zero corruption.  Many in Panama\'s elite (and 
elsewhere) doubt that any big fish will be prosecuted or that 
Torrijos will go after his own.  As one person said, there 
are too many people with \"straw tails\" in Panama (read: light 
mine, and I light yours).  This is the one area where 
Torrijos can establish and maintain credibility with Panama\'s 
voters even if they disagree with him on other things such as 
economic reforms.  The polls clearly show that corruption and 
employment are the major concerns of average Panamanians. 
Who Torrijos selects as Attorney General (a critical ten-year 
appointment rumored for this week) will be telling. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Fixing Social Security 
---------------------- 
 
 
13. (U) Press and other reports indicate that the Panamanian 
Social Security System (Spanish abbreviation CSS) will 
exhaust its resources in 2011 if reforms are not taken. 
Plagued by increasing life expectancies and static 
contribution rates and rules, the CSS maintains a large gap 
between the amount paid in and the amount paid out. Created 
in 1941 when the average life expectancy was 60 years, the 
CSS set retirement ages (the age at which the CSS would pay 
benefits) at 60 years for men and 55 years for women. 
Contrastly, Panama\'s average life expectancy in 2004 is 74 
years but its retirement ages have changed little: 62 years 
for men and 57 years for women.  Additionally, the rate of 
contributors per retiree (the number of contributors paying 
into the system for every retiree) has drastically declined 
from 58 contributors in 1941 to 5 contributors in 2004. 
Currently, Panamanians are only required to contribute to the 
CSS for 15 years.  For example, a woman retiring after 15 
years of contributions at 57 years with a life expectancy of 
72 years is expected to receive over 4 times what she put 
into the system.  Factoring in inflation adjustments as well, 
it is no surprise the CSS is losing approximately $600 
thousand per day.  While a dialogue continues between the 
CSS, employer, and labor groups over how to best reform the 
CSS, no consensus has been reached.  (Note: The CSS provides 
pensions, medical services, and workers\' compensation to over 
60 percent of Panama\'s three million population.  The 
Disability, Old Age, and Death (IVM) program component 
provides pensions to Panamanians; for many, this is their 
only source of retirement income.  End note.) 
 
 
14. (U) Recent press reports have highlighted Minister of 
Economy and Finance (MEF) Ricaurte Vasquez\'s comments that 
the financial crisis of the Caja de Seguro Social (CSS), 
Panama\'s Social Security System, could present an obstacle 
for the expansion of the Panama Canal.  According to Vasquez, 
international financial institutions, from whom Panama would 
borrow to finance the Canal\'s expansion, fear Canal monies 
would be used to finance CSS obligations.  This could result 
in higher interest rates from the lending international 
markets. 
 
 
----------------- 
Container Traffic 
----------------- 
 
 
15. (SBU) Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT), the 
largest container port in Latin America, recently announced a 
30 percent growth in TEU movements (Twenty foot equivalent 
units; the industry standard to measure containers) over last 
year.  MIT moved 1.9 million TEUs in 2003, an increase of 
800,000 units from the 1.1 million TEUs in 2002.  This growth 
can be attributed to economic recovery in Latin America and 
increased commercial trade with China. (Comment:  While 
Panama sees significant transshipments through ports such as 
MIT, Evergreen\'s Colon Container Terminal (Taiwanese-owned) 
and Hutchinson-Whampoas\' Panama Ports Company (Chinese 
owned), the volume of containers (carrying local export) sent 
to the U.S. is quite small, probably around 15,000 TEUs. The 
Panama Canal Authority (ACP) cites that during FY 2004, 
5,947,092 containers passed through the Canal.  Of these, 
1,696,868 containers were destined for the East Coast of the 
United States and 58,200 were destined for the West Coast. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Panama Canal (ACP) Breaks the Billion Dollar Mark 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
16. (U) The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) earned a record 
$1.06 billion for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, 
with $757.7 million collected from transit tolls.  (Note: The 
ACP maintains the U.S. fiscal accounting year. $923 million 
was earned in 2003.  End note.)  Revenues passed to the 
central government from Canal operations (dividends, tonnage 
fees, and services) came to around $332 million, up from $294 
million the previous fiscal year.  Such revenues will come to 
around $384 million during FY 2005.  Gross cargo throughput 
was approximately 267 million tons, a 10 percent increase 
over 2003. The number of \"Panamax\" vessels (currently the 
largest ships which cross the Canal) transiting the canal 
increased 12.5 percent to 5,329 and total transits grew by 
6.7 percent to 14,035.  The ACP reported only ten accidents 
during this year, the least number reported in the last 81 
years.  According to the ACP, the principal route utilizing 
the Canal was from Asia to the East Coast of the United 
States and the Gulf of Mexico.  Approximately 66 percent of 
the cargo transiting the Canal is going to or from the United 
States. 
 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
ACP: A Strict Question of Supply and Demand or We Did It 
Because We Could 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
17. (SBU/NOFORN) Taking advantage of its market position and 
the growth in containerization that is driving global 
maritime trade, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is proposing 
to modify its toll system and rules of measurement for 
container ships in order to establish a toll structure based 
on a charge per TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) to account 
for on-deck containers (of which presently only 8.78 percent 
is covered).  For a full container vessel the proposal 
establishes a $42 per TEU toll begining May 1, 2005, $49 per 
TEU toll beginning January 1, 2006 and $54 per TEU toll 
begining January 1, 2007.  A senior shipping industry contact 
said that the net effect of the change will be a 65 percent 
increase in the total transit cost per Panamax sized vessel 
from $170,000 to $280,000.  The ACP for its part feels this 
is \"back pay.\"  Despite some grousing, shippers will pass the 
costs onto their customers (the Walmart and Home Depots of 
the world), and recognize the Canal is still the best game in 
town (the U.S. intermodal system Long Beach/LA is reportedly 
operating at capacity and the Suez Canal is costlier).  The 
ACP also knows this and expects to add in excess of $40 
million to its bottom line just during the first year the 
change goes into effect. 
 
 
 
 
---------------- 
Panama Joins G-4 
---------------- 
 
 
18. (SBU) On November 5, the GOP formally announced its 
entrance to the now G-4 (Group of Four), formally the G-3 
consisting of Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico.  GoP officials 
have stated that Panama\'s G-4 accession is to promote 
Panama\'s economic, political, and social integration with 
those countries.  MFA Senior Advisor Nils Castro commented to 
EmbOffs, during a November 24 meeting, the G4 represented a 
consolidation of Panamanian economic integration with the G3 
markets as well as a vehicle to improve Panama\'s 
attractiveness as a hub into those markets given the small 
size of Panama\'s internal market.  Castro noted that 
accession to the existing current trade agreement between 
those countries has to be worked out, but added the current 
agreement includes agricultural safeguards which should make 
things easy for Panama.  Castro also added that the G-4 
agreement could eventually further Panama\'s penetration into 
Ecuador and Peru where Panama sees real potential.  Panama\'s 
commercial exchange with Venezuela is small.  Principal 
exports will be consumer or manufactured products.  While GOP 
officials have been reticent to provide specifics in public 
venues on how Panama will accede to G-4, Castro commented 
that negotiations would begin soon after the closure of the 
U.S.-Panama FTA.  According to the G-3\'s original agreement 
signed by the three original members on June 13, 1994, 
tariffs would be reduced to zero by January 2005. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
A Victory for Environmentalists 
------------------------------- 
 
 
19. (U) Former-President Moscoso authorized the construction 
of a paved highway through the Volcan Baru national park 
reserve in 2001.  It was ostensibly to be used to connect two 
previously separated villages for commercial reasons, and to 
support eco-tourism for the park.  In reality, the road would 
have simplified access to several of Moscoso\'s coffee farms 
in the area.  National and international opposition to the 
road was extremely intense, and construction stalled due to 
protests, legal actions, and propitiously bad weather. 
During the last week of October, President Torrijos formally 
struck down a previous decree of then-President Moscoso that 
had allowed the construction of the so-called \"Camino 
Ecologico.\"  With this action, the proposed road construction 
is permanently halted. 
 
 
 
 
-------------- 
On the Horizon 
-------------- 
 
 
20. (SBU) The GOP is continuing discussions with Colombia for 
electricity and gas pipelines to flow through Panama to 
connect Central America.  It is estimated that Central 
America will require approximately 5,840 additional MW in 
2015.  In April 2003, Panama and Colombia signed a MOU to 
perform feasibility studies of an Electric and Gas 
Interconnection between Panama and Colombia.  On November 1, 
2004, Panama signed an MOU with Colombia to conduct a 
feasibility study for a gas pipeline interconnection from 
Colombia to Panama.  GOP officials are continuing 
government-to-government discussions as well as beginning 
discussions with the private sector as the cost of the 
projects would be borne totally by the private sector.  In a 
November 24 meeting with EmbOffs, MFA Official Nils Castro 
stated Panama preferred a water connection for both projects 
because it would provide a lower security risk, reduce 
illegal immigration possibilities, and a maintain the Darien 
as a natural barrier against infectious animal diseases 
(i.e., hoof and mouth, screwworm, etc).  According to the 
GoP, the pipeline would most likely go across the Atlantic 
Ocean, connecting Cartegena, Colombia, with Colon, Panama. 
(Comment:  While interesting so far much of this is just 
talk. The GoP recently asked Post for possible technical 
assistance (through USTDA) on the gas project. End Comment.

SUBJECT: PANAMA PUSHES DISABLED RIGHTS UNDER THE TORRIJOS 
GOVERNMENT\'S NEW SOCIAL AGENDA 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  In his first hundred days in office, President 
Torrijos has moved quickly to deliver on campaign promises to 
280,000 disabled citizens and their families to create 
practical and inclusive institutions to boost compliance with 
Panama\'s disability laws.  The president\'s personal interest 
has raised disabled rights on the national agenda and bodes 
well for improving the plight of the disabled. 
Paradoxically, despite a new constitutional amendment 
prohibiting discrimination against the disabled, the 
president\'s personal involvement in the new institutions may 
decrease their future chance for survival.  President 
Torrijos has a disabled child and his strong push for 
disabled rights could be viewed as a purely personal crusade. 
 On the other hand, his new initiatives will create a 
constituency for disabled rights which future politicians may 
be loath to try to dismantle.  This is the first report in a 
series on the Torrijos administration\'s social agenda.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
TORRIJOS PLEDGED TO INCLUDE DISABLED 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
2.  (U)  Prior to the May 2nd election, President Martin 
Torrijos stood out in the 2004 campaign for actively courting 
the disabled vote.  In March 2004, Torrijos signed a pact 
with a local disabled rights group and the Ombudsman\'s 
office, promising to increase compliance with Panama\'s 1999 
disability law, to create an office to channel government 
resources to the disabled, and to develop a national policy 
for disabled rights.  Prior to taking office, Torrijos 
initiated a constitutional reform package that included 
articles prohibiting discrimination against the disabled 
population and that raised the Ombudsman\'s office to the 
constitutional level.  Similarly, First Lady Vivian Torrijos 
repeatedly stated that disability issues were her top 
priority. 
 
 
------------------------- 
NUMBER IMPACTED UNCERTAIN 
------------------------- 
 
 
3.  (U)  While the 2000 census counted 52,197 disabled 
Panamanians, activist groups estimate the actual figure to be 
closer to 280,000, citing World Health Organization and 
Pan-American Health Organization estimates that 10% of the 
global population is disabled.  Disabled rights activists and 
NGOs note that five times that number are impacted as family 
and friends of disabled people. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
FRUSTRATION WITH LOW COMPLIANCE 
------------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  The disabled constituency was frustrated with 
Panama\'s dismal compliance with its 1999 disability law.  The 
comprehensive law provided for mainstreaming disabled school 
children, the right to rehabilitation services, mandatory 
employment of 2% disabled personnel, and accessible new 
public construction.  Nonetheless, since then the Ministry of 
Public Works has continued to build public schools 
inaccessible to disabled children; only some disabled 
children received special education; nearly all disabled 
children attending school were separated from other children; 
and health centers did not provide rehabilitation services 
outside of the capital.  The 2% employment requirement was 
not implemented and the government took no steps to train 
rehabilitation professionals to attend to its disabled 
citizens. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
TORRIJOS CREATES INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Torrijos administration acted quickly to form 
inclusive institutions to address disability issues. 
Immediately upon taking office, Torrijos created by decree 
the National Secretariat for the Social Integration of the 
Disabled.  Located within the Ministry of the Presidency, the 
Secretariat coordinates and provides technical assistance to 
 
SIPDIS 
government and civil society efforts to integrate the 
disabled within Panamanian society.  In October 2004, the 
Secretariat installed the Council for the Social Integration 
 
SIPDIS 
of the Disabled, over which President Torrijos presides, with 
the First Lady\'s Office playing a key role.  The Council 
supports the Secretariat by involving civil society and 
government ministries in the formulation of policy for 
disabled residents.  For example, in consultation with 
disabled rights groups, council representatives advise the 
ministries they represent on accounting for the disabled in 
their budgets.  The Council also charges its members with 
boosting ministerial compliance with the 2% employment 
requirement. 
 
 
-------------------- 
A PRACTICAL APPROACH 
-------------------- 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Secretariat is taking a practical and 
inclusive approach to promoting disabled rights.  For 
example, the Secretariat\'s campaign to increase voluntary 
compliance with Panama\'s disability law uses a \"friendly\" 
approach to business compliance.  The Secretariat is also 
working with a civil society group that raised $3.5 million 
in a December 17-18th telethon for disabled children, 
including $260,000 from Cable and Wireless.  The telethon 
sponsors will provide the funds to construct and equip four 
disabled rehabilitation centers in provincial cities and the 
Torrijos administration will provide the land and personnel. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)   The Secretariat freely acknowledges the existence 
of substantial discrimination against the disabled in Panama 
and the government\'s current inability to comply with its 
1999 law.  Moreover, the Secretariat employs technical 
specialists who understand disabled rights issues and budget 
realities.  The Secretariat even uses Power Point to explain 
its national disability plan to aid in seeking international 
and civil society partners. 
 
 
8.  (U)  In December, the Ministry of Education\'s (MEDUC\'s) 
Director of Special Education announced that the GOP\'s 
centralized school for the disabled (IPHE) would work with 
MEDUC to permit 3,000 of the 8,000 current IPHE students to 
be mainstreamed in 65 schools throughout Panama in 2005. 
IPHE personnel will prepare teachers at the schools to work 
with disabled children. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
 
9.  (U)  In November, the constitutional reform pushed by 
Torrijos\'s PRD party took effect, making discrimination 
against disabled persons unconstitutional and raising the 
Ombudsman\'s office to constitutional status. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  Torrijos\'s courting of the disabled vote and his 
activist policies have demonstrated the importance of 
including the disabled and their families in the national 
agenda.  Nonetheless, disabled rights are a personal issue 
for both President Torrijos and First Lady Vivian Torrijos, 
who have a disabled child.  Their personal commitment and 
experience augurs progress for disabled Panamanians over the 
next five years.  Indeed, the Torrijos administration\'s focus 
on this issue has already increased national awareness of 
disabled rights.  The Secretariat\'s coordinating and 
technical assistance function was sorely needed to increase 
even government compliance with Panama\'s disability law.  The 
Secretariat\'s practical and inclusive approach is 
 
SIPDIS 
encouraging.  Nonetheless, providing services to the disabled 
in Panama\'s remote areas remains an expensive and ambitious 
proposition.  The rural poor are probably too marginalized to 
participate in the Council. 
 
 
11.  (SBU)  The President\'s and First Lady\'s heavy personal 
involvement with the Council and the Secretariat also calls 
into question the sustainability of the new institutions 
under future administrations.  The Secretariat and Council 
are not government ministries and do not have permanent 
status.  Moreover, because they resulted from presidential 
decrees, the institutions may lack widespread political 
backing or could be viewed as merely Torrijos\'s personnel 
crusade.  Finally, with the Secretariat located in the 
Ministry of the Presidency and the President heading the 
Council, the new entities could quickly become mere shells 
under a chief executive with little interest in disabled 
rights.  Nonetheless, improved rights and benefits for 
disabled Panamanians over the next five years through 
inclusive institutions could strengthen the disabled rights 
interest group to the point that future administrations will 
need to pay attention.

1. (SBU) This is the first in a series of reports from 
Embassy Panama\'s newly formed Illicit Finance Task Force 
(IFTF).  The interagency IFTF was initiated in September 2004 
to monitor terrorist financing and the laundering of 
narcotics and other criminal proceeds.  The task force 
includes members from DHS, DAO, DEA, RSA, NAS, ECON, and POL.

Panama: Illicit Finance Overview 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Numerous criminal organizations and drug trafficking 
groups, including the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces 
(FARC) and the United Self-Defense Forces (AUC), move 
hundreds of millions of dollars of illicit proceeds through 
Panama each year.  (Comment: Embassy estimates that 70 
percent of the money laundered in Panama is derived from the 
sale of illegal narcotics; the other 30 percent of illicit 
funds come from the proceeds of corruption, arms trafficking, 
human smuggling, intellectual property rights violations and 
other criminal activity.  End comment.) 
 
 
3. (C) Panama has made significant strides in improving its 
anti-money laundering (AML) regime over the past decade, but 
loopholes still exist.  Likewise, under-funded and 
understaffed Panamanian enforcement agencies and poorly 
functioning judiciary allow launderers to operate with little 
fear of arrest or prosecution.  Panama\'s well-developed 
financial services sector, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), and 
geographic location at the crossroads of international trade 
and narcotics flows, make it vulnerable to money laundering 
and terrorist financing.  The majority of illicit funds are 
smuggled into Panama via bulk cash couriers, hidden in cargo, 
or transferred via wire to banks or other non-bank financial 
institutions. 
 
 
4. (C) Panama\'s use of the USD and the existence of the Colon 
Free Zone make it an attractive place for traffickers to 
launder proceeds through the Black Market Peso Exchange 
(BMPE).  Excess USD earned by South American, mainly 
Colombian, drug traffickers and the need to exchange these 
dollars for local currency, create a black market whereby 
brokers purchase excess dollars from drug traffickers (in 
exchange for local currency) to sell to legitimate businesses 
for lower-than-normal market rates.  The USDs purchased in 
this scheme are often used to pay down the trade accounts 
between those businesses and CFZ exporters.  Free Zone goods 
are then shipped from companies in Colon to legitimate 
businesses, normally in Colombia and Venezuela, and the 
exchange is complete.  Efforts by the CFZ Administration to 
monitor BMPE bulk cash and third party payments have been 
weak due to the conflicting goal of promoting commerce. 
 
 
5. (C) The anti-money laundering and compliance efforts of 
Panamanian banks and money remitters have improved in recent 
years.  In 2003, legislation was passed to increase 
regulatory oversight of money remitters and allow the bank 
superintendent (SB) to conduct audits of the industry. 
(Comment: Embassy officials noted that although regulation 
and compliance are generally improving, Panamanian 
institutions tend to give less scrutiny to wire transfers 
from U.S. institutions.  There is a perception among 
Panamanian companies that transactions from the U.S. are 
strictly regulated and therefore safe to accept.  End 
comment.) 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Torrijos Administration and Illicit Finance 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Since taking office in September, the Torrijos 
Administration promised to take a more aggressive approach 
toward money laundering and terrorist finance than did the 
Moscoso Administration.  Panama\'s Customs Service has long 
suffered from endemic corruption, but, the new director, 
Julio Kennion, has asked the USG to help form an Office of 
Professional Responsibility to address corruption within 
Customs.  (Note: Ironically, unconfirmed rumors of Kennion\'s 
involvement in corruption have already begun to surface.  End 
note.) 
 
 
7. (C) Customs improvement is desperately needed to slow the 
flow of illicit cash movements into the Colon Free Zone and 
the bulk currency that fuels the BMPE.  Undeclared cash 
seizures have dropped from $7.4 million in 2003 to 
approximately $2 million so far in 2004.  In 2003, $470 
million was declared with Panamanian customs officials, up 
from $400 million in 2002.  Total declarations for 2004 are 
not yet known.  (Comment: Embassy officials believe that the 
drop in undeclared seizures, coupled with increasing 
declarations, indicates that couriers have little fear of 
further investigation once cash is declared.  Customs keeps 
records of declared cash, but, follow-up investigations into 
the sources and uses of the cash are rare.  Considering the 
safety, quickness and ease of electronic transfers versus 
cash transactions, $470 million in declared cash is a 
startling amount for a country of Panama\'s size.  End 
comment.) 
 
 
8. (C) Panama has two main bodies that analyze and 
investigate financial crime: the Financial Analysis Unit 
(UAF), which works under the civilian intelligence service, 
the Council for Public Security and National Defense 
(CSPDN/Consejo), and the Financial Investigative Unit (UIF), 
which operates under the Public Ministry.  The UAF was 
created in 1995 (with USG assistance) and is responsible for 
the analysis of financial intelligence and data.  When 
suspicious activity is identified by the UAF, the cases are 
sent to the Attorney General who decides whether to turn them 
over to the UIF for criminal investigation. 
 
 
9. (C) Orcila Vega de Constable took over as head of UAF 
under the Torrijos administration.  Upon taking office, 
Constable was instructed by members of the Torrijos 
administration to aggressively attack money launderers and to 
improve cooperation with the U.S. Embassy in this effort. 
Currently, the UAF has 12 staff members and, since its 
formation, has sent hundreds of cases to the Attorney General 
and the UIF.  (Note: Constable is an attorney with no 
experience investigating financial crimes.  End note.) 
 
 
10. (C) The UIF continues to face resource and staffing 
shortages, severly limiting its ability to investigate 
financial crimes.  Gustavo Cardenas, the head of the UIF, is 
a hold over from the Moscoso Administration.  The 
understaffed UIF consists of nine investigators who have more 
than 400 open cases.  Though a number of cases are awaiting 
trial, so far in 2004, the UIF has produced no money 
laundering convictions.  With USG assistance, the UIF 
recently updated its facilities with a new computer system 
capable of supporting a staff of 15.  However, due to budget 
constraints, it still lacks basic analytic software programs 
and trained personnel to make full use of the new technology. 
 
 
11. (C) Panama\'s long-term inability to effectively control 
money laundering is partly due to the lack of internal 
training for financial analysts and investigators.  Neither 
of the two main bodies responsible for financial intelligence 
and investigation, the UAF and the UIF, have formal training 
programs.  Most UAF-UIF financial analysts and investigators 
receive some financial training, but mainly through the 
support of foreign governments or simply on-the-job. 
 
 
12. (C) As is evident by the 400 financial crime cases under 
investigation by the UIF, and the lack of money laundering 
convictions, there are problems at the judicial level. 
Panamanian judges have little familiarity or training in the 
technicalities of money laundering cases.  (Comment: 
Likewise, corruption is more evident among judicial officials 
than among law enforcement, suggesting a need for ethical 
training or oversight.  End comment.)

Comment 
------- 
 
 
13. (C) For the reasons previously mentioned, Panama will 
remain a preferred destination for licit and illicit funds 
from around the world.  Panama has improved its AML regime 
and, with continued U.S. support, law enforcement is 
beginning to investigate and bring cases to trial.  The 
challenge for the Panamanians will be to further improve 
customs procedures for monitoring bulk cash movements and to 
sustain and fully utilize the analytic and investigative 
improvements of the UAF and UIF.  More importantly, the 
Panamanians need to address corruption and the inability of 
Panamanian judges to convict money launderers.
