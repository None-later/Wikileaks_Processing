SUBJECT: STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION: 
NAMIBIA 
 
REF: STATE 112270 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS POSED 
REFTEL. 
 
 
WOMEN AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION IS VERY PROGRESSIVE 
IN GUARANTEEING FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS TO ALL 
CITIZENS.  IN ADDITIONAL TO GENERAL GUARANTEES OF 
LIFE, LIBERTY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND 
FREEDOM FROM DISCRIMINATION, ARTICLE 23 SUBSECTION 
(3) DEALING WITH APARTHEID AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 
MAKES SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO PROMOTE 
GENDER EQUALITY AND STATES, \"IT SHALL BE 
PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE REGARD TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN 
IN NAMIBIA HAVE TRADITIONALLY SUFFERED SPECIAL 
DISCRIMINATION AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED 
AND ENABLED TO PLAY A FULL, EQUAL AND EFFECTIVE 
ROLE IN THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND 
CULTURAL LIFE OF THE NATION.\" 
 
3.  WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MARRIED PERSONS 
EQUALITY ACT EARLIER THIS YEAR, PARLIAMENT, WITH 
THE STRONG SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT NUJOMA, IS 
ATTEMPTING TO BRING NAMIBIAN LAWS INTO COMPLIANCE 
WITH CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES.  WHILE THE ACT 
ELIMINATES DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN CIVIL 
MARRIAGES, WOMEN MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW ARE 
OFTEN SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATION.  ALL TOO 
FREQUENTLY, WHEN CUSTOMARY PRACTICES ARE IN 
CONFLICT WITN MODERN STATUTES, CUSTOMARY PRACTICES 
PREVAIL, PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AREAS.  AT A 
RECENT NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADITIONAL 
AUTHORITIES, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MADE IT CLEAR 
THAT CUSTOMARY LAWS WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH 
PROVISIONS OF THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION OR MODERN 
STATUTES WOULD BE INVALID.  HOWEVER, PRACTICES IN 
THE RURAL AREAS ARE SLOW TO CHANGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
IT IS COMMON FOR A WOMAN MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY 
LAW TO HAVE HER HOUSE AND POSSESSIONS SEIZED BY 
HER HUSBAND\'S FAMILY IF THE HUSBAND PASSES AWAY. 
OFTEN THE WOMEN IS THROWN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND 
LEFT TO FEND FOR HERSELF.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
CONDEMNED THIS PRACTICE, BUT IT STILL CONTINUES. 
WOMEN ACTIVISTS AND SOCIAL RESEARCHERS IN NAMIBIA, 
ENCOURAGED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE MARRIED PERSON\'S 
EQUALITY ACT, ARE NOW LOOKING AT WAYS OF ATTACKING 
THE PROBLEM OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN 
MARRIED UNDER CUSTOMARY LAW. 
 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
BEIJING PLAN OF ACTION

4.  TNE NAMIBIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO 
IMPLEMENTING THE BEIJING PLAN OF ACTION AND THE

PARTY.  MS. NDAITWAH SERVED AS RAPPORTEUR GENERAL 
AT THE BEIJING CONFERENCE AND PLAYED AN ACTIVE

SHE IS STRONGLY AND FERVENTLY COMMITTED TO 
ELIMINATING ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
WOMEN, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN 
PARLIAMENT, AND IMPLEMENTING THE BEIJING PLAN OF 
ACTION.  PRESIDENT NUJOMA HAS BEEN OUT FRONT AND 
VOCAL IN SUPPORT OF THE MARRIED PERSONS EQUALITY

THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE IN PRESSING FOR THE 
ELIMINATION OF PRACTICES WHICH DISCRIMINATE 
AGAINST WOMEN.
