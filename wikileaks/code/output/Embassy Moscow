1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
. 
SUMMARY 
------- 
2.  A WELL-INFORMED SOVIET OBSERVER OF EVENTS IN IRAN 
RECENTLY DISCUSSED WITH US THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING 
FUTURE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN TEHRAN.  WHILE ASSERTING 
THAT SOVIET ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH IRAN WOULD 
CONTINUE, OUR INTERLOCUTOR CLEARLY IMPLIED THAT THERE IS 
NO CONSENSUS IN MOSCOW ON THE LIKELY SUCCESS OF SUCH 
EFFORTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  EMBOFF RECENTLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS 
DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE ORIENTAL 
INSTITUTE\'S DEPARTMENT FOR AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN, IRAN, 
AND TURKEY, YURIY GANKOVSKIY (PROTECT).  WHILE GANKOVSKIY 
IS NOT A POLICY-MAKER, HE IS ONE OF THE BEST INFORMED AND 
MOST THOUGHTFUL SOVIET ANALYSTS ON IRAN, AS WELL AS A 
REPUTED MFA ADVISER. 
. 
4.  IRAN/IRAQ WAR:  GANKOVSKIY WITHOUT PROMPTING VOLUNTEER- 
ED THAT IRAN WAS CLEARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTINUATION OF 
THE WAR.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE SAUDIS AND OTHER ARAB 
COUNTRIES WERE READY TO MEET IRANIAN DEMANDS FOR CASH 
PAYMENTS TO OFFSET WAR DAMAGES.  HOWEVER, GANKOVSKIY SAW 
LITTLE PROSPECT FOR AN END TO THE WAR BECAUSE THE 
AUTHORITIES IN TEHRAN REMAIN DETERMINED TO BRING DOWN 
SADDAM HUSAYN. 
. 
5.  FUTURE POLITICAL PROSPECTS IN IRAN:  GANKOVSKIY 
DISCOUNTED A BID BY THE IRANIAN MILITARY EITHER TO OVER- 
THROW KHOMEINI OR TAKE POWER FOLLOWING HIS DEATH.  HE 
ATTRIBUTED THE MILITARY\'S RELUCTANCE TO MAKE A BID FOR POW- 
ER TO THE OFFICER CORPS\' PREOCCUPATION WITH THE WAR, THE 
STRENGTH OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS, AND THE DECIMATION 
OF THE IRANIAN MILITARY\'S BEST OFFICERS IN SUCCESSIVE 
WAVES OF REPRESSION.  GANKOVSKIY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 
REPRESSION HAD TAKEN A HEAVY TOLL AMONG THE \"LEFT\" 
OPPOSITION, WHICH WAS FURTHER WEAKENED BY LACK OF UNITY. 
HE CONCLUDED THAT, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, THERE 
WOULD BE \"NO SOLUTION ON THE LEFT\" FOR IRAN.  INTERESTING- 
LY, GANKOVSKIY WOULD NOT RULE OUT A COMEBACK BY THE 
WESTERN-ORIENTED IRANIAN \"BOURGEOISIE.\"  WHILE THEY WERE 
IN EXILE NOW, IRAN HAD A LONG HISTORY OF EXILES WHO HAD 
MADE STARTLING POLITICAL COMEBACKS.  ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, 
GANKOVSKIY SAID THAT KHOMEINI\'S SUCCESSOR WOULD MOST 
LIKELY COME FROM AMONG THOSE POLITICAL FIGURES ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE CURRENT REGIME AND THAT RAFSANJANI SEEMED THE 
BEST BET FOR THE PRESENT. 
. 
6.  EMBOFF ASKED GANKOVSKIY WHETHER THERE WERE NOT TWO 
BROAD LINES IN SOVIET THINKING ABOUT RELATIONS WITH IRAN. 
SOME SOVIETS SEEMED TO ADVOCATE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO 
IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE CURRENT REGIME, WHILE OTHERS 
SEEMED DEEPLY SKEPTICAL THAT EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH 
THE TEHRAN AUTHORITIES WOULD SERVE SOVIET INTERESTS (REF- 
TEL). GANKOVSKIY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WERE NOT TWO 
LINES, BUT \"TWENTY LINES\" IN SOVIET THINKING ABOUT IRAN. 
DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION, HOWEVER, THE SOVIET 
UNION HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TRY TO WORK OUT A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP WITH A COUNTRY WITH WHICH IT SHARED A LONG 
BORDER. 
. 
7.  COMMENT:  WHILE MUCH OF WHAT GANKOVSKIY HAD TO SAY IS 
STANDARD, HIS COMMENTS SUGGEST CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY 
AMONG KNOWLEDGEABLE SOVIETS ABOUT IRAN\'S LONG-TERM COURSE. 
WHILE HE WAS CAREFUL TO ASSERT SOVIET INTEREST IN IMPROVE- 
MENT OF RELATIONS WITH IRAN, GANKOVSKIY CLEARLY IMPLIED 
THAT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS AMONG SOVIET ANALYSTS ABOUT THE 
LIKELY SUCCESS OF SUCH AN EFFORT.

1.  DEPARTMENT HAS NO DOUBT SEEN MASSIVE PRESS 
COVERAGE OF LAUNCH FEBRUARY 20 OF SOVIET \"MIR\" 
(PEACE) SPACE STATION.  PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT, 
THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE OPEN IN THEIR 
COVERAGE OF THE EVENT IN LINE WITH A TREND WE HAVE 
OBSERVED IN RECENT MONTHS.  FEBRUARY 20 VREMYA 
NEWSCAST SHOWED, BESIDES FOOTAGE OF THE LAUNCH ITSELF, 
DETAILS OF THE SPACE FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER OUTSIDE 
MOSCOW, INCLUDING A LARGE DETAILED DIAGRAM OF THE 
OUTSIDE OF THE STATION.  VIDEOTAPE OF THE LAUNCH 
SHOWS THAT THE STATION WAS LAUNCHED ON THE SOVIETS\' 
NEW LARGE \"PROTON\" BOOSTER. 
 
2.  INTERVIEWED DURING THE NEWSCAST, PROFESSOR AND 
PILOT-COSMONAUT K. FEOKTISTOV CALLED THE \"MIR\" 
SPACE STATION A \"NEW GENERATION\" STATION.  HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SOVIETS INTEND TO MAN THE 
STATION PERMANENTLY, BUT \"NOT RIGHT AWAY.\"  AFTER 
SHAKE-DOWN AND TESTING, A FIRST CREW WILL BE SENT 
UP FOR A \"NOT LENGTHY\" STAY TO CHECK THE STATION\'S 
SYSTEM, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A BREAK FOR FURTHER 
\"ADJUSTMENTS.\"  AFTER THIS THE STATION WILL BE 
PERMANENTLY MANNED, WITH ROTATING SHIFTS. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO A. IVAKHNOV, WRITING IN FEBRUARY 20 
IZVESTIYA, THE METHOD OF CARRYING OUT EXPERIMENTS 
AND TRANSPORTING EQUIPMENT TO THE NEW STATION 
REPRESENTS A CHANGE OVER THE SALYUT STATIONS.  RATHER 
THAN TRANSPORTING EQUIPMENT TO THE STATION AND 
PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS INSIDE THE STATION ITSELF 
(WHICH MADE SALYUT RESEMBLE AN \"INSTRUMENT WAREHOUSE,\" 
IZVESTIYA SAYS), THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT FOR 
EXPERIMENTS WILL BE TRANSPORTED IN SPECIALLY OUTFITTED 
MODULES TO BE DOCKED WITH THE CRAFT, AND THE 
EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT IN THE MODULES THEMSELVES. 
\"MIR\" CAN DOCK SIX MODULES AT A TIME, AND THUS, 
ACCORDING TO FEOKTISTOV, WILL PERMIT \"A MUCH 
WIDER PROGRAM OF RESEARCH WORK.\" 
 
4.  EMBASSY DAO WILL FORWARD BY SEPTEL TECHNICAL 
OBSERVATIONS OF THE \"MIR\" STATION AND IS FORWARDING 
TO DIA VIDEO TAPE OF \"VREMYA\" COVERAGE OF THE 
LAUNCH.

1. C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
SUMMARY 
/------- 
 
2. KHOMEINI\'S DEATH EVOKES IN THE MINDS OF SOVIETS 
THE DEATH OF STALIN.  PERHAPS SIMPLY BECAUSE STALIN 
IS ON EVERYONE\'S MINDS THESE DAYS AS THE CONGRESS OF 
PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES REVIEWS PAST CRIMES, SOVIET 
CONTACTS IN TWO SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH EMBOFFS 
INDEPENDENTLY BROUGHT UP THE DEAD SOVIET DICTATOR IN 
DESCRIBING THE CURRENT SITUATION IN IRAN: STALIN THE 
COMPROMISE CHOICE FOR LEADER FOLLOWING LENIN\'S DEATH 
(LIKE KHAMENEI NOW); AND STALIN THE GIANT HISTORICAL 
FIGURE WHOSE SHOES NO MORTAL COULD EVER FILL (LIKE 
THE NOW-DEPARTED KHOMEINI). 
 
3. OUR CONTACTS SUGGEST THE SOVIETS DO NOT EXPECT ANY 
SUDDEN CHANGES IN IRANIAN POLICY, WITH REGARD TO 
BILATERAL RELATIONS, IRAN-IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN.  BUT 
THE SOVIETS DO APPEAR TO HOPE FOR A MORE PRAGMATIC 
IRANIAN APPROACH TO EMERGE EVENTUALLY.  ONE CONTACT 
RAISED THE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT A DEBATE IS 
UNDERWAY CONCERNING HOW EAGERLY THE SOVIETS SHOULD 
PURSUE IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH IRAN.  FOR THE MOMENT 
THE SOVIET DESIRE FOR FULL NORMALIZATION REMAINS 
OFFICIAL POLICY, HOWEVER.  THE RAFSANJANI VISIT MAY 
WELL BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE MOURNING PERIOD, BUT 
NO WORD HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM IRAN ON THIS.  THE 
SOVIETS STILL DEFEND PROSPECTIVE ARMS SALES TO IRAN. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
4. EMBASSY OFFICERS MET JUNE 7 WITH MFA MIDDLE 
EASTERN COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION IRAN SECTOR OFFICIAL 
VADIM NAZAROV AND \"IZVESTIYA\" DEPUTY MIDDLE EAST 
EDITOR ANDREY OSTALSKIY TO DISCUSS SOVIET REACTIONS 
TO THE DEATH OF KHOMEINI. 
 
THE STALIN IMAGE 
/----------------- 
 
5. BOTH NAZAROV AND OSTALSKIY, INDEPENDENTLY, FOUND 
THEMSELVES DRAWING ON THE IMAGE OF STALIN TO DESCRIBE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE WAKE OF KHOMEINI\'S DEATH. 
NAZAROV COMPARED THE SELECTION OF KHAMENEI TO SUCCEED 
THE AYATOLLAH AS IRAN\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER TO STALIN\'S 
SELECTION AS THE COMPROMISE CANDIDATE OVER OTHER, 
MORE FACTIONALIZED RIVALS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF 
LENIN.  OSTALSKIY COMPARED THE REACTION OF THE 
IRANIAN PEOPLE TO KHOMEINI\'S DEATH TO THAT OF THE 
SOVIET PEOPLE FOLLOWING STALIN\'S DEMISE.  OSTALSKIY 
SAID THAT, AS WITH STALIN, THERE WOULD AT FIRST BE A 
PERIOD OF INTENSE MOURNING OVER KHOMEINI--\"BUT LATER 
WOULD COME A RE-EVALUATION\".  OSTALSKIY SUGGESTED THE 
SOVIETS WERE HOPING THIS RE-EVALUATION WOULD RESULT 
IN THE ADOPTION OF A MORE PRAGMATIC COURSE BY THE 
IRANIAN LEADERSHIP. 
 
REACTIONS, PERSONAL AND OFFICIAL 
/------------------------------- 
 
6. NAZAROV SUGGESTED THAT, SPEAKING PERSONALLY, HE 
AND MANY SOVIETS WERE NOT SORRY TO SEE KHOMEINI 
DEPART THE SCENE.  KHOMEINI\'S REGIME HAD DESTROYED 
MANY LIVES AND VIOLATED MANY STANDARDS OF 
INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR. 
 
7. THE OFFICIAL S0VIET REACTION, HOWEVER--WHICH HAD 
TO TAKE SOVIET INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT--NATURALLY 
CONSISTED OF OFFERING CONDOLENCES TO IRAN, NAZAROV 
SAID.  GORBACHEV SENT A SHORT MESSAGE TO KHAMENEI 
(PUBLISHED AT THE BOTTOM OF FRONT PAGE OF THE JUNE 7 
\"PRAVDA\"), AND SHEVARDNADZE AND FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN 
OF THE SUPREME SOVIET LUK\'YANOV SIGNED THE CONDOLENCE 
BOOK AT THE IRANIAN EMBASSY. 
 
IRAN DOMESTIC POLITICS 
/---------------------- 
 
8. IT WAS VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT 
INSIDE IRAN, NAZAROV SAID.  KHOMEINI HAD BEEN THE 
ONLY IRANIAN POLITICAL FIGURE WHO EXERCIZED A 
CONSISTENT LINE.  THE FLIRTING WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
WHICH OTHER LEADERS HAD ENGAGED IN WOULD RE-EMERGE, 
BUT WHETHER IT WOULD LAST REMAINED UNPREDICTABLE. 
 
9. THE CHOICE OF KHAMENEI AS KHOMEINI\'S SUCCESSOR HAD 
BEEN TACTICAL, NAZAROV SAID, REPRESENTING A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE RADICAL SPIRITUAL LEADERS AND 
THE PRAGMATISTS.  IN ACCEPTING A LEADERSHIP ROLE, 
THOUGH, KHAMENEI WAS TAKING A RISK: WHEREAS IRANIANS 
HAD NOT BEEN WILLING TO CRITICIZE KHOMEINI\'S 
LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY, THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE 
THAT THEIR PENT-UP FRUSTRATIONS WOULD NOW BE 
UNLEASHED ON A LESS-IDOLIZED LEADER LIKE KHAMENEI. 
 
10. KHAMENEI WAS TIED TO THE BAZAARIS, NAZAROV SAID, 
AND HAD CALLED FOR REDUCED GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT 
IN COMMERCIAL LIFE.  LIKEWISE, HE HAD--AS SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE \"PARTY OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC\"--AT 
ONE TIME CALLED FOR A REDUCED POLITICAL ROLE FOR THE 
COUNTRY\'S SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP.  KHAMENEI HAD ALSO 
HELPED CREATE THE 25-MEMBER CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW 
COUNCIL WHICH WAS PROPOSING TO EXPAND THE POWERS OF 
THE PRESIDENCY AND ABOLISH THE POST OF PRIME 
MINISTER.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, NAZAROV 
SUGGESTED, KHAMENEI APPEARED TO FAVOR RAFSANJANI\'S 
ELECTION TO THE POST OF A MORE POWERFUL PRESIDENCY, 
THEREBY FACILITATING IRAN\'S RETURN TO A MORE 
PRAGMATIC, LESS SPIRITUALLY-INFLUENCED APPROACH.  BUT 
MUCH DEPENDED ON WHEN THE COUNCIL WOULD MAKE ITS 
DECISIONS CONCERNING THE POWERS OF THE 
PRESIDENCY--NAZAROV COULD NOT ESTIMATE WHEN THIS 
WOULD BE--AND IN ANY CASE, AS RAFSANJANI\'S CALL FOR 
THE DEATHS OF AMERICANS HAD DEMONSTRATED, THE ACTIONS 
OF EVEN A \"MODERATE\" IRANIAN POLICIAL FIGURE WERE 
ENTIRELY UNPREDICTABLE. 
 
FOREIGN RELATIONS 
/----------------- 
 
11. WHAT REMAINED CONSTANT, NAZAROV SAID, WAS IRAN\'S 
DESPERATE NEED FOR FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO EMERGE FROM 
ITS ECONOMIC CRISIS.  MUCH OF THIS ASSISTANCE COULD 
ONLY COME FROM THE WEST, AS THE SOVIET UNION SIMPLY 
DID NOT HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO PROVIDE IT.  THE 
SOVIETS WERE IN A POSITION, HOWEVER, TO BUY IRANIAN 
NATURAL GAS AND TO OFFER TRANSPORTATION ROUTES FOR 
THE GAS AND OTHER IRANIAN PRODUCTS. 
 
12. BECAUSE THE SOVIETS WERE NOT PRESENTLY PERCEIVED 
AS A MAJOR THREAT BY IRAN, NAZAROV SAID, THE IRANIANS 
WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN RECEIVING AS MUCH POLITICAL 
SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE USSR.  THE \"PRIMITIVE\" 
IRANIAN CONCEPTION OF FOREIGN RELATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT 
BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION--IN WHICH OTHER NATIONS 
WERE EITHER FRIEND OR FOE-- WAS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO 
SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED. 
 
RAFSANJANI VISIT 
/--------------- 
 
13. NAZAROV SAID THE SOVIETS HAD RECEIVED NO WORD ON 
WHETHER RAFSANJANI WOULD CANCEL OR POSTPONE HIS JUNE 
21 VISIT TO MOSCOW.  GIVEN THAT DURING THE 40-DAY 
PERIOD OF MOURNING A DEVOUT FOLLOWER OF KHOMEINI 
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT HOME AND GRIEVE, 
HOWEVER, THERE WAS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THAT THE VISIT 
WOULD BE AT THE VERY LEAST POSTPONED, NAZAROV 
INDICATED. 
 
DEFENSE COOPERATION 
/------------------ 
 
14. IN A RECENT CONVERSATION, THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR 
(PROTECT) TOLD EMBOFF THAT VORONTSOV\'S MAY 21 VISIT 
TO TEHRAN HAD PRODUCED SUSPICIONS THAT A MUTUAL 
DEFENSE AGREEMENT HAD BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN IRAN AND 
THE USSR.  8UCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE OF TREMENDOUS 
CONCERN TO THE IRAQIS, THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED, AND 
HE WAS TO SEE MFA NEAR EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES ADMINI8TRATION CHIEF POLYAKOV JUNE 6 AT 4 
P.M. TO DISCUSS THE MATTER. 
 
15. ASKED ABOUT SOVIET-IRANIAN DEFENSE COOPERATION, 
NAZAROV SAID THAT THE IRANIAN PRESS AGENCY STATEMENT 
ON THE VORONTSOV VISIT TOOK LIBERTIES WITH REALITY. 
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE SOVIETS WERE 
PREPARED TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN IN A VARIETY OF 
SPHERES, WHICH WOULD NATURALLY INCLUDE MILITARY 
COOPERATION AS WELL.  THIS IN NO WAY ENVISAGED A 
MUTUAL DEFENSE AGREEMENT, NAZAROV SAID.  THE IRANIANS 
STILL VIEWED THE SOVIETS AS TOO MUCH OF A THREAT FOR 
THAT. 
 
16. ARMS SALES WERE ANOTHER MATTER, HOWEVER, AND HE 
REITERATED ARGUMENTS OUTLINED IN REF (A) IN DEFENSE 
OF SUCH SALES.  NAZAROV DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN WEAPONS 
SUCH AS MISSILES, WHICH WOULD BE PROVOCATIVE, AND 
FIELD ARTILLERY, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS HAVING 
\"LIMITED USES\".  HE PROVIDED NO FURTHER CLUE AS TO 
THE TIMING OF THE SALES, BUT ASSERTED THAT THE 
RAFSANJANI VISIT WOULD BE \"TOO SOON\" BECAUSE SOVIET 
PRODUCTION PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS WERE INVOLVED. 
 
IRAM-IRAQ 
/-------- 
 
17. NAZAROV FORESAW NO IMMINENT CHANGE IN IRAN\'S 
POLICY ON THE CONFLICT WITH IRAQ.  A MAJOR CONSTRAINT 
UNDER WHICH ANY IRANIAN REGIME HAD TO OPERATE, HE 
SUGGESTED, WAS THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IRAN\'S POLICY 
ON TERRITORIAL DISPUTES WITH IRAQ DID NOT APPEAR 
WEAKER THAN THAT OF THE SHAH, WHO HAD CONSOLIDATED 
SOME OF IRAN\'S CLAIMS. 
 
AFGHANISTAN 
/---------- 
 
18. IN A MOMENT OF FRANKNESS, NAZAROV CONCEDED THAT 
THE IRANIANS WERE SPEAKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF THEIR 
MOUTHS WITH REGARD TO THEIR AFGHAN POLICY.  IRAN WAS 
TELLING THE SOVIETS THAT AN AFGHAN POLITICAL SOLUTION 
HAD TO COMPRISE ALL POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY, 
WHEREAS THEY WERE TELLING THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE THAT 
NAJIB HAD TO GO BEFORE A SETTLEMENT COULD BE 
REACHED.  THE SOVIET VIEW REMAINED THAT NAJIB 
INTENDED TO FIGHT TO THE BITTER END AND THAT ONLY A 
DECISION TO INCLUDE HIM IN THE NEGOTIATIONS OFFERED 
ANY HOPE FOR A SETTLEMENT.  THE ALLIANCE OF EIGHT, 
HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO INSIST ON NAJIB\'S DEPARTURE. 
 
SOVIET POLICY-MAKING ON IRAN 
/--------------------------- 
 
19. OSTALSKIY SUGGESTED THAT SOME SOVIET 
OFFICIALS--INCLUDING CERTAIN DEPUTIES TO THE CONGRESS 
OF PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES FROM THE MOSCOW REGION--DID NOT 
SHARE THE OFFICIAL VIEW THAT RELATIONS WITH IRAN 
SHOULD BE FULLY NORMALIZED WHILE IRAN REMAINED 
EMBARKED ON ITS REVOLUTIONARY COURSE.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT SHEVARDNADZE HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO MEET WITH 
KHOMEINI LAST FEBRUARY, AND PREFERRED TO DEAL WITH 
OTHER, \"MORE NORMAL\" MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN 
LEADERSHIP. 
 
20. OSTALSKIY SAID HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CALLED FOR 
THE SOVIET UNION TO COORDINATE ITS APPROACH TO IRAN 
WITH THE UNITED 8TATES.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS NOT IN 
THE SOVIET INTEREST FOR U.S.-IRANIAN RELATIONS TO BE 
ESTRANGED, AND THAT THE SOVIETS DID NOT INTEND TO 
SEEK ADVANTAGE FROM THE PRESENT SITUATION.  OSTALSKIY 
WOULD NOT ELABORATE ON WHO IN THE \"MOSCOW GROUP\" OF 
DEPUTIES SHARED HIS VIEWS.  ALTHOUGH FOR THE PRESENT 
THOSE VIEWS WERE CLEARLY IN THE MINORITY AS FAR AS 
OFFICIAL SOVIET POLICY WAS CONCERNED, OSTALSKIY SAW A 
TIME APPROACHING WHEN SOVIET LEGISLATORS WOULD DEBATE 
THIS AND OTHER FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IN THE SUPREME 
SOVIET. 
 
 
COMMENT 
/------- 
 
21. DESPITE ANY PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENT WHICH SOVIET 
ASSOCIATION WITH REVOLUTIONARY IRAN MAY BE CAUSING 
SOVIET OFFICIALS AND JOURNALISTS, THE OFFICIAL SOVIET 
APPROACH CONTINUES TO BE AIMED AT CULTIVATING 
NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH IRAN IN THE HOPE THAT 
WHOEVER EMERGES AT THE TOP FOLLOWING THE PROTRACTED 
LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE IN IRAN WILL BE A \"PRAGMATIST\". 
AS SOVIET OFFICIALS CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THIS TERM IN 
THE IRANIAN CONTEXT IS ONLY RELATIVE.

------------------- 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
2. AT THE END OF OCTOBER A STIR WAS CREATED AS THREE 
SOVIET SPOKESMEN STATED THAT EAST EUROPEAN STATES 
WERE FREE TO QUIT THE WARSAW PACT IF THEY SO 
DESIRED.  THE SOVIETS REGARD THIS AS A LOGICAL 
OUTCOME OF THEIR POLICY OF \"NON-INTERFERENCE IN 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.\" THEY INSIST THAT THEIR EAST 
EUROPEAN PARTNERS HAVE FULL \"FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\" 
NEVERTHELESS, TOP PARTY FIGURES HAVE HINTED THAT THIS 
IS NOT A BLANKET FREEDOM.  IN PRIVATE, GORBACHEV AND 
OTHERS HAVE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF  THE WARSAW 
PACT REMAINING INTACT.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE 
UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF \"GEOPOLITICAL 
REALITIES\" IN EASTERN EUROPE. 
 
3. THE SOVIETS STRESS THAT NO WARSAW PACT MEMBERS 
HAVE EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN LEAVING THE ALLIANCE. 
IN FACT, SOVIET OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE 
IN AN ALLY\'S NATIONAL INTEREST TO LEAVE THE PACT. 
HOWEVER, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT HUNGARY 
COULD EDGE TOWARD NEUTRALITY IN THE NEAR-TERM. 
SOVIET LEADERS HAVE STRESSED THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY 
MILITARY FORCE IN EASTERN EUROPE, REGARDLESS OF THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.  IN THE SENSE OF INTERVENING 
MILITARILY TO IMPOSE IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY, THE 
BREZHNEV DOCTRINE APPEARS DEAD. 
 
4. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE COST OF TAKING MILITARY 
ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST A \"DEFECTING\" ALLY COULD BE 
ENORMOUS, BOTH IN ITS DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY 
IMPLICATIONS.  SHOULD HUNGARY MOVE TOWARD NEUTRALITY, 
THE SOVIETS ARE LIKELY TO EMPLOY ONLY POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC MEANS TO DETER THE DECISION.  GEOPOLITICAL 
REALITIES, HOWEVER, SEEM TO IMPOSE A SIGNIFICANTLY 
DIFFERENT SET OF TOLERANCES AS REGARDS POLAND AND THE 
GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.  TRADITIONAL SOVIET 
SECURITY CONCERNS VIS-A-VIS THESE COUNTRIES REMAIN 
HIGH AND THEIR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE WARSAW 
PACT IS REGARDED BY MANY AS A FUNDAMENTAL FACTOR FOR 
SOVIET SECURITY AND EUROPEAN STABILITY.  THIS MEANS 
THAT DESPITE SOVIET ASSURANCES THAT FORCE WILL NOT BE 
USED TO PREVENT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PACT, THERE ARE 
CIRCUMSTANCES -- EXTREME THOUGH THEY MAY BE -- UNDER 
WHICH THE PROSPECT OF SOVIET MILITARY INTERVENTION TO 
PRESERVE THE VIABILITY OF THE WARSAW PACT CANNOT BE 
RULED OUT. 
 
----------------------- 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
----------------------- 
 
5. THIS IS THE SECOND CABLE IN A THREE-PART SERIES 
ADDRESSING CURRENT SOVIET ATTITUDES TOWARD CHANGES IN 
THE WARSAW PACT, WHICH WE HOPE WASHINGTON READERS 
WILL FIND USEFUL IN PREPARING FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S 
DECEMBER 2-3 MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN GORBACHEV.  OTHER 
REPORTS FOCUS ON SOVIET AND EAST EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO 
TRANSFORM THE WARSAW PACT FROM A MILITARY-POLITICAL 
TO A POLITICAL-MILITARY ALLIANCE (SEE REFTEL), AS 
WELL AS THE ROLE THE SOVIETS BELIEVE THE WARSAW PACT 
SHOULD PLAY IN MAINTAINING EUROPEAN STABILITY IN THE 
1990\'S AND ADVANCING EAST-WEST RELATIONS (SEPTEL TO 
FOLLOW). 
 
6. THE SOVIET UNION INSISTS THAT IT IS NOT PREPARED 
MILITARILY TO IMPOSE ITS WILL ON ITS ALLIES.  THE 
DOCTRINE OF THE DAY IS \"NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS,\" AND SOLIDARITY\'S SUCCESS IN POLAND GIVES IT 
SOME CREDIBILITY.  AT HOME, GORBACHEV CONTINUES TO 
PUSH A BOLD PROGRAM OF REFORM.  ABROAD, HE HAS 
ACTIVELY PROMOTED THE BUILDING OF A \"COMMON EUROPEAN 
HOME.\"  HIS FOREIGN POLICY GOAL IN EASTERN EUROPE IS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD -- STABILITY.  BY THIS HE DOES NOT 
MEAN A HALT TO THE POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS, BUT 
STABILITY IN TERMS OF MILITARY AND ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND \"AMIABLE\" 
RELATIONS.  BUT DOES THIS REQUIRE THAT EAST EUROPEAN 
STATES REMAIN MEMBERS OF THE WARSAW TREATY 
ORGANIZATION? 
 
----------------- 
A BARBERSHOP TRIO 
----------------- 
 
7. AT THE END OF OCTOBER, THREE SOVIET OFFICIALS MADE 
STATEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT EAST EUROPEAN 
NATIONS WERE FREE TO LEAVE THE WARSAW TREATY 
ORGANIZATION (WTO): YEVGENIY PRIMAKOV, CHAIRMAN OF 
THE SUPREME SOVIET COUNCIL OF THE UNION; NIKOLAY 
SHISHLIN, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AIDE WHO SPECIALIZES IN 
EASTERN EUROPE; AND MFA PRESS SPOKESMAN GENNADIY 
GERASIMOV (WHO LATER SAID HE HAD BEEN MISQUOTED). 
PRIMAKOV SAID THAT WTO MEMBER STATES WERE FREE TO 
LEAVE, BUT EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL BELIEF THAT THIS 
WOULD NOT BE IN THEIR INTEREST.  SHISHLIN SAID THAT 
HUNGARY WAS FREE TO LEAVE THE WTO, BUT WAS MORE 
GUARDED WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE 
GDR.  FINALLY, GERASIMOV, REPEATING AN ANALOGY HE HAD 
MADE IN SEPTEMBER IN ITALY, SAID THAT THE BREZHNEV 
DOCTRINE HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE \"FRANK SINATRA 
DOCTRINE,\" I.E. COUNTRIES CAN SAY \"I DID IT MY WAY.\" 
(WE NOTE THAT SOVIET DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN 
ABOIMOV, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE WTO POLITICAL 
CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON ANY OF 
THE ABOVE STATEMENTS -- SEE MOSCOW 30503). 
 
8. WHILE IT IS UNIQUE TO HEAR SUCH A HARMONIOUS 
CHORUS AT ONE TIME, SIMILAR STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE 
BY SOVIET SPOKESMEN IN RECENT MONTHS.  SHISHLIN, FOR 
EXAMPLE, MADE THE SAME REMARK ABOUT HUNGARY IN A 
PARIS INTERVIEW IN SEPTEMBER.  FURTHERMORE, 
PRIMAKOV\'S REMARKS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO COMMENTS MADE 
BY MARSHAL SERGEY AKHROMEYEV IN JULY.  AKHROMEYEV, IN 
WASHINGTON TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES 
COMMITTEE, SAID EAST EUROPEAN NATIONS WERE FREE TO 
DECIDE WHETHER TO REMAIN IN THE PACT, BUT ADDED HE 
COULD NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR SOCIALIST COUNTRIES TO 
QUIT AS IT WOULD NOT BE IN THEIR INTEREST.  IN 
ADDITION, AKHROMEYEV\'S STATEMENTS ECHOED REMARKS MADE 
EARLIER BY OLEG BOGOMOLOV, THE DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW\'S 
INSTITUTE OF THE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD SOCIALIST 
SYSTEM. 
 
------------------- 
\"FREEDOM OF CHOICE\" 
------------------- 
 
9. GORBACHEV ANNOUNCED IN HIS AUGUST 1 SPEECH TO THE 
SUPREME SOVIET THAT THERE WERE NO UNIVERSAL SQCIALIST 
MODELS AND THAT EACH COUNTRY\'S PEOPLE DECIDE THE 
FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY THEMSELVES AND SELECT ITS 
SYSTEM ON THEIR OWN.  HE INSISTED THAT NOBODY MAY 
INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY OR IMPOSE 
ITS VIEWS ABOUT ITS POLICY UNDER ANY PRETEXT.  THE 
SOVIETS HAVE STRESSED THAT A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF 
THEIR NEW POLITICAL THINKING IS FREEDOM OF CHOICE. 
POLITBURO MEMBER ALEKSANDR YAKOVLEV, CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CPSU\'S INTERNATIONAL POLICY COMMISSION, SAID THAT 
THIS WAS THE \"MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF EAST EUROPEAN 
DEVELOPMENTS.\"  SHISHLIN TOO HAS EMPHASIZED THAT THIS 
POLICY MEANS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT THAT THE 
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES MUST NOT EXCEED IN THEIR DOMESTIC 
POLICIES. 
 
10. NEVERTHELESS, THE SOVIETS HAVE MADE SOME HINTS 
THAT THIS IS NOT A BLANKET FREEDOM.  IN PRIVATE TOP 
SOVIET LEADERS, GORBACHEV INCLUDED, HAVE STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE WARSAW PACT REMAINING INTACT.  LAST 
WEEK, YAKOVLEV TOLD ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI THAT IT WOULD 
BE DESTABILIZING IF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES WERE TO PEEL 
OFF FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCES.  IN ADDITION, HE 
PLACED A PROVISO ON \"FREEDOM OF CHOICE\" -- THAT THERE 
BE NO \"INTERFERENCE FROM THE U.S. AND THE WEST IN 
GENERAL.  SHISHLIN HAS ALSO NOTED THAT THERE WERE 
CERTAIN \"GEOPOLITICAL REALITIES\" WHICH COUNTRIES 
SHOULD NOT IGNORE. 
 
------------------------- 
BUT NO ONE WANTS TO LEAVE 
------------------------- 
 
11. MFA SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION CHIEF 
GORAL\'D GORINOVICH EMPHASIZED TO POLOFF THAT THE 
HUNGARIAN LEADERSHIP HAD NOT RAISED THE QUESTION OF 
LEAVING THE WTO, NOR HAD ANY OTHER PACT MEMBER STATE 
-- \"NOT HUNGARY, NOT POLAND, NOT ROMANIA.\"  HE SAID 
THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP HAD NOT ADDRESSED THE QUESTION 
OF WARSAW PACT MEMBERS POSSIBLY QUITTING THE 
ALLIANCE, AS NO MEMBER HAD EXPRESSED SUCH A DESIRE. 
IN RECENT MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY LITANY OF 
STATEMENTS OF FIRM AND UNDYING SUPPORT FOR THE WARSAW 
PACT FROM THOSE EAST EUROPEAN STATES WHICH ARE 
UNDERGOING REFORM. 
 
------------------------------------ 
COULD HUNGARY LEAVE THE WARSAW PACT? 
------------------------------------ 
 
12. NEVERTHELESS, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF HUNGARY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE WARSAW 
PACT, BECAUSE OF ITS EXPRESSED DESIRE FOR NEUTRALITY 
AND THE EXAMPLE OF NEUTRAL AUSTRIA JUST ACROSS THE 
DANUBE.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THEM ARGUE THAT WERE 
HUNGARY TO DO SO -- ABSENT SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC 
ASSISTANCE FROM THE WEST -- IT WOULD FIND ITSELF IN 
VERY DIFFICULT STRAITS.  THEY BELIEVE THAT IF HUNGARY 
SEVERED ALL ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH THE 
SOVIET UNION AND ITS OTHER EASTERN NEIGHBORS, IT 
COULD SIMPLY END UP CRIPPLING ITSELF. 
 
13. HUNGARY\'S WTO PARTICIPATION IS REGARDED AS MORE 
SYMBOLIC THAN SUBSTANTIAL.  LIBERAL SCHOLARS HERE 
ARGUE THAT HUNGARY\'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE WTO IS NOT 
REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THAT EVEN IF IT ADOPTED 
NEUTRAL STATUS, THE OVERALL BALANCE OF FORCES IN 
EUROPE WOULD REMAIN BASICALLY INTACT.  IN FACT, USA 
INSTITUTE DEPARTMENT HEAD ANDREY KORTUNOV HAS ARGUED 
THAT IN MILITARY TERMS A GREATER THREAT MIGHT BE 
POSED BY COUNTRIES LIKE HUNGARY REMAINING IN THE 
ALLIANCE, DUE TO THE UNRELIABILITY OF THEIR TROOPS 
SHOULD A CONFLICT EVER ARISE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PERHAPS HUNGARY COULD QUIT, BUT IT\'S A SMALL FISH 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
14. THE PRINCIPAL CONCERN RAISED ABOUT A HUNGARIAN 
\"DEFECTION\" WOULD BE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF AN 
ALLIANCE MEMBER QUITTING AND THE CHANCE THAT OTHER 
PACT MEMBERS MIGHT DECIDE TO FOLLOW ITS EXAMPLE.  IF 
HUNGARY DECIDED TO QUIT THE ALLIANCE, THERE IS LITTLE 
DOUBT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD BE LOATH TO INTERVENE 
MILITARILY.  INSTEAD, THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY SEEK TO 
ENCOURAGE HUNGARY TO REMAIN A MEMBER BY USING 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEVERS OF INFLUENCE. 
 
15. MANY OF OUR SOVIET CONTACTS BELIEVE THAT THE 
DEFECTION OF A LESS IMPORTANT WTO STATE, SUCH AS 
HUNGARY, WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SOVIET CONSERVATIVES\' 
HAND, BY PROVIDING THEM WITH YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
HOW GORBACHEV\'S PERESTROYKA AND NEW POLITICAL 
THINKING ARE UNDERMINING NATIONAL SECURITY. 
NEVERTHELESS, WE AND OUR SOVIET CONTACTS DOUBT THAT 
THIS COULD APPRECIABLY DIMINISH GORBACHEV\'S POLITICAL 
POWER, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH THE DRASTIC 
DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND NATIONALITY PROBLEMS THAT HE 
HAS TO FACE.  THERE ARE BIGGER FISH IN THIS POND, 
HOWEVER, WHOSE POSSIBLE DEFECTION COULD POSE A FAR 
MORE DANGEROUS THREAT. 
 
------------------------------------ 
A SOVIET POLICY OF \"DIFFERENTIATION\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
16. MFA SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ADMINISTRATION CHIEF 
GORINOVICH INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN HOW THE SOVIETS VIEWED HUNGARY, POLAND OR THE 
GDR UNDER THE WARSAW PACT.  NIKOLAY SHISHLIN, 
HOWEVER, WAS HESITANT ABOUT PLACING HUNGARY AND THE 
GDR IN THE SAME CATEGORY.  ANDREY KORTUNOV, HEAD OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES DEPARTMENT OF 
IUSAC, HAS SAID THAT MANY SOVIET MILITARY MEN STILL 
VIEW EASTERN EUROPE IN TERMS OF BUFFER ZONES AND 
DEPTH OF DEFENSE.  IN THEIR OPINION SOME EAST 
EUROPEAN ALLIES, IN PARTICULAR THE GDR AND POLAND 
WERE CRUCIAL TO SOVIET SECURITY INTERESTS.  YURIY 
DAVYDOV, HEAD OF IUSAC\'S \"EUROPEAN CENTER\" HAS VOICED 
SIMILAR CONCERNS. 
 
---------------------------- 
THE GDR: THE PACT\'S KEYSTONE 
---------------------------- 
 
17. SHISHLIN HAS STATED THAT \"FREEDOM OF CHOICE\" MUST 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CERTAIN \"GEO-POLITICAL REALITIES.\" 
IN RECENT MONTHS, WE HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD THIS 
PHRASE VOICED IN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE OF 
THE GDR.  THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT FOR THE GDR, 
THESE REALITIES COULD INCLUDE THE STATIONING OF 
FOREIGN TROOPS IN THE FRG AND THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE 
WEST GERMAN BUNDESWEHR, IF NOT THE EXISTENCE OF NATO 
ITSELF.  IN LIGHT OF SOVIET SECURITY INTERESTS, IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO ENVISION THE GDR BEING ABLE TO LEAVE THE 
WARSAW PACT IN THE NEAR-TERM WITHOUT POSING A SERIOUS 
THREAT TO SOVIET SECURITY AND OVERALL EUROPEAN 
SECURITY. 
 
18. THE SOVIETS CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT THE GERMAN 
QUESTION CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED WITHIN AN ALL-EUROPEAN 
CONTEXT.  IN FACT, VALENTIN FALIN, CHIEF OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT,  IS 
REPORTED TO HAVE TOLD WEST GERMAN OFFICIALS IN EARLY 
OCTOBER (SEE BONN 32350) THAT THE USSR COULD ACCEPT 
NEITHER GERMAN REUNIFICATION NOR THE GDR\'S LEAVING 
THE WARSAW PACT. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
POLAND: LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND HISTORY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
19. A GROUP OF AMERICAN SCHOLARS RECENTLY MET WITH 
RAFAIL FEDOROV, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AIDE, TO DISCUSS 
DEVELOPMENTS IN EASTERN EUROPE.  FEDOROV ADMITTED 
THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD STRONG GEOPOLITICAL 
INTERESTS IN POLAND, INSISTING, HOWEVER, THAT THEY 
COINCIDED FULLY WITH POLISH NATIONAL INTERESTS.  HE 
SAID THAT THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT INTRUDE IN 
POLISH AFFAIRS, BUT HIGHLIGHTED THE SUBSTANTIAL 
NETWORK OF ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
STATES, AS WELL AS THE OUTSTANDING \"GERMAN 
QUESTION.\"  IN FACT, FEDOROV POINTED OUT THAT SOVIET 
MILITARY FORCES IN POLAND WERE PRINCIPALLY IN THE 
WESTERN BORDER AREAS, LEAVING UNSAID THE FACT THAT 
THESE WERE FORMER GERMAN LANDS (WHICH WOULD FALL 
INSIDE THE 1937 BORDERS). 
 
20. SOVIET SCHOLARS, AS WELL AS FEDOROV, HAVE NOTED 
THAT POLAND HAS BEEN THE TRADITIONAL PATH OF INVASION 
TO THE SOVIET UNION AND NOW PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN 
MILITARY LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO THE GDR.  THESE 
FACTORS EVOKE CONSIDERABLE EMOTION ON THE PART OF THE 
SOVIET MILITARY -- AND MANY CIVILIANS -- AND CAST 
INTO DOUBT THE PROPOSITION THAT THE POLES WOULD BE 
TOTALLY FREE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN LOT.  SIMILARLY, 
KORTUNOV NOTED THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF 
POLAND QUITTING THE ALLIANCE, WHICH BEARS THE NAME OF 
ITS CAPITAL, COULD BE DEVASTATING.  IN FACT, WE WERE 
TOLD BY A CONTACT IN THE MFA ARMS LIMITATION AND 
DISARMAMENT ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS WAS ONE FACTOR 
THAT HAD LED THE SOVIETS TO CONSIDER PROPOSING WARSAW 
AS THE POSSIBLE SEAT FOR A PERMANENT WARSAW PACT 
HEADQUARTERS. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
COST OF STOPPING ANY DEFECTOR WOULD BE HIGH 
------------------------------------------- 
 
21. SOVIET SCHOLARS DRAW A BLANK WHEN ASKED WHAT 
COULD BE DONE TO STOP A POTENTIAL DEFECTOR.  THE 
STANDARD METHOD UNDER \"OLD THINKING\" -- SENDING IN 
THE TROOPS -- IS REGARDED AS PARTICULARLY OUT OF STEP 
WITH THE TIMES.  YAKOVLEV HAS INSISTED PRIVATELY THAT 
THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT APPLY MILITARY FORCE IN 
EASTERN EUROPE, REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
SHISHLIN, TOO, HAS SAID THAT THE USSR IS \"OPPOSED TO 
ANY USE OF TROOPS IN THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES\' 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  TO DO SO WOULD BE A TOTAL 
REPUDIATION OF THE FOREIGN POLICY LINE THAT THE 
SOVIET UNION HAS ESPOUSED FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. 
 
22. FURTHERMORE, MANY SOVIET SCHOLARS WE HAVE SPOKEN 
WITH BELIEVE THAT IF THE USSR WERE TO TAKE ANY 
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST A DEPARTING WARSAW TREATY 
MEMBER, IT WOULD RISK DESTROYING MOST OF ITS RECENT 
FOREIGN POLICY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  RELATIONS WITH THE 
WEST WOULD LIKELY COME TO A STANDSTILL -- PROGRESS IN 
ARMS CONTROL AND EXPANDING ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH 
THE U.S. AND WESTERN EUROPE COULD VANISH. 
 
23. FINALLY, THE DOMESTIC RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH A 
POLICY COULD BE UNPRECEDENTED.  THERE IS A CHANCE 
THAT A MAJOR MILITARY INTERVENTION IN EASTERN EUROPE 
COULD LEAD TO A CHANGE IN SOVIET LEADERSHIP AND THAT 
THE REFORM MOVEMENT UNDERWAY HERE MIGHT COME TO A 
RAPID HALT.  IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT A 
MILITARY MOVE AGAINST REFORMERS ABROAD WOULD NOT HAVE 
A CONCOMITANT IMPACT ON REFORMERS AT HOME -- JUST AS 
THE 1968 WTO INVASION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA CHILLED 
REFORM THROUGHOUT EASTERN EUROPE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
24. THE SOVIETS HAVE WOVEN FOR THEMSELVES A FOREIGN 
POLICY PARADOX.  THEY APPEAR TO BE PERFECTLY PREPARED 
TO LET THE EAST EUROPEAN STATES FOLLOW THEIR OWN 
INDIVIDUAL PATHS TO SOCIALISM -- OR WHEREVER ELSE 
THEY MAY BE HEADED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH \"NEW POLITICAL 
THINKING.\"  NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE THEIR BASIC 
REJECTION OF POWER POLITICS, THEY BELIEVE THAT THESE 
STATES WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS NEW FOUND FREEDOM 
TO TAKE STEPS THAT COULD UNDERMINE SOVIET SECURITY 
INTERESTS -- IN THIS CASE, LEAVING THE WARSAW PACT -- 
BECAUSE THE SOVIETS BELIEVE TO DO SO WOULD NOT BE IN 
SUCH A STATE\'S NATIONAL INTEREST. 
 
25. IS THE BREZHNEV DOCTRINE THEREFORE A THING OF THE 
PAST?  IN OUR VIEW THE ANSWER IS BOTH YES AND NO.  IN 
THE SENSE THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD INTERVENE TO ENFORCE 
IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY -- TO ENSURE THAT A CLIENT 
STATE FOLLOWED THE SOVIET MODEL OR PATH TO SOCIALISM, 
IT APPEARS THAT THE BREZHNEV DOCTRINE IS INDEED 
DEAD.  IN A BROADER, GEO-POLITICAL SENSE, HOWEVER, A 
MORE BASIC FORM OF THE DOCTRINE MAY REMAIN.  THE 
SOVIETS CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY 
CONCERNS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THESE 
FACTORS CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED WHEN EVALUATING BASIC 
SOVIET NATIONAL INTERESTS.  TO DATE, REFORM IN 
EASTERN EUROPE HAS, REASSSURINGLY FOR THE SOVIETS, 
PROCEEDED WITHOUT EITHER SUBSTANTIAL MANIFESTATIONS 
OF ANTI-SOVIET FEELING OR DOMESTIC TURMOIL WHICH 
THREATENED TO GET OUT OF CONTROL.  GORBACHEV\'S 
PERSONAL POPULARITY AMONG EASTERN EUROPEANS SEEKING 
REFORM HAS THUS FAR SERVED ESSENTIAL SOVIET SECURITY 
INTERESTS WELL. 
 
26. THERE IS, NEVERTHELESS, A POINT AT WHICH THE 
SOVIET UNION\'S LEADERSHIP COULD FEEL COMPELLED, EVEN 
THOUGH IT WOULD DESTROY MUCH OF THE PROGRESS IT HAS 
RECENTLY ACHIEVED, TO MOVE MILITARILY IN EASTERN 
EUROPE.  AS DETAILED ABOVE, THE MOST LIKELY VENUES 
FOR SUCH ACTION WOULD BE IN EITHER POLAND OR THE 
GDR.  EVEN HERE, WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT GORBACHEV 
WOULD USE EVERY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LEVER HE COULD 
TO PRECLUDE HAVING TO INITIATE SUCH AN ACTION. 
THEREFORE, THE SPECTER OF SOVIET MILITARY 
INTERVENTION, WHICH HAS HUNG OVER EASTERN EUROPE FOR 
THE PAST FORTY YEARS, THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY 
DISPELLED, HAS FADED APPRECIABLY. 
 
27. LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR 
TAGS: PREL UR, JA, US 
SUBJECT:  U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS: THE SOVIET PERSPECTIVE 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE\'S TOP JAPAN 
EXPERT, CONSTANTIN SARKISOV, THINKS UNCERTAINTY IN 
THE U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE AND WILL 
EVENTUALLY FORCE A STRUCTURAL \'REMODELLING\" OF THE 
RELATIONSHIP.  THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE 
INEVITABILITY OF JAPAN\'S BECOMING THE WORLD\'S LEADING 
ECONOMIC POWER.  THE CHANGES IN U.S.- JAPAN RELATIONS 
OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE U.S. AND SOVIETS TO 
COOPERATE IN CHANNELING JAPAN INTO PRODUCTIVE 
ENDEAVORS AND MAKING SURE JAPAN DOES NOT GET \"OUT 
FRONT\" POLITICALLY OR MILITARILY.  SINCE THE SOVIETS 
HAVE LITTLE ECONOMIC INFLUENCE IN THE REGION, THE 
U.S. WILL NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD IN FINDING AN 
ECONOMIC ROLE FOR JAPAN THAT WILL KEEP IT HAPPY. 
\"DON\'T ASK THEM,\" HE ADVISED. \"PUSH THEM.\"  THE 
COROLLARY, SARKISOV SUGGESTED, IS THAT IT IS IN 
SOVIET INTERESTS TO MOVE THINGS ALONG IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION MILITARILY, BY ACTING TO FURTHER DIMINISH 
THE ALREADY SHRINKING PERCEPTION IN JAPAN OF THE 
\"SOVIET THREAT.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  WORLD\'S LEADING ECONOMIC POWER 
/   ------------------------------ 
 
CONSTANTIN SARKISOV, THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE\'S LEADING 
JAPAN EXPERT, PROVIDED POLOFF WITH HIS VIEWS ON U.S. 
- JAPAN RELATIONS AND ON HOW THE U.S. AND SOVIET 
UNION COULD COOPERATE IN THE FUTURE ON JAPAN POLICY. 
IN A JANUARY 19 MEETING WITH POLOFF, SARKISOV SAID HE 
SAW CONSIDERABLE TENSION IN U.S. - JAPAN RELATIONS. 
CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES ON BOTH SIDES WOULD EVENTUALLY 
FORCE A \"REMODELLING\" OF THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP, 
WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS OUTDATED.  THE U.S. NEEDED TO 
COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT IN THE NEXT CENTURY 
JAPAN WOULD BE THE WORLD\'S LEADING ECONOMIC POWER. 
IN TEN YEARS, JAPAN\'S GNP WOULD BE 75 PERCENT OF U.S. 
GNP--OR MORE, HE SAID. 
 
4.  A MODEL RELATIONSHIP 
/   -------------------- 
 
SARKISOV SAID THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
POWERS WOULD CONTINUE AND THE U.S. - JAPAN 
RELATIONSHIP SHOULD PROVE TO BE A MODEL OF FUTURE 
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORLD.  THERE WOULD BE FRICTION 
IN THE PROCESS BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD SURVIVE 
INTACT ALBEIT WITH ALTERED SECURITY AND ECONOMIC 
DIMENSIONS.  THE U.S. WOULD NEED TO ACTIVELY SEEK OUT 
A LEADING ROLE FOR JAPAN ECONOMICALLY--NOT AS A BILL 
PAYER OR DISCOUNT BANK BUT AS THE PREDOMINANT 
FINANCER AND DECISIONMAKER IN MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC 
PROJECTS.  SARKISOV SAID THE U.S. SHOULD NOT 
NEGOTIATE THIS WITH JAPAN, BUT SHOULD PUSH JAPAN INTO 
THE ROLE, WHICH HE FELT WOULD SATISFY THE JAPANESE 
\"EGO\" AND KEEP TOKYO FROM CONCENTRATING ON POLITICAL 
OR STRATEGIC ISSUES. 
 
5.  THE SOVIETS, SARKISOV SAID, DID NOT SEE AN 
ECONOMIC THREAT FROM JAPAN.  THERE WAS AN ECONOMIC 
MISMATCH.  THE SOVIETS DID, HOWEVER, FEAR A MILITARY 
THREAT FROM JAPAN SHOULD JAPANESE MILITARY POWER 
CONTINUE TO GROW.  IT HAS NOT IN SOVIET OR U.S. 
INTERESTS TO SEE JAPAN BECOME A WORLD POLITICAL OR 
STRATEGIC POWER.  TOGETHER, THE U.S. AND SOVIET UNION 
COULD WORK TO ENSURE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.  MANY 
SOVIETS CONSIDERED THE U.S. PRESENCE IN JAPAN AN 
ANCHOR RESTRAINING JAPANESE MILITARY POWER, SAID 
SARKISOV, AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CONTINUE 
INDEFINITELY.  BUT THE SIZE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE 
NEEDED TO BE REDUCED.  U.S. REDUCTIONS--OR EVEN U.S. 
WILLINGNESS TO TALK SERIOUSLY ABOUT REDUCTIONS--COULD 
OPEN THE WAY FOR SOVIET MILITARY REDUCTIONS IN THE 
REGION.  SOVIET REDUCTIONS WOULD FURTHER REDUCE THE 
PERCEPTION IN JAPAN OF A SOVIET THREAT.  EVEN NOW, 
PEOPLE IN JAPAN DID NOT FEEL AS THREATENED BY THE 
SOVIET UNION AS THEY HAD TWO YEARS AGO, SARKISOV 
SAID. 
 
 
6.  COMMENT:  SARKISOV\'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE 
COMMONALITY OF U.S. AND SOVIET INTERESTS VIS-A-VIS 
JAPAN ARE PART OF A BROADER SOVIET ARGUMENT WE HAVE 
BEEN HEARING MUCH OF RECENTLY IN SUPPORT OF SOVIET 
ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES.  THE BASIC THRUST IS THAT, 
TO OPEN THE POSSIBILITIES FOR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL 
COOPERATION IN NORTHEAST ASIA IN WHICH THE U.S., 
JAPAN AND THE SOVIET UNION ALL PLAY CONSTRUCTIVE 
ROLES, THE U.S. NEEDS TO BEGIN THE ARMS CONTROL 
PROCESS.  THE RIGHT U.S. GESTURE WOULD OPEN THE WAY 
FOR SOVIET FORCE REDUCTIONS WHICH WOULD LESSEN 
JAPANESE (AND KOREAN) SECURITY CONCERNS.  A CONTINUED 
U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN JAPAN IS ALSO PART OF THE 
ARGUMENT.  OFFICIAL SOVIETS ARE CLAIMING THAT THE 
SOVIET UNION HAS DONE WHAT IT CAN TO INITIATE THE 
PROCESS AND CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE LARGE UNILATERAL 
REDUCTIONS. 
 
7.  NORTHERN TERRITORIES 
/  -------------------- 
 
SARKISOV NOTED THAT MOSCOW WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
MILITARY-TO-MILITARY CONTACTS.  THE JAPANESE WERE 
THINKING ABOUT IT BUT WERE STILL HESITANT \"BECAUSE 
THEY WANT TO DO IT ONLY WITH YOU--AND WITHOUT YOUR OK 
THEY WON\'T.\"  SARKISOV THOUGHT A MOMENT, THEN ADDED, 
\"ALSO, THEY WANT A CONCESSION ON THE NORTHERN 
TERRITORIES.\"  BUT THERE WOULD BE NO PROGRESS ON THE 
NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE WHEN SHEVARDNADZE GOES TO 
TOKYO IN MARCH, SARKISOV PREDICTED.  GROWING 
NATIONALISM MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SOVIETS TO 
CONCEDE ON ETOROFU AND KUNASHIRI.  THE EMERGENCE OF 
THE SUPREME SOVIET FURTHER COMPLICATED THE ISSUE. 
AZERBAYDZHAN AND THE BALTICS WERE TOO CLOSELY 
CONNECTED TO THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES AND IT WOULD 
THEREFORE BE \"ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE\" TO GET A DEAL 
THROUGH THE SUPREME SOVIET.  MOSCOW WAS PREPARED TO 
OFFER JOINT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND NO-VISA TRAVEL TO 
THE ISLANDS.  THE IDEA OF SELLING THEM TO JAPAN WAS A 
NON-STARTER.  FOR MOSCOW, IT WAS SIMPLY SAFER TO HOLD 
ON TO THE ISLANDS THAN TO OPEN POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE 
NEGOTIATIONS OR SELL THEM.  SHEVARDNADZE MIGHT, 
HOWEVER, REFORMULATE THE ISSUE IN MARCH SO THAT 
MOSCOW RECOGNIZED THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES 
SPECIFICALLY AS AN UNRESOLVED PROBLEM BETWEEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, RECENT 
COMMENTS MADE BY A NUMBER OF SOVIETS, INCLUDING 
GORBACHEV HIMSELF, ARE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP INTO A 
VAGUE PATTERN CENTERED ON SOVIET AIR POWER IN THE 
NORTHERN TERRITORIES.  ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ACTING 
DIRECTOR CHUFRIN POINTEDLY TOLD VISITING SENATOR 
WIRTH RECENTLY THAT U.S. WILLINGNESS TO START TALKING 
ABOUT ARMS CONTROL WOULD PROMPT SOVIET AIR FORCE 
REDUCTIONS IN THE REGION.  GORBACHEV TOLD ABE THAT 
JAPANESE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE GRAVE VISITS TO 
ETOROFU IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS 
THERE, BUT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD \"SEE WHAT THEY 
COULD DO\" ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  IMEMO JAPAN EXPERT 
KUNADZE TOLD POLOFF GORBACHEV COULD NOT AFFORD AN 
UNSUCCESSFUL FOREIGN TRIP.  WE DO NOT THINK ANY 
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON HOW TO MOVE THE NORTHERN 
TERRITORIES PROBLEM FORWARD, OR EVEN WHETHER IT 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE HANDLED AS A BILATERAL PROBLEM 
OR AS AN EAST-WEST ISSUE.  SOVIET DOMESTIC CONCERNS 
WOULD ARGUE FOR A CONTINUED BILATERAL APPROACH, WHILE 
SOVIET ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES COULD CLEARLY BENEFIT 
FROM ITS TREATMENT AS AN EAST-WEST ISSUE.  WE KNOW 
THAT HIGH LEVEL ATTENTION IS NOT FOCUSED ON THE 
NORTHERN TERRITORIES.  BUT IT WILL INCREASE AS THE 
TIME FOR GORBACHEV\'S VISIT NEARS, AND THOSE TO WHOM 
THE LEADERSHIP TURNS FOR ANSWERS AT THAT TIME ARE NOW 
IN THE PROCESS OF SEEING WHAT WILL FLY--AND WHAT 
WON\'T.

FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY FROM HA A/S SCHIFTER 
 
E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR 
TAGS:  PREL, US, RO 
SUBJECT:  IMPRESSIONS OF POLITICAL SITUATION IN ROMANIA 
 
1.  (SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  DURING MY SHORT STAY IN ROMANIA I MET WITH FOREIGN 
MINISTER ALAC, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER NEAGU, JUSTICE 
MINISTER POP, RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER STOICESCU, 
LEADERS OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES (PEASANTS, 
NATIONAL LIBERALS, AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS) AND LEADERS OF 
TWO NEWLY CREATED LABOR UNIONS.  I SPOKE AT LENGTH TO 
THE AMBASSADOR, THE DCM, AND POLITICAL OFFICERS AND 
FOUND ALL OF THEM IN STRONG AGREEMENT IN THEIR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION HERE:  IF ANYONE CAN SAVE 
ROMANIA FROM THE CHAOS IT WILL HAVE TO BE THE NATIONAL 
SALVATION FRONT, THAT THE FRONT\'S BASIC INCLINATION IS 
TO ESTABLISH A DEMOCRACY, THAT OUR INVOLVEMENT IN 
ROMANIA CAN STRENGTHEN THAT INCLINATION, THAT THE 
LEADERS OF THE OLD PARTIES SIMPLY DON\'T HAVE WHAT IT 
TAKES TO LEAD, AND THAT THERE IS NO OTHER POLITICAL 
FORCE ON THE SCENE.  THE EMBASSY ALSO BELIEVES THAT 
ANALYSES MADE IN WASHINGTON ON THE BASIS OF VARIOUS 
FRAGMENTS OF INFORMATION LACK THE FEELING THAT CAN BE 
PROVIDED ONLY BY ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVATION.  I FIND 
MYSELF IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE 
EMBASSY\'S ASSESSMENT. 
 
3.  NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITH WHOM I MET 
REFLECTED ANY COMMUNIST THINKING IN THEIR REMARKS TO 
ME. THE EMBASSY STRONGLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE 
TRASHING OF PEASANT PARTY HEADQUARTERS BY FRONT 
SUPPORTERS AND I BELIEVE THE PROTEST WAS DULY NOTED. 
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR POLICY SHOULD BE BASED ON 
THAT SINGLE INCIDENT.  IF ACTIONS OF THIS KIND EVER 
BECOME A PATTERN, WE WOULD, OF COURSE, HAVE TO 
REASSESS THE SITUATION. 
 
4.  JUSTICE MINISTER POP SPENT QUITE SOME TIME 
OUTLINING HIS OBJECTIVES.  HE WAS CLEARLY WELL VERSED 
IN WESTERN LEGAL THINKING.  HE SPOKE OF PLANS FOR THE 
ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AND GUARANTEEING 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  HE SPOKE 
ALSO OF HIS PLANS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM.  I DID NOT HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS 
MOUTHING PHRASES.  IT SEEMED ALL WELL THOUGHT THROUGH 
AND GENUINE. 
 
5.  RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER STOICESCU WAS A 
DISAPPOINTMENT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS SO STRONG AN 
ORTHODOX BELIEVER THAT HE LEFT ME WITH THE IMPRESSION 
THAT OTHER DENOMINATIONS MIGHT NOT GET A FAIR SHAKE. 
I TRIED TO IMPRESS ON HIM THAT HE MUST LIVE UP TO 
ROMANIA\'S HELSINKI COMMITMENT TO RESPECT ALL RELIGIONS 
AND URGED HIM TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE EMBASSY 
ON THIS SUBJECT.  STOICESCU IS CLEARLY A LONG-TERM 
ENEMY OF COMMUNISM, COMING FROM THE OLD-LINE 
CONSERVATIVE CAMP.  AS I WAS PREACHING TO HIM ABOUT 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, HE EYED ME SUSPICIOUSLY AT ONE 
POINT AND ASKED WHETHER I WAS A BAPTIST.  (THE 
BAPTISTS WANT HIS MINISTRY TO BE ABOLISHED.) 
 
6.  THE FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS STRONGLY EMPHASIZED 
THEIR INTENTIONS TO HAVE ROMANIA LIVE UP TO ALL ITS 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT.  CELAC 
TENDED TO BE SOMEWHAT OBNOXIOUS IN HIS COMPLAINT ABOUT 
U.S. ALLEGED FAILURE TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN SUPPORT OF 
ROMANIAN DEMOCRACY.  HE MEANT THAT WE HAD NOT SENT A 
SIGNAL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NSF. 
 
7.  AS TO THE LEADER OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES, I WAS 
LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAVE SIMPLY COME 
OUT OF RETIREMENT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY HAVE 
SURVIVED.  IT DOES NOT SEEM AS IF THEY HAVE MADE MUCH 
OF AN EFFORT TO PUT AN ORGANIZATION TOGETHER. 
NEVERTHELESS, GIVEN THE AD HOC CHARACTER OF THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF UNCERTAINTY, 
THE INCLUSION OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TRADITIONAL 
PARTIES IN THE TRANSITION GOVERNMENT WOULD BE OF 
SYMBOLIC VALUE AND WOULD HAVE A REASSURING EFFECT ON 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC. 
 
8.  MY OVERALL IMPRESSION, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE READ AS 
WELL AS WHAT I SAW IN BUCHAREST, IS THE FOLLOWING:  THE 
ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY THAT EMERGED AT THE END OF THE 
STALIN ERA HAS LIKE THE OTHER COMMUNIST PARTIES IN 
EASTERN EUROPE IN THAT IT WAS HELD TOGETHER BY A STRONG 
IDEOLOGY AND CLOSE BONDS OF MUTUAL LOYALTY AMONG 
MEMBERS OF THE NOMENKLATURA.  AS IN THE CASE OF OTHER 
PARTIES, THE IDEOLOGY EVAPORATED IN THE SEVENTIES.  BUT 
UNLIKE THE OTHER PARTIES, IN WHICH FRATERNAL BONDS KEPT 
THE NOMENKLATURA TOGETHER, THE COMMUNIST PARTY BONDS IN 
ROMANIA DISSOLVED AS CEAUSESCU ESTABLISHED WHAT WAS IN 
EFFECT A BYZANTINE IMPERIAL COURT.  THERE WERE NO 
LONGER ANY FRATERNAL BONDS.  THERE WAS ONLY A DIRECT 
LINE OF LOYALTY FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL COURTIER TO 
CEAUSESCU.  ANY OFFICIAL WHO CROSSED THE LEADER OR 
DISPLEASED HIM OR WAS DENOUNCED WAS DEMOTED, FIRED, OR 
JAILED. 
 
9.  GIVEN THE FOREGOING STATE OF AFFAIRS, CEAUSESCU\'S 
DEATH CAUSED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO SHATTER OVERNIGHT. 
THERE WAS NO COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP GROUP TO CLOSE RANKS, 
AS IN BULGARIA AFTER ZHIVKOV\'S OUSTER.  CEAUSESCU\'S 
MINIONS HAD NO RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER.  THEY FELL 
BY THE WAYSIDE.  WHAT THEN CAME TOGETHER WERE THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OUSTED FROM PROMINENT 
POSITIONS, WHO THEN JOINED WITH MORE JUNIOR OFFICIALS 
IN AN EFFORT TO PUT TOGETHER A GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF 
FUNCTIONING. 
 
10.  TO BE SURE, MOST OF THE NEW LEADERS WERE ONCE 
COMMUNISTS, WHETHER OF THE BELIEVING OR THE OPPORTUNIST 
VARIETY.  CAN THEY BE TRUSTED NOW?  I BELIEVE THEY CAN 
BECAUSE (A) THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS EMBITTERED 
THEM AGAINST TOTALITARIAN RULE (THEY USE THAT TERM|), 
AND (B) EVEN IF THEY ARE CYNICS (AND I AM SURE NONE OF 
THEM ARE), THEY KNOW WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING AND 
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THE FOREIGN HELP THEY NEED. 
 
11.  AS THE NSF APPEARS FOR THE TIME BEING TO BE THE 
ONLY GAME IN TOWN TO KEEP ROMANIA FUNCTIONING AND AS WE 
CAN BRING OUR INFLUENCE TO BEAR TO STEER THE FRONT IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I STRONGLY CONCUR IN THE BUCHAREST 
EMBASSY\'S APPROACH AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

POLITICAL REFORMS, HINTING THAT APPROVAL OF A 
MULTIPARTY SYSTEM AND DRASTIC REVISION, PERHAPS 
REPEAL, OF ARTICLE SIX OF THE USSR CONSTITUTION (ON 
THE PARTY\'S PRIMACY) WERE IN THE OFFING.  ALTHOUGH HE 
ARGUED THAT THE POSTS OF PARTY AND STATE LEADER 
SHOULD BE COMBINED DURING THE \"TRANSITION PERIOD,\" HE 
SAID HE SUPPORTED THEIR ULTIMATE SEPARATION.  THE 
PARTY CONGRESS WOULD DECIDE THE ISSUE, HE NOTED.  HE 
CALLED FOR DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS TO THE 28TH PARTY 
CONGRESS, PREDICTING THE PLENUM WOULD APPROVE AN 
EXCEPTION TO EXISTING PARTY RULES TO PERMIT THAT. 
GORBACHEV, HOWEVER, WAS SILENT ON WHETHER THE 
CONGRESS WOULD BE ADVANCED TO THIS SPRING, AS MANY 
PARTY MEMBERS HAVE DEMANDED, BUT NOTED THAT THE 
CONGRESS WAS NECESSARY TO \"RENEW\" BOTH THE POLITBURO 
AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. 
 
3.  AFTER A WEEK IN WHICH THE CENTRAL PRESS WAS 
FILLED WITH ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS OF INTELLECTUALS 
CALLING FOR ENHANCING THE POWER OF THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE SUPREME SOVIET (I.E., GORBACHEV), THE MEETING 
WITH MINERS WAS CLEARLY INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE 
GORBACHEV HAS SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM THE WORKING 
CLASS AS WELL.  AT THE MEETING, GORBACHEV EXTENDED AN 
INVITATION TO THE MINERS TO SEND A TEN-MAN DELEGATION 
TO THE PLENUM ITSELF AND SUGGESTED ITS MEMBERS MIGHT 
BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK.  THAT TOO WAS AN OBVIOUS PLOY TO 
WIN FAVOR WITH WORKERS AND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION 
THAT THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE HEARD AT THE 
PLENUM.  OVERALL, MEDIA REPORTING OF THE PAST WEEK 
AND THE HUGE DEMONSTRATION IN MOSCOW IN SUPPORT OF 
RADICAL POLITICAL REFORM FEBRUARY 4 (REPORTED SEPTEL) 
HAVE CREATED THAT IMPRESSION THAT GORBACHEV IS IN 
CHARGE AND PREPARED TO PUSH THROUGH A SET OF RADICAL 
PARTY REFORMS THAT WOULD HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE JUST 
A FEW MONTHS AGO. 
 
 
LAST RUMORS 
/---------- 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT HEAD AT THE INSTITUTE 
OF STATE AND LAW (STRICTLY PROTECT), TWO KEY ITEMS ON 
THE PLENUM AGENDA WILL BE THE TIMING OF THE 28TH 
PARTY CONGRESS AND THE METHOD OF SELECTING DELEGATES 
TO IT.  OUR SOURCE SAID THE PLENUM WOULD DECIDE TO 
ADVANCE THE DATE OF THE CONGRESS FROM OCTOBER TO 
PERHAPS AS EARLY AS APRIL OR MAY.  HE BELIEVED THE 
PLENUM WOULD APPROVE DIRECT SELECTION OF DELEGATES BY 
THE PARTY RANK AND FILE. 
 
5.  ACCORDING TO A BRITISH DIPLOMAT CITING A 
CONVERSATION LATE LAST WEEK WITH ARKADIY VAKSBERG 
(PROTECT), A POLITICAL COMMENTATOR FOR \"LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA,\" LIGACHEV AND VOROTNIKOV WILL RETIRE AT THE 
PLENUM AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE SECRETARY MANAYENKOV 
WILL BE ELEVATED TO THE POLITBURO. 
 
6.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT:  MUTED SOVIET REACTION TO MANDELA\'S RELEASE 
 
1.    CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.    FOR ALL THE ATTENTION THE SOVIET MEDIA HAVE 
PAID TO NELSON MANDELA\'S RELEASE FEBRUARY 12, HE 
MIGHT AS WELL STILL BE IN PRISON.  \"SEVEN DAYS\", THE 
USSR\'S MAJOR SUNDAY EVENING NEWS AND WEEK-IN-REVIEW 
PROGRAM, DEVOTED ALL OF THIRTY SECONDS TO THE EVENT, 
AND BURIED IT SOME FORTY MINUTES INTO THE PROGRAM -- 
AFTER SUCH HIGHLIGHTS AS UPCOMING LOCAL ELECTIONS IN 
SVERDLOVSK.  \"PRAVDA\" (FEB. 12) LIKEWISE DEVOTED 
SCANT COVERAGE TO THE RELEASE, AND CARRIED ONLY A BIO 
SKETCH OF MANDELA, NEXT TO THE FAMILIAR 27-YEAR OLD 
PHOTO OF THE ANC LEADER WHEN HE WAS JAILED. 
 
3.    AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW FEBRUARY 12, 
FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER YULIY VORONTSOV WAS 
ASKED ABOUT MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND WHETHER THIS WOULD 
PROMPT THE USSR TO RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH 
SOUTH AFRICA.  VORONTSOV RESPONDED THAT THE SOVIET 
UNION WELCOMED MANDELA\'S RELEASE BY THE SAG.  \"IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IMPRISONED 
FOR 27 YEARS,\" VORONTSOV SAID IN THE ONLY FORCEFUL 
COMMENT WE HAVE HEARD ON THIS SUBJECT.  MANDELA\'S 
RELEASE DID NOT YET MEAN THE SAG HAD DISMANTLED 
APARTHEID, HOWEVER.  UNTIL THIS OCCURRED, THE WHOLE 
CIVILIZED WORLD -- INCLUDING THE USSR -- WOULD REFUSE 
TO HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, VORONTSOV 
SAID. 
 
4.  THE SINCERITY OF VORONTSOV\'S COMMENTS WAS 
UNDERMINED BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION WAS 
OBVIOUSLY \"PLANTED.\"  THE PRESS CONFERENCE HAD BEEN 
CALLED TO DISCUSS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE SUBJECT 
RELATING TO THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE PERSON WHO ASKED 
THE QUESTION -- RADIO MOSCOW AFRICA SERVICE OFFICIAL 
ALEKSEY BATOGOV -- WAS CLEARLY BEWILDERED BY HIS 
PRESENCE THERE AND EVEN ASKED AN EMBOFF IN ATTENDANCE 
WHAT THE PROCEDURE WAS FOR POSING QUESTIONS. 
 
5.  IF THIS RELATIVE LACK OF ATTENTION TO AN 
HISTORIC EVENT HAS SURPRISED US, IT HAS NO DOUBT 
INFURIATED SOME AFRICAN DIPLOMATS.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THIS TREATMENT CONFIRMS THE LOW PRIORITY WHICH 
AFRICAN AFFAIRS OCCUPIES IN A SOVIET SOCIETY WHICH IS 
ABSORBED IN DOMESTIC ISSUES.  MATLOCK

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DURING A FEBRUARY 20 MEETING ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, 
THE AMBASSADOR TOOK UP WITH FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER BESSMERTNYKH ALLEGATIONS REPORTEDLY MADE BY 
SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN KABUL BORIS PASTUKHOV THAT THE 
U.S. AND PAKISTAN WERE ASSISTING MUJAHEDIN GROUPS IN 
FOMENTING REBELLION IN SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA.  PASSING 
BESSMERTNYKH AN AP ACCOUNT OF PASTUKHOV\'S SUNDAY, 
FEBRUARY 18 PRESS CONFERENCE (REF), THE AMBASSADOR 
NOTED THAT PASTUKHOV HAD REPORTEDLY ACCUSED \"THE 
UNITED STATES AND PAKISTAN OF USING MOSLEM 
FUNDAMENTALISTS TO FUNNEL MILITARY AID TO STRIFE-TORN 
SOUTHERN SOVIET REPUBLICS\"...\"AND HAD CREATED AN 
ORGANIZATION SPECIFICALLY TO FUEL THIS UNREST\" (THE 
UNION OF NORTHERN PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN). 
 
3.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED BESSMERTNYKH TO CLARIFY 
WHETHER PASTUKHOV HAD ACTUALLY SAID THIS.  THIS WAS A 
VERY SERIOUS CHARGE, AND AS BESSMERTNYKH KNEW THERE 
WAS NO BASIS FOR ACCUSATIONS OF THIS SORT AGAINST THE 
U.S., AND WE HAD NO INTEREST IN ENGAGING IN THIS SORT 
OF ACTIVITY. 
 
4.  BESSMERTNYKH SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE REPORT 
IN QUESTION AND COULD NOT COMMENT IMMEDIATELY ON ITS 
ACCURACY; HE WOULD LOOK INTO IT.  HOWEVER, SPEAKING 
PRELIMINARILY, HE COULD SAY THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN 
FACTS OF WHICH BOTH THE U.S. AND USSR HAD TO BE 
AWARE.  FIRST, MUJAHEDIN WERE INVOLVED IN 
CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY -- THIS WAS IRREFUTABLE. 
SECOND, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN (I.E., ISI) WERE ENCOURAGING MUJAHEDIN 
ACTIVITY AGAINST SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA.  BESSMERTNYKH 
DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS ACCORDED WITH THE POLICY OF 
THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, BUT NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A 
FACT THAT ENCOURAGEMENT WAS BEING PROVIDED. 
BESSMERTNYKH ADDED THAT WHILE HE TOOK NOTE OF THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S STATEMENT THAT ACCUSATIONS OF THIS SORT 
AGAINST THE U.S. WERE GROUNDLESS, HE ALSO HOPED THE 
U.S. WOULD TRY TO RESTRAIN THOSE FORCES IN THE 
PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT THAT WERE BEHIND THIS ACTIVITY.

          REBUILT ON RED SQUARE 
 
REFS: A)  90 MOSCOW 20019  B)  90 MOSCOW 41463 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------ 
 
2.  RED SQUARE\'S KAZAN CATHEDRAL, A POWERFUL RUSSIAN 
PATRIOTIC SYMBOL BLOWN UP BY STALIN, IS TO BE 
REBUILT.  CONSERVATVE RUSSIENS CHEER WHILE LIBERAL 
ORTHODOX BELIEVERS FRET THAT THE REBUILDING MAY PLAY 
INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE THE 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH (ROC) FOR RUSSIAN NATIONALIST 
AS OPPOSED TO SPIRITUAL ENDS.  THE ROC\'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER UNDERSTANDS THESE CONCERNS; NEVERTHELESS, HE 
IS GAMBLING THAT CONSERVATIVES\' INTEREST IN THE 
REBUILDING WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE IN 
THE ROC INSTEAD OF SIMPLY WANTING TO USE IT.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL ON MOSCOW\'S RED SQUARE USED 
TO BE ONE OF RUSSIA\'S MOST REVERED RELIGIOUS AND 
HISTORIC SHRINES.  IT WAS BUILT DURING THE REIGN OF 
THE FIRST ROMANOV TSAR.  PTER THE GREAT LATER 
INSPECTED TROOPS UPON THEIR RETURN FROM THE POLTAVA 
BATTLE IN FRONT OF IT AND CELEBRATIONS WERE HELD 
THERE AFTER NAPOLEON\'S RETREAT FROM MOSCOW.  AFTER 
1917, THE CATHEDRAL WAS FORCEFULLY TAKEN AWAY FROM 
THE ROC AND FELL INTO DISREPAIR.  TOUSANDS OF RUBLES 
WERE SPENT RESTORING IT IN THE 1920S -- UNTIL ITS 
CHIEF RESTORER WAS PACKED OFF TO SIBERIA AND THE 
CATHEDRAL WAS BLOWN UP BY STALIN.  THE CATHEDRAL\'S 
FOUNDATIONS WERE LATER GRACED FOR A TIME BY PUBLIC 
TOILETS AND NOW STAND EMPTY. 
 
4.  ON JUNE 5, 1990 THE NEW MOSCOW CITY GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE CATHEDRAL WOULD BE REBUILT ON ITS 
ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONS BY THE MOSCOW DIVISION OF THE 
ALL-RUSSIA SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORICAL 
MONUMENTS AND CULTURE (SEE REF A).  THE COST IS 
EXPECTED TO TOTAL ONE MILLION RUBLES.  MONEY FOR THE 
REBUILDING IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED FROM PRIVATE 
INDIVIDUALS.  THE CATHEDRAL IS SCHEDULED TO BE READY 
IN TIME FOR MOSCOW\'S 850TH ANNIVERSARY IN 1995. 
 
5.  THIS DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT ESCAPE THE 
NOTICE OF THE ROC\'S NEWLY-ELECTED PATRIARCH, ALEXEI 
II, WHO RECENTLY WEIGHED IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS 
INITIATIVE.  ON NOVEMBER 4, ALEXEI II ORGANIZED A 
TRIUMPHAL MARCH FROM THE KREMLIN\'S USPENSKIY 
CATHEDRAL (RECENTLY RECLAIMED FOR OCCASIONAL ROC 
RELIGIOUS SERVICES) TO THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL\'S EMPTY 
LOT, WHERE HE LED RELIGIOUS SERVICES, BLESSED THE 
REBUILDING\'S FIRST STONE, AND ADDRESSED THE ATTENDING 
FAITHFUL, FOLLOWED BY A SPEECH BY MOSCOW MAYOR 
GAVRIIL POPOV. 
 
6.  VISITING AMERICAN SCHOLARS WHO ATTENDED THE 
CEREMONY TOLD POLOFF LATER THAT FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND 
MUSCOVITES WERE ALSO PRESENT.  THEIR IMPRESSION WAS 
THAT ALEXEI II HAD EXCELLENT CONTACT WITH THE CROWD, 
WHO LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO HIS ADDRESS.  HEARING HIM 
WAS NOT A PROBLEM, AS AN \"AMERICAN QUALITY\" SOUND 
SYSTEM BOOMED HIS WORDS, THE RELIGIOUS SERVICE AND 
ACCOMPANYING BELL CHIMES ALL OVER RED SQUARE.  THE 
AMERICANS\' COMMENT: \"LENIN MUST HAVE BEEN ROLLING 
OVER IN HIS GLASS BOX A FEW FEET AWAY.\" 
 
7.  DISCUSSIONS AMONG VARIOUS ROC ACTIVISTS AND OTHER 
OPINION LEADERS HAVE RESULTED IN A CONSENSUS THAT THE 
KAZAN CATHEDRAL WILL INDEED BE REBUILT IN SOME FORM 
BUT MIXED FEELINGS AS TO THE USEFULNESS OF THIS 
ENDEAVOR.  STRONGLY IN THE PRO-REBUILDING CAMP ARE A 
NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE AND RUSSIAN NATIONALIST 
FIGURES, SUCH AS \"LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA\" JOURNALISTS 
AND \"NASH SOVREMENNIK\" EDITOR AND WRITER STANISLAV 
KUNYAYEV (SEE REF B).  THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE 
FIGURES ARE AGNOSTICS OR ATHEISTS DOES NOT AFFECT 
THEIR SUPPORT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE DESIRE TO REVIVE 
RUSSIA\'S GLORIOUS PAST (SYMBOLIZED BY THE CATHEDRAL), 
REGARDLESS OF HOW THIS AFFECTS THE FORTUNES OF THE 
ROC. 
 
8.  IN THE OTHER CAMP, LIBERAL ROC LEADERS SUCH AS 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST VIKTOR POPKOV STRONGLY OPPOSE 
THE REBUILDING.  ONE OF THEIR REASONS IS PRECISELY 
THAT THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL HAS BECOME MORE OF A 
NATIONALISTIC THAN A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL.  THEY ARE 
CONVINCED THAT ITS REBUILDING WOULD ENCOURAGE THE 
TENDENCY TO HAVE ORTHODOXY SERVE NATIONALIST AS 
OPPOSED TO MORAL ENDS.  POPKOV SPOKE FOR MANY LIBERAL 
ROC BELIEVERS WHEN HE TOLD POLOFF: \"THE ORTHODOX 
CHURCH SPENT ENOUGH TIME SERVING THE STATE UNDER THE 
TSARS.  IF ANY GOOD AT ALL COULD STILL COME OUT OF 
THE REVOLUTION IT WOULD BE TO CREATE A TRUE DIVISION 
BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE IN THIS COUNTRY.\"  ANOTHER 
REASON IS MORE PROSAIC.  WITH THOUSANDS OF BADLY 
DILAPIDATED CHURCHES NOW BEING HANDED OVER TO THE ROC 
ALL OVER THE USSR, LIBERALS BELIEVE THAT ONE MILLION 
RUBLES COULD BE MUCH BETTER SPENT REVIVING WORSHIP 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TYING IT UP IN ONE 
MORE CHURCH IN MOSCOW. 
 
9.  AS HAS BECOME HIS CUSTOM, ROC FOREIGN MINISTER 
ARCHBISHOP KIRILL -- REPUTED TO BE THE SMARTEST MAN 
IN THE ROC -- HAS STAKED OUT A POSITION SOMEWHERE IN 
THE MIDDLE.  HE RECENTLY TOLD POLOFF THAT HE WAS WELL 
AWARE OF THE VARIOUS CONCERNS SURROUNDING PROPOSALS 
TO REBUILD THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL (AND THE SIMILAR 
SITUATION OF THE CHRIST THE SAVIOR CATHEDRAL, BLOWN 
UP AND REPLACED BY AN OUTDOOR PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL). 
HE ADDED THAT HE TOOK THESE CONCERNS SO SERIOUSLY 
THAT HE HAD DELAYED RECOMMENDING OPEN SUPPORT FOR THE 
REBUILDINGS TO PATRIARCH ALEXEI II WHILE HE MET WITH 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT AND WEIGHED THE 
PROS AND CONS. 
 
10.  ARCHBISHOP KIRILL EXPLAINED WHY HE HAD 
EVENTUALLY COME OUT IN FAVOR OF ROC SUPPORT FOR THE 
ENDEAVORS.  FINANCIALLY, HE REALIZED IT MADE SENSE. 
AFTER CANVASSING WOULD-BE DONORS, HE BECAME CONVINCED 
THAT IF THIS OPTION WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY WOULD 
SIMPLY NOT GIVE ANY MONEY AT ALL TO THE ROC: \"WE\'RE 
NOT TAKING ONE MILLION RUBLES AWAY FROM STARVING 
PARISHES; WE\'RE EITHER ACCEPTING OR REJECTING ONE 
MILLION RUBLES.\"  AS FOR THE MORE DELICATE 
NATIONALISM ASPECT, THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT HE HAD 
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS STILL AN OPEN 
QUESTION OF WHO WOULD INFLUENCE WHOM: \"IGNORING THEM 
(CONSERVATIVES AND NATIONALISTS) IS NOT THE ANSWER -- 
BY GETTING INVOLVED, THEY MAY COME TO BELIEVE IN US 
INSTEAD OF WANTING TO USE US.\"

SUMMARY 
/------ 
 
2.  LATVIAN AND LITHUANIAN SPOKESMEN CONFIRMED PRESS 
REPORTS THAT SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY (MVD) SPECIAL 
FORCES HAVE TAKEN OVER THE MAIN PRESS BUILDING IN RIGA 
AND ARE OCCUPYING THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LITHUANIAN 
BRANCH OF THE CPSU IN VILNIUS, REPORTEDLY AT THE 
LATTER\'S REQUEST.  ONE JOURNALIST WAS BEATEN WHEN HE 
TRIED TO STAGE A SIT-DOWN STRIKE IN THE BUILDING AND 
ANOTHER EVICTED BODILY, BUT NO OTHER REPORTS OF 
INJURIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.  THE OCCUPATION OF THE 
PRESS BUILDING BRINGS TO A HEAD A LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE 
BETWEEN THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE 
SMALL BUT VOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY ALLIED WITH SOVIET 
MILITARY FORCES STATIONED IN THE REPUBLIC AND SOVIET 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR SPECIAL FORCES.  IT IS STILL NOT 
CLEAR WHO IS CALLING THE TUNE THOUGH:  THE COMMANDER OF 
THE INTERIOR MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS IN LATVIA 
ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY THAT 
THE OCCUPATION OF THE PRESS BUILDING OCCURED WITHOUT 
HIS KNOWLEDGE OR APPROVAL.  THE COMMANDER OF SPECIAL 
FORCES IN LITHUANIA SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE 
TAKEOVER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY BUILDING THERE.  USSR 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR CONTACTS IN MOSCOW PROVIDED NO 
INFORMATION OR CLARIFICATION ON THE ACTIONS OF TROOPS 
IN RIGA AND VILNIUS. 
 
3.  THE SITUATION IN RIGA IS VERY TENSE, AND THE 
LATVIAN LEADERSHIP IS IN MOSCOW TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE 
SITUATION.  LATVIAN PRESIDENT GORBUNOVS IS MEETING WITH 
GORBACHEV AT 3:00, AND OTHER LATVIAN OFFICIALS ARE 
MEETING WITH USSR MILITARY AND INTERIOR MINISTRY 
OFFICIALS.  THE LITHUANIAN REPRESENTATIVE IN MOSCOW 
APPEARED LESS WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN VILNIUS, 
BUT SAID PRIME MINISTER PRUNSKIENE HAD CUT SHORT A 
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA AND WAS BACK IN VILNIUS FOR 
DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  EMBASSY 
BELIEVES IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR DEPARTMENT PRESS 
SPOKESPERSON TO CALL FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE 
INCIDENTS.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
TAKEOVER OF LATVIAN PRESS BUILDING NOT UNEXPECTED 
/-------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.  LATVIAN PREMREP PRESS SPOKESMAN ARIS JARSONS 
PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON THE TAKEOVER BY 
WHAT APPEAR TO BE SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY SPECIAL 
FORCES (SPETSNAZ) TROOPS OF THE MAIN PRESS BUILDING IN 
RIGA.  THE BUILDING AND PRINTING ENTERPRISE IT HOUSES 
FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY, BUT FOLLOWING 
A LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET DECREE IN DECEMBER, IT WAS 
AUTHORIZED TO BE TURNED INTO AN INDEPENDENT 
WORKER-OWNED JOINT STOCK VENTURE, WITH 20` OF THE STOCK 
TO REMAIN IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S HANDS. SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER, A SMALL NUMBER OF SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY 
FORCES BEGAN TO TAKE UP POSITIONS IN THE BUILDING, BUT 
DID NOT INTEREFERE WITH THE WORKINGS.  ON NEW YEAR\'S 
EVE, LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ALFRED RUBIKS 
APPEARED ON LATVIAN TELEVISION TO PROTEST THE JOINT 
STOCK VENTURE, WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS 
\"EXPROPRIATION\", AND WARNED THAT \"SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO 
PAY\" FOR THIS.  THE FOLLOWING NIGHT (JANUARY 1-2), A 
LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIAL FORCES ARMED WITH AUTOMATIC 
WEAPONS TOOK CONTROL OF THE PRESS BUILDING, SURROUNDED 
THE DIRECTOR DUDNURS, AND PREVENTED HIM FROM ISSUING 
ANY ORDERS TO THE WORKERS. 
 
4.  WORKERS REMAINED IN THE BUILDING THROUGH THE 
MORNING OF JANUARY 2, WHILE A LARGE CROWED ESTIMATED IN 
THE THOUSANDS, ACCORDING TO JARSONS, GATHERED OUTSIDE. 
ALTHOUGH THE MVD TROOPS DID NOT INITIALLY TRY TO EVICT 
THE WORKERS, THEY BEGAN TO GET TOUGHER DURING THE 
COURSE OF THE DAY.  THEY BODILY EVICTED ONE JOURNALIST 
AND BEAT UP ANOTHER WHO TRIED TO ORGANIZE A SIT-DOWN 
STRIKE.  MOREOVER THEY ALLEGEDLY TURNED THEIR MACHINE 
GUNS ON VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL 
DAINIS IVANS WHO SHOWED UP AT THE PRESS BUILDING 
SHORTLY BEFORE NOON, AND TRIED TO ENTER THE BUILDING 
DISPLAYING HIS DEPUTY\'S CREDENTIALS.  NO OTHER REPORTS 
OF INJURIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.  SOVIET SPECIAL FORCES 
NOW OCCUPY EVERY FLOOR OF THE PRESS BUILDING, AND ARE 
PREVENTING LATVIANS FROM ENTERING.  THERE ARE STILL 
CROWDS MILLING IN FRONT OF THE PRESS BUILDING AND THE 
POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE REMAINS STRONG. 
 
 
WHO GAVE THE ORDER? 
/----------------- 
 
THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED NO OFFICIAL 
EXPLANATION FOR THE TAKEOVER OF THE BUILDING, ACCORDING 
TO JARSONS.  THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL CHAIRMAN 
SUMMONED THE COMMANDER OF SOVIET MVD SPECIAL FORCES, TO 
RIGA ON JANUARY 2 FOR AN EXPLANATION.  THE LATTER 
REPORTEDLY SAID THAT THE TAKEOVER WAS CARRIED OUT 
WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT, AND HE REFERRED ALL 
QUESTIONS \"TO MOSCOW\".  THE LITHUANIAN PERMREP IN 
MOSCOW REPORTED A SIMILAR RESPONSE TO HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
EFFORTS TO GET AN EXPLANATION OF THE SPECIAL FORCES 
OCCUPATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY BUILDING IN VILNIUS. 
THE COMMANDER OF THE SPECIAL FORCES REPORTEDLY TOLD THE 
LITHUANIAN LEADERSHIP THAT THE ACTION WAS TAKEN WITHOUT 
HIS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE.  IN ADDITION, EMBASSY\'S 
EFFORTS TO CONTACT THE USSR MINISTRY OF INTERIOR FOR 
CLARIFICATION OF INTERIOR MINISTER PUGO\'S REPORTED 
REMARKS THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE INCIDENT IN RIGA AND 
HAD NOT AUTHORIZED THE USE OF SPECIAL TROOPS WERE 
UNAVAILING. 
 
 
GORBUNOV TO MEET GORBACHEV TODAY 
/------------------------------- 
 
THE LATVIAN LEADERSHIP FLEW TO TO MOSCOW TO TRY TO 
RESOLVE THE SITUATION.  PRESIDENT OF THE LATVIAN 
SUPREME COUNCIL GORBUNOVS HAD A 3:00 PM MOSCOW TIME 
MEETING WITH GORBACHEV.  PRIME MINISTER GODMANIS IS 
MEETING WITH GENERAL MOISEYEV, AND OTHER SENIOR LATVIAN 
OFFICIALS ARE MEETING WITH INTERIOR MINISTER PUGO TO 
DEFUSE THE CURRENT SITUATION.  THE TAKEOVER OF THE 
PRESS BUILDING IN RIGA CULMINATES MONTHS OF GROWING 
TENSION IN THE CAPITAL AND FEARS BY THE LATVIAN AND 
OTHER BALTIC GOVERNMENTS THAT THE USSR WOULD RESORT TO 
MILITARY FORCE OR DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL RULE -- INCLUDING 
REPLACEMENT OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENTS BY OFFICIALS 
SUBSERVIENT TO MOSCOW -- TO FORCE THE BALTICS TO ABJURE 
THEIR INDEPENDENCE CLAIMS.  IN LATVIA, THE DISPUTE HAS 
PITTED THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE ONE SIDE, AGAINST 
THE SMALL BUT VOCAL LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ALLIED WITH 
LOCAL SOVIET MILITARY COMMANDERS AND SOVIET INTERIOR 
MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES.  THE DISPUTE WAS FUELED BY THE 
DECISION OF THE BALTIC DISTRICT MILITARY COMMANDER TO 
HOLD THE NOVEMBER 7 MILITARY PARADE IN RIGA, DESPITE 
THE EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE LATVIAN SUPREME COUNCIL. 
THE LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET RESPONDED WITH A NOVEMBER 14 
DECREE ANNOUNCING THAT THE REPUBLIC WOULD NO LONGER 
PROVIDE MATERIAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO SOVIET FORCES 
STATIONED ON ITS TERRITORY, AND RESTRICTING THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THE LATVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY. 
 
THE DECREE PROVOKED A STRONG REACTION FROM MOSCOW: 
GORBACHEV SINGLED IT OUT FOR CRITICISM IN HIS NOVEMBER 
15 SUPREME SOVIET SPEECH, AND SOME LATVIAN DEPUTIES 
CLAIM IT WAS A MAJOR FACTOR BEHIND GORBACHEV\'S DECISION 
TO GIVE THE MILITARY GREATER LEEWAY TO DEAL WITH 
ATTACKS ON THEIR FORCES IN THE REPUBLICS (YAZOV\'S 
NOVEMBER    SPEECH).  ALTHOUGH THE DECREE HAS NOT BEEN 
PUT INTO EFFECT, AND HAS NO LEGAL STATUS BECAUSE 
SUPREME COUNCIL PRESIDENT GORBUNOVS REFUSED TO SIGN IT, 
IT HAS NEVERTHELESS BECOME A MAJOR SOURCE OF IRRITATION 
BETWEEN MOSCOW AND RIGA, ACCORDING TO BOTH SOVIET AND 
LATVIAN SOURCES.  MOREOVER, A SERIES OF FIREBOMBINGS IN 
THE REPUBLIC, ALTERNATING BETWEEN SOVIET MILITARY OR 
COMMUNIST PARTY FACILITIES AND LATVIAN NATIONAL 
MONUMENTS (REF A) HAS ALSO HEIGHTENED TENSIONS OVER THE 
SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REPUBLIC.  ALTHOUGH NO 
ONE HAS BEEN HURT SO FAR, THE REPUBLIC LEADERSHIP, 
ACCORDING TO PETERS, IS CONCERNED THAT THE INCIDENTS 
ARE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES 
AND COULD PROVOKE GORBACHEV TO IMPOSE PRESIDENTIAL RULE 
IN THE REPUBLIC. 
 
 
LATVIA PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS ON STATUS OF FORCES 
/-------------------------------------------- --- 
 
ON NOVEMBER 18, LATVIAN PERMREP IN MOSCOW JANIS PETERS 
(PROTECT) WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE LATVIAN SUPREME SOVIET 
TO PROPOSE TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATIONS ON A 
STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT ON SOVIET TROOPS STATIONED 
IN LATVIA.  HE TOLD EMBOFF THAT HE MET WITH 
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL MEMBER YAKOVLEV, WHO PROMISED TO 
CONVEY THE PROPOSAL TO GORBACHEV.  YAKOVLEV NEVER 
PROVIDED A FORMAL SOVIET RESPONSE TO THE LATVIAN 
OFFER.  HOWEVER, IN A CORRIDOR CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF 
DURING THE FOURTH CONGRESS OF PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES IN LATE 
DECEMBER, PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL MEMBER GRIGORIY REVENKO 
(PROTECT) TOLD EMBOFF THAT THE LATVIAN PROPOSAL WAS NOT 
WITHOUT MERIT, BUT THAT SUCH TALKS COULD ONLY TAKE 
PLACE AFTER THE REFERENDUM ON THE TREATY OF THE UNION. 
REVENKO ASSERTED THAT BALTIC ASSERTIONS THAT THE USSR 
WOULD IMPOSE PRESIDENTIAL RULE IN THE REPUBLICS WAS 
PURELY POLITICAL PRESSURE TACTICS. 
 
 
LITHUANIANS SOMEWHAT LESS CONCERNED 
/---------------------------------- 
 
LITHUANIAN PERMREP IN MOSCOW BICKAUSKAS (PROTECT) 
CONFIRMED THAT WHAT APPEAR TO BE SOVIET INTERIOR 
MINISTRY SPECIAL FORCES HAVE ALSO OCCUPIED THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN VILNIUS, 
REPORTEDLY AT THE LATTER\'S REQUEST, AND FORCED OUT THE 
LITHUANIAN MILITIA.  BICKAUSKAS, WHO RETURNED FROM 
VILNIUS YESTERDAY, SAID THAT THE COMMANDER OF SPECIAL 
FORCES REPORTEDLY TOLD THE REPUBLIC\'S LEADERSHIP THAT 
THAT THE OCCUPATION WAS CARRIED OUT WITHOUT HIS 
KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. 
 
BICKAUSKAS, WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT 
THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WAS PLANNING TO IMPOSE ANOTHER 
ECONOMIC BLOCKADE OR DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL RULE, 
CAUTIONED THAT THE SITUATION IN VILNIUS \"SHOULD NOT BE 
OVERLY DRAMATIZED\".  THE LITHUANIAN SUPREME COUNCIL IS 
MEETING TO DECIDE WHAT STEPS TO TAKE, BUT DID NOT FEEL 
THAT THE SITUATION WAS AT A CRISIS STAGE, AND HAD NO 
PLANS TO SEND REPRESENTATIVES TO MOSCOW TO TALK TO THE 
SOVIET LEADERSHIP.  NEVERTHELESS, PRIME MINISTER 
PRUNSKIENE CUT SHORT A VISIT TO AUSTRALIA TO RETURN TO 
VILNIUS.  BICKAUSKAS WAS CALLED ON HIS DIRECT LINE TO 
THE KREMLIN TO ATTEND THE 3:00 MEETING WITH GORBACHEV, 
BUT DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY 
VILNIUS TO ATTEND. 
 
COMMENT 
/------ 
 
THE LATVIAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO ITS SPOKESMAN, 
APPEARS TO BE MOST ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
EVENTS GETTING OUT OF HAND, AND IS CLEARLY DETERMINED 
TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM AT WHAT IT BELIEVES TO BE THE 
SOURCE -- MOSCOW.  WHETHER THE EVENTS IN RIGA HAVE BEEN 
ORCHESTRATED FROM MOSCOW OR NOT, THERE IS A REAL RISK 
OF GROWING VIOLENCE WHICH WILL NOT BE AMENABLE TO 
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION.  WE, THEREFORE, SUGGEST THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON MAKE A STATEMENT URGING THAT 
THE SITUATION BE RESOLVED BY MEANS OF TALKS WITHOUT 
RESORT TO VIOLENCE. 
 
 
LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUMMARY 
/------ 
 
2.  DURING A MARCH 31 - APRIL 3 TRIP TO TBILISI, 
POLOFF RELAYED THE TALKING POINTS IN REF A TO 
GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN GAMSAKHURDIA AND 
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEKING A MECHANISM FOR 
PEACEFUL DIALOGUE TO RESOLVE THE MANY PROBLEMS 
GEORGIA FACES.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT HE HAD 
BEEN FORCED TO TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY HARSH MEASURES 
AGAINST THE OSSETIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LEAGUE 
WITH MOSCOW.  GAMSAKHURDIA EXPLAINED THAT THE CENTER 
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE TO FORCE 
GEORGIA TO SUCCUMB TO ITS WISHES AND NOW MOSCOW WAS 
RESORTING TO POLITICAL SABOTAGE.  GAMSAKHURDIA 
CLAIMED THAT THE CENTER WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THE 
REPUBLIC\'S CITIZENS HAD VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR 
GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE MARCH 31 REFERENDUM.  HE 
FELT THAT MOSCOW WOULD MAKE FURTHER EFFORTS TO 
PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION AS A PRETEXT FOR IMPOSING 
PRESIDENTIAL RULE IN GEORGIA.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO SAID 
HE FELT BETRAYED BY YEL\'TSIN BECAUSE THE RSFSR LEADER 
HAD RENOUNCED THE AGREEMENT THEY HAD SIGNED EARLIER 
IN MARCH.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF THREE REPORTS ON 
POLITICS IN SOVIET GEORGIA.  THIS CABLE FOCUSES ON 
GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CONFRONTATION WITH THE CENTER OVER 
SOUTH OSSETIA AND RELATIONS WITH OTHER REPUBLICS. 
THE SECOND REPORT DEALS WITH GEORGIA\'S INTERNAL 
POLITICS.  THE THIRD WILL COVER A TRIP POLOFF MADE TO 
A KGB PRISON AND A CONVERSATION WITH THE LAWYER OF 
THE IMPRISONED OSSETIAN LEADER KULUNBEGOV. 
 
A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR GAMSAKHURDIA 
/------------------------------- 
 
4. POLOFF ARRIVED IN GEORGIA LATE ON MARCH 31, THE 
DAY OF THE REFERENDUM ON GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE AND 
ALSO GAMSAKHURDIA\'S BIRTHDAY.  GAMSAKHURDIA SENT 
GEORGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GEORGIY KHOSHTARIA TO THE 
AIRPORT TO GREET POLOFF AND WHISK HER AWAY TO A 
BIRTHDAY/REFERENDUM CELEBRATION HELD AT AN OPULENT 
GOVERNMENT HOUSE OVERLOOKING THE CITY.  MANY OF 
GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CLOSEST FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WERE IN 
ATTENDANCE INCLUDING FOREIGN MINISTER KHOSHTARIA, 
PRIME MINISTER TENGIZ SIGUA, AND ALL OF THE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF HIS GOVERNMENT. 
 
5.  THE PRELIMINARY REFERENDUM RETURNS WERE ANNOUNCED 
AS THEY CAME IN.  WITH EACH NEW ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT 
THE OVERWHELMING VOTE IN VARIOUS REGIONS IN FAVOR OF 
INDEPENDENCE, THE CELEBRANTS MADE MORE TOASTS AND 
BECAME ALMOST DELIRIOUS WITH THEIR VICTORY.  THE 
BANQUET WAS LAID OUT IN TYPICAL GEORGIAN FASHION WITH 
PLATES FULL OF GEORGIAN DELICACIES AND FREE-FLOWING 
LIQUOR OF ALL SORTS.  POLOFF ARRIVED RATHER LATE INTO 
THE CELEBRATION AND GAMSAKHURDIA WAS ALREADY INTO HIS 
SECOND ROUND OF TOASTS OFFERED TO MOST OF HIS MANY 
GUESTS.  THE TOASTS WERE INTERSPERSED WITH TYPICAL 
GEORGIAN SINGING WHICH CONSISTS OF A FOUR-PART 
HARMONY A CAPPELLA.  ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING 
TOASTS OFFERED BY THE MINISTER OF FINANCE BEGAN WITH 
REGRET THAT GEORGIA WAS REMEMBERED ONLY AS STALIN\'S 
BIRTHPLACE. 
 
6.  PRIME MINISTER SIGUA (PROTECT) SAT NEXT TO POLOFF 
AND TOLD HER THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA THAT GAMSAKHURDIA 
ATTEND THE MARCH 16 DINNER IN MOSCOW WITH SECRETARY 
BAKER.  SIGUA SAID THE CENTER HAD DISCOURAGED ALL 
REPUBLIC LEADERS FROM ATTENDING AND THAT WAS WHY 
GAMSAKHURDIA HAD ARRIVED AFTER ANNOUNCING OVER THE 
TELEPHONE THAT HE WAS NOT COMING.  SIGUA SAID THAT 
GORBACHEV HAD SUCCESSFULLY PRESSURED MOST OF THE 
OTHER REPUBLIC LEADERS TO DECLINE THE SECRETARY\'S 
INVITATION. 
 
GEORGIA\'S DISPUTE WITH THE CENTER INTENSIFIES 
/-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  POLOFF MET WITH GAMSAKHURDIA SEVERAL TIMES DURING 
THE VISIT TO DISCUSS GEORGIAN POLITICS AND THE 
DEVELOPING POLITICAL DRAMA BETWEEN GEORGIA AND 
MOSCOW.  POLOFF DREW ON POINTS OUTLINED IN REF A 
DURING DISCUSSIONS WITH GAMSAKHURDIA AND EMPHASIZED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING A PEACEFUL MECHANISM FOR 
THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES.  GAMSAKHURDIA FELT THAT 
HE HAD OFFERED MORE THAN ONCE TO RESOLVE HIS DISPUTES 
WITH THE CENTER THROUGH PEACEFUL DIALOGUE BUT WAS 
REBUFFED BY MOSCOW.  HE RECOUNTED SEVERAL RECENT 
CONFRONTATIONS WITH USSR LEADERS OVER THE UNION 
TREATY, SOUTH OSSETIA, AND THE GEORGIAN MVD. 
 
8.  GAMSAKHURDIA REFERRED TO A FEBRUARY 25 
CONVERSATION WITH GORBACHEV IN WHICH THE SOVIET 
LEADER REPORTEDLY WARNED GAMSAKHURDIA THAT IF HE DID 
NOT SIGN THE UNION TREATY, GEORGIA WOULD FACE EVEN 
MORE VIOLENCE AND POLITICAL UNREST.  HE ALSO SHOWED 
POLOFF COPIES OF TELEGRAMS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM 
MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS BORIS PUGO AND GORBACHEV 
WARNING HIM TO COMPLY WITH USSR DECREES OR FACE THE 
CONSEQUENCES.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE STILL HAS NO 
INTENTION OF SENDING EVEN OBSERVERS TO THE UNION 
TREATY NEGOTIATIONS AND THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET 
WOULD NOT EVEN BE DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT. 
 
9.  ON APRIL 7, THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET PRESIDIUM 
PASSED A RESOLUTION PROTESTING THE ADDITION OF 
FURTHER SOVIET TROOPS IN SOUTH OSSETIA AS A \"RUDE 
VIOLATION OF GEORGIAN SOVEREIGNTY,\" ACCORDING TO 
GEORGIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER GEORGIY KHONELIDZE 
(PROTECT), WHO CALLED POLOFF THAT SAME DAY.  THE 
RESOLUTION DECRIES THE USE OF TROOPS AGAINST SOCIETY 
AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE CENTER WOULD REFRAIN 
FROM FURTHER DESTABLIZING THE SITUATION IN THE 
REPUBLIC.  THE RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS FOR A PEACEFUL 
DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE OSSETIAN 
PROBLEM.  THE RESOLUTION EMPHASIZED GEORGIA\'S INTENT 
TO LEGALLY SEEK INDEPENDENCE AND INITIATE DIRECT 
ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH THE 
RSFSR, ARMENIA, AZERBAYDZHAN AND OTHER REPUBLICS. 
KHONELIDZE ALSO TOLD POLOFF THAT GEORGIA\'S WORKERS 
WERE PREPARING TO CALL FOR A GENERAL STRIKE IN 
SUPPORT OF THE MINERS AS A RESULT OF THE PRICE RISES 
AND CONTINUED PARTIAL ECONOMIC BLOCKADE. 
 
GAMSAKHURDIA SEES CENTER\'S HAND IN SOUTH OSSETIA 
/-------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT THE CENTER WAS 
FUELING THE OSSETIAN PROBLEM AND THAT GORBACHEV HAD 
REFUSED TO ENGAGE IN ANY KIND OF DIALOGUE ON THE 
PROBLEM.  THE GEORGIAN LEADER ACCUSED USSR COUNCIL OF 
NATIONALITIES CHAIRMAN RAFIK NISHANOV OF 
MASTERMINDING THE CENTER\'S MANIPULATION OF OSSETIA. 
GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT ARRESTING OSSETIAN LEADER 
KULUNBEGOV WAS \"THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE BLOODSHED 
AND DEFUSE THE SITUATION.\" (SEE SEPTEL FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION ON KULUNBEGOV\'S DETENTION.) 
 
11.  GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT GEORGIA WOULD BE 
WILLING TO ALLOW THE OSSETIANS TO HOLD A REFERENDUM 
ON AUTONOMY BUT ONLY AFTER GEORGIA ACHIEVED 
INDEPENDENCE.  HE SAID THAT NOW THEY COULD NOT BE 
SURE WHETHER THE OSSETIANS GENUINELY WANTED POLITICAL 
AUTONOMY OR WHETHER THEY WERE BEING DRIVEN BY THE 
CENTER TO DEMAND THIS AUTONOMY.  AS IN PAST 
CONVERSATIONS (REFS C-E), HE ROUTINELY REFERRED TO 
THE OSSETIANS AND THEIR LEADERS AS \"CRIMINALS\" AND 
\"TERRORISTS.\"  HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAD ORDERED AN END 
TO THE GEORGIAN BLOCKADE OF TSKHINVALI BUT THAT 
\"BANDS OF CRIMINALS\" CONTINUED TO SABOTAGE THE 
OSSETIANS. 
 
12.  WHEN POLOFF SUGGESTED THAT INNOCENT OSSETIANS, 
SUCH AS TSKHINVALI\'S CHILDREN, MIGHT BE SUFFERING, 
GAMSAKHURDIA AGAIN BLAMED THE OSSETIANS FOR THE 
PROBLEM.  HE CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT THIS FATE 
UPON THEMSELVES BY CONTINUING TO DEMAND AUTONOMY.  HE 
ALSO ASSERTED THAT \"BANDS OF OSSETIAN CRIMINALS\" WERE 
FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER --A POINT THE OSSETIANS 
DENY. 
 
13.  ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 2, POLOFF SAT WITH 
GAMSAKHURDIA IN HIS OFFICE IN THE GEORGIAN SUPREME 
SOVIET AND WATCHED THE SOVIET NEWS PROGRAM \"VREMYA\" 
WHICH WAS FEATURING AN ITEM ON THE VIOLENCE IN 
TSKHINVALI.  \"THEY ARE ANGRY BECAUSE WE HAD SUCH AN 
OVERWHELMING VICTORY IN THE REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE.  NOW THEY ARE PREPARING THE GROUND TO 
SEND IN TROOPS TO TAKE OVER OSSETIA AND MAYBE THE 
REPUBLIC,\" HE SAID. 
 
14.  THOSE WORDS PROVED TO BE PROPHETIC BECAUSE 
GORBACHEV BEGAN TO SEND IN ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO SOUTH 
OSSETIA THE NEXT DAY.  ON ALRIL 3, GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD 
POLOFF HE HAD SPOKEN TO USSR SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN 
LUK\'YANOV BY TELEPHONE ABOUT THE TROOPS BEING SENT TO 
SOUTH OSSETIA.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE HAD WARNED 
LUK\'YANOV THAT MORE TROOPS WOULD INCREASE BLOODSHED 
IN THE REGION AND THAT HE AND GORBACHEV WOULD BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS BLOODSHED.  LUK\'YANOV REPLIED 
THAT HE WOULD PASS THIS MESSAGE TO GORBACHEV. 
LUK\'YANOV ALSO TOLD GAMSAKHURDIA THAT THE RSFSR 
CONGRESS\' RESOLUTION CALLING ON GORBACHEV TO \"TAKE 
URGENT MEASURES TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IN SOUTH 
OSSETIA\" HAD HEAVILY INFLUENCED GORBACHEV\'S DECISION 
TO SEND MORE TROOPS.  GAMSAKHURDIA ASKED LUK\'YANOV, 
\"WHAT RIGHT DOES THE RSFSR HAVE TO TELL THE CENTER 
WHAT TO DO IN GEORGIA?\"  THE GEORGIAN LEADER SAID HE 
CONSIDERED THIS INTERFERENCE IN GEORGIA\'S INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS.  HE SAID LUK\'YANOV HAD NO ANSWER AND WAS 
SILENT. 
 
15.  GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT ACCORDING TO THE 
GEORGIAN MVD COMMANDANT IN TSKHINVALI, THE CENTER 
PLANNED TO SEND IN THE DZHERZHINSKIY DIVISION TO 
IMPOSE ORDER IN SOUTH OSSETIA.  THIYSPARTICULAR 
DIVISION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRUTAL TREATMENT OF 
AZERBAYDZHANIS IN BAKU IN JANUARY 1990. 
 
16.  GAMSAKHURDIA CLAIMED THAT THE CENTER WAS 
FUNNELING WEAPONS THROUGH THE SOVIET ARMY TO THE 
OSSETIANS.  HE TOOK POLOFF TO A ROOM WITH A DISPLAY 
OF SOVIET ARMY WEAPONS ALLEGEDLY CONFISCATED FROM THE 
OSSETIANS.  THE GEORGIAN LEADER ALSO SHOWED POLOFF A 
ROCKET WHICH ALLEGEDLY HAD BEEN USED IN AN ATTACK ON 
A GEORGIAN VILLAGE NEAR TSKHINVALI.  THE ROCKET HAD 
KILLED A GEORGIAN FAMILY OF FIVE AND WAS THE SAME 
TYPE USED IN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, ACCORDING TO A 
GEORGIAN VETERAN OF THAT WAR.  GAMSAKHURDIA USED THIS 
EXHIBIT TO ILLUSTRATE THAT OSSETIANS WERE NOT THE 
ONLY ONES SUFFERING IN THIS CONFRONTATION.  THE 
GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO HAD SEVERAL GEORGIAN 
REFUGEES FROM TSKHINVALI ON DISPLAY IN THE LOBBY OF 
THE INTOURIST HOTEL IVERIA WITH SIGNS WRITTEN ONLY IN 
ENGLISH PROTESTING OSSETIAN ACTS AGAINST GEORGIA. 
ALTHOUGH THE REFUGEES\' SUFFERING APPEARED TO BE 
GENUINE, THEIR USE AS PAWNS IN A POLITICAL PROPAGANDA 
GAME WAS OBVIOUS AND A BIT CRUDE. 
 
17.  INTERESTINGLY, GEORGIAN REPUBLIC OPPOSITION 
LEADERS ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE OSSETIANS ARE \"TOOLS OF 
THE KGB\" AND THAT OSSETIAN LEADER CHOCHIYEV IS A KGB 
OFFICER.  LIKE GAMSAKHURDIA, THE GEORGIAN NATIONAL 
CONGRESS LEADERS BELIEVE THAT OSSETIANS SHOULD BE 
GRANTED CULTURAL BUT NOT POLITICAL AUTONOMY. 
 
ECONOMIC PRESSURE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST GEORGIA 
/-------------------------------------------- 
 
18.  GAMSAKHURDIA ASSERTED THAT THE CENTER\'S ATTEMPTS 
TO USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE AGAINST GEORGIA HAD FAILED 
FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  HE SAID THAT GEORGIA HAD BEEN 
ABLE TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE CENTER\'S ATTEMPTS TO 
USE ECONOMIC PRESSURE BY THREATENING TO CLOSE THE 
REPUBLIC\'S RAILWAYS AND PORTS.  HE SAID THAT THIS 
TACTIC HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE DURING THE REPUBLIC\'S 
DISPUTES WITH MOSCOW LAST SUMMER WHEN GEORGIA WAS 
ABLE TO FORCE THE CENTER TO GIVE INTO ITS DEMANDS ON 
SOVEREIGNTY.  GAMSAKHURDIA POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE 
OF THE ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI CONFLICT, GEORGIA\'S 
RAILWAYS WERE THE ONLY ONES FULLY FUNCTIONING IN THE 
CAUCASUS AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTED A CRITICAL 
TRANSPORTATION LINK TO THE REST OF THE USSR. 
GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO POINTED OUT THAT MANY SOVIET 
MILITARY FAMILIES LIVED IN GEORGIA AND THEY TOO WOULD 
SUFFER FROM ANY MORE SHORTAGES OF FOOD AND ENERGY. 
IN ADDITION, THE NON-GEORGIANS IN THE REPUBLIC WOULD 
PAY A PRICE FOR ANY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS OR DEPRIVATION 
IMPOSED ON GEORGIA. 
 
19.  GAMSAKHURDIA OBSERVED THAT THE ECONOMIC WEAPON 
WAS NOT GEORGIAN-SPECIFIC AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE 
USED EFFECTIVELY TO STEM GEORGIAN NATIONALISM AND THE 
DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENCE.  HE MAINTAINED THAT THE 
CENTER WAS MORE LIKELY TO USE A COMBINATION OF 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY PRESSURE SUCH AS IMPOSING 
PRESIDENTIAL RULE, INSTEAD OF ECONOMIC THREATS WHICH 
HAD PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. 
 
BETRAYED BY YEL\'TSIN 
/------------------- 
 
20.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE COULD NO LONGER TRUST RSFSR 
LEADER BORIS YEL\'TSIN \"BECAUSE ONE DAY HE SAYS ONE 
THING AND THE NEXT DAY HE SAYS THE OPPOSITE.\" 
GAMSAKHURDIA WAS REFERRING TO THE PROTOCOL HE HAD 
SIGNED WITH YEL\'TSIN ON MARCH 23.  THE PROTOCOL 
STIPULATED RSFSR-GEORGIAN COOPERATION IN QUELLING THE 
OSSETIAN CONFLICT WITHOUT THE CENTER\'S INTERFERENCE. 
THE PROTOCOL ALSO CALLED FOR CLOSER POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLICS IN THE 
FUTURE.  GAMSAKHURDIA AND OTHER GEORGIAN OFFICIALS 
SUCH AS GEORGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER KHOSHTARIA ON 
PREVIOUS OCCASIONS HAD EMPHASIZED THE GREAT 
IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROTOCOL FOR GEORGIA\'S FUTURE (REF 
B). 
 
21.  GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT YEL\'TSIN WAS 
\"FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE IN THE RSFSR 
CONGRESS AND HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS AGREEMENT WITH US 
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL FUTURE.\"  THE 
GEORGIAN LEADER SAID YEL\'TSIN HAD REJECTED THE 
PROTOCOL AS A SOP TO THE RSFSR COMMUNIST PARTY. 
GAMSAKHURDIA CONTINUED TO LAMBAST YEL\'TSIN AND HIS 
PERSONAL CHARACTER SAYING THAT THE RSFSR LEADER IS A 
\"DRUNKARD AND OBVIOUSLY UNTRUSTWORTHY.\"  \"YEL\'TSIN 
WILL DO ANYTHING TO SAVE HIS SKIN,\" GAMSAKHURDIA 
SAID.  INTERESTINGLY, ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE, 
GAMSAKHURDIA HAD BEEN SINGING YEL\'TSIN\'S PRAISES AND 
STRESSING THAT YEL\'TSIN WAS THE SOVIET UNION\'S ONLY 
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO CRITICIZED 
USSR PEOPLE\'S DEPUTY GALINA STAROVOYTOVA FOR HER ROLE 
IN BACKING THE SOUTH OSSETIANS\' CAUSE.

SUBJECT:  BYZANTINE POLITICS THRIVE IN SOVIET GEORGIA 
 
REF:  MOSCOW 10336 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
SUMMARY 
/------ 
 
2.  DURING A MARCH 31 - APRIL 3 TRIP TO TBILISI, 
POLOFF MET WITH GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN 
ZVIAD GAMSAKHURDIA (PROTECT), OPPOSITION LEADERS, AND 
OTHER REPUBLIC RESIDENTS TO SORT OUT THE BYZANTINE 
POLITICS OF GEORGIA WHERE ACCUSATIONS FLY FREELY, 
ENEMIES ARE MADE EASILY, AND VIOLENT CONFRONTATION 
OCCURS DAILY.  DURING THE PAST MONTH GAMSAKHURDIA HAS 
MOVED TO CONCENTRATE MOST REPUBLIC POWERS IN HIS 
HANDS THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PREFECTURE SYSTEM AND 
A REPUBLIC PRESIDENCY.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTS THAT 
SUCH STEPS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CENTER IS 
WORKING WITH HIS ENEMIES -- THE NATIONAL CONGRESS AND 
THE SOUTH OSSETIANS -- TO UNDERMINE HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
POSITION.  OPPOSITION LEADERS FROM THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS ACCUSE GAMSAKHURDIA OF DEPRIVING THEM OF 
THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND WORKING WITH THE CENTER 
AGAINST THE GEORGIAN PEOPLE.  VIRTUALLY ALL SIDES 
CLAIM THE OTHER SIDES ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THE KGB. 
IN ADDITION, EACH SIDE, INCLUDING GAMSAKHURDIA\'S 
ROUND TABLE, HAS ITS OWN PARAMILITARY GROUP OR GROUPS 
WHICH LAUNCH FREQUENT ATTACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THIS IS THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE CABLES ON 
POLITICS IN SOVIET GEORGIA.  THIS FIRST REPORT (REF) 
DEALT WITH GAMSAKHURDIA\'S CONFRONTATION WITH THE 
CENTER AND THE SOUTH OSSETIANS.  THE THIRD WILL COVER 
A TRIP POLOFF MADE TO A KGB PRISON AND A CONVERSATION 
WITH THE IMPRISONED OSSETIAN LEADER KULUMBEGOV\'S 
LAWYER. 
 
GEORGIAN POLITICS:  ETERNAL PLOTS AND COUNTER-PLOTS 
/-------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.  GEORGIAN POLITICS REMAIN TRUE TO THEIR BYZANTINE 
HERITAGE AND APPEAR SOMEWHAT BIZARRE TO MOST 
OUTSIDERS.  MOST OF THE RELATIVELY SMALL REPUBLIC\'S 
LEADERS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE CHILDHOOD AND 
HAVE BUILT AN INTRICATE WEB OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES 
THROUGH THE YEARS.  GEORGIAN POLITICS ARE HIGHLY 
EMOTIONAL AND LOGIC IS OFTEN CAST ASIDE IN FAVOR OF 
INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AND HIGH DRAMA.  ACCUSATIONS OF 
KGB MEMBERSHIP, BETRAYAL, COLLUSION WITH MOSCOW, AND 
CLINICAL INSANITY ARE TRADED WITH EQUAL VENOM FROM 
ALL SIDES.  THE STORIES BECOME ENHANCED WITH TIME AND 
QUICKLY TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE TWISTED AND 
BEWILDERING LORE OF GEORGIAN POLITICAL HISTORY. 
POLOFF HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC FREQUENTLY DURING THE 
PAST TWO YEARS AND OCCASIONALLY DURING THE PAST 
DECADE AND HAS NEVER FAILED TO BE INTRIGUED BY THE 
PECULIAR BRAND OF POLITICS GEORGIANS PRACTICE. 
 
5.  VENDETTAS, PARTICULARLY IN RETALIATION FOR PUBLIC 
CRITICISM, ARE QUITE COMMON IN GEORGIA.  GEORGIANS 
ARE QUICK TO TAKE UMBRAGE AND TURN ON ANY CRITICAL 
PARTIES.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE GEORGIAN FLARE FOR 
DRAMA AND HYPERBOLE SOMETIMES LEAD TO RATHER 
STARTLING ACCUSATIONS.  GEORGIAN POLITICAL LEADERS, 
ESPECIALLY GAMSAKHURDIA, HAVE TRIED TO APPLY THESE 
TACTICS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD WITH DISASTROUS PUBLIC 
RELATIONS RESULTS.  GAMSAKHURDIA, FOR EXAMPLE, 
RECENTLY LABELLED RADIO LIBERTY AND THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL \"INSTRUMENTS OF THE KREMLIN\" BECAUSE THEY 
CRITICIZED HIM.  WHEN POLOFF POINTED OUT THAT THIS 
WAS NOT EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION WITH THE KREMLIN, 
GAMSAKHURDIA APPEARED SURPRISED.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO 
HAS MADE MANY OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AGAINST HIS MAJOR 
OPPOSITION, THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.  THESE CLAIMS 
INCLUDE BEARING OR FATHERING ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN, 
COLLUSION WITH IRAQ IN THE GULF WAR, AND OTHER 
APOCRYPHAL ACCUSATIONS. 
 
6.  THE OPPOSITION REACTS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY. 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER GHIA CHANTURIA 
(PROTECT) HAD EQUALLY OUTRAGEOUS STORIES ABOUT HOW 
GAMSAKHURDIA WAS ACTUALLY COLLUDING WITH THE CENTER, 
PARTICULARLY THE KGB, AGAINST THE GEORGIAN PEOPLE. 
IN ADDITION, CHANTURIA AND HIS WIFE AMD FELLOW 
POLITICAL ACTIVIST, IRINA SARISHVILI (PROTECT), WHO 
WERE ONCE FELLOW DISSIDENTS WITH GAMSAKHURDIA, SHOWED 
POLOFF ALLEGED OFFICIAL PROOF OF GAMSAKHURDIA\'S 
INSANITY.  THE \"PROOF\" CONSISTED OF A \"SECRET\" 
CERTIFICATE FROM A PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC WHERE 
GAMSAKHURDIA WAS CONFINED WHEN HE WAS A POLITICAL 
PRISONER.  WHEN POLOFF ASKED WHERE THEY HAD OBTAINED 
THESE AND OTHER DOCUMENTS, CHANTURIA REPLIED THAT 
FORMER KGB MEMBERS HAD PASSED THE DOCUMENTS TO THEM 
IN FRANCE LAST YEAR. 
 
7.  LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES ARE BURIED IN EACH SIDE\'S 
LITANY OF ACCUSATIONS AND COMPLAINTS.  GREAT EFFORT 
AND MUCH PATIENCE, HOWEVER, IS REQUIRED TO MINE THESE 
NUGGETS OF TRUTH FROM THE TANGLED TERRAIN OF GEORGIAN 
POLITICS.  CONSISTENCY IS NOT A HIGHLY REGARDED 
VIRTUE WHEN IT COMES TO STATISTICS AND AN INTERVIEWER 
WILL OFTEN RECEIVE WILDLY FLUCTUATING ESTIMATES FROM 
THE SAME PERSON IN THE COURSE OF A SINGLE DAY.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, GAMSAKHURDIA ESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF 
GEORGIAN MVD PERSONNEL AT 10,000 ONE MORNING AND 
20,000 LATER THAT DAY.  NATIONAL CONGRESS LEADERS 
EXHIBITED THE SAME CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARD 
STATISTICS BY CHANGING THEIR ESTIMATES OF MEMBERSHIP 
BY SEVERAL THOUSAND ON EACH OF THE THREE OCCASIONS 
POLOFF SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE TRIP. 
 
SPRINGTIME FOR GAMSAKHURDIA 
/-------------------------- 
 
8.  ON APRIL 14, GAMSAKHURDIA HELD AN EMERGENCY 
SESSION OF THE GEORGIAN PARLIAMENT, WHICH CREATED A 
REPUBLIC PRESIDENCY WITH SWEEPING POWERS AND 
UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED GAMSAKHURDIA PRESIDENT UNTIL 
REPUBLIC-WIDE ELECTIONS ON MAY 26.  DURING A 
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THAT SAME DAY, GAMSAKHURDIA 
TOLD POLOFF THAT HE REQUIRED SUCH POWERS TO BRING 
ORDER TO THE REPUBLIC AND ROUT THE CENTER\'S 
ACCOMPLICES.  THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE PRESIDENCY, 
GAMSAKHURDIA HAS GAINED VIRTUALLY UNRESTRAINED 
POWER.  ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLIC LAW ON THE PRESIDENCY 
STIPULATES THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE PARLIAMENT CAN 
IMPEACH HIM AT ANY TIME, GAMSAKHURDIA HAS THE PRESENT 
GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET FIRMLY UNDER HIS CONTROL. 
 
9.  GAMSAKHURDIA WILL PROBABLY WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS ON MAY 26.  HE PROBABLY SET AN EARLY DATE 
FOR THE ELECTIONS SO THAT THE FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION 
WOULD NOT HAVE TIME TO PREPARE AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN. 
WHILE GAMSAKHURDIA CERTAINLY HAS AUTHORITARIAN 
TENDENCIES, HE IS ALSO QUITE POPULAR -- AS EVEN HIS 
RIVALS WILL ADMIT.  HE IS STILL ABLE TO DRAW LARGE 
CROWDS AND GEORGIANS, WHO ARE QUITE NATIONALISTIC, 
REVERE HIM FOR HIS MANY YEARS AS A POLITICAL 
DISSIDENT AND HIS STRONG CHALLENGES TO THE CENTER. 
HIS MARCH 31 REFERENDUM ON GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE WAS 
A RESOUNDING SUCCESS AS EVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE 
NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTICIPATED AND VOTED IN FAVOR OF 
REPUBLIC INDEPENDENCE.  ONE OF THE POSTERS URGING 
REPUBLIC CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM 
BORE A PHOTOGRAPH OF GAMSAKHURDIA EXTENDING HIS ARM 
FORWARD IN A CLENCHED FIST AS A SIGN OF DEFIANCE 
AGAINST THE CENTER.  THE GESTURE BORE A CHILLING 
RESEMBLANCE TO THE NAZI SALUTE -- A FACT THAT DID NOT 
ESCAPE HIS DETRACTORS BUT EVIDENTLY DID GAMSAKHURDIA 
NO HARM. 
 
 
10.  ONE OF GAMSAKHURDIA\'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
POLICIES HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM OF 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES CALLED PREFECTURES. 
ACCORDING TO THIS SYSTEM, GAMSAKHURDIA APPOINTS 
PREFECTS WHO ADMINISTER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PLACE 
OF THE SOVIETS OR COUNCILS OF THE FORMER SYSTEM. 
GAMSAKHURDIA SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE APPOINTED THE 
FIRST GROUP OF PREFECTS IN JANUARY, HE HOPED THAT BY 
NEXT YEAR THEY WOULD BE ELECTED.  HE CLAIMED THAT 
SOME OF THESE ELECTIONS WERE HELD AT THE SAME TIME AS 
THE MARCH 31 GEORGIAN REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE. 
ACCORDING TO THE APRIL 14 LAW ON THE PRESIDENCY, 
HOWEVER, THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE POWER 
TO APPOINT AND REMOVE PREFECTS.  GAMSAKHURDIA SAID HE 
WOULD TRY THE SYSTEM FOR SIX MONTHS AND \"IF THE 
PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT, WE WILL GET RID OF IT.\" 
GAMSAKHURDIA  COMPARED THIS SYSTEM TO THE FRENCH AND 
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS, WHICH HE SAID HE USED AS 
EXAMPLES TO CREATE THE PREFECTURES.  CRITICS HAVE 
ACCUSED GAMSAKHURDIA OF SETTING UP A NON-DEMOCRATIC 
SYSTEM BY APPOINTING PREFECTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE 
NATIONAL CONGRESS. 
 
11.  GAMSAKHURDIA PLANS TO CONTINUE HIS PUSH FOR \"THE 
RENEWAL OF GEORGIA\'S INDEPENDENCE BASED ON THE 1918 
GEORGIAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\"  HE SAID HE 
UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A GRADUAL BUT INEVITABLE 
PROCESS.  ON APRIL 9, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC 
GEORGIAN DEATHS AT THE HANDS OF SOVIET TROOPS, THE 
GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET OFFICIALLY DECLARED ITS 
INTENTION TO RENEW ITS INDEPENDENCE BASED ON THE 1918 
DECLARATION JUST AS GAMSAKHURDIA HAD PLANNED. 
 
DOUBLE-SPEAK ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
/--------------------------- 
 
12.  DURING POLOFF\'S VISIT, GAMSAKHURDIA CONTINUED TO 
JUSTIFY HIS SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, SUCH AS 
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND SPEECH, AS \"NECESSARY 
MEASURES\" TO FIGHT THE CENTER\'S \"PROVOCATION.\"  AT 
OTHER TIMES, HE GAVE POLOFF OBVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT 
EXCUSES.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN POLOFF ASKED WHY HE HAD 
CLOSED DOWN \"MOLODEZH GRUZII,\" A NEWSPAPER CRITICAL 
OF THE GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT, GAMSAKHURDIA SAID THAT 
GEORGIA WAS EXPERIENCING A PAPER SHORTAGE AND 
\"THEREFORE, UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE NEWSPAPERS HAD 
TO BE SHUT DOWN.\" 
 
13.  GAMSAKHURDIA INSISTED THAT HE WOULD ALLOW 
CRITICISM OF HIMSELF AND HIS GOVERNMENT IN THE PRESS, 
\"BUT NOT SLANDER.\"  HIS DEFINITION OF \"SLANDER\" 
SEEMED EXCESSIVELY WIDE-RANGING.  HE CLAIMED THAT 
CHANTURIA HAD WANTED TO PRINT ARTICLES \"WITH OBSCENE 
WORDS IN THEM AND OF COURSE, WE CANNOT ALLOW SUCH 
THINGS.\"  IN REALITY, CHANTURIA HAD TRIED TO PRINT AN 
ARTICLE CRITICAL OF GAMSAKHURDIA IN THE REPUBLIC 
NEWSPAPER AND THE EDITOR WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PRINT 
IT.  GAMSAKHURDIA ALSO SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE 
POLITICAL GROUPS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO PUBLISH OR SAY WHATEVER THEY WANTED 
\"BECAUSE THEY WOULD JUST PROVOKE VIOLENCE.\" 
 
14.  DURING THE LAST WEEK IN MARCH, THE GEORGIAN 
SUPREME SOVIET PASSED A RESOLUTION BANNING 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF THE GEORGIAN SUPREME 
SOVIET BUILDING.  INTERESTINGLY, THIS IS WHERE 
GAMSAKHURDIA HIMSELF HELD MANY LARGE RALLIES LAST 
YEAR.  CHANTURIA TOLD POLOFF THAT THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY 
GAMSAKHURDIA\'S PLOY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT 
POLITICAL CRITICISM OF GAMSAKHURDIA IN ONE OF THE 
MOST POPULAR GATHERING PLACES IN THE CITY. 
GAMSAKHURDIA TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO BAN 
THE DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE BUILDING\'S GROUNDS BECAUSE 
THE DEMONSTRATIONS \"BLOCKED MY EXIT FROM THE BUILDING 
AND I COULD NOT GO HOME BECAUSE I WAS TRAPPED.  THEY 
ARE FREE TO DEMONSTRATE ANYWHERE ELSE.\" 
 
THE UNDERDOG OPPOSITION TRIES TO FIGHT BACK 
/------------------------------------------ 
 
15.  THE MAJOR OPPOSITION, THE NATIONAL CONGRESS, 
CONSISTS OF SIX BLOCKS OF ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN 
AVERAGE OF TEN PARTIES IN EACH BLOCK.  MANY OF THESE 
PARTIES HAVE ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED MEMBERS.  THE 
LARGEST PARTIES ARE THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, 
WHICH HAS ABOUT 5000 MEMBERS, AND THE NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE PARTY, WHICH HAS ABOUT 2000 MEMBERS. 
THE NATIONAL CONGRESS HAS A MORE RADICAL APPROACH TO 
ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE THAN GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND 
TABLE.  THEY BELIEVE THAT GAMSAKHURDIA SHOULD TAKE AN 
EVEN MORE CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE CENTER. 
FOR EXAMPLE, DAVID ONANASHVILI (PROTECT), NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE PARTY ACTIVIST, TOLD POLOFF THAT HIS 
BLOCK OF PARTIES HAD BEEN HOLDING DEMONSTRATIONS TO 
GET THE GEORGIAN SUPREME SOVIET TO BAN THE PRESENCE 
OF ALL SOVIET TROOPS IN GEORGIA.  WHILE ITS MEMBERS 
AGREE ON THE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE INDEPENDENCE 
PROCESS, THEY DISAGREE ON WHAT KINDS OF TACTICS TO 
USE.  NOW THAT THE REPUBLIC IS PREPARING TO HOLD 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS EARLY AS MAY 26, IT IS 
DOUBTFUL THAT THE OVER 60 PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO 
SETTLE ON A CANDIDATE AND MOUNT AN EFFECTIVE 
CAMPAIGN TO CHALLENGE GAMSAKHURDIA\'S BID FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY. 
 
16.  NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER GHIA CHANTURIA 
TOLD POLOFF THAT IT WAS MUCH HARDER FOR THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE ROUND TABLE THAN IT WAS 
FOR THEM TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
BECAUSE THE ROUND TABLE IS GEORGIAN.  CHANTURIA AND 
OTHERS ADMITTED THAT THEIR SUPPORT AND NUMBERS HAD 
DWINDLED.  INDEED, POLOFF NOTICED THAT THE TWO 
DEMONSTRATIONS SHE ATTENDED WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN 
PREVIOUS NATIONAL CONGRESS DEMONSTRATIONS LAST YEAR. 
EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, NATIONAL CONGRESS GATHERINGS 
TENDED TO BE SMALLER THAN ROUND TABLE RALLIES. 
 
17.  THE NATIONAL CONGRESS GROUPS FEAR GAMSAKHURDIA 
AND HAVE LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES ABOUT LACK OF ACCESS 
TO THE MEDIA AND VIOLATIONS OF THEIR FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH.  CHANTURIA TOLD POLOFF THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD 
WARNED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT HE WOULD \"PHYSICALLY 
DESTROY\" THEM.  HE ALSO SAID THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD 
PREVENTED THEM FROM GETTING HARD CURRENCY TO PAY FOR 
A TRIP THEY PLANNED TO MAKE TO THE U.S.  IRINA 
SARISHVILI TOLD POLOFF THAT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT 
GAMSAKHURDIA WAS PREPARING TO HAVE HER ARRESTED 
BECAUSE SHE WROTE ARTICLES AND MADE SPEECHES CRITICAL 
OF HIS GOVERNMENT. 
 
18.  SARISHVILI CALLED GAMSAKHURDIA \"A CRUEL MAN\" AND 
TOLD POLOFF THAT GAMSAKHURDIA HAD FABRICATED MANY 
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER ABOUT COLLABORATING WITH IRAQ 
AND HAVING SEVERAL ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN IN 
ORPHANAGES.  CHANTURIA SAID THAT WHEN THEY TRIED TO 
CHALLENGE GAMSAKHURDIA TO A DEBATE ON TELEVISION, 
GAMSAKHURDIA REFUSED AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO EVEN 
PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. 
 
19.  INTERESTINGLY, GAMSAKHURDIA AND CHANTURIA HAD 
BEEN FELLOW GEORGIAN DISSIDENTS AT ONE TIME AND HAD 
WORKED TOGETHER AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS.  ALTHOUGH 
THEY NOW CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE, 
POLOFF CLEARLY REMEMBERS BOTH MEN SINGING EACH 
OTHER\'S PRAISES SEVEN YEARS AGO. 
 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS WAGE POLITICAL BATTLES 
/----------------------------------------- 
 
20.  ACCORDING TO MOST ESTIMATES, ABOUT 25 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS FUNCTION IN GEORGIA.  ABOUT HALF 
OF THESE ALLEGEDLY BELONG TO POLITICAL GROUPS LOYAL 
TO GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND TABLE AND THE OTHER HALF 
BELONG TO POLITICAL GROUPS LOYAL TO THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS.  DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, 
GAMSAKHURDIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO DISARM THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS\' PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND TRIED TO SLOWLY 
INCORPORATE HIS GROUPS INTO THE GEORGIAN NATIONAL 
GUARD.  THESE TROOPS IN GREEN FATIGUES AND BURGUNDY 
BERETS ARE MOST VISIBLE AROUND THE GEORGIAN SUPREME 
SOVIET BUILDING AND AT THE AIRPORT.  A WESTERN 
JOURNALIST TOLD POLOFF THREE MONTHS AGO THAT 
ACCORDING TO A SOVIET MILITARY GENERAL IN GEORGIA, 
GAMSAKHURDIA HAD TRIED TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE SOVIET 
ARMY TO DISARM THE NATIONAL CONGRESS\' GROUP IN 
EXCHANGE FOR SOME COOPERATION ON DRAFTING YOUNG 
GEORGIANS INTO THE ARMY. 
 
21.  GAMSAKHURDIA HAS FOCUSSED PARTICULARLY ON 
DISBANDING THE MKHEDRIONI GROUP SOMETIMES KNOWN AS 
\"THE HORSEMEN\" OR THE \"KNIGHTS OF MKHEDRIONI.\" 
INTERESTINGLY, THE MKHEDRIONI WAS FORMED BY BOTH 
GAMSAKHURDIA\'S ROUND TABLE AND GROUPS PRESENTLY 
BELONGING TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS DURING THE SUMMER 
OF 1989 TO PROTECT GEORGIANS DURING CONFLICTS WITH 
THE ABKHAZIANS AND THE AZERBAYDZHANIS.  AFTER THE 
ROUND TABLE AND THE NATIONAL CONGRESS GROUPS SPLIT, 
THE MKHEDRIONI THREW THEIR SUPPORT TO THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS. 
 
22.  THE MKHEDRIONI LEADER, JOSELIANI, WAS RECENTLY 
ARRESTED WITH ABOUT 70 OTHER MKHEDRIONI MEMBERS AND 
HAS BEEN AWAITING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF ILLEGAL 
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS.  JOSELIANI\'S SUPPORTERS ADMIT 
THAT HE HAS SERVED FOUR PRISON SENTENCES FOR ARMED 
ROBBERY AND THAT PRIOR TO HIS MOST RECENT ARREST, HE 
HAD NOT BEEN A POLITICAL PRISONER.  NATIONAL CONGRESS 
MEMBER IRINA SARIASHVILI TOLD POLOFF, \"WE ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT HE HAS BEEN A CRIMINAL SO IT IS NOT A PROBLEM. 
HE DOES NOT HIDE IT.  GAMSAKHURDIA UNJUSTLY ARRESTED 
HIM ON CHARGES OF ILLEGALLY POSSESSING WEAPONS.  OF 
COURSE, HE HAD THOSE WEAPONS, BUT IF YOU USE THAT 
CRITERIA YOU COULD IMPRISON EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN 
GEORGIA.\"  INTERESTINGLY, GEORGIAN MINISTRY OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICIAL LEVON GOGOBERIDZE (PROTECT) 
DEFENDED JOSELIANI\'S CHARACTER BY POINTING OUT THAT 
HE WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO GET INTO MOSCOW STATE 
UNIVERSITY AFTER OBTAINING ONLY A SEVENTH GRADE 
EDUCATION.  HE ALSO TOLD POLOFF THAT MANY GEORGIANS 
THOUGHT OF JOSELIANI AS AN INTELLECTUAL. 
 
23.  ALTHOUGH GAMSAKHURDIA MAINTAINS THAT ALL THE 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS LOYAL TO THE ROUND TABLE HAVE 
BEEN DISBANDED, POLOFF SAW AND HEARD ENOUGH EVIDENCE 
TO INDICATE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THESE GROUPS WERE 
STILL ACTIVE.  IN AREAS OUTSIDE TBILISI, ARMED GROUPS 
FROM THE MERAB KOSTAVA SOCIETY, THE LEAGUE OF 
GEORGIAN EAGLES, THE WHITE KNIGHTS OF GEORGIA 
(ROUNDTABLE SPINOFF FROM THE MKHEDRIONI), AND THE 
ILYA THE RIGHTEOUS SOCIETY HAVE BATTLED THE NUMEROUS 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. 
ACCORDING TO DAVID ONANASHVILI (PROTECT), A NATIONAL 
CONGRESS ACTIVIST, MOST OF THE MORE THAN 20 GROUPS IN 
THE NATIONAL CONGRESS HAVE THEIR OWN PARAMILITARY 
GROUPS. 
 
24.  LENINGRAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUMMARY

2.  DURING A MAY 13-16 TRIP TO ARMENIA: 
 
--ARMENIAN OFFICIALS DESCRIBED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OTHER FIVE REPUBLICS EXCLUDED FROM 
THE NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION. 
 
--ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET CHAIRMAN TER-PETROSYAN 
(PROTECT) SAID ARMENIA INTENDED TO PURSUE INDEPENDENCE 
ACCORDING TO THE MECHANISMS STIPULATED BY SOVIET LAW.

POGOSYAN REFLECTED THE DISILLUSIONMENT OF ARMENIAN 
COMMUNISTS WITH THE CPSU. 
 
--TER-PETROSYAN DESCRIBED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET 
MILITARY TO ALLOW ARMENIAN CITIZENS TO SERVE ONLY IN 
ARMENIA. 
 
3.  THIS IS THE THIRD OF THREE REPORTS ON THE TRIP.  THE 
FIRST REPORT COVERED ARMENIA\'S DISPUTE WITH AZERBAYDZHAN 
(REF A).  THE SECOND ANALYZED ARMENIA\'S FOREIGN POLICY 
(SEPTEL).  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
THE SIX VERSUS THE NINE-PLUS-ONE 
/------------------------------- 
 
4.  DURING A CONVERSATION WITH POLOFFS, ARMENIAN SUPREME 
SOVIET CHAIRMAN LEVON TER-PETROSYAN STRESSED THAT THE 
APRIL 23 SO-CALLED NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION WAS ONLY A 
TACTICAL AND PROPAGANDA STEP WITH NO REAL MEANING. 
TER-PETROSYAN SAID THAT KAZAKHSTAN PRESIDENT NAZARBAYEV 
HAD BROACHED THE IDEA ORIGINALLY IN COUNCIL OF THE 
FEDERATION MEETINGS EARLY THIS YEAR.  THE ARMENIAN LEADER 
SAID GORBACHEV NEEDED SUCH AN AGREEMENT GOING INTO THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY PLENUM AND YEL\'TSIN, AT THAT POINT, 
NEEDED TO SHOW HE WAS WILLING TO COMPROMISE TO SAVE THE 
UNION.  TER-PETROSYAN ADDED THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE 
THE REPUBLICS WOULD NOT SIGN THE LATEST UNION TREATY 
DRAFT. 
 
5.  TER-PETROSYAN OBSERVED THAT UKRAINE SPEARHEADED THE 
GROUP OF REPUBLICS WHICH PRESENTED THE GREATEST CHALLENGE 
TO THE CENTER.  TER-PETROSYAN INDICATED THAT DURING THE 
COUNCIL OF THE FEDERATION MEETINGS, UKRAINIAN LEADER 
KRAVCHUK WAS THE MOST ADAMANT ABOUT REDUCING THE CENTER\'S 
POWERS VIS-A-VIS THE CENTER.  BECAUSE UKRAINE IS A VERY 
RICH AND POWERFUL REPUBLIC, KRAVCHUK IS SURE TO HAVE A 
MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE UNION 
TREATY NEGOTIATIONS, ACCORDING TO TER-PETROSYAN. 
 
6.  TER-PETROSYAN TOLD POLOFFS THAT SIX MONTHS AGO, 
MOLDAVIAN PRESIDENT MIRCHA SNEGUR INTRODUCED A PLAN FOR 
COOPERATION AMONG THE SIX REPUBLICS WHICH HAD NO 
INTENTION OF SIGNING THE UNION TREATY.  THESE INCLUDE THE 
THREE BALTIC REPUBLICS, GEORGIA, MOLDOVA, AND ARMENIA. 
AT THAT TIME THESE REPUBLICS HAD A STRONG SENSE THAT THE 
CENTER WOULD IMPLEMENT PUNITIVE MEASURES TO KEEP THEM IN 
THE UNION.  ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE MEMBER HOVANES IGITYAN (PROTECT) HAD JUST 
RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO MOLDOVA AND WAS PREPARING TO 
LEAVE FOR THE BALTICS THE NEXT DAY TO CONTINUE THESE 
DISCUSSIONS.  IGITYAN IS THE WORKING-LEVEL ARMENIAN 
REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FORMULATION OF COUNTERMEASURES TO 
ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE THE NINE MAY TRY TO INFLICT 
ON THESE SIX REPUBLICS. 
 
7.  IGITYAN INDICATED THAT THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD BECOME 
MORE FREQUENT SINCE THE APRIL 23 SIGNING OF THE 
NINE-PLUS-ONE DECLARATION.  HE ADDED THAT THE LEADERS OF 
THE SIX REPUBLICS HAD NOT YET MET BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN 
BUSY WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE 
REPUBLICS.  (COMMENT:  BALTIC CONTACTS HAVE TOLD US THAT 
BALTIC LEADERS ARE WARY OF ANY TYPE OF FORMAL AGREEMENT 
AMONG THE SIX BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WISH TO DILUTE THEIR 
ARGUMENTS FOR INDEPENDENCE BY INCLUDING REPUBLICS WHOSE 
INCORPORATION IS ACCEPTED BY THE WEST.  END COMMENT.) 
 
8.  TER-PETROSYAN MAINTAINED THAT ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC 
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE SIX REPUBLICS WOULD BE VERY 
DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE 
SOVIET ECONOMIC SYSTEM.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE CLOSE 
ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE REPUBLICS WOULD MAKE IT VERY 
HARD FOR THE CENTER OR THE NINE REPUBLICS TO TAKE ACTION 
WITHOUT SUFFERING RETALIATION.  THUS, HE CONCLUDED THAT 
SUCH ECONOMIC PRESSURE WOULD BACKFIRE ON THE CENTER. 
 
 
 
A LEGAL PATH TO INDEPENDENCE 
/--------------------------- 
 
9.  TER-PETROSYAN OUTLINED FOR POLOFFS HIS VISION OF THE 
PATH TO ARMENIA\'S INDEPENDENCE.  FIRST, ARMENIA INTENDED 
TO FOLLOW THE USSR SUPREME SOVIET LAW ON SECESSION.  THIS 
PROCESS WILL BEGIN WITH THE SEPTEMBER 21 REPUBLIC 
REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE.  SOON AFTER, ARMENIAN 
OFFICIALS PLAN TO HOLD REPUBLIC ELECTIONS.  AFTER THE 
ELECTIONS, THE NEW REPUBLIC SUPREME SOVIET WILL DRAFT A 
NEW CONSTITUTION.  FINALLY, THE REPUBLIC WILL COMPLETE 
THE FINAL STAGES FOR COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE 
SOVIET UNION.  TER-PETROSYAN AND ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET 
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMISSION CHAIRMAN VARDANIYAN 
(PROTECT) COULD NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME AND 
INDICATED THAT THE PROCESS COULD TAKE A LONG TIME. 
TER-PETROSYAN MAINTAINED THAT ARMENIA\'S CHOICE TO FOLLOW 
THE LEGAL ROUTE TO INDEPENDENCE HAD UPSET THE CENTER AND 
THEREFORE THE CENTER EXACERBATED THE 
ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI DISPUTE (REF A). 
 
 
ARMENIAN COMMUNISTS DISILLUSIONED 
/-------------------------------- 
 
10.  ACCORDING TO SEVERAL ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF 
STEFAN POGOSYAN RESIGNED ON MAY 13 BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO 
COLLUDE WITH THE CENTER AGAINST THE ARMENIANS.  LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SERZHIK DOVLADBEGYAN (PROTECT) TOLD 
POLOFFS POGOSYAN HAD RESIGNED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ASKED 
TO FORM A NATIONAL SALVATION COMMITTEE IN ARMENIA TO WORK 
AGAINST THE ARMENIAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT.  KAMU 
KOCHARYAN (PROTECT), ANOTHER LOCAL OFFICIAL, SAID 
POGOSYAN RESIGNED BECAUSE \"HE DID NOT WANT TO BETRAY HIS 
PEOPLE.\"  OTHER OFFICIALS TOLD US THE LAST STRAW FOR 
POGOSYAN WAS WHEN HE ASKED GORBACHEV FOR A MEETING TO 
DISCUSS THE DEPORTATION OF GETASHEN AND MARTUNASHEN (REF 
A) AND WAS REFUSED. 
 
11.  DZHEMA ANANYAN (PROTECT), FORMERLY A VERY ACTIVE 
ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVIST AND MEMBER OF THE USSR 
CPSU CONTROL COMMISSION, EMBODIED THE BITTERNESS LOCAL 
COMMUNISTS FEEL TOWARD THE CPSU AND THE CENTER.  RUBEN 
SHUGAROV (PROTECT), AN ARMENIAN SUPREME SOVIET STAFFER, 
TOLD POLOFFS THAT ANANYAN HAD BEEN A STRONG COMMUNIST 
PARTY STALWART IN ARMENIA AND HAS SPENT MOST OF HER 
CAREER ESPOUSING COMMUNIST PARTY IDEOLOGY AND IDEALS. 
12.  WHEN POLOFFS MET ANANYAN ON MAY 15 IN HER OFFICE IN 
THE ARMENIAN BORDER CITY OF IDZHEVAN, SHE EXUDED 
BITTERNESS AND DISGUST TOWARD THE CENTER AND THE CPSU. 
SHE ACCUSED THE CENTER OF CONDUCTING \"A CAMPAIGN OF STATE 
TERROR AGAINST THE ARMENIANS.\"  SHE ADDED, \"I HAVE BEEN A 
LOYAL AND DEDICATED COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL FOR 40 YEARS 
AND THIS IS HOW THEY TREAT US|\"  SHE SHOWED POLOFFS A 
COPY OF HER PUBLISHED STATEMENT IN WHICH SHE RESIGNED 
FROM THE CPSU CONTROL COMMISSION AND AIRED HER DISGUST 
WITH THE CENTER\'S SUPPORT OF AZERBAYDZHAN AND THE 
SHELLING OF VILLAGES ALONG THE ARMENIAN-AZERBAYDZHANI 
BORDER.  SHE ALSO REFLECTED THAT \"IT IS STRANGE THAT THEY 
WOULD GIVE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE TO A MAN WHO WOULD 
CONDUCT THIS KIND OF TERROR CAMPAIGN.\" 
 
ARMENIAN DRAFTEES TO SERVE ONLY IN ARMENIA? 
/------------------------------------------ 
 
13.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID ARMENIAN OFFICIALS ARE ENGAGED IN 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET ARMY OVER THE STATUS OF 
ARMENIA\'S DRAFTEES AND WHERE THEY WILL SERVE.  ACCORDING 
TO THE DRAFT AGREEMENT WITH THE SOVIET ARMY, ARMENIA 
WOULD CONCLUDE ITS OWN AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER REPUBLICS 
ABOUT WHERE SOLDIERS WOULD SERVE.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID 
THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF CONCLUDING SUCH AN AGREEMENT 
WITH LITHUANIA, FOR EXAMPLE.  THE ARMENIAN LEADER SAID 
THE PLAN HAS THE BLESSING OF USSR DEFENSE MINISTER YAZOV 
AND ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES, WHO HAS JUST BEEN IN ARMENIA TO 
FINALIZE THE AGREEMENT.  TER-PETROSYAN SAID THAT ARMENIA 
WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE, 
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THEIR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH 
RUSSIAN TROOPS.  HE SAID THAT IN 1918 AND 1942, RUSSIAN 
SOLDIERS HAD ABANDONED ARMENIA TO THE ENEMY AND HAD NOT 
DEFENDED THE REPUBLIC AGAINST HOSTILE FORCES.  \"WITH OUR 
OWN PART OF THE ARMY STAFFED BY ARMENIANS, THIS WOULD NOT 
HAPPEN,\" HE SAID. 
 
14.  TER-PETROSAN ALSO TOLD POLOFFS THAT THE ARMENIAN 
SUPREME SOVIET HAD RECENTLY CREATED AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
DEFENSE COMMISSION, WHICH WOULD COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES 
OF SOVIET ARMY, USSR MVD, ARMENIAN MVD, CIVIL DEFENSE, 
VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY AND 
AIR FORCE (DOSAAF), AND KGB TROOPS IN ARMENIA. 
TER-PETROSYAN SAID HIS GOALS WERE TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS, TO STRENGTHEN THE MILITIA, AND 
PROTECT THE REPUBLIC\'S BORDERS.

IN, AT MOST, A MINOR ADVISORY ROLE FOR THE CENTER. 
REPUBLIC LEADERS CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR U.S. 
DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN TBILISI AND FOR OUR 
MORAL/POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR GEORGIAN INDEPENDENCE. 
OPINION ON YEL\'TSIN AND RUSSIA IS DIVIDED.  MOST SEE 
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AS LESS THREATENING THAN THE 
SOVIET, BUT FEAR ADDITIONAL COUPS COULD UNSEAT MOSCOW 
REFORMERS.  DISTRUST OF SHEVARDNADZE IS GROWING.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
END OF THE SOVIET UNION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  DURING DECEMBER 4-7 VISIT BY EMBOFFS TO TBILISI, 
GEORGIAN INTERLOCUTORS OPINED THE DEMISE OF THE 
SOVIET UNION IN THE WAKE OF THE UKRAINIAN 
REFERENDUM.  BOTH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION SOURCES 
FELT THE UKRAINIAN VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE OPENED THE 
FINL ACT FOR THE SOVIET UNION.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
GEORGIAN NEWS AGENCY, IRAKLI KENCHASHVILI, SAID 
GORBACHEV WAS FIGHTING AGAINST A HISTORICAL PROCESS, 
SINCE EMPIRES CANNOT SURVIVE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. 
OPPOSITION PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FORMER HEAD OF THE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, TEDO PAATASHVILI, SAID 
THAT IN PRACTICAL TERMS NO REPUBLIC REALLY NEEDS THE 
CENTER.  HE PREDICTED THE MOST CENTER OFFICIALS COULD 
HOPE FOR IS A VERY LOOSE ASSOCIATION, PROVIDING 
SUGGESTIONS TO INDEPENDENT STATES. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
REQUEST FOR U.S. MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4. EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SOURCES REQUESTED 
U.S. MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR GEORGIA\'S 
INDEPENDENCE, CLAIMING THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE 
ARE BEHIND THE CURVE ON THE SOVIET DEMISE. 
PROCURATOR GENERAL ABAKELIA STATED THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR THE U.S. TO RECOGNIZE THE UKRAINE, BUT NOT 
GEORGIA.  IN A SESSION WITH PARLIAMENTARIANS, THE 
FATHER OF JAILED OPPOSITION JOURNALIST GEORGIY 
HAINDRAVA TOLD EMBOFFS THE U.S. HAD HISTORICALLY LET 
GEORGIA DOWN, BEING IN 1920 THE ONLY GREAT POWER NOT 
TO RECOGNIZE ITS INDEPENDENT STATUS, AND NOW AVOIDING 
ANY STATEMENT CONGRATULATING GEORGIA\'S DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE.  IN APPEALING FOR U.S. SUPPORT, 
GEORGIANS OF ALL STRIPES POINTED OUT THAT GEORGIA 
CONTAINS A SEPARATE PEOPLE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION AND 
CULTURE FROM RUSSIA; HAS AN OLD TRADITION OF 
STATEHOOD; AND CONSTITUTES NO THREAT TO ITS 
NEIGHBORS.  BY SUPPORTING THE REPUBLICS, THEY ARGUE, 
THE U.S. CAN DEMONSTRATE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY NEED 
OF EMPIRES.  THEY CLAIMED AN INDEPENDENT, &HRISTIAN 
GEORGIA, LOCATED IN THE MIDST OF MOSLEM NEIGHBORS, 
COULD POSITIVELY INFLUENCE EVENTS IN TURKEY, IRAN, 
AND THE REST OF THE MOSLEM WORLD.  THEY ALSO ARGUED 
THAT AN INDEPENDENT GEORGIA COULD PLAY A GREATER ROLE 
IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA.  IN 
ARGUING FOR A U.S. DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN TBILISI, THE 
GEORGIAN OPPOSITION STATED THAT ISOLATION FROM THE 
WEST WOULD NOT HELP THE LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
SITUATION.  A U.S. MISSION, THEY SAID, COULD 
INFLUENCE LOCAL EVENTS AND \"CONSTRAIN THE 
DICTATOR.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
HOPE FOR RUSSIAN MODERATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  OPINION WAS DIVIDED ON RUSSIA\'S RELATIONS WITH 
THE REPUBLICS.  SOME SOURCES, LIKE PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF 
OF STAFF, MERAB KLIMIASHVILI, SEEMED LESS WORRIED 
ABOUT YEL\'TSIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, FEELING 
THAT ITS IMPERIAL AMBITIONS, UNLIKE THE SOVIET 
GOVERNMENT\'S, HAVE FINALLY BEEN LAID TO REST.  AS HE 
PUT IT, \"THANK GOD RUSSIA FINALLY WANTS TO LIVE ON 
ITS OWN.\"  KLIMIASHVILI STILL HAD SOME CONCERNS, 
HOWEVER, SINCE HE SAW DEMOCRATS IN MOSCOW IN THE 
MINORITY.  HE PERCEIVED A CONTINUING DANGER \"THAT 
HEIRS OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM WITH TOTALITARIAN, 
IMPERIALIST, NON-DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES COULD REASSERT 
THEMSELVES.\"  THIS SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED BY OPPOSITION 
PARLIAMENTARIAN PAATASHVILI, WHO DID NOT FEAR A 
STRONG RUSSIAN REPUBLIC \"IF IT SAYS IT DOESN\'T WANT 
TERRITORIES BEYOND ITS BORDERS.\"  CITING YEL\'TSIN\'S 
MODERATE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE UKRAINIAN REFERENDUM, 
PAATASHVILI SAID THAT RUSSIA, UNLIKE THE CENTER, IS A 
LARGE COUNTRY IN ITS OWN RIGHT, AND IS NOT RELIANT ON 
AN ARTIFICIAL EMPIRE.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED THE CAVEAT 
OF UNCERTAINTY OVER FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SAYING \"THE 
POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT MORE SERIOUS COUPS COULD LEAD 
TO CONTROL BY A MILITARY LEADER WHO WOULD TRY TO 
RESTORE EVERYTHING.\"  HE ALSO ADMITED THAT SMALL 
NATIONS WITHIN THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC HAVE MORE TO FEAR 
THAN THE SEPARATE REPUBLICS. 
 
6.  OTHER SOURCES WERE MORE CAUTIOUS ON THE RUSSIAN 
REPUBLIC.  IN GENERAL, SOVIET, RATHER THAN RUSSIAN, 
TROOPS WERE CASTIGATED FOR INCITING TROUBLES IN 
OSSETIA (SEPTEL), PROMPTING A CURRENT BILL BEFORE THE 
LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY AND 
NAVAL ELEMENTS FROM GEORGIAN TERRITORY.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, HOWEVER, RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS WERE SEEN AS 
PROVIDING DISINFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE SOVIETS. 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER TENGIZ SIGUA BLAMED BOTH RUSSIA 
AND THE CENTER FOR PROBLEMS IN OSSETIA, SAYING 
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE MOSCOW \"WHITE HOUSE\" AND THE 
KREMLIN LEAVES LOCAL SOVIET INTERIOR MINISTRY AND KGB 
FORCES BEYOND ANYONE\'S CONTROL.  SEVERAL 
INTERLOCUTORS ALSO IMPLIED LINGERING FEAR OF RUSSIAN 
EXPANSIONISM.  ONE GEORGIAN LEGISLATOR CLAIMED THAT 
EVEN DEMOCRATS IN RUSSIA NEVER UNDERSTOOD SMALL 
NATIONS LIKE GEORGIA.  NEWS DIRECTOR KENSCHASVILI HAD 
NO USE FOR THE CENTER OR RUSSIA.  HE SAID \"EARLIER WE 
NEEDED GORBACHEV, THEN WE NEEDED YEL\'TSIN, NOW WE 
DON\'T EVEN NEED HIM.\"  ONE OPPOSITION SOURCE TOLD 
CIRCUIT RIDERS HE FEARED YEL\'TSIN AS WELL, SAYING THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT WILL \"SHOW HIS TEETH YET.\" 
 
7.  THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISTRUST OF SHEVARDNADZE 
WHOSE RE-EMERGENCE AS SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER WAS 
SEEN BY THE NEWS DIRECTOR AND OTHERS AS 
OPPORTUNISTIC.  BOTH PRESIDENT GAMASHKURDIA (SEPTEL) 
AND OPPOSITION LEADERS LABELLED SHEVARDNADZE A 
REMNANT OF THE BREZHNEV SYSTEM, REMEMBERED FOR HIS 
ROLE AS REPUBLIC FIRST SECRETARY.  GAMSAKHURDIA 
CALLED SHEVARDNADZE \"A GREAT ACTOR\" WHO FEIGNED A 
SPLIT WITH GORBACHEV SO HE COULD RETURN TO GEORGIA 
AND HOLD IT IN THE UNION.  THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT 
ADDED THAT SHEVARDNADZE IS TO THIS DAY STILL LEADING 
THE FIGHT AGAINST GEORGIA\'S NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, 
USING THE LOCAL COMMUNIST MAFIA TO CREATE DISSENT AND 
ECONOMIC INSTABILITY.

SUBJECT:  GEORGIA -- DELIVERY OF LETTER ON 
RECOGNITION, COMMENTS ON INTERNAL SITUATION 
 
REF:  STATE 418469 
 
 
1.  (U)  DEPUTY POLITICAL COUNSELOR DELIVERED 
PRESIDENTIAL LETTER RECOGNIZING THE INDEPENDENCE OF 
GEORGIA TO GEORGIAN REPRESENTATIVE IN MOSCOW PYOTR 
PETROVICH CHIKMEIDZE ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 27.  SHE ALSO 
EXPLAINED THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
WILL BE ESTABLISHED, AND EXPRESSED U.S. DESIRE TO 
CONTINUE AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF 
GEORGIA AND TO SUSTAIN CONTACTS THROUGH THE U.S. 
EMBASSY IN MOSCOW. 
 
2.  (C)  CHIKMEIDZE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL LETTER, THEN EXPRESSED POLITE DISMAY THAT 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS REMAINED AT ISSUE.  \"THINGS ARE 
VERY DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED FOR US.  WE HAVE MADE 
MANY MISTAKES, BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE TALK TO 
EACH OTHER, IF YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR POINTS DIRECTLY TO 
US, RATHER THAN SCOLDING US FROM A DISTANCE,\" HE 
SAID.  HE ASSERTED GEORGIAN RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY 
AND FOR THE VALUES REPRESENTED SPECIFICALLY BY 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND APPEALED FOR U.S. HELP AND 
COOPERATION. 
 
3.  (C)  TURNING TO THE CURRENT SITUATION IN TBILISI, 
CHIKMEIDZE CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION FOR \"STRUGGLING 
FOR DEMOCRACY WITH MACHINE GUNS.\"  AT THE SAME TIME, 
HE VOLUNTEERED THAT GAMSAKHURDIYA HAD MADE MANY 
MISTAKES, AND IMPLIED PERSONAL DOUBT AS TO WHETHER 
GAMSAKHURDIYA SHOULD ATTEMPT TO STAY ON.  ACCORDING TO 
CHIKMEIDZE, GAMSAKHURDIYA HAD BEEN OFFERED SAFE 
PASSAGE OUT OF THE COUNTRY EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND HAD 
INITIALLY AGREED TO THIS.  HIS ADVISORS, HOWEVER, WHOM 
CHIKMEIDZE DESCIBED AS \"THE WOMEN AROUND HIM,\" OPPOSED 
THIS, AND CONVINCED HIM OUT OF IT.  CHIKMEIDZE ALSO 
POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE TUNNELS LEADING FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING INTO THE HILLS SURROUNDING THE 
CITY;  HE ASSUMES THAT THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO AWARE OF 
THESE POTENTIAL ACCESS/ESCAPE ROUTES. 
 
4.  (C)  ACCORDING TO CHIKMEIDZE, THE ARMED OPPOSITION 
STORMED THE FORMER KGB PRISON IN TBILISI AND HAS FREED 
OPPOSITION FIGURES CHANTURIYA AND YOSELYANI, AMONG 
OTHERS. (THIS HAS SINCE BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE MEDIA.) 
 
5.  (C)  CONCERNING GEORGIA\'S POSSIBLE PLACE IN THE 
COMMONWEALTH, CHIKMEIDZE SAID THAT GAMSAKHURDIYA 
FAVORS GEORGIAN MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMONWEALTH, AND 
THAT IF HE SURVIVES THE CURRENT STRUGGLE GEORGIA WILL 
JOIN THE COMMONWEALTH.  MANY OTHERS OPPOSE THIS MOVE, 
HOWEVER, ARGUING THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WILL NOT WORK 
AND THEY DO NOT WISH TO GET INVOLVED IN A FAILING 
EFFORT.  PROPONENTS OF THIS VIEW ACCOUNTED FOR 
GEORGIA\'S POSITION AT THE ALMA-ATA MEETING. 
NONETHELESS, CHIKMEIDZE SUPPORTED INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
COMMONWEALTH FOR WHAT BENEFITS MIGHT COME OF IT, AND 
EXPECTS THAT GEORGIA WILL EVENTUALLY JOIN THE GROUPING 
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT POWER 
STRUGGLE IN TBILISI.

PRESS REPORTING ON THE KURD CONFERENCE 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (U)  ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN PRESS REPORTS, A 
CONGRESS FOR THE CONFEDERATION OF KURDISH 
ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CIS WAS HELD IN MOSCOW 
OCTOBER 29-31.  CLOSE TO EIGHTY DELEGATES 
PARTICIPATED.  A PRESS STATEMENT FROM THE 
CONGRESS STATES THAT \"THE FALL OF THE IRON 
CURTAIN, AND THE CIS KURDS HAVING COME TO KNOW 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE OF THE 
PEOPLE OF KURDISTAN, AND THEIR JOINING THIS 
STRUGGLE, HAS OPENED UP NEW PROSPECTS FOR THE 
\'SOVIET\' KURDS.\" 
 
3. (U)  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FRONT FOR THE 
NATIONAL LIBERATION OF KURDISTAN (FNLK) ALSO 
ATTENDED THE CONGRESS.  ACCORDING TO THE RUSSIAN 
PRESS, THE FNLK IS LINKED TO THE PKK.  ONE FNLK 
DELEGATE IS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT: \"WE HOPE THAT 
THE CONFERENCE OF KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS OF THE 
CIS WILL GIVE MORAL SUPPORT TO OUR LIBERATION 
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES.\" 
SHARAF ASHIRI (PHONETIC), DESCRIBED BY THE PRESS 
AS A LEADER OF THE CONFEDERATION OF KURDISH 
ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CIS, STATED AT A PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT \"THE GOAL OF OUR ORGANIZATION IS 
NOT ONLY TO PRESERVE THE UNIQUENESS OF CIS KURDS, 
BUT ALSO TO GIVE ASSISTANCE TO OUR FELLOW KURDS 
WHO ARE WAGING A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE TURKISH 
REGIME.\" 
 
4. (U)  THE PRESS SPECULATES THAT THE RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENT MAY TOLERATE THE CREATION OF THE 
CONFEDERATION OF KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CIS 
AS A MEANS TO PRESSURE TURKEY. THE FEW KURDS IN 
AZERBAIJAN MAY ALSO BE A PRESSURE POINT MOSCOW 
MIGHT WISH TO DRAW ATTENTION TO AT THIS TIME. 
THE RUSSIAN DAILY NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA NOTES IN 
THIS REGARD THAT RUSSIAN MFA SPOKESMAN GRIGORIY 
KARASIN \"EVADED AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ON 
WHETHER MOSCOW REGARDS THE KURDISH WORKERS PARTY 
AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, STATING ONLY THAT 
RUSSIA\'S LEADERSHIP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
FACT OF CREATING IN MOSCOW THE CONFEDERATION OF 
KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CIS.\" 
 
TURKISH EMBASSY VIEWS 
--------------------- 
5. (S)  THE TURKISH EMBASSY HERE TOLD US THAT THE 
PKK LINK TO THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION OF 
KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CIS WAS STRONG. 
SOME DELEGATES WERE CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE 
PKK AND A PKK FLAG WAS PRESENT AT THE CONGRESS 
PODIUM.  THE TURKS RAISED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE CONGRESS WITH THE RUSSIAN MFA, STRESSING THE 
TERRORIST NATURE OF THE PKK.  THE TURKISH EMBASSY 
SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT THE GOR SUPPORTED THE PKK OR 
THE CONGRESS IN ANY WAY AND FRAMED THEIR 
PRESENTATION IN TERMS OF A BRIEFING ABOUT THE 
BACKGROUND OF THE PKK.  THE RUSSIAN MFA RESPONDED 
THAT THE GOR RECOGNIZED THE PKK AS A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION  AND HAD FULL RESPECT FOR THE 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF TURKEY.  (COMMENT: WE 
NOTE REF B REPORT FROM A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT 
INDICATING THAT THE GOR HAS NOT BANNED THE 
ACTIVITY OF THE PKK OR PKK FRONTS.  END COMMENT.)

CLASSIFIED BY MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS 
JOHN M. ORDWAY.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, CHECHEN PRESIDENT 
ASLAN MASKHADOV DECLARED A STATE OF SHARIA (ISLAMIC) 
LAW TO BE IN EFFECT IN CHECHNYA.  ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN 
PRESS REPORTS, MASKHADOV ASKED THE CHECHEN LEGISLATURE 
AND THE COUNCIL OF MUFTIS TO DRAFT A SHARIA 
CONSTITUTION WITHIN ONE MONTH\'S TIME.  OFFICIAL 
REACTIONS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA 
HAVE BEEN VARIED, BUT ANALYSTS SUGGEST SHARIA LAW MAY 
BE PREFERABLE TO WAHHABIST EXTREMISM WHICH HAS 
THREATENED THE REGION FOR MONTHS.  NEVERTHELESS, 
OBSERVERS HERE AGREE THAT MASKHADOV\'S IMPLEMENTATION OF 
SHARIA LAW, IN FACT, IS A THINLY-VEILED EFFORT TO 
NEUTRALIZE HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS BY IMPLEMENTING DE 
FACTO ABSOLUTE RULE IN CHECHNYA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
SHARIA ON THE HORIZON 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 3, FULL-SCALE SHARIA LAW WENT INTO 
EFFECT IN CHECHNYA, THE INITIATIVE OF CHECHEN PRESIDENT 
ASLAN MASKHADOV.  INTERFAX REPORTED THAT MASKHADOV 
SIGNED SEVERAL DECREES STIPULATING THAT ALL LOCAL 
LEGISLATION MUST BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE KORAN 
AND SHARIA REGULATIONS.  THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW 
IN CHECHNYA IS INTENDED TO STRIP THE CHECHEN 
LEGISLATURE OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS, LEAVING THE 
ELECTED BODY WITH NOTHING BUT SELECT OVERSIGHT 
RESPONSIBILITIES.  IRONICALLY, THE LEGISLATORS HAVE 
BEEN ORDERED BY MASKHADOV TO WRITE A SHARIA 
CONSTITUTION FOR REVIEW IN ONE MONTH\'S TIME.  MASKHADOV 
ALSO INSTRUCTED THE CHECHEN COUNCIL OF MUFTIS TO ASSIST 
THE PARLIAMENTARIANS WITH THIS TASK. 
 
----------------------------------- 
\"IF IT\'S ISLAMIC, IT CAN\'T BE GOOD\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF 
SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAS BEEN MIXED.  IVAN RYBKIN, 
FORMER SECRETARY OF RUSSIA\'S SECURITY COUNCIL, TOLD THE 
PRESS THAT MASKHADOV\'S DECISION IS IN DIRECT 
CONTRADICTION TO THE CHECHEN CONSTITUTION DRAFTED 
DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF DZHOKHAR DUDAYEV.  UNDER THE 
DUDAYEV CONSTITUTION, THE CHECHEN REPUBLIC IS SUPPOSED 
TO BE A SECULAR STATE, AND THE EQUALITY OF ALL 
RELIGIONS IS EMPHASIZED.  THE DUDAYEV CONSTITUTION ALSO 
STATES THAT THE LAWFULLY ELECTED PARLIAMENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC HAS NO RIGHT TO BE DISSOLVED BY ANYONE, NOR IS 
IT ABLE TO DISSOLVE ITSELF.  RYBKIN STATED THAT \"ONE 
CANNOT EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD...FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF 
SUCH A DECISION.\" 
 
4.  (C) THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAS 
RECEIVED CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC REACTIONS FROM REGIONAL 
ANALYSTS.  ALEKSEY MALASHENKO OF THE MOSCOW CARNEGIE 
CENTER CALLED SHARIA LAW \"A COMPROMISE BETWEEN ANARCHY 
AND ANARCHY.\"  MALASHENKO BELIEVES THAT WITHOUT A 
FIRMER GRIP ON THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC, MASKHADOV 
WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO MORE THAN KEEP THE POLITICAL 
SITUATION AT A CONSTANT LOW BOIL.  THE ALTERNATIVE TO 
MASKHADOV, ACCORDING TO MALASHENKO, IS A MENTALLY 
UNSTABLE GROUP OF OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDERS HEADED BY 
SALMAN RADUYEV, SHAMIL BASAYEV, AND KHUNKOR-PASHA 
ISRAPILOV.  MALASHENKO NOTES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT 
FACTOR IN A BASAYEV/ RADUYEV/ ISRAPILOV POWER OPTION IS 
THAT IT MOST LIKELY WILL BE FUNDED BY EX-FIELD 
COMMANDER AL-KHATTAB.  AL-KHATTAB IS A SAUDI NATIONAL 
WITH WAHHABIST TENDENCIES WHO FAVORS A MORE MILITANT 
VERSION OF ISLAMIC LAW THAN SHARIA.  (NOTE:  AL- 
KHATTAB, IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMER FIELD COMMANDER 
ARBI BARAYEV, IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
MOST HOSTAGE-TAKING IN THE REGION AS WELL AS THE 
BEHEADING OF THE FOUR WESTERN HOSTAGES IN DECEMBER 
1998.  AFTER THE HOSTAGE\'S HEADS WERE DISCOVERED, 
MASKHADOV\'S GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED ITS DESIRE TO EXPEL 
AL-KHATTAB FROM CHECHNYA, BUT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO. 
END NOTE) 
 
5.  (U) VALENTIN VLASOV, FORMER HOSTAGE AND RUSSIAN 
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE REGION, TOLD THE RUSSIAN MEDIA 
THAT \"NO FUSS SHOULD BE RAISED ABOUT THE DECISION\" TO 
INSTITUTE A STATE OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA.  FORMER 
CHECHEN FOREIGN MINISTER MOVLADIY UDUGOV CALLED 
MASKHADOV\'S MOVE THE \"MOST CORRECT DECISION,\" AND 
STATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW 
WILL ALLOW MASKHADOV TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE CURRENT 
SITUATION. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) MASKHADOV\'S SEEMINGLY SNAP DECISION TO 
INTRODUCE SHARIA LAW IS BEING VIEWED WITH MUCH 
SKEPTICISM BY CHECHEN OPPOSITION FORCES AS WELL AS 
CHECHNYA\'S NEIGHBORS.  ALTHOUGH THE TRUE NATURE OF 
CHECHEN SHARIA LAW WILL NOT BECOME APPARENT UNTIL AFTER 
A CONSTITUTION IS DRAFTED, PRESUMABLY SOME MEASURES OF 
ISLAMIC INFLUENCE WILL BECOME MORE EVIDENT, IF ONLY AS 
A FACADE.  ISLAMIC EXTREMISM ON ITS BORDERS IS 
SOMETHING WHICH RUSSIA CONTINUES TO FEAR.  MASKHADOV\'S 
MOVE COULD TOUCH OFF NEW FEARS IF HE IS UNABLE TO 
CONTROL THE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST INFLUENCE. 
 
7.  (C) THE CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM WITH WHICH ANALYSTS ARE 
VIEWING MASKHADOV\'S MOVE IS PERHAPS MORE REALISTIC AND 
DEVOID OF THE EMOTIONAL BIAS AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ISLAM 
WHICH PREVAILS IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY TODAY.  RUSSIAN 
POLITICIANS (E.G. PM PRIMAKOV, MINISTER FOR 
NATIONALITIES ABDULATIPOV, AND DEPUTY PM FOR REGIONAL 
AFFAIRS GUSTOV) HAVE INVESTED IN MASKHADOV\'S GOVERNMENT 
BY OPENING NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSING PLANS FOR 
IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE REGION WITH 
HIM.  FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MASKHADOV HAS FACED SERIOUS 
AND GROWING CHALLENGES TO HIS AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO 
GOVERN CHECHNYA.  MASKHADOV HAS BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN 
ANY SEMBLANCE OF ORDER IN CHECHNYA.  THE INTRODUCTION 
OF SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA MAY BE VIEWED AS MASKHADOV\'S 
ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HIS ISLAMIC EXTREMIST OPPOSITION, 
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CREATING THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH 
HE CAN IMPOSE AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF ORDER WITH A 
MODERATE LEVEL OF POPULAR SUPPORT.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) CHECHEN PRESIDENT MASKHADOV DECLARED A STATE OF 
SHARIA (ISLAMIC) LAW EARLY IN FEBRUARY, PROMPTING A 
FLOOD OF HIGH-LEVEL CRITICISM IN MOSCOW.  RUSSIAN 
POLITICIANS HAVE PREDICTED WORSENING RUSSIAN-CHECHEN 
RELATIONS DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
IN THE BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC.  ACCORDING TO REGIONAL 
EXPERTS, THE INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW AND A SHURA 
(COUNCIL) IN CHECHNYA MAY BE NO MORE THAN A LAST DITCH 
ATTEMPT BY MASKHADOV TO UNITE A SHARPLY-DIVIDED 
POPULATION AND BUILD A SENSE OF STATEHOOD.  THE 
PROGNOSIS, HOWEVER, REMAINS THE SAME:  IT IS UNLIKELY 
THAT MASKHADOV OR THE OPPOSITION CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS 
TASK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE, IN WITH THE SHURA 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 3, THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL-SCALE 
SHARIA (ISLAMIC) LAW WAS ANNOUNCED IN CHECHNYA ON THE 
INITIATIVE OF CHECHEN PRESIDENT ASLAN MASKHADOV.  TO 
BEGIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA LAW, MASKHADOV 
SIGNED SEVERAL DECREES STIPULATING THAT ALL LOCAL 
LEGISLATION MUST BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE KORAN 
AND DECREED THE CREATION OF A SHURA (COUNCIL) ACCORDING 
TO SHARIA REGULATIONS.  PRESS REPORTS FURTHER INDICATE 
THAT, IN AN EFFORT TO HASTEN THE TRANSITION TO ISLAMIC 
LAW, THE EXISTING CHECHEN LEGISLATURE WAS STRIPPED OF 
ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS, AND THE POST OF VICE 
PRESIDENT WAS ABOLISHED. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE, IN WITH THE SHURA 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 10, CHECHNYA\'S NEWLY-FORMED SHURA 
ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR \"CONSULTING\" WITH PRESIDENT 
MASKHADOV, ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS.  THE CHECHEN 
SHURA IS COMPRISED OF 34 MEMBERS IN ADDITION TO 
MASKHADOV.  THE SHURA INCLUDES SEVERAL PROMINENT 
OPPOSITION LEADERS SUCH AS FORMER PM SHAMIL BASAYEV, 
FORMER VP VAKHA ARSANOV, FORMER PRESIDENT ZELIMKHAN 
YANDERBIYEV, AND OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDER KHUNKOR- 
PASHA ISRAPILOV.  (NOTE:  ALTHOUGH CHECHEN \"WAR LORDS\" 
ARBI BARAYEV AND AL-KHATTAB ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE 
SHURA, OBSERVERS BELIEVE THEY CONTINUE IN THEIR SUPPORT 
OF BASAYEV.  END NOTE) 
 
4.  (U) ALTHOUGH MASKHADOV\'S ACTIONS ARE WIDELY 
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN AN EFFORT TO CO-OPT HIS EXTREMIST 
OPPOSITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL-SCALE SHARIA AND 
THE CREATION OF A SHURA HAVE NOT CREATED PEACE INSIDE 
THE REBEL REPUBLIC.  THE CHECHEN OPPOSITION, LED MOST 
OFTEN BY BASAYEV, CONTINUED TO EXERT PRESSURE ON 
CHECHEN SOCIETY TO REMOVE MASKHADOV FROM HIS POST AS 
PRESIDENT.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESS ON 
FEBRUARY 23, BASAYEV CLAIMED MASKHADOV\'S INTRODUCTION 
OF SHARIA LAW WAS \"INSINCERE,\" AND ALLEGED THAT AN 
INDEPENDENT SHARIA COURT WILL BE FORMED WHICH WILL 
\"DECIDE WHO IS GUILTY\" AND RECOMMEND APPROPRIATE 
PUNISHMENT FOR THE \"GUILTY.\"  NO FURTHER DETAILS WERE 
GIVEN. 
 
5.  (C) ACCORDING TO CAUCASUS EXPERT ALEKSEY MALASHENKO 
OF THE MOSCOW CARNEGIE CENTER, THE SHURA CREATED IN 
CHECHNYA IS NOT A TRADITIONAL MOSLEM SHURA RUN BY 
RELIGIOUS MEN.  INSTEAD, MALASHENKO BELIEVES, THE 
CHECHEN SHURA IS A COUNCIL OF MILITARY MEN.  MALASHENKO 
CLAIMS THE CHECHENS CAME TO HIM OVER A YEAR AGO AND 
ASKED FOR MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ON SHARIA LAW AND 
BUILDING AN ISLAMIC STATE.  HE SAYS HE ADVISED THEM ON 
THE DIFFICULTY OF MOSLEM CIVIC EDUCATION IN A POST- 
SOVIET SOCIETY, AND GAVE THEM BOOKS ON ISLAM AND SHARIA 
LAW.  AFTER WATCHING THE EVENTS OF THE PAST MONTH, 
MALASHENKO SADLY CONCLUDED THAT NO ONE IN THE CHECHEN 
LEADERSHIP EVER READ THE MATERIAL THEY RECEIVED. 
 
--------------------- 
FROM \"BAD\" TO \"WORSE\" 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (U) MASKHADOV\'S MOVE TO INTRODUCE SHARIA AND FORM A 
SHURA BEFORE HIS OPPOSITION BEAT HIM TO IT HAS BEEN MET 
WITH A FLOOD OF HIGH-LEVEL CRITICISM ELSEWHERE. 
COMMUNIST LEADER GENNADIY ZYUGANOV CALLED THE 
INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA LAW A \"ROLL-BACK TO THE DARK 
AGES\" AND PREDICTED A WORSENING OF THE REFUGEE 
SITUATION IN THE REGION.  DEPUTY PM FOR REGIONAL 
AFFAIRS VADIM GUSTOV CHARACTERIZED THE INTRODUCTION OF 
SHARIA AS DIVISIVE, AND CLAIMED IT MAY LEAD TO A 
\"YUGOSLAVIA VERSION\" OF RUSSIA, AND WILL MEAN \"WAR.\" 
 
7.  (C) GUSTOV MAY FIND HE HAS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR A 
MILITARY INTERVENTION IN CHECHNYA, HOWEVER.  ACCORDING 
TO A MOSCOW OPINION POLL CONDUCTED ON FEBRUARY 12-14, 
ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED BELIEVE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE MILITARY FORCE TO BRING CHECHNYA 
FULLY BACK INTO THE FOLD OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. 
SIXTY-EIGHT PERCENT OPPOSE THE USE FORCE, EVEN THOUGH 
THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS BELIEVE CHECHNYA IS A PART 
OF RUSSIA. 
 
8.  (U) ALTHOUGH CLEARLY IN THE MINORITY, MODERATE 
VOICES HAVE SPOKEN OUT WITH A \"WAIT AND SEE\" ATTITUDE 
TOWARDS CHECHEN SHARIA.  SPEAKER OF THE RUSSIAN DUMA, 
GENNADIY SELEZNEV, STATED THAT REGIONAL EXPERTS MUST 
FIRST SPECIFY WHAT KIND OF SHARIA RULE CHECHNYA WILL 
ADOPT OFFICIALLY BEFORE AN OPINION CAN BE FORMED.  THE 
PREDICTABLY MODERATE DAGESTAN-BORN MINISTER FOR 
NATIONALITIES, RAMAZAN ABDULATIPOV, CALLED THE 
INTRODUCTION OF SHARIA IN CHECHNYA \"A RASH STEP\" AND 
STATED THAT MASKHADOV HAS \"WEAKENED HIS POSITION\" AND 
MAY BE REMOVED FROM HIS PRESIDENTIAL POST AT ANY TIME 
BY THE NEWLY-FORMED SHURA.  ABDULATIPOV ALSO QUESTIONED 
THE ABILITY OF CHECHNYA TO \"EXERCISE CIVILIZED ISLAM 
AND SHARIA LAW,\" POINTING OUT THAT \"NO ONE IN CHECHEN 
SOCIETY IS SUFFICIENTLY VERSED ON SHARIA STANDARDS, 
BEGINNING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ENDING WITH THE FIELD 
COMMANDERS.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) THE FIRST WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF 
SHARIA LAW IN CHECHNYA HAVE BROUGHT NO RESOLUTION TO 
THE ONGOING POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN PRESIDENT MASKHADOV 
AND THE OPPOSITION FIELD COMMANDERS.  MASKHADOV AND THE 
OPPOSITION HAVE YET TO REVEAL THE \"DEGREE\" OF SHARIA 
THEY INTEND TO IMPOSE.  THEIR NEWLY-CREATED SHURA DOES 
APPEAR TO BE NO MORE THAN A COUNCIL OF MILITARY MEN, AS 
NO SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP HAS EMERGED FROM THE RUINS OF 
CHECHEN SOCIETY.  ACCORDING TO REGIONAL EXPERTS, THE 
QUESTION OF CHECHNYA\'S ABILITY TO BUILD ANY TYPE OF 
STATE, INCLUDING AN ISLAMIC ONE, REMAINS THE CORE 
ISSUE.  THE OFFICIAL SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
IN THE BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC, HOWEVER PRO-FORMA, MAY 
SIGNAL THE FURTHER WORSENING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN 
CHECHNYA AND MOSCOW, PARTICULARLY IF NO COMPROMISE 
FORMULA CAN BRIDGE THE GAP NEEDED TO GIVE SHARIA LAW 
THE VEIL OF CONFORMANCE WITH THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION.

Classified By: A/POL Bruce Donahue.  Reasons 1.4 (a), (b), (d), (e) and 
 (g). 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY: On November 22 Igor Matveyev, of the MFA\'s 
Military and Technology Cooperation Division, provided a 
response to our demarche (reftels) requesting that the GOR 
not transfer thermobaric weapons to Yemen.  Matveyev would 
not say whether the GOR had made a decision on the matter or 
if the transfer had taken place.  A non-paper provided by 
Matveyev states that the GOR considers the Yemeni loss of 
control of SA-7 MANPADS used in terrorist attacks in Kenya 
and Saudi Arabia to have been the result of events related to 
Yemen\'s civil war, and amounted to \"force majeure.\" 
According to the MFA, the GOR was pressuring its Yemeni 
partners not to allow similar losses in the future.  Matveyev 
invited the U.S. to provide additional information on Yemeni 
violations of end use certificate requirements or other 
diversions of weapons.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (S) On November 22 we received from Igor Matveyev of the 
MFA\'s Arms Control and Technology Division a non-paper in 
response to our September 7 request that the GOR not permit 
the transfer of thermobaric weapons to Yemen.  (NOTE: A copy 
of the non-paper has been sent as a .pdf file to EUR/PRA. 
END NOTE.)  Matveyev would not say whether the GOR had made a 
decision on whether to transfer thermobaric weapons to Yemen. 
 He said the GOR strictly follows its national laws in 
pursuing military-technical cooperation with countries such 
as Yemen, and Russia\'s national laws are in accordance with 
international arms control and non-proliferation agreements. 
Matveyev said that the GOR had looked into the Yemeni loss of 
SA-7s during the civil war in that country, and, calling it 
the result of \"force majeure,\" the GOR considered it to have 
been unexpected, unpredictable and unpreventable. 
 
3.  (S) He added that the GOR was working to persuade its 
Yemeni partners to prevent a similar loss of control over its 
weapons from happening again.  When questioned on this point, 
Matveyev told us that at the working level  the Russians have 
made clear they would stop cooperation with the Yemenis if 
Russian end user requirements were not met.  Transfers to 
Yemen would be secured with end user certificates 
guaranteeing that any products received from Russia would not 
be used improperly.  In response to our inquiries, Matveyev 
said end user certificates might contain terms permitting 
inspections by the Russian side.  Separately, the GOR was 
establishing an additional legislative basis for permitting 
the conduct of inspections in recipient countries to 
determine whether end user requirements were being followed. 
Matveyev asserted that this legislation would assist in 
persuading possible recipients of military-technical 
cooperation to accept inspections by authorities from the 
Ministry of Defense and the Federal Service for 
Military-Technical Cooperation.  When pressed on the status 
of the legislation, Matveyev indicated it had not been 
submitted to the Duma, but would be made public when enacted. 
 
4.  (S) Towards the end of the meeting, Matveyev stressed the 
GOR interest in preventing the diversion of Russian weapons 
into terrorists hands.  He also invited the U.S to provide 
information on Yemeni violations of end user certificates, 
specific incidents showing that stockpiles were not secure, 
or other confirmed examples of Yemeni authorities losing 
control over weapons.  When asked, he said the GOR had no 
timetable or deadline for receiving such information. 
Without concrete information, however, he said there was no 
reason to prevent the transfer.  After all, he argued, Yemen 
had the right to defend itself and the transfer was 
permissible under Russian and international law. 
 
5.  (S) COMMENT:  Although Matveyev would not say whether the 
GOR had made a decision on this transfer, his invitation for 
us to provide specific information on Yemen\'s record of 
compliance with end user controls suggests that no final 
decision has yet been made.  The GOR had no qualms about 
letting us know in December 2003 that it had decided to sell 
thermobaric rockets to Sudan despite our demarches against 
that sale (ref C).

1.  (C) On December 21 we delivered ref A points and U.S. 
proposed final text for a U.S.-Russia agreement on MANPADS 
cooperation to Colonel Oleg Skabara of the MOD International 
Treaties Directorate and Oleg Burmistrov, Political Military 
Affairs officer of the MFA North America Department.  Skabara 
pushed back on the bracketed changes suggested by the U.S. 
On December 23 we met again with Skabara and Burmistrov to 
continue our discussions on the text changes to the proposed 
U.S. Russian agreement on MANPADS cooperation. 
 
2.  (C) At the December 23 meeting, Colonel Skabara, who had 
participated in the December 9 Vienna talks on MANPADS, 
insisted on working off the GOR\'s Russian-language version of 
the draft agreement, saying it was a direct translation from 
the English-language version agreed upon in Vienna.  Skabara 
declined to work from the USG\'s Russian-language draft.  The 
Russian side submitted 21 different text changes for USG 
review, many of which Skabara described as \"stylistic\" or 
required by GOR lawyers.  A scanned copy of the GOR\'s 
Russian-language draft, with line in/out changes submitted by 
the Russian side, has been sent via email to Jean Siskovic in 
EUR/PRA.  A separate email detailing the 21 GOR-proposed 
edits has also been sent to Siskovic. 
 
3.  (C) Although most of the edits were described as 
stylistic, post sees three specific edits which could 
potentially be problematic. 
 
-- The Russian side rejected the placement of the term 
\"retransfer\" (\"re-export\" in Russian) preceding the \"of 
proprietary rights\" in Section One of the agreement.  They 
instead proposed  placing the word \"re-export\" between the 
words \"grant\" and \"loan.\"  They argued that \"re-export of 
proprietary rights\" sounds odd in Russian. 
 
-- In Section Five, the Russian side rejected the first use 
of the word \"illicit\" in regard to production of MANPADS, 
claiming it had too broad a meaning.  They instead insisted 
on using the word \"unauthorized,\" reporting that President 
Putin had used the word \"unauthorized\" in reference to this 
matter.  However, they were not opposed to using the word 
\"illicit\" with regard to transfers later in the same sentence. 
 
-- The Russian side insisted on deleting the last sentence of 
Section Five, which reads, \"The participants intend to work 
cooperatively to discourage transfers of MANPADS by third 
countries that the Participants would not themselves 
authorize in similar circumstances.\"  Skabara said the GOR 
had not agreed to this sentence during the December 9 talks 
in Vienna, and that this sentence was not submitted for 
clearance with the rest of the text through their interagency 
process.  He said that if this sentence is to be considered, 
it would require further negotiations at a higher level -- 
presumably between General-Lt. Buzhinskiy, Chief of the MOD\'s 
International Treaty Directorate, and A/S Bloomfield.  In 
addition, the entire text with the additional changes would 
need to be resubmitted for review through the GOR\'s 
interagency process, Skabara said. 
 
4.  (C) At the end of the meeting, Colonel Skabara proposed a 
follow-up meeting once the U.S. side has reviewed the 
proposed GOR edits.
