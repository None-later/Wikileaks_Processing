U.S.-ROK BILATERAL COOPERATION: 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  ROK COUNTERTERRORISM UNITS TRAINED WITH U.S. CT FORCES 
ON MANY OCCASIONS IN 1988.  THE JADE NUGGET EXERCISE IN 
JUNE INCLUDED ROKG PLAYER AND OBSERVER CELLS.  A SIMILAR 
THOUGH MORE ELABORATE ROK-US EXERCISE, JADE NUGGET 88, IS 
PLANNED FOR JUNE OF THIS YEAR.  EXERCISE IVY CRAWLER IN 
OCTOBER 1987 WAS AN EXTREMELY INVOLVED ROK-US EFFORT.  THE 
SCENARIO POSITED THREE TERRORIST SITES IN COMMUNICATION 
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REQUIRED BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AND 
MILITARY COORDINATION.  U.S. FORCES TOOK DOWN ONE SITE, 
ROK FORCES ANOTHER, WHILE AN INTEGRATED FORCE TOOK DOWN THE 
THIRD.  IT WAS A COMPLEX EXERCISE AND OF GREAT VALUE IN 
EVALUATING UNILATERAL AND COOPERATIVE METHODS AND 
CAPABILITIES.  FURTHER MILITARY COOPERATION INCLUDED FIVE 
SMALL UNIT EXCHANGE/TRAINING EXERCISES, BOMB DOG, AND 
EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE DEMOLITION TRAINING. 
 
4.  THE USG HAS ALSO PROVIDED COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE 
AND TRAINING THROUGH A VARIETY OF AGENCIES INCLUDING 
CUSTOMS, INS, FBI, FAA, AND SIRO (S/NF).  FURTHER DETAILS 
OF SIRO (S/NF) COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO THE ROK ARE 
RESTRICTED TO SIRO (S/NF) REPORTING CHANNELS. 
 
JUDICIAL RESPONSE: 
----------------- 
 
5.  DURING EXERCISE IVY CRAWLER, ROK OFFICIALS RESISTED 
ATTEMPTS BY U.S. PLAYERS TO TRY TO EXERCISE LEGAL 
JURISDICTION OVER TERRORISTS ACTING AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS 
ON A U.S. INSTALLATION AND CAPTURED BY U.S. FORCES.  WHILE 
THIS EXAMPLE OF EXERCISE PLAY CANNOT BE TAKEN AS AN 
OFFICIAL ROKG POSITION AS HIGH-LEVEL ROKG DECISION-MAKERS 
DID NOT TAKE PART, WE BELIEVE IT A LIKELY RESPONSE. 
NONETHELESS, SHOULD THE ROKG DECIDE NOT TO EXTRADITE THE 
USG WOULD PROBABLY FIND A KOREAN LEGAL DECISION 
ACCEPTABLE, AS ROKG AND U.S. POLICIES ON TERRORISM AND 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT. 
 
NORTH KOREA: 
----------- 
 
6.  WE ASSUME THAT PREPARATION OF THE DEPARTMENT\'S REPORT 
ON NORTH KOREA CAN BEST BE PREPARED IN WASHINGTON.

1.  UNCLASSIFIED SECTION FOR THE REPORT FOR THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA FOLLOWS: 
 
I.  REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN, 
    INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
 
A.  INTRODUCTION 
 
AFTER YEARS OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING INFILTRATION BY NORTH 
KOREAN COMMANDO TEAMS AND AGENTS, AND HAVING SUFFERED 
TERRORIST ATTACKS SUCH AS THE 1983 RANGOON BOMBING, THE 
ROKG IS CONCERNED OVER TERRORISM.  THAT CONCERN HAS 
HEIGHTENED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 1988 SUMMER 
OLYMPICS TO BE HELD IN SEOUL AND WITH THE NOVEMBER 1987 
DESTRUCTION OF KA 858 BY A CONFESSED NORTH KOREAN AGENT. 
PLANNING FOR THE OLYMPICS HAS ENCOURAGED THE ROKG TO 
CONSIDER TERRORISM FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE, ALTHOUGH 
NORTH KOREA AND PRO-NORTH KOREAN GROUPS BASED IN JAPAN SUCH 
AS THE CHOSEN SOREN WILL CONTINUE AS THE PREDOMINANT FOCUS 
OF THEIR ATTENTION. 
 
B.  MAJOR STEPS TAKEN 
 
    1)BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. 
 
THE ROKG AND USG HELD BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS ON TERRORISM 
IN WASHINGTON IN SEPTEMBER OF 1987.  THE DISCUSSIONS LED 
TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH SIDE\'S ORGANIZATION FOR 
DEALING WITH TERRORISM AND TO SPECIFIC COOPERATIVE 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR INFORMATION SHARING, TRAINING, AND 
MILITARY PREPAREDNESS. 
 
CLASSIFIED SOURCE MATERIAL: 
 
1)  SEPTEL. 
2)  DETAILS OF THE AGENDA OF THIS MEETING SHOULD BE ON 
    FILE IN S/CT. 
3)  87 STATE 311198 CONTAINS A PRELIMINARY READOUT ON THE 
    CONSULTATIONS 
4)  87 STATE 371296 OUTLINES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
    COOPERATIVE ACTION AMONG A VARIETY OF ROKG AND USG 
    AGENCIES, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH ARE NOW IN PLACE. 
 
    2)BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH JAPAN 
 
JAPAN HAS AGREED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT ROK-JAPAN 
COMMITTEE WHICH WILL MEET ON A BIMONTHLY BASIS TO 
COORDINATE ANTITERRORISM COOPERATION RELATED TO THE 
OLYMPICS.  FINAL MINISTERIAL DISCUSSIONS ON ESTABLISHMENT 
OF THE COMMITTEE TAKE PLACE ON 20 MARCH 1988. 
 
    3)UNITED NATIONS ACTIVITIES 
 
THE ROKG IS LIMITED TO OBSERVER STATUS IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS BUT IS SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURES AGAINST TERRORISM. 
IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH US IT INTRODUCED THE DESTRUCTION 
OF KA 858 INTO THE SECURITY COUNCIL FOR DEBATE, AND ITS 
CAREFULLY MARSHALLED ARGUMENTS CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY TO 
THAT BODY\'S UNDERSTANDING OF NORTH KOREA\'S RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE ACT. 
 
 
 II.   RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING 
       EXTRADITION REQUESTS, WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS 
       RELATING TO TERRORISM AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS 
       OR FACILITIES. 
 
 
THE U.S. HAS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE ROKG. 
ALTHOUGH WE SUSPECT THAT THE ROKG WOULD BE WILLING TO 
CONSIDER THE EXTRADITION OF TERRORISTS TO THE U.S. ON A 
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS (SEE SEPTEL), WE CANNOT EXPECT THAT 
TERRORISTS GUILTY OF ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS OR 
FACILITIES WOULD BE EXTRADITED AS A MATTER OF COURSE. 
 
III.  THE ROKG OFFERS NO SUPPORT, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL OR 
DIPLOMATIC, FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IT SUPPORTS 
NEITHER THE PLO OR FMLN.

1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: WITH N/S NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUING OVER 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE N/S BASIC AGREEMENT AND THE 
NON-NUCLEAR ACCORD, KIM IL SUNG\'S APRIL 15 BIRTHDAY BASH, 
KIM\'S NEW TITLE OF GENERALISSIMO, AND KIM JONG IL\'S 
ELEVATION TO MARSHAL HAVE GENERATED ONLY MODEST PUBLIC 
INTEREST IN THE SOUTH.  NORTH KOREA WATCHERS BELIEVE THE 
NEW TITLES CONFIRM EARLIER INDICATIONS THAT KIM SENIOR 
WILL NOT RETIRE, BUT THAT AT THE SAME TIME KIM JUNIOR WILL 
TAKE ON EVER GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES.  MOST OBSERVERS 
BELIEVE THE NORTH\'S POLICY LINE TOWARD THE SOUTH WILL 
REMAIN UNCHANGED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW TITLES 
---------- 
3.  IN HONOR OF HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY ON APRIL 15 THE TITLE OF 
GENERALISSIMO (DAEWONSU) WAS CONFERRED UPON KIM IL SUNG. 
ON APRIL 20, THE DPRK ANNOUNCED THAT THE NORTH KOREAN 
WORKERS PARTY HAD CONFERRED THE TITLE OF MARSHAL (WONSU) 
ON KIM JONG IL AND O CHIN-U, MINISTER OF THE PEOPLE\'S 
ARMED FORCES.  ACCORDING TO JAPANESE PRESS REPORTS, KIM 
JONG IL ALSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE JAPANESE DELEGATION 
WHO ATTENDED KIM SENIOR\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.  WHILE KIM 
JONG IL HAS MET FOREIGNERS IN THE PAST, THE OCCASIONS HAVE 
BEEN FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. 
 
\"PROMOTIONS\" NOT UNEXPECTED 
--------------------------- 
4.  MOST NORTH KOREA OBSERVERS IN THE SOUTH EXPECTED SOME 
CHANGES AROUND KIM IL SUNG\'S BIRTHDAY.  DR. KIL JEONG WOO 
OF THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL UNIFICATION TOLD 
POLOFF APRIL 20 THAT AT HIS BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION KIM 
SENIOR OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED HIS SON AS HIS SUCCESSOR 
(SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE) AND MADE THE OCCASION 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR KIM JONG IL\'S \"COMING OUT,\" I.E., WAS 
INTRODUCED BY HIS FATHER AND MET WITH SOME FOREIGN 
VISITORS. 
 
5.  KIL OBSERVED THAT IT WAS LOGICAL FOR KIM JONG IL TO 
BECOME MARSHAL ONCE HIS FATHER HAD BECOME GENERALISSIMO. 
ACCORDING TO KIL, THE TITLE OF MARSHAL IS HONORARY AND 
POLITICAL IN NATURE AND DOES NOT CARRY GREAT MILITARY 
SIGNIFICANCE, ESPECIALLY SINCE KIM JUNIOR WAS MADE SUPREME 
COMMANDER LAST DECEMBER.  KIL SUGGESTED THAT THE CONFERAL 
OF THE NEW TITLE SYMBOLICALLY FORMALIZES KIM JUNIOR\'S 
INHERITANCE OF HIS FATHER\'S POSITION WITHOUT HAVING HIM 
TAKE OVER.  KIM IL SUNG STILL HAS THE TITLES OF PRESIDENT 
AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE KOREAN WORKERS PARTY (AND NOW 
GENERALISSIMO).  KIL SAID THAT KIM JUNIOR IS RUNNING THE 
DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY AND PROBABLY PLAYS AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE IN FORMULATING FOREIGN POLICY.  IT WOULD 
SEND THE WRONG SIGNALS, ACCORDING TO KIM\'S ANALYSIS, FOR 
KIM JONG IL TO TAKE OVER HIS FATHER\'S ROLE COMPLETELY 
DURING SUCH AN UNCERTAIN PERIOD FOR THE NORTH. 
 
6.  MOFA INTER-KOREA POLICY DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR NAM 
SANG-JUNG GAVE POLOFF A SIMILAR INTERPRETATION ON APRIL 
22.  NAM SAID THAT KIM IL SUNG NOW \"LEADS AND REIGNS\" OVER 
NORTH KOREA, WHILE KIM JONG IL \"CONTROLS AND RUNS\" THE 
COUNTRY.  HE, HOWEVER, CITED THE PROMOTION OF O CHIN-U TO 
MARSHAL ALONG WITH KIM JONG IL AS UNEXPECTED.  HE 
EXPLAINED THAT O\'S PROMOTION MIGHT SERVE TWO PURPOSES. 
FIRST, NAM EXPLAINED, THE NORTH CAN NOW ARGUE THAT THE 
SUCCESSION WAS NOT DYNASTIC SINCE O AND KIM JUNIOR SHARE 
THE SAME TITLE.  SECOND, THE PROMOTION OF O COVERS KIM 
JONG IL\'S WEAK MILITARY FLANK BECAUSE O PRESUMABLY ENJOYS 
STRONG SUPPORT AMONG MILITARY LEADERS. 
 
NO EFFECT ON NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE 
--------------------------------- 
7.  KIL, NAM, AND OTHERS WE HAVE TALKED TO DOUBT THAT THE 
TITLE CHANGES IN THE NORTH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT 
NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE.  BOTH EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT HAVING 
SIGNED THE IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT AND THE TWO 
NORTH/SOUTH AGREEMENTS, THE DPRK WILL PRESS FOR BETTER 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., JAPAN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AT 
THE SAME TIME STRINGING OUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
AGREEMENTS. 
 
SOUTH KOREAN PERCEPTIONS OF THE NORTH UNCHANGED 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8.  KIM IL SUNG\'S BIRTHDAY BASH GENERATED ONLY MODEST 
PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE SOUTH.  THE KIMS STILL RULE THE 
DPRK, AND NEGOTIATIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF N/S DIALOGUE 
AGREEMENTS HAVE YET TO ACHIEVE TANGIBLE RESULTS.  WITH THE 
BIRTHDAY SPOTLIGHT ON THE \"GREAT LEADER,\" SOUTH KOREANS 
WERE REMINDED OF KIM IL SUNG\'S PERSONAL ROLE AS THE MAIN 
OBSTACLE TO PROGRESS TOWARD REUNIFICATION. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9.  FROM ALL INDICATIONS, THE SUCCESSION PROCESS IS 
UNDERWAY.  KIM JONG IL RUNS THE COUNTRY ON A DAY TO DAY 
BASIS.  KIM SENIOR, HOWEVER, RETAINS HIS POWER AS THE 
SUPREME FIGURE IN THE NORTH.  HE WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD 
MAINTAIN HIS TITULAR SUPERIORITY WELL INTO THE PERIOD 
AHEAD.

1.  SUMMARY.  THE ROKG VIEWS ITSELF AS A POTENTIAL TARGET 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SHARES A STRONG POLICY 
AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WITH THE UNITED STATES. 
THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN 
1992, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER 
RECURRING INCIDENTS OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL 
ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST EVENTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL 
OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1991, BUT THE ROKG HAS FAILED 
TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN KOREA, AS 
STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ROK AS A TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  THE ROKG SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST THREAT, AND OUR POLICIES ON TERRORISM AND 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT.  AS 
RECENTLY AS 1987, THE ROK WAS THE VICTIM OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM SPONSORED BY NORTH KOREA WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
DEATHS OF 115 PASSENGERS ABOARD KAL FLIGHT 858.  THE 
SELF-CONFESSED SABOTEUR OF KAL FLIGHT 858 WAS TRIED AND 
SENTENCED TO DEATH, BUT RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON IN 
1990 AFTER COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE ROK AND IMPLICATING 
NORTH KOREA IN THE BOMBING. 
 
3.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
IN 1992, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS 
INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THERE HAS BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL 
OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1991. 
 
4.  THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS OF 
STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST 
EVENTS.  THE ROKG REACTS VIGOROUSLY TO OCCASIONAL ACTS OF 
VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT USG FACILITIES IN KOREA WHICH PROVIDE 
CONVENIENT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENT PROTESTERS. 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE RADICAL STUDENT MOVEMENT IN KOREA IS 
DIMINISHING WITH PROGRESS TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION.  YET 
STUDENTS CONTINUED TO STAGE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS DURING 
1992, USING FIREBOMBS, FOR EXAMPLE, AGAINST THE USIS 
LIBRARY IN DOWNTOWN SEOUL ON APRIL 19 AND AGAINST RIOT 
POLICE IN DEMONSTRATIONS IN SEOUL, INCHON, AND KWANGJU ON 
AUGUST 11. 
 
5.  ROKG SECURITY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO BE ALERT TO 
POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL AND 
INSTALLATIONS.  THE USG AND ROKG ROUTINELY SHARE 
INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS. 
 
A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
6.  THE ROKG HAS A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM BORNE OF ITS CONCERN OVER NORTH KOREAN TERRORIST 
ATTACKS.  ON MAY 22, 1992 THREE ARMED NORTH KOREAN 
INFILTRATORS WERE INTERCEPTED AND KILLED BY SOUTH KOREAN 
SOLDIERS APPROXIMATELY ONE KILOMETER SOUTH OF THE MDL. 
 
7.  NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA SIMULTANEOUSLY JOINED THE UNITED 
NATIONS AS FULL MEMBERS IN OCTOBER 1991.  THE ROKG, WHILE 
DECLARING SUPPORT FOR UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, HAS 
TAKEN NO STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN 
THE ROK, AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  MOFA 
OFFICIALS HAVE SEVERAL TIMES SAID (SEE REF B) THAT THE 
ROKG WAS \"SERIOUSLY EXAMINING\" HOW TO COMPLY WITH THIS 
PART OF UNSCR 748 BUT THAT NO DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE. 
 
8.  THE ROKG HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SUPPORT STATE TERRORISM 
AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL OR 
OTHER SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE ROKG HAS 
NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTED COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.

2.  ON MARCH 24, DPRK SUPREME COMMANDER KIM JONG IL ISSUED 
AN ORDER LIFTING THE \"SEMI-WAR STATE\" (REF A) THAT HAD 
BEEN INSTITUTED MARCH 9 IN RESPONSE TO THE BEGINNING OF 
TEAM SPIRIT.  ACCORDING TO THE MOFA INTER-KOREA POLICY 
DIVISION, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE DPRK HAS OFFICIALLY 
ANNOUNCED SUCH A STEP AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF A TEAM 
SPIRIT EXERCISE.  (COMMENT: WE NOTE THAT IT IS THE FTX 
PORTION OF TEAM SPIRIT \'93 WHICH HAS CONCLUDED.  END 
COMMENT.)  MOFA ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT IN TAKING THIS 
ACTION THE NORTH HAS LINKED ITS \"SEMI-WAR STATE\" 
SPECIFICALLY TO TEAM SPIRIT, SEPARATING IT CLEARLY FROM 
THE NORTH\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NPT.  WHETHER INTENDED OR 
NOT, KIM JONG IL\'S ORDER IS ALSO VIEWED BY SOUTH KOREANS 
AS A SIGNAL THAT THE DPRK MAY BE INTERESTED IN IMPROVING 
THE CLIMATE FOR RESOLVING THE IAEA IMPASSE.  IN ADDITION, 
MOFA ANALYSTS SUGGEST THAT THE DPRK NEEDS TO GET ITS 
WORKERS BACK ON THE JOB, AND BY ISSUING A PUBLIC ORDER 
THIS GOAL IS QUICKLY ACCOMPLISHED. 
 
3.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS (REF B) THAT VISA 
ISSUANCE WILL QUICKLY RETURN TO NORMAL.  JIM GROEN OF THE 
WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT HE 
WILL ESCORT A U.S. CHRISTIAN MUSICAL GROUP TO THE DPRK FOR 
A 12 DAY SERIES OF CONCERTS AND PROGRAMS BEGINNING APRIL 
6.  GROEN SAID THE DPRK MISSION IN NEW YORK HAD ASSURED 
HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM GETTING THEIR VISAS. 
GROEN ADDED THAT PARENTS OF THE GROUP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN 
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE \"SEMI-WAR STATE\" 
ANNOUNCED BY THE NORTH.  THE DPRK MISSION INDICATED TO 
GROEN THAT THE SECURITY SITUATION WOULD CAUSE THEM NO 
DIFFICULTIES. 
 
4.  THE ROK NATIONAL UNIFICATION BOARD TOLD US THAT THE 
SOUTH HAS REQUESTED A MEETING OF LIAISON OFFICERS AT 
PANMUNJOM THE MORNING OF MARCH 26 TO PASS AN INVITATION 
LETTER FROM THE HEAD OF THE SOUTH KOREAN CHONDO CHURCH 
(CHONDOISM IS A NATIVE RELIGION WITH A MODEST FOLLOWING IN 
KOREA) TO HIS COUNTERPART IN THE NORTH.  THE LETTER 
INVITES THE HEAD OF THE NORTH KOREAN CHONDO CHURCH TO 
ATTEND A CHONDO CONFERENCE IN THE SOUTH.  NUB OFFICIALS 
REPORTED LATE MARCH 25 THAT THE DPRK HAS NOT AGREED TO 
ACCEPT THE LETTER, SAYING THAT SUCH INVITATIONS DO NOT 
IMPROVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF N/S DIALOGUE AT THIS TIME.  THIS 
REQUEST FOR A MEETING IS THE FIRST INTER-KOREAN LIAISON 
OFFICE CONTACT SINCE THE RETURN OF LI IN MO ON MARCH 19. 
 
5.  COMMENT: WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE FTX PORTION OF THE 
EXERCISE, THE DPRK HAS TONED DOWN ITS PUBLIC POSTURING ON 
TEAM SPIRIT.  KIM JONG IL HAS DECLARED VICTORY TO HIS 
DOMESTIC AUDIENCE AND SAID IN EFFECT THAT NORTH KOREANS 
CAN GET BACK TO WORK.  DESPITE ROKG EFFORTS TO FOSTER 
PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS INDEPENDENT OF OTHER FACTORS IN 
THE N/S EQUATION, THE NORTH IS NOT YET WILLING TO MOVE 
FORWARD IN THIS AREA.

SUBJECT:  SOUTH KOREA:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
1. SUMMARY.  (U)  THE ROKG VIEWS ITSELF AS A POTENTIAL 
TARGET FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SHARES A STRONG 
POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WITH THE UNITED 
STATES.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERORISM IN 1994, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS 
INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE POLICE IN KOREA 
CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE 
CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST EVENTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL 
OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1993.  THE ROKG HAS NOT TAKEN 
STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN KOREA, 
AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748, ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL 
NUMBER OF LIBYAN DIPLOMATS HAS GONE DOWN THROUGH 
ATTRITION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ROK AS A TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) THE ROKG SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST THREAT, AND OUR POLICIES ON 
TERRORISM AND TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN 
AGREEMENT.  AS RECENTLY AS 1987, THE ROK WAS THE VICTIM OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM SPONSORED BY NORTH KOREA, WHICH 
RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 115 PASSENGERS ABOARD KAL FLIGHT 
858.  THE SELF-CONFESSED SABOTEUR OF KAL FLIGHT 858 WAS 
TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH, BUT RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL 
PARDON IN 1990 AFTER COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE ROK AND 
IMPLICATING NORTH KOREA IN THE BOMBING. 
 
3.  (U) THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM IN 1994, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR 
EXTRADITIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THERE HAS 
BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1993. 
 
4.  (U) THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS 
OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST 
EVENTS. THE ROKG RESPONDS TO OCCASIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS 
DIRECTED AT USG FACILITIES IN KOREA THAT PROVIDE 
CONVENIENT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENT PROTESTERS. 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE RADICAL STUDENT MOVEMENT IN KOREA 
CONTINUES TO DIMINISH IN KEEPING WITH DEMOCRATIZATION. 
STUDENTS CONTINUED TO STAGE DEMONSTRATIONS DURING 1994, 
USING FIREBOMBS, IN ONE INSTANCE, AGAINST KOREAN POLICE 
STATIONS. 
 
5.  (C) THE ROK HAS SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL LINKS AND 
CORDIAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LIBYA AND IRAN AND 
THEREFORE THE ROKG DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE COUNTRIES 
LIKELY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN SOUTH KOREA. 
NETHERTHELESS, ROKG SECURITY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO BE ALERT 
TO POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL 
AND INSTALLATIONS.  THE USG AND ROKG ROUTINELY SHARE 
INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS. 
 
6.  (U) NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA SIMULTANEOUSLY JOINED THE 
UNITED NATIONS AS FULL MEMBERS IN OCTOBER 1991.  THE ROKG, 
WHILE DECLARING SUPPORT FOR UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, 
HAS TAKEN NO STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC 
PRESENCE IN THE ROK, AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748, 
ALTHOUGH THE LIBYAN PRESENCE HAS GONE DOWN TO SEVEN 
PERSONS FROM THE EIGHT WHO WERE HERE IN MAY 1992. 
 
A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7.  (U) THE ROKG HAS A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM BORNE OF ITS CONCERN OVER NORTH KOREAN TERRORIST 
ATTACKS. 
 
8.  (U) THE ROKG HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SUPPORT STATE 
TERRORISM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, 
FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
THE ROKG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTED COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, KS 
SUBJECT: REPUBLIC OF KOREA: 1998 ANNUAL TERRORISM 
REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 202128 
 
1. (U) NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL OR 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA (ROK) IN 1998, AND THE ROK DID NOT RECEIVE ANY 
EXTRADITION REQUESTS FROM OTHER NATIONS FOR SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS.  ON DECEMBER 1, 1998, THE ROK NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY RATIFIED THE ROK-U.S. EXTRADITION TREATY; WHEN 
THE U.S. RATIFIES THE TREATY, A POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO 
THE EXTRADITION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS WILL BE REMOVED. 
 
2. (U) THE ROKG HAS CONSISTENTLY MADE CLEAR ITS FIRM 
OPPOSITION TO ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM, WHILE FOCUSING ITS 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ON PREVENTING SUCH ACTS BY THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK).  THE ROKG 
COOPERATES FULLY WITH THE U.S. IN CASES OF POTENTIAL 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY 
CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN 
TANZANIA AND KENYA, AND IN THE AFTERMATH OF THOSE 
BOMBINGS, WHEN INFORMATION INDICATED THAT TERRORIST 
ACTION MIGHT BE TAKEN AGAINST OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT 
INSTALLATIONS AND/OR PERSONNEL IN THE ROK, THE ROKG 
RESPONDED RAPIDLY, REINFORCING THE SECURITY PRESENCE 
AROUND U.S. DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND 
UNDERTAKING A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE THREATS. 
THE ROK\'S SECURITY FORCES ALSO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO 
IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO HANDLE POSSIBLE TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS.  IN A RECENT EXERCISE ATTENDED BY FOREIGN 
EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVES, A COUNTER TERRORISM TEAM PUT ON 
AN IMPRESSIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ROKG\'S PREPARATIONS TO 
DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL INCIDENTS AT THE 1999 ASIAN 
WINTER GAMES TO BE HELD IN KOREA. 
 
3. (U) THE ROKG DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND IT HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY 
CHANGED ITS STANCE TOWARD TERRORISM IN THE PAST YEAR.  IT 
MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LIBYA, IRAN, IRAQ AND 
SUDAN, BUT NOT WITH CUBA, NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA.  IT DOES 
NOT CONDONE TERRORIST ACTIVITY BY ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES.

SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR KOREA 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
BELOW ARE EMBASSY SEOUL\'S RESPONSES TO REFTEL QUESTIONNAIRE 
FOR THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE 
QUESTIONS FROM REFTEL. 
 
A.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, WHEN NOTIFIED IN OCTOBER THAT 
A SHIP APPROACHING PUSAN MIGHT HOLD AL-QAEDA TERRORISTS, 
REPUBLIC OF KOREA (ROK) CUSTOMS DETAINED AND SEARCHED THE 
SHIP.  THE SEARCH AND REVIEW OF CREW DOCUMENTS WAS NEGATIVE. 
THE ROK FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTS UN AND U.S. REQUESTS 
TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  THE ROK, 
THROUGH ITS VARIOUS MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES, HAS ALSO MOVED 
PROMPTLY TO ACT UPON SUGGESTIONS FROM THE U.S. TO IMPROVE 
MONITORING OF FINANCIAL TRANSFERS.  SOUTH KOREA HAS SIGNED AND 
RATIFIED 10 OF THE 12 UN CONVENTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM. THE 
REMAINING TWO CONVENTIONS, THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR 
THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBING AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM, 
HAVE BEEN SIGNED AND ARE AWAITING RATIFICATION IN THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY. 
 
B.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO INCIDENTS OF TERRORISM IN SOUTH KOREA 
IN 2003. 
 
C/D.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS FOR 
EXTRADITIONS OF TERRRORISTS TO OR FROM SOUTH KOREA DURING 
2003.  SHOULD SUCH A CASE ARISE, HOWEVER, WE ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT THE ROKG WOULD MOVE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO PROSECUTE 
AND/OR EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
E.  THE ROKG REGULARLY DENOUNCES INCIDENTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  WHEN ASKED, THE ROK HAS PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
F.  THE ROK DID NOT UNDERTAKE ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM 
EFFORTS IN 2003. PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT IN THE WAKE OF 
THE BOMBING OF THE BRITISH EMBASSY IN TURKEY, THE ROK 
INCREASED SECURITY AROUND THE BRITISH EMBASSY HERE AND 
INSTRUCTED ALL ROK GOVERNMENT OFFICES TO INCREASE THEIR 
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACK. 
 
G.  N/A. 
 
H.  UNDER ITS \"PEACE AND PROSPERITY POLICY,\" THE GOVERNMENT 
OF ROK PRESIDENT ROH MOO-HYUN ACTIVELY PURSUES IMPROVED 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH NORTH KOREA. AT NO TIME, HOWEVER, 
HAS SOUTH KOREA EVER VOICED SUPPORT FOR NORTH KOREA ON A 
TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUE.
