60 METERS LONG) STRETCHING FROM A HOUSE IN THE SLUM

REF: ADANA 0468 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2. RECENT REPORTING FROM ADANA AND OTHER POSTS IN 
TURKEY HAS FOCUSSED ON THE MASS MIGRATION OF KURDS 
FROM THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE LARGE CITIES OF THE WEST. 
AN ITEM IN THURSDAY\'S ADANA PRESS SUMMARY SHOWS HOW 
KURDISH MIGRATION IS ALSO PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON 
TURKISH RESIDENTS IN SMALLER TOWNS BORDERING ON THE 
TRADITIONAL KURDISH AREAS -- AND BRINGING WITH IT THE 
PKK. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO A \"MILLIYET\" ITEM ON SEPTEMBER 9 
(PARA 5, REFTEL), PKK MILITANTS ATTACKED THE 
SUMERBANK (A GOVENMENT-OWNED COOPERATIVE) YARN MILL 
IN THE TOWN OF PERTEK ON THE NIGHT OF SEPT 6, KILLING 
THE MILL\'S PLANNING CHIEF AND A SECURITY GUARD.  THE 
MILITANTS THEN TORCHED THE MILL.  SECURITY TROOPS 
REPORTEDLY ARRIVED AS THE MILITANTS WERE LEAVING, AND 
KILLED ONE.  THE REST PRESUMABLY ESCAPED.  PERTEK, A 
TOWN IN TUNCELI PROVINCE ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN 
TUNCELI AND ELAZIG ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE KEBAN 
RESERVOIR, HAS BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY POPULATED BY ETHNIC 
TURKS SINCE THE ARMENIAN RESIDENTS WERE REMOVED OR 
EXTERMINATED DURING WORLD WAR I.  THE MOTHER OF ONE 
OF CONSULATE ADANA\'S EMPLOYEES HALES FROM PERTEK, AND 
THE EMPLOYEE KNOWS THE TOWN, AND WAS A DISTANT 
RELATIVE OF ONE OF THE MEN KILLED IN THE YARN MILL 
ATTACK. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE\'S RELATIVES, THERE HAD 
BEEN NO SIGNS OF KURDISH UPRISING VIOLENCE IN THE 
TOWN UNTIL THIS SUMMER, AND THE ATTACK ON THE MILL 
WAS THE FIRST ATTACK EVER INSIDE THE TOWN.  THE ONLY 
OTHER PREVIOUS INCIDENT, ALSO THIS SUMMER, INVOLVED 
GUNMEN -- PRESUMABLY KURDISH MILITANTS -- FIRING DOWN 
ON A NEARBY JANDARMA STATION FROM SURROUNDING HILLS. 
THE ATTACK ON THE MILL, HOWEVER, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST 
A GOVERNMENT-OWNED FACTORY, AND INCIDENTALLY, THE 
ONLY MAJOR EMPLOYER IN TOWN. 
 
5.  FROM THE TIME OF THE ARMENIAN REMOVALS UNTIL THE 
LAST 4 OR SO YEARS, PERTEK HAD REMAINED ALMOST 
EXCLUSIVELY TURKISH.  IN THE LAST 4 YEARS, LARGE 
NUMBERS OF ZAZA KURDS FROM TUNCELI HAVE MOVED INTO 
THE TOWN, BOUGHT PROPERTY AND BUILT HOUSES, ALL 
APPARENTLY HOPING TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE IN AND 
AROUND TUNCELI.  THE NUMBERS OF KURDS AND TURKS IN 
PERTEK ARE NOW ABOUT EQUAL, OR PERHAPS EVEN WEIGHTED 
SLIGHTLY IN FAVOR OF THE KURDS.  THE TWO GROUPS DO 
NOT MIX, AND KEEP THEIR DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER. 
KURDISH MEN DO NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, GO TO TURKISH TEA 
HOUSES, AND VICE VERSA. 
 
6.  EVEN BEFORE THE PKK FOLLOWED THE KURDISH 
MIGRANTS, MANY ETHNIC TURKS HAD ALREADY LEFT PERTEK, 
CITING THE OTHER PROBLEMS THE KURDISH MIGRANTS 
BROUGHT WITH THEM.  HOWEVER, OUR EMPLOYEE\'S RELATIVES 
HAVE RESISTED, HAVING THEIR ROOTS AND BUSINESSES IN 
TOWN.  IT WILL BEAR WATCHING WHETHER THIS ATTACK, AND 
THE RESULTING JOBLESSNESS, WILL ACCELERATE THE 
TURKISH FLIGHT FROM SMALL TOWNS LIKE PERTEK. 
 
7.  COMMENT: IN THE PAST MONTH OR SO, THE TURKISH 
PRESS HAS REPORTED GREAT GOVERNMENT SUCCESS IN THE 
SOUTHEAST, CITING FIGURES OF OVER 1000 PKK 
FATALITIES.  THESE REPORTS ARE PRESUMABLY BASED ON 
TGS PRESS RELEASES, WHICH PROBABLY HAVE MORE 
PROPAGANDA THAN NEWS VALUE.  BUT WHILE THE TGS IS 
CLAIMING VICTORY IN THE AREAS AROUND HAKKARI, SIRNAK, 
AND DOGUBEYAZIT, THE PKK CONTINUES TO STRIKE IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST.  AS THIS AND OTHER ATTACKS 
SHOW, THE MILITANTS CAN EVEN VENTURE INTO NEW AREAS. 
 
8.  FURTHER COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE PRESS REPORTS 
REFERRED TO THE ATTACKERS AS PKK MILITANTS, AND THERE 
IS NO EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, TUNCELI PROVINCE HAS 
BEEN A BASE FOR THE TURKISH WORKERS AND PEASANTS 
LIBERATION ARMY (TIKKO).  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TIKKO 
ELEMENTS CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK, BUT THE LARGER AND 
MORE NOTORIOUS PKK GOT THE CREDIT.  END COMMENTS.

1.  (U) THE TURKISH PRESS REPORTED ON MAY 19TH THAT 
TURKISH F-16S AND F-4S HAD AGAIN BOMBED THE PKK\'S ZALEH 
CAMP IN NORTHERN IRAQ, AND BOASTED THAT THE CAMP WAS 
\"RAZED TO THE GROUND.\" 
 
2.  (C) THE TAF HAD PREVIOUSLY BOMBED ZALEH CAMP ON 
JANUARY 29, AND AT THAT TIME CLAIMED THAT HUNDREDS OF PKK 
PAGE 02 RUFTWPA1266 C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0290 
MILITANTS WERE KILLED.  HOWEVER, THE PKK WAS WARNED OF THE 
JANUARY RAID, ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION GIVEN 
TO IRAQI KURDISH LEADER JALAL TALABANI WAS PASSED ON TO 
THE PKK.  AS A RESULT, DESPITE TURKISH CLAIMS OF HUNDREDS 
OF CASUALTIES IN THE JANUARY RAID, CONSULATE RECEIVED 
CREDIBLE REPORTS FROM THE AREA THAT PUT THE NUMBER OF 
FATALITIES AT A FRACTION OF THAT, PERHAPS AS LOW AS 10. 
AT ANY RATE, THE PKK QUICKLY RECLAIMED THE CAMP AND MOVED 
BACK. 
 
3.  (C) THIS TIME, THERE WAS NO WARNING, AND THE TAF 
CLAIMS OF HEAVY PKK CASUALTIES MAY BE MORE ACCURATE. 
SECONDHAND REPORTS COMING OUT OF NORTHERN IRAQ INDICATE 
THAT AS MANY AS 100-200 PKK MILITANTS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN THE RAID.  INJURED MILITANTS WERE REPORTEDLY BROUGHT AS 
FAR AS DAHUK HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT, INDICATING THAT 
FACILTIES CLOSER TO THE CAMP SITE MAY HAVE BEEN 
OVERLOADED.

ABOUT OFFICIAL CASUALTY FIGURES RELEASED AFTER LARGE 
OPERATIONS LIKE THE AIR STRIKE AGAINST ZALEH CAMP, OR THE 
RECENT CROSS-BORDER OPERATION.  IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TOTAL 
CASUALTIES, HOWEVER, SUCH STRIKES MAY FORCE THE PKK TO 
CHANGE ITS TACTICS, SCATTER ITS MILITANTS INTO SMALLER 
OPERATING UNITS, AND STOP CONGREGATING IN LARGE CAMPS THAT 
ARE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE AND HARD TO DEFEND FROM AIR 
ATTACKS.  END COMMENT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ETHNIC TURKISH WIFE OF ADANA AMCIT BUSINESSMAN 
INFORMED ADANA POLOFF THAT HER BROTHER, OWNER OF A LARGE 
RESTAURANT NEAR BURSA, WAS KIDNAPPED BY THE PKK AND TOLD TO MAKE 
\"FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\"  RELEASED UNHARMED THE NEXT DAY BUT 
AWARE OF THE PKK\'S ABILITY TO EXACT REPRISALS, HE TOLD HIS WIFE 
NOT TO TELL ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE POLICE, ABOUT THE INCIDENT. 
THE PKK\'S EXTORTION NETWORK NOW SEEMS TO EXTEND TO TURKISH 
NATIONALS WITH FEW, IF ANY, TIES TO THE TROUBLED SOUTHEAST.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  AMCIT BUSINESSMAN IN ADANA, WHOSE WIFE IS AN ETHNIC TURK FROM 
THE BURSA AREA OF NORTHWEST TURKEY, HOSTED A SMALL DINNER PARTY 
ON SEPTEMBER 8.  HIS WIFE WAS SOBBING AS SHE GREETED POLOFF AT 
THE FRONT DOOR.  SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE SO THAT THE OTHER GUESTS 
COULD NOT HEAR, SHE SAID THAT HER BROTHER HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY 
THE PKK.  HE OWNS A LARGE SEAFRONT RESTAURANT THAT FACES THE SEA 
OF MARMARA AND HAS A PIER WHERE HIS YACHT AND OTHERS CAN DOCK. 
 
4.  THE HOSTESS\'S SISTER-IN-LAW HAD JUST CALLED TO PROVIDE THE 
FOLLOWING DETAILS.  ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 7, SHE AND HER 
HUSBAND WERE GETTING INTO THE CAR OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE.  TWO WELL- 
DRESSED MEN APPROACHED THEM.  THEY TOLD HER THEY NEEDED TO SPEAK 
TO HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY AND THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM 
PROVIDED THAT SHE DID NOT GO TO THE AUTHORITIES.  THEY THEN PUT 
HER HUSBAND INTO THEIR CAR AND DROVE AWAY.  SHE DID NOT CALL THE 
POLICE. 
 
5.  THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS HOME UNHARMED.  HE 
HAD BEEN TAKEN BY TWO PKK OPERATIVES, HE SAID, AND DRIVEN TO A 
LOCATION THAT HE COULD NOT (OR WOULD NOT) IDENTIFY.  THEY TOLD 
HIM THAT THEY KNEW HE WAS A RICH MAN AND THAT THEY EXPECTED HIM 
TO MAKE APPROPRIATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PKK.  THEY CAUTIONED HIM 
THAT NO HARM WOULD COME TO HIM OR HIS FAMILY IF HE COOPERATED AND 
IF HE TOLD NO ONE OF THE APPROACH THEY HAD MADE TO HIM. 
OTHERWISE, THEY TOLD HIM, THEY \"KNEW WHERE HE LIVED.\"  HIS WIFE 
DID NOT SAY THAT HE HAD AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS, BUT THERE SEEMS 
TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT HE DID SO.  HE URGED HIS WIFE TO SAY 
NOTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  PKK EXTORTION HAS BEEN PART OF THE LANDSCAPE IN 
SOUTHEAST TURKEY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.  CONSULATE ADANA REPORTED 
AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1992 THE LIKELIHOOD THAT BUSINESSMEN AND 
ELECTED OFFICIALS--EVEN MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION\'S TRUE 
PATH PARTY (DYP)--HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING, IN SOME CASES 
UNWILLINGLY, TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S COFFERS.  PKK COLLECTION 
EFFORTS, AND RETRIBUTION FOR NON-PAYMENT, HAVE BECOME KNOWN IN 
ADANA AS WELL.  A LARGE ADANA LANDOWNER WAS TAKEN FROM HIS HOME 
AND KILLED TWO YEARS AGO, APPARENTLY FOR REFUSING TO PAY THE PKK. 
THE SITUATION OF THE RESTAURANTEUR NEAR BURSA IS A STRONG 
INDICATION THAT THE TENTACLES OF THE PKK NOW EXTEND TO ETHNIC 
TURKS WITH NO TIES EITHER TO THE SOUTHEAST OR TO THE INCREASINGLY 
\"KURDIFIED\" ADANA-MERSIN REGION.  IF HIS CASE IS NOT AN ISOLATED 
ONE, IT IS YET ANOTHER INDICATION WHY THE PKK SEEMS NOT TO BE 
CONSTRAINED BY A LACK OF FUNDS.  END COMMENT.

2.  COORDINATING GOVERNOR TO REPLACE OHAL GOVERNOR 
(Sabah)  Following the 15-year state of emergency (OHAL) in 
the East and Southeast, which is to end on November 30 in 
Diyarbakir and Sirnak, the only provinces where OHAL 
remains in effect, the OHAL Governor\'s Office will be 
replaced by the Coordinator Governor\'s Office.  During the 
Turkish National Security Council (MGK) meeting last month, 
Interior Ministry Muzaffer Ecemis briefed MGK members on 
his Ministry\'s \"classified\" report, along with a series of 
measures to be taken after OHAL ends in the region.  The 
Coordinator Governor will reportedly have the same 
privilege of using special allocations from the Prime 
Ministry budget as the OHAL Governor. 
 
 
3.  NGO REPORT CALLS DIYARBAKIR RETURNEE KILLINGS \"TERROR\" 
(Evrensel)  A report prepared by an Association for the 
Oppressed (MAZLUM-DER) about the killing of three returnees 
to Bismil\'s (Diyarbakir) Ugrak village by village guards 
called the incident not a blood feud, but \"terror\" by 
village guards which threatened the social peace.  The 
delegation called for removal of obstacles in the way of 
village returns and abolition of the village guard system. 
 
 
4.  THREE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES INVESTIGATED FOR PARTICIPATION 
IN DEHAP RALLY 
(Evrensel)  An investigation has been launched against 
three Diyarbakir public employees for participating in the 
Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP) rally and the 
inauguration of a DEHAP election office in Lice 
(Diyarbakir).  The public employees have been suspended 
until the investigation is concluded. 
 
 
5.  DEHAP PETITIONS TO CANCEL VOTES IN TWO TOWNSHIPS 
(Evrensel)  Claiming voters were forced to cast their votes 
openly in Sirnak\'s Beytussebap and Uludere townships, as 
well as many villages, the Democratic People\'s Party 
(DEHAP) petitioned the Provincial Election Board to cancel 
the elections (in those townships and villages).  In 
addition, Youth Party (GP) Sirnak candidate Tahir Adiyaman 
claimed Ayvalik and Basaran villagers were forced to cast 
their votes openly and complained the Election Board 
refused to process objections to that end. 
 
 
6.  103 ELECTION VIOLATION APPLICATIONS 
(Evrensel)  One hundred and three people applied to the 
Crisis Desk formed by the Diyarbakir Chapter of the Human 
Rights Association (HRA), reporting rights violations 
during the November 3 elections. According to the Desk, 
observers serving at 17 different ballot boxes were 
prevented, while 37 people were arrested on election day 
for arguing with security forces.  Alleged violations 
included forcing voters to vote openly, pressuring them to 
vote for another party (rather than the Democratic People\'s 
Party - DEHAP), preventing them from casting their votes, 
as well as threats and wrong electorate information cards. 
 
 
7.  MERSIN POLICE BRIEFED ON EU HARMONIZATION LAWS 
(Milliyet/Hurriyet/Turkiye)  Chief Public Prosecutor Halil 
Acioglu briefed 500 police chiefs and police officers at 
the Mersin Security Directorate on EU Harmonization Laws. 
Police were informed about recent amendments to the 
Criminal Court Procedures Law (CMUK), the Police Duty and 
Authorization Law, the Meetings, Demonstrations and Marches 
Law, the State Security Court and Trial Procedures Laws, 
the Associations Law, as well as Regulations on Arrest, 
Detention and Testimony Taking. 
 
 
8.  NEW ADANA MP\'S LOBBY TO POSTPONE ADANA AIRPORT\'S CLOSURE 
(Milliyet/Hurriyet)  Following a meeting with 
representatives of the Adana and Mersin industrial 
organizations, newly elected Justice and Development Party 
(AKP) and Republican People\'s Party (CHP) parliamentarians 
and provincial chairmen faxed a joint message to their 
headquarters to postpone the closure of the Adana Airport 
to flights until April 1, 2003.  In addition to 
postponement of the Airport\'s closure, the message called 
for putting in service a secondary runway, and use of the 
Incirlik Air Base during the two-month renovation project. 
(Note:  Several papers had already reported the closure of 
the Adana Airport to flights as of November 4 due to repair 
and maintenance.)

2.  38 ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION MEMBERS ARRESTED IN OCTOBER 
(Bolge)  According to the Mersin Security Directorate, 38 
suspected members of the illegal organization (i.e., the 
PKK) were arrested during 13 operations in October in 
Mersin.  The arrestees were arraigned in a local court 
which ordered 19 to remain in custody.  The remaining 19 
were released but ordered to appear for their upcoming

3.  JANDARMA ARREST 49 IRAQIS FLEEING POSSIBLE U.S. WAR 
(Turkiye)  Baykan (Siirt) Jandarma arrested 49 Iraqis who 
had illegally crossed into Turkey in order to flee a 
possible U.S. war in Iraq.  The arrestees were taken to the 
Baykan Prosecutor\'s Office following interrogation.  They 
will reportedly be deported following the completion of 
necessary procedures. 
 
 
4.  SIIRT MAN SOUGHT BY INTERPOL ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIAN 
(Sabah)  The November 3 elections were the most interesting 
of all the parliamentary elections since the foundation of 
the Republic of Turkey.  For the first time, a political 
party whose chairman was barred from entering the 
Parliament won elections.  And for the first time, a 
person, Fadil Akgunduz, sought by Interpol with a red 
bulletin for fraud has been elected a parliamentarian. 
What makes the November 3 elections interesting is that the 
birthplace of these two victories is the same province: 
Siirt.  Siirt was the province where AKP leader Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan had recited a poem by Ziya Gokalp which 
resulted in his conviction and a ban from active politics. 
It was Siirt people who elected Akgunduz despite many cases 
of fraud opened against him.  Akgunduz received 11,450 
votes, becoming the third in Siirt after the Democratic 
People\'s Party (DEHAP) and AKP.  If someone has made a 
mistake, the judiciary must punish him,\" public employee 
Yusuf Alcan reacted.  Alcan claimed Akgunduz had been 
prevented from establishing an automobile factory (Jet 
Motor, which had earned him the name \"Jet Fadil\") in Siirt. 
He had made investments (in Siirt) amounting to USD 100 
million and he had TL 30 trillion (18.2 million) in the 
bank.  There are people who do not want any investments 
made in this region, Algan argued.  Support for \"Jet Fadil\" 
resulted from his being seen as a victim, from hope for 
employment, as well as ethnic origin solidarity, and his 
participation in rallies via telephone which caused Siirt 
people to burst into tears.  Siirt Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry President Nedim Kuzu said poverty and hopelessness 
opened the way for \"Jet Fadil\" and gave statistics:  Income 
per capita has fallen below USD 900 in Siirt, there is only 
the Kurtalan (Siirt) Cement Factory, which currently 
employs 250 people only.  Other plants are either 
inoperative or closed.

-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  AKP WANTS ELECTIONS CANCELLED IN SIIRT 
(Sabah/Milli Gazete)  AKP petitioned the Higher 
Election Council (YSK) to cancel the elections in 
Siirt due to lack of a ballot council in a Pervari 
(Siirt) village where 700 voters were unable to vote. 
If YSK cancels the elections there, AKP will 
reportedly nominate AKP chairman Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
from Siirt if his political ban is lifted. 
 
 
3.  RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST 
(Evrensel)  The Diyarbakir Chapter of the Human Rights 
Association (HRA) issued a report regarding violations 
experienced during the November 3 parliamentary 
elections.  The report claimed the Democratic People\'s 
Party (DEHAP) was the only political party which 
suffered from rights violations in the region. 
According to the report, DEHAP observers were not 
allowed into schools (to watch vote casting), police 
officers tore electorate information cards, voters 
were subjected to such maltreatments as insults and 
threats, and were forced to cast their votes openly. 
HRA President Selahattin Demir indicated 310 rights 
violations, including arrests, threats, preventions, 
detentions, maltreatments, forcible open vote casting 
and assaults took place in the region prior to and 
during the elections.  Demir claimed village guards, 
village chiefs, jandarma, tribal chiefs, and from time 
to time political parties, had exercised pressure on 
voters and accused them of election fraud. 
 
 
4.  PKK ARRESTS CONTINUE 
(Turkiye)  Gaziantep Security Directorate Anti-terror 
squad arrested three PKK members who had received 
training in a (PKK) camp in northern Iraq.  Police 
found out that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, following 
his capture, had ordered his less known members to go 
to Turkey in order to incite the public to carry out 
mass activities (demonstrations), recruit new members, 
and stage civil disobedience.  The arrestees were 
later arraigned in a local court and ordered to remain 
in custody.  In a separate operation, Jandarma 
arrested eleven people accused of assisting and 
abetting the PKK in Diyarbakir\'s Lice and Hani 
townships.  In Nusaybin (Mardin), police arrested PKK 
member Ibrahim Tanhan while he was trying to take a 
bag full of clothing to PKK members in rural areas.  A 
local court later ordered Tanhan to remain in custody. 
Van police seized one truck load of medical supplies 
and equipment destined for PKK camps in Iran and 
arrested four people in connection with the seizure.

Officer Jonathan Sugden indicated the project was 
far from solving evacuees\' problems.  Attorneys

7.  A WHITE LIE SAVES MARDIN 
(Sabah)  Mardin Residents Education and Solidarity 
Foundation (MAREV) President Ibrahim Ozlen\'s \"UNESCO 
will declare Mardin a world province after Venice and 
Jerusalem\" statement in 2000 has had effects of a 
magic touch on the historic province, which had been 
neglected for years.  This statement has been the 
salvation of Mardin, where the value of historic homes 
rose to USD 200,000 and the number of visitors jumped 
from several thousand to 150,000 people.  Ozlen 
explains the reason for this lie:  \"We were not able 
to attract the attention of the press or anyone else 
no matter what we did.  Everyone claimed ownership 
over and supported my lie.  Even State officials 
believed it.\"

criteria.\"  Claiming no serious steps had been 
taken in the name democratization, Ondul stressed 
legal amendments made (recently) were not clear 
in terms of practice of law.  \"For example, the

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, ADANA 
SUBJECT:  OHAL MENTALITY, IF NOT NAME, PERSISTS IN 
TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST 
 
 
REF: (A) ANKARA 8447;  (B) ANKARA 6116 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Although the GOT lifted the State of 
Emergency in the Southeast (OHAL) November 30, vestiges 
of OHAL rule and a siege mentality among security 
personnel persist.  Kurds in the region continue to wait 
for implementation of promised cultural freedoms, 
including the right to teach the Kurdish language and 
broadcast in Kurdish. This \"wait-and-see\" mentality 
cannot be maintained indefinitely, and as time passes, 
disappointment, and belief that meaningful reform will 
not occur, grow.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
---------------------- 
THE ROAD TO DIYARBAKIR 
---------------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) For years, four security checkpoints guarded the 
road from Bingol to Diyarbakir.  According to Bingol 
Mayor Feyzullah Karaaslan, people still are routinely 
stopped, questioned about travel, and asked to produce 
identification.  Karaaslan said he continues to be 
subjected to significant unnecessary delays on this 
route, which persist long after the ending of OHAL in 
Bingol in 1997.  Passenger vehicles, trucks, tractors, 
and buses are all regularly stopped.  In the case of 
trucks, identification and cargo manifest must be 
presented.  For buses, typically the driver must present 
his identification and license. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Poloff was stopped for 20 minutes at one 
checkpoint on the Bingol-Diyarbakir road, and questioned 
about purpose of travel, parents\' names, previous 
travel, length of time in Turkey, and point of arrival 
in Turkey.  When asked why traffic jandarma had such 
questions, they replied \"for the safety of the people of 
Diyarbakir.  How do we know you are who you say you 
are?\"  This, of course, despite the fact they were 
holding a diplomatic ID issued by the MFA and could see 
the vehicle\'s diplomatic plates.  At all checkpoints in 
the three-hour drive, identification must be presented 
and destination given. 
 
 
----------------------- 
THE PERSISTENCE OF OHAL 
----------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) The State of Emergency lives on, both mentally and 
bureaucratically, and there have been press reports 
alleging the GOT plans to create a \"Coordinating 
Governorate\" for the Southeast(see reftel A).  Whether 
true or not, such reports raise doubts about the GOT\'s 
future plans for the region.  Gov. Aydiner\'s OHAL 
administration continues to exist in Diyarbakir, though 
local political contacts indicated Aydiner has been 
given approximately two months to close down and account 
for all funding. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Provincial governors with whom Poloff met in 
Bingol, Elazig, and Malatya all said they are confident 
that security in the region can be maintained post OHAL. 
Bingol Deputy Governor Ibrahim Suha Karaboran said all 
SUBJECT:  OHAL MENTALITY, IF NOT NAME, PERSISTS IN TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST 
 
 
concerns which OHAL oversaw could now competently be 
handled on the provincial level.  Tunceli Governor 
Mustafa Erkal concurred, saying that security issues had 
taken a back seat to development and employment 
concerns, and did not require super-provincial 
authority.  (NOTE: Provincial governors have long found 
their authority circumscribed by the OHAL 
administration, and have an interest in defending their 
security-based prerogatives.) 
 
 
------------------------ 
A KURD BY ANY OTHER NAME 
------------------------ 
6. (SBU) A raft of cultural-freedom laws was passed as part 
of the August EU-harmonization package (reftel B). 
However, implementation, both in the form of regulation 
and mentality, has yet to occur.  No Kurdish-language 
television broadcasts, radio programs, or courses are 
yet in place.  Moreover, Kurds continue to chafe under 
Birth Registry Law number 1587, which outlaws \"names 
which do not fit Turkey\'s national culture, moral rules, 
customs or traditions, or which harm the general 
public.\"  This law is often used to ban traditional 
Kurdish names; the most recent case in which a parent 
was charged with violation of this law was on November 
26. In March, 25 Batman city council members were 
acquitted on charges of separatist propaganda for 
renaming local streets using Kurdish names. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) With or without OHAL, a restrictive mentality 
persists among government and security officials in the 
Southeast.  Promised reforms and expanded freedoms are 
still pending.  Kurds\' expectations have been raised by 
small liberalizing measures (like the increased 
availability of Kurdish music on cassette and compact 
disc), but could be easily dashed if promised reforms 
are not followed through. End comment.

2.  TURKISH TROOPS ON IRAQI BORDER 
(Hurriyet/Sabah)  A high-level Turkish military 
official made a statement to the British Reuters 
Agency by phone, saying that Turkey has deployed 
10,000-15,000 soldiers and engineers along the 
Iraqi border in preparation for a possible U.S. 
war in Iraq. 
 
 
3.  ECHR ORDERS TURKEY TO PAY INDEMNITY 
(Cumhuriyet)  The European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) ruled against the Government of Turkey in 
connection with six cases, including \"prolonged 
detention, violation of right to fair trial, 
torture, death in custody and prevention of 
freedom of thought\" and ordered a total payment 
of EUR 130,000 (approx. USD 133,000) in 
reparations.  These cases included the killing by 
a landmine of 16-year-old suspect Orhan Yakar, 
arrested in Bingol in 1996, after Yakar was taken 
to a rural area to show a PKK member\'s body. 
ECHR also ordered that Turkey pay Mus resident 
Makbule Kinay, whose home had been burned by 
soldiers, EUR 59,000 (approx. USD 60,300) in 
indemnity. 
 
 
4.  LANDMINE THREAT IN THE SOUTHEAST 
(Sabah)  Turkey faces the problem of over one 
million landmines planted across the Southeast. 
According to the Human Rights Association (HRA), 
600 people, among them children, lost their 
lives, and over one thousand others were injured 
by landmines over the past ten years.  Turkish 
security forces swept 10,638 landmines in various 
border regions by the end of 2001.  However, 
Turkish Armed Forces said USD 12 million is 
initially needed to remove the remaining 
landmines.  Five years and USD 36 million are 
needed to remove all the landmines. 
 
 
5.  CHOMSKY IN DIYARBAKIR 
(Evrensel)  U.S. writer and linguist Noam Chomsky 
held a press conference in Diyarbakir on December 
16 in which he said he had returned to the U.S. 
in a very positive mood following his visit to 
Turkey in 2001.  In answer to the question 
whether or not the U.S. would launch an operation 
against Iraq, Chomsky said it was not easy to 
find a statement of reasons for the resolution 
made by the U.N.  \"No matter what the report of 
weapons inspectors in Iraq is, the U.S. and the 
U.K. have from the very beginning been determined 
to wage a war against Iraq.  The U.N.\'s decision 
clearly foresees disarmament in the region. 
There are thousands of nuclear weapons in the 
hands of Israel.  Saddam Hussein is not the only 
problem in the region,\" he added. 
 
 
6.  3.5 TONS OF UNPROCESSED HEROIN SEIZED IN 
ELAZIG 
(All papers)  In collaboration with U.S. and 
Russian units, Elazig police seized 3.5 tons of 
asitanhidrite in 15 plastic barrels concealed 
among timber on a trailer truck headed for 
Hakkari.  The truck first came to the Samsun Port 
by a ferryboat that left Russia\'s Novorossisk 
Port.  The value of the seized asitanhidrite, 
which was reported to be associated with the 
PKK/KADEK, was estimated at EUR 600,000 (approx. 
USD 613,000).  In the truck, nine people were 
arrested and an unlicensed pistol was 
confiscated.  Five other suspects, including a 
Syrian national, were arrested during ensuing 
operations in Kilis and Ankara.  The 15 arrestees 
were later sent to the (Elazig) State Security 
Court.

2.  ANTI-WAR DECLARATION 
(Bolge/Bolge)  The Cukurova University (Adana) Teaching

opposition to the proposed U.S. operation against Iraq. 
The statement said:  \"The U.S. is preparing for an 
operation against Iraq taking shelter behind the words 
`terror and democracy.\'  The U.S. has been trying to 
maintain its international relations by the way of war 
because the economic basis on which its power is based has 
gradually weakened.  We are concerned over the possibility 
of Turkish support for such an operation intended to bring 
oil regions under control.  With all our might, we are

preparing to become the world empire.\"  Evrensel reported a 
group of Cukurova University students issued a press

Emergency (OHAL) due to personal security will be replaced 
with licenses to own weapons.  Licenses of those who fail 
to apply by January 16 will be declared null and void and 
their weapons seized.  Village guards do not fall within 
the scope of this practice, because officials said the fact 
that OHAL was abolished does not mean the village guard 
system has also been lifted.

commission would investigate all kinds of allegations of 
human rights abuses, eventually coming up with a road map 
on human rights.  According to Elkatmis, torture will be 
the main item on the commission\'s agenda.  \"With laws to be 
passed, there will be no more human rights abuses,\" 
Elkatmis pledged. 
 
 
5.  SES OFFICIAL \"EXILED\" 
(Evrensel)  Health Employees\' Union (SES) Bingol chapter 
President Muharrem Aydinalp and his wife Mevlude Aydinalp

reportedly made although an August investigation against 
Aydinalp turned up no criminal activity.

(approx. USD 12.2 million) donated by the EU for \"Basic 
Education Support Project\" to be carried out in big 
provinces such as Adana, Mersin, Antalya, Bursa and 
Istanbul, which attract intense migration from the 
Southeast.  Adana National Education Director Gungor Kose 
said the project went into effect on September 11 as a 
result of the February 8, 2000 protocol agreement signed 
between the EU and the National Education Ministry.  The 
donation will be used to educate adults, street and working 
children, as well as to turn some schools into multi- 
purpose educational centers for the purpose of training 
illiterate women, girls, and street and working children 
especially in slum areas.

different newspapers reported different reasons for 
the cancellation.  Bolge cited a soccer match, while 
Evrensel reported that the Adana Governor\'s office had 
refused to grant permission due to sensitivity of the 
situation in Iraq, existence of a U.S. base and 
consulate in Adana, intelligence that illegal groups 
might provoke the rally, and personal security of 
American citizens.

Confederation (KESK) Term Spokesperson and Haber-Sen

2.  ANTI-WAR RALLY IN ADANA 
(Evrensel/Milli Gazete/Bolge)  On December 22, nearly 
500 workers, laborers and youths who were members of 
the Labor Party (EMEP), the Freedom and Solidarity 
Party (ODP), the TKP (Turkish Communist Party) and the 
Public Training Centers, all components of the Adana 
War Opponents Platform, gathered in Adana\'s Ugur Mumcu 
Square to protest the December 19 decision by the 
Adana Governor\'s Office to postpone until February the 
proposed anti-war rally the Platform wanted to 
organize on December 22.  \"We do not want to become 
U.S. puppets,\" the protestors said.  Yasin Aytac of 
the Haber-Sen in Adana read a press release on behalf 
of the platform characterizing the postponement as 
\"the throwing backward of humanitarian values.\"  Aytac 
said he did not want the Governor\'s Office and the 
Incirlik Air Base to become the center of war and the 
U.S. Consulate a war representation.  Aytac added the 
U.S. did not have the right to teach anyone the lesson 
of human rights and democracy because none of the 
Middle Eastern administrations which the U.S. 
supported were democratic.  He also criticized the 
U.S. stance on Israel\'s attitude toward Palestine. 
\"We reject a war decision by the government, which 
acts like a satellite or a colonial governor of the 
U.S., on our behalf,\" he indicated.  A similar 
demonstration was held in Izmir, where hundreds of 
thousands of people protested government practices 
thus far and its pro-war attitude.  Turkiye reported 
nearly 1,500 people, including children, attended the 
anti-war rally in Adana, carrying banners and shouting 
slogans that were critical of war and the U.S.

Erdogan, Coast Guard Commander Captain Murat Ozer 
and Security Director Salih Gokalp visited the 
Iskenderun Port, meeting with Operation Director

proposed war in Iraq.  During the exercise, two F- 
16\'s flew over the base, followed by a simulated 
fire in hangars near AWACS early-warning planes.

Bossa building, has been looking for a new office 
space, as its leasing contract will expire next 
month.  Facing reactions from nearby merchants 
following closure of the roads around the Consulate 
due to security reasons, Consulate officials looked 
at another Sabanci building but reached no 
agreement.  Sabanci Holding officals confirmed the 
Consulate\'s effort to find a new office.  Sabanci 
officials said roads around the Consulate, which is 
on Ataturk Street, had been closed as a security 
precaution.  \"The Consulate\'s leasing contract is 
expiring in the New Year.  The fact that the roads 
are closed disturbs the nearby merchants and all 
citizens.  We face pressure from the public and 
merchants.  They (Consulate officials) do not want 
to move out, but we asked them to move.  Then, 
Consulate officials began to seek a new place,\" they 
added.  Sabanci officials indicated temporarily 
moving the consulate initially to Hilton-Sa and then 
to another building entered the agenda.  They gave 
the following information:  \"Their move to Hilton-Sa 
was not accepted.  We showed them the closed Gunes 
Newspaper facility, a property that belongs to the 
Sabanci Holding\'s Ex-Sa company, on the Adana-Ceyhan 
highway.  Consulate officials examined the ... 
building ....  They wanted to lease it but we 
informed them we want to sell it.  They will inform 
us of their decision after evaluating the building\'s 
status.\"

Directorate denied parent Mehmet Sert permission to 
give the Kurdish name \"Rozerin\" (\"Sun-light Blonde\")

receive permission because \"Rozerin was the name of 
KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan\'s bodyguard.\"

(Cumhuriyet)  Bullet casings found following the

(MUSIAD) Malatya President Selahattin Asan warned 
the price of Turkey\'s involvement in the war would 
be very high.  Hurriyet quoted Iskenderun (Hatay)

humanity.  Business circles in Adana, Mersin and 
Tarsus (Mersin) signed a joint declaration saying 
that \"the operation on Iraq for which the United 
States is making preparations is not based on 
legitimate grounds; all the states in the world, 
particularly our country, should oppose this issue 
unless a United Nations\' decision has been 
obtained, and that the likely war would bring great 
material and moral losses to our country, 
especially to the Cukurova (Adana) region, and that 
we announce to the public opinion that our country 
should not take part in this war unless a United 
Nations\' decision has been obtained\". 
 
 
16.  INTERIOR MINISTRY BANS VILLAGE GUARDS FROM 
POLITICS 
(Evrensel)  A recently circulated Interior Ministry 
decree bans Hakkari village guards from becoming 
administrators or members of political parties.

17.  FAMILY PLANNING 
(Cumhuriyet)  A report by the Diyarbakir Chamber of 
Physicians revealed that women in the Southeast 
have insufficient information about birth and 
family planning.  While 61% of women do not get any 
pre-delivery medical care, 58% do not use any birth 
control methods.  Fifty-four per cent of births 
take place at home and 0.062 of babies are 
stillborn, while the infant mortality rate is 0.076 
per cent.  The report noted that it was mandated by 
law to get a spouse\'s consent for sterilization, 
and that there were claims of forced birth-control 
methods in the region.  The report emphasized that 
it was up to the individual to choose any birth- 
control methods after being informed adequately. 
\"The OHAL Regional Governor\'s teams should be 
removed from family planning services.  While these 
services are being rendered, modern, scientific, 
legal, and moral principles should not be 
neglected.  Especially legation of tubes 
(sterilization) should only be applied on a 
voluntary basis, not through any incentives, 
persuasion, or pressure,\" the report said. 
 
 
18.  ADANA\'S SEYHAN DISTRICT MAYOR TO JOIN CHP

chapter of the State Employees\' Union Confederation 
(KESK) issued an anti-war press release calling for 
opposition to war.  Akif Ekici of the Gaziantep 
Organized Industrial Zone said a new intervention 
in Iraq would result in such negative effects as 
market losses and decreases in employment and 
production.  Evrensel (01/07) quoted State 
Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK) Mersin 
Chapters Platform Term Spokesperson Recep Kara as 
voicing opposition to involvement in a war that had 
nothing to do with Turkish people.  The presidents 
of the Mersin Genel-Is labor union and Egitim-Sen 
teachers union opposed war, as it would bring 
nothing but suffering and tears.  The Egitim-Sen 
secretary general called on laborers for active 
 
SIPDIS 
opposition to war.  The Turkish Union of Architects 
and Engineers Chambers (TMMOB) Van Provincial 
Coordination Council President indicated a possible 
war in Iraq would bring destruction to all the 
people in the Middle East. 
 
 
3.  SIRNAK RESIDENTS STOCKPILING FLOUR 
(Sabah)  Residents of Sirnak\'s Silopi township have 
been rushing to flourmills in an effort to 
stockpile sacks of flour prior to the possible U.S. 
operation against Iraq.  Six flourmills in the 
province are not able to meet the demand, while 
eight trailer trucks affiliated with the Turkish 
Red Crescent Society are reported to have unloaded 
materials in Silopi.  \"Although we have a daily 
capacity of 125-175 sacks, we cannot keep up with 
the demand,\" said a local miller.  Evrensel (01/07) 
quoted Silopi merchants as wanting \"investments, 
not war\" in the region.

WAR 
(Cumhuriyet)  Landmines planted as part of the 
fight against the PKK in Silopi\'s (Sirnak) Ova 
village, which is on the Iraqi border, killed three 
people and damaged four tractors in 2001.  In the 
same year, other ammunition such as mortar shells 
and hand grenades also caused the death of 19 
people and the injury of 34 others in the region. 
War preparations along the Iraqi border have led to 
increased concerns on the part of Southeastern 
people that they might return to dark days again. 
Evrensel reported a four-fold increase in rental 
prices as a result of reports stating that U.S. 
soldiers would come to the district.

people who had come from Sanliurfa to join KADEK. 
The four arrestees reportedly admitted having 
traveled to join KADEK. 
 
 
6.  \"TRICKY TRIAL FOR USE OF KURDISH\" 
(Evrensel)  Attorney Sedat Yurttas of the 
Diyarbakir Bar Association claimed the State was 
trickily opening cases for \"membership in an 
illegal organization (i.e., KADEK/PKK)\" or 
\"assisting and abetting an illegal organization 
(KADEK)\" instead of directly opening cases against 
the use of Kurdish language and culture.  Attorneys 
alleged such cases de facto violated EU 
Harmonization Laws. 
 
 
7.  MALATYA SUPPORT FOR DIYARBAKIR PETITION DRIVE 
(Evrensel)  Malatya\'s Inonu University students 
issued a January 5 press release in front of the 
province\'s post office in support of the \"I Want My 
University Initiative\" campaign launched by Dicle 
University (Diyarbakir) students.  The students 
called for reforming the structure of the Higher 
Education Council (YOK), which they characterized 
as a product of the \"September 12\" military regime 
and an obstacle to science and free thought in 
universities.  They carried \"No to YOK,\" \"Free of 
charge, Scientific and Democratic Education,\" 
\"Budget to Education, Not War\" and \"No to YOK Bill\" 
banners and shouted anti-YOK slogans.

8.  DELAY IN RE-OPENING OF ADANA AIRPORT DRAWS 
CRITICISM 
(Bolge)  Residents of Adana criticized a delay in 
completion of the repair project at the Adana 
Airport, which was closed by the State Airports 
Administration (DHMI) to flights on November 4. 
Residents described the airport\'s closure for 
repair during winter conditions as \"an example of 
irresponsibility.\"  DHMI officials had previously 
announced they would try to complete the repair 
project and re-open the airport by mid-January. 
Muslim pilgrim candidates, however, complained they 
were not being given a definite date on which they 
could fly to Saudi Arabia, as it is not known when 
the airport would resume operation.

foreign tourists visiting Gaziantep museums 
increased 141.7% in 2002, rising to 45,933 people, 
compared to 19,000 visitors in 2001.  The increase 
was attributed to the display in these museums of 
mythological mosaics unearthed during excavations

submerged by water from Sanliurfa\'s Birecik Dam. 
 
 
11.  TRUCKER PROTEST ENDS

an agreement between the truckers and the 
contracting firm that foresees that truckers will 
receive a payment of TL 15 million (approx. USD 9) 
per day after a three-day waiting period, truckers 
began to unload their cargoes.  Currently, 1,700

\"BALCONIES OVERLOOKING INCIRLIK AIR BASE FOR RENT\" 
(Radikal/Bolge)  Merchants at the Wholesalers\' 
Complex across from Adana\'s Incirlik Air Base 
offered the balconies of their places of business 
for rent prior to the possible U.S. operation 
against Iraq.  Some media organizations wanted to 
rent these workplaces\' balconies to watch the 
taking off and landing of fighters and other 
military planes more comfortably.  One merchant who 
refused to disclose his name announced having 
allocated his balcony to a television station. 
 
 
INCREASED ANTI-WAR SENSITIVITY IN MALATYA 
(Evrensel)  Representatives of organizations and 
institutions forming the Malatya War Opponents 
Platform pointed to increased anti-war sensitivity 
following reports that the U.S. wants to use that 
province\'s Erhac Air Base in the event of war in 
Iraq.  The representatives stressed that a majority 
of the public were against this war and that it 
could be prevented through the public\'s will. 
 
 
OPPOSITION AGAINST POSSIBILITY OF DIYARBAKIR 
BECOMING A TARGET 
(Evrensel)  Behcet Balik, President of the 
Diyarbakir Young Businessmen\'s Association 
(DIGIAD), expressed opposition to the possible U.S. 
operation against Iraq, saying the use by the U.S. 
of the Diyarbakir Air Base would turn the region 
into a target for Iraq.  Ali Oncu, President of the 
Diyarbakir chapter of the nationwide Tes-Is labor 
union, called for struggle against (this) war.  The 
Diyarbakir Physicians Chamber President, Necdet 
Ipekyuz, said hospitals, physicians and the number 
of beds were not sufficient in Diyarbakir, which is 
included in the list of critical provinces due to 
U.S. preparations for an operation against Iraq. 
The SES health employees\' union Diyarbakir chapter 
president complained the State did not care about 
the region\'s people. 
 
 
KANADOGLU:  ERDOGAN CANNOT BE NOMINATED FROM SIIRT 
(All papers)  Supreme Court of Appeals Chief 
Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu said new candidates 
cannot be nominated in the Siirt elections, which 
are characterized as \"a continuation and renewal\" 
of the November 3 parliamentary elections, 
signaling that he would object to AK Party leader 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s candidacy (in that 
province).  Kanadoglu based his argument on the 
Member of Parliament Election Law\'s Article 25, 
which prevents nomination of new candidates in the 
renewal of an election, as well as on Article 16, 
which says one person cannot run twice in the same 
election, i.e. from two different constituencies. 
Thus, Kanadoglu expressed an opinion against a 
(recent) Higher Election Council (YSK) decision 
stating that \"new candidates may be nominated in 
the Siirt elections in the event of a resignation 
or death.\"  Kanadoglu indicated the recent 
Constitutional amendments removing legal obstacles 
in front of Erdogan could not be implemented in the 
Siirt elections, as they were \"a continuation\" of 
the November 3 elections.  He noted that these 
rules would only be valid in case of a by-election. 
Sabah quoted AK Party officials as negatively 
reacting to Kanadoglu by saying that \"it is YSK 
that will make a decision on this\".  AK Party vice 
national president Dengir Firat noted that acting 
with Kanadoglu\'s mindset would mean that Fadil 
Akgunduz can re-nominate himself.  (Note: 
Akgunduz, a fugitive sought for swindling for a 
long time, was elected to the parliament in the 
November 3 elections through an election campaign 
carried out by his attorney, but was arrested and 
jailed soon after the Siirt elections were 
canceled.) 
 
 
VILLAGE GUARD SALARIES UNDER INVESTIGATION 
(Turkiye)  The Bitlis Governor\'s Office launched a 
comprehensive investigation to look into monthly 
salaries and severance pay paid to local village 
guards since 1990.  The investigation stemmed from 
increased complaints that some village guards had 
received payments although they should not have 
been paid and vice versa. 
 
 
ALLEGATIONS OF PRESSURE AGAINST MARDIN INMATES 
(Evrensel)  Relatives of inmates incarcerated in 
Mardin\'s E-type prison complained about 
maltreatment in the prison.  Inmates\' complaints 
included: 
- Fourteen inmates were put in six-person wards 
  and 24 inmates in eight-person ones; 
- Wards\' walls were painted in colors 
  displeasing to inmates\' eyes; 
- Threats of epidemic diseases; 
- Poisoning from prison food; 
- Prohibition of publications not banned by 
  courts; and 
- Insult by soldiers and prison guards. 
 
 
SANLIURFA VILLAGERS APPLY TO HRA FOR ASSISTANCE 
(Evrensel)  Mehmet Sakin, a resident of Siverek\'s 
(Sanliurfa) Hebana village whose brother was 
seriously wounded when five local village guards 
allegedly opened fire on their vehicle on route to 
Viransehir to take revenge because of a blood feud 
between them, applied to the Human Rights 
Association (HRA) in Gaziantep for assistance. 
Based on Sakin\'s testimony, the village guards were 
arrested, but were later set free. 
 
 
HONOR KILLING IN BATMAN 
(Cumhuriyet/Radikal/Turkiye)  Twenty-four-year-old 
Sevide Uyanik of Sason\'s (Batman) Gecitli village 
was found dead on December 30, with her three-day- 
old baby strangled and thrown two kilometers 
outside the village.  Uyanik\'s relatives reported 
the incident to the local Jandarma command as a 
suicide.  However, an investigation by the Sason 
Prosecutor\'s Office revealed that Uyanik had 
delivered a baby before dying and that there were 
signs of two Kalashnikov bullets in her body.  Her 
son and brother-in-law Mahmut Uyanik, to whose home 
she and her husband\'s second wife moved after her 
husband had been ordered held for smuggling, were 
arrested.  The arrestees were later ordered to 
remain in custody.  Prosecutor Mehmet Firat said a 
DNA test would help find out who the baby\'s father 
was, how it died, and with whom the killed woman 
had an intercourse.  Firat added that a sample 
taken from the baby\'s body had already been sent to 
the Istanbul Forensic Medical Department (for 
analysis). 
SANLIURFA YOUTHS AGAINST THE CLAN SYSTEM 
(Evrensel)  A survey carried out by a group of 
Sanliurfa\'s Harran University students on 83 of 
their peers, among them 33 women, showed that 
youths were against the \"clan\" or \"tribal\" system 
that still prevails in the Southeast.  The survey 
also found out that 40% of the students were clan 
members, while 63% thought it was not important to 
have ties to a clan. 
 
 
DEFENDANT IN THE CASE OF SLAIN THAI TOURIST 
CONVICTED 
(Turkiye)  The Sanliurfa Felony Court convicted 21- 
year-old Serdar Beyazit of \"rape, murder and 
extortion.\"  Beyazit was the only defendant in the

dead in her room of a Sanliurfa hotel after being 
sexually assaulted and killed.  Beyazit was 
sentenced to a prison term of ten years for 
extortion, seven years for rape and life 
imprisonment for murder. 
 
 
\"WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM\" CASE AGAINST ADANA 
MAYOR DURAK 
(Radikal/Milliyet)  Adana Mayor Aytac Durak faces a 
\"Where did you get it from\" case.  (Note: 
Ironically, the Mayor himself once brought a libel 
suit against individuals who had said of him:  \"He 
owns half of Adana\".)  Following a complaint to the 
Justice Ministry and reports by a local newspaper 
on Durak and his family\'s assets and property, 
Interior Ministry inspectors launched an 
investigation against Durak.  According to the Land 
Registry Office, Durak and his spouse own 1.7 
million square meters of land; his son and daughter 
have 17 houses/apartments and places of business 
(offices).  Prosecutor Vedat Mentes opened the case 
after he found out Durak had acquired enormous 
wealth after being elected mayor.  If convicted of 
\"untrue property declaration and unjust property 
obtainment,\" Durak will be sentenced to a prison 
term of eight years and his unjustly-obtained 
property will be confiscated. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
\"ATATURK DAM PRINTING MONEY\" 
(Cumhuriyet)  Sanliurfa\'s Ataturk Dam and Hydro- 
electric Power Plant produced over five billion 
kilowatt hours of energy (electricity), amounting 
to nearly USD 250 million.  Production by the eight 
units (turbines) of the Ataturk Dam, which 
constitutes the most important part of the 
Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), exceeded 2002 
targets. 
 
 
COMMERCIAL CREDITS FOR ADANA BUSINESSMEN 
(Milliyet/Bolge)  Disbank and the Adana Chamber of 
Commerce (ACOC) signed a protocol agreement to 
enable ACOC members to take advantage of Disbank\'s 
\"Entrepreneur Support Credit\".  Under the 
agreement, Disbank will provide small- and medium- 
scale industries (KOBI\'s) with long-term, fixed- 
rate and flexible-paying commercial and other 
credits ranging from TL 5-50 billion (approx. USD 
3,000-30,000). 
 
 
FOREIGN INTEREST IN SANLIURFA KILIMS 
(Milli Gazete)  Kilims woven by 50 Siverek 
(Sanliurfa) girls in carpet looms established by 
the Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation, an 
affiliate of the district governor\'s office, 
reportedly have entered the European market.  The 
paper points to big demand from Denmark, Germany, 
the Netherlands, France and other European 
countries for these kilims bearing historical, 
Central Asian, and Karakeci (an ancient Turkish 
tribe) motifs. 
 
 
TOBACCO FARMERS NOW FREQUENTERS OF COFFEEHOUSES 
(Evrensel)  With tobacco cultivation declining 
nearly to zero, tobacco farmers in Batman\'s Kozluk 
township are now spending their time in local 
coffeehouses.  A majority of Kozluk\'s 30,000 people 
are now jobless as there are not many job 
opportunities outside tobacco cultivation.  The 
number of coffeehouses has reportedly risen to a 
peak of 60 from only four or five two years ago.

1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for January 9, 2003.  Please note that Turkish

exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
2.  SEVENTY-FIVE DIE IN PLANE CRASH IN DIYARBAKIR 
(All papers)  An RJ 100-type plane that left 
Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. for Diyarbakir with 75 
passengers and five crew members aboard crashed 
near a military zone five kilometers away from the 
Diyarbakir Airport at 8:15 p.m. on the same day. 
Seventy-five people, including six foreigners, 
three babies, two pilots and three crew members, 
died, while five people thrown out at the time of 
the crash escaped the crash with injuries.  (Note: 
One Amcit was among the dead.  Ankara reporting 
septel.)  After the crash, which was attributed to 
\"intense fog\", soldiers encircled the crash site. 
After falling, the plane fell apart, followed by 
explosions.  Bodies are reported to be in an 
unrecognizable state due to burns.  Experts pointed 
to the lack of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) 
at the airport.  This system cannot be installed at 
the airport, as Diyarbakir is a military area. 
There were no flights to Diyarbakir for the past 
week due to fog.  Transportation Minister Binai 
Yildirim left for Diyarbakir, taking corpse bags 
with him.  Regarding the crash, Prime Minister 
Abdullah Gul said there was not the possibility of 
terror.  \"Most probably, the weather conditions had 
an effect,\" he added.  Hurrriyet reported a DNA 
test will be conducted unless relatives recognize 
the victims.  Bodies of identified victims will be 
handed over to their families. 
 
 
3.  CRITICISM OF POSSIBLE U.S. OPERATION IN VARIOUS 
AREAS OF THE SOUTHEAST 
Evrensel reported increased criticism of the 
possible U.S. operation against Iraq in Gaziantep 
and Adana, the two provinces that were mostly 
affected during the 1991 Gulf Crisis.  The 
Gaziantep Labor Platform decided to stage an anti- 
war rally to protest U.S. war preparations and the 
(Turkish) government\'s attitude toward this war. 
In Adana, Belma Cingillioglu of the Labor Party 
(EMEP) held a press conference in front of the EMEP 
office in which she said 90% of the public wanted 
Incirlik (Adana) Air Base and other bases closed. 
Human Rights Association (HRA) and Public Training 
Center (Halkevi) officials supported the press 
conference.  Local journalists in Mersin, whose 
port might be used during such an operation, said 
they do not want to publish news articles on the 
destruction to be caused by this Iraq war.  Mersin 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Acting President 
Serdal Kuyucuoglu warned that the province\'s 
economy would never be able to recover if its port 
were used in such a war.  Hurriyet reported that 
the representatives of 15 Mersin professional 
associations, all affiliated with the Turkish Union 
of Architects and Engineers Chambers (TMMOB), 
issued a declaration saying they do not want war. 
Sabah reported that attorneys from bar associations 
throughout Turkey issued an anti-war declaration 
saying that \"Turkey has neither a single child nor 
a penny to sacrifice for oil and arms monopolies\".

anti-war activities through a rally on January 19. 
Nearly 500 people attended the press conference, 
which was supported by democratic mass 
organizations and labor unions.  Sadi Ozdemir, 
President of the Batman chapter of the Human Rights 
Association (HRA), said Turkey\'s involvement in a 
possible war in Iraq would bring nothing but 
hunger, poverty and tears. 
 
 
5.  BLACKOUT INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO GAS STATIONS 
(Evrensel)  The Turkish Petroleum Refineries 
Corporation\'s (TUPRAS) Batman Refinery has given 
blackout instructions to all gas stations along the 
Iraqi border in order to protect the pipeline 
carrying Iraqi oil.  The paper points to increased 
activity across the Southeast as preparations 
continue toward a possible U.S. war in Iraq. 
 
 
6.  ADANA AIRPORT WILL RESUME OPERATION 
(Bolge)  The State Airports Administration (DHMI) 
senior director, Cengiz Asikli, stressed that the 
Adana Airport would re-open to flights beginning on 
January 15, despite a delay in the completion of 
its repair and maintenance project due to weather 
conditions.  The airport was closed to flights on 
November 4 for repair and maintenance. 
 
 
7.  YSK PRESIDENT CRITICIZES KANADOGLU FOR HIS 
STATEMENT 
(Hurriyet/Sabah/Cumhuriyet)  In an answer to a 
journalist\'s question regarding Supreme Court Chief 
Prosecutor Sabih Kanadoglu\'s statement that AK 
Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan could not run in 
the Siirt elections, Tufan Algan, President of the 
Higher Election Council (YSK), reacted negatively. 
\"If the president of every institution goes out and 
expresses his opinion, this will only disrupt the 
State and confuse heads,\" he said.  Algan first 
characterized Kanadoglu\'s statement as \"his 
political thought\" and then as \"his own opinion\".

CONTINUE 
(Sabah/Cumhuriyet)  On January 8, NGO\'s from 
Southeastern Turkey briefed the Parliamentary Human 
Rights Commission, which is preparing to travel to 
inspect the situation in the Southeast after the 
State of Emergency\'s (OHAL) abolition.  \"Current 
problems still continue despite partial 
improvements following the lifting of OHAL,\" they 
claimed.  Fusun Sayek of the Turkish Physicians 
Chamber (TTB) said, \"Health services in the region 
are far from the humanitarian level\", while the 
Association for the Oppressed (MAZLUM-DER) national 
president, Yilmaz Ensaroglu, claimed there were no 
changes in such issues as the village guard system, 
the Village Return Project, and (use of) Kurdish 
names.  Human Rights Association (HRA) Vice 
National President Yusuf Alatas noted that public 
officials viewed OHAL as normal. 
 
 
9.  ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTEST 
(Bolge)  The Adana chapter of the Egitim-Sen 
teachers union staged a January 7 march from the 
city hall to the AK Party provincial office to 
protest the Government\'s decision to repay 
employees for mandatory payroll deductions only on 
a long-term basis.  Protestors shouted anti- 
government slogans despite police warnings.  State 
Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK)-affiliated 
labor unions and such political parties as the 
Republican People\'s Party (CHP), the Freedom and 
Solidarity Party (ODP) and the Labor Party (EMEP) 
gave support by participating in the march.  The 
Egitim-Sen Adana organization issued a press 
release claiming that, during the march, some 
security units had threatened to arrest and \"exile\" 
(i.e., \"transfer\") the chapter president.  The

\"a very good reason\" to enter the province. 
 
 
12.  COLLEGE STUDENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION 
(Evrensel)  The Mustafa Kemal University (Hatay)

conference, Retired judge Musa Ufuktepe said he 
believed Adana Mayor Aytac Durak, who faces a

convicted, as he believes Durak\'s political 
pressure elements have now been eliminated. 
Ufuktepe added he had served on the panel of judges 
handling previous cases against Durak and while 
doing so had encountered political pressure.  He 
accused Durak of having used his political

his relatives\' assets and property must be

POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  BODIES OF NINE FOREIGNERS CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED 
(Milli Gazete/Cumhuriyet)  The Diyarbakir 
Governor\'s Office wrote to several Embassies to 
help identify nine foreigners who were among the 75 
victims of the plane that crashed in Diyarbakir on 
January 8.  A five-person delegation from the Civil 
Aviation National Directorate arrived in Diyarbakir 
on January 10 to investigate the crash.  In 
addition, an investigation is also underway to find 
out the owner of USD 170,000 found on the plane. 
The paper noted that an American came to Diyarbakir 
but was not able to identify the (American\'s) body. 
His family will come from the U.S.  Based on the 
January 10 broadcast of some private television 
stations, Milliyet wrote that British national 
Muhammed Nazmu Haque, one of the crash victims, was 
said to be a member of the British Secret Service, 
MI-5, appointed to watch hot developments in the 
region.  Hurriyet reported allegations that two 
foreigners, Mahmod Dara and Hardi Mohammed Ali, 
whose nationalities could not be identified, were 
MI-5 agents.  An investigation is underway. 
 
 
3.  THY BEGINS TO PAY REPARATIONS 
(Radikal/Hurriyet/Cumhuriyet)  Turkish Airlines 
(THY) has begun to pay USD 21,000 in reparations 
for the victims of the RJ 100-type plane that 
crashed in Diyarbakir.  The insurance company will 
determine the definite amount of indemnity to be 
paid to the victims\' relatives.  The Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) strongly criticized reports 
that \"the TGS had prevented the installment of an 
Instrument Landing System (ILS)\" at the Diyarbakir 
Airport.  The TGS denied having received any 
applications to install an ILS system in 
Diyarbakir. 
 
 
4.  ADANA AIRPORT TO RESUME OPERATION AS OF 
    JANUARY 15 
(Hurriyet)  Cengiz Asikli, President of the Adana 
State Airports Administration (DHMI) Senior 
Director, announced the Adana Airport would re-open 
to flights beginning on January 15.  The airport 
was closed to flights on November 4 for repair and 
maintenance.  Asikli said a 110-person team 
continued to work three shifts to complete the 
repair project.  \"If weather conditions permit, we 
will not postpone the re-opening of the airport,\" 
Asikli added.  THY officials said they have not yet 
begun to sell tickets although the DHMI informed 
them when the airport would re-open. 
 
 
5.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS 
(Evrensel)  A group of 150 Mersin residents 
gathered in front of the Democratic People\'s Party 
(DEHAP) office upon a call by the Mersin Anti-War 
Platform to protest U.S. imperialism.  Officials 
and members of the Democratic People\'s Party 
(DEHAP), the People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP), the 
Labor Party (EMEP), the Social Democrat Party 
(SDP), and the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) 
participated in the protest, criticizing U.S. 
preparations to attack Iraq.  The DEHAP provincial 
chairman read a joint declaration on behalf of the 
platform saying U.S. reasons to hit Iraq were far 
from convincing, the current administration in Iraq 
was a also product of U.S. imperialism and that the 
U.S. was the largest producer and seller of weapons 
of mass destruction.  According to the declaration, 
the U.S. intended to re-draw the region\'s map in 
order to control oil fields in Iraq and the Middle 
East.  In a January 11 press conference, the 
Diyarbakir Peace Platform said the scope and 
outcome of a possible Iraq war planned according to 
the benefit of the U.S. and its allies would be 
devastating in Turkey.  On January 12, The Tunceli 
Anti-war Platform held an anti-war rally attended 
by nearly 1,000 people carrying \"No to the 
Imperialist War\".  Erdogan Colak of the Adana 
Pharmacists\' Chamber said said no one would remain 
insensitive to U.S. preparations to attack Iraq, 
noting that every pharmacy would display an anti- 
war poster.  In addition, political parties, mass 
organizations and business organizations are 
scheduled to hold an anti-war rally on January 18, 
with the Egitim-Sen teachers union launching a 
petition drive and collecting 1,000 signatures in 
three days.  Also, Diyarbakir police arrested six 
Labor Party (EMEP) members for displaying banners 
reading, \"We do not want a government that is a 
puppet of the U.S., Let\'s Stop Invasion of Iraq.\" 
The arrestees were later released. 
 
 
6.  ANTI-WAR STATEMENTS FROM THE SOUTHEAST 
(Evrensel)  Issues such as war, youth and women\'s 
struggle were on the agenda of the People\'s 
Democracy Party (HADEP) Youth Commission during its 
January 6-7 Youth Conference in Diyarbakir. 
Participants emphasized the need for youths to play 
a leading role against U.S. aggression, 
underscoring that joint struggle would stop war. 
AK Party, which had expressed reservations with 
respect to a possible U.S. war in Iraq before the 
(November 3) elections, was criticized for 
forgetting its promises to the public.  A Dicle 
University (Diyarbakir) student said that all 
Diyarbakir and Batman hotels had been reserved for 
U.S. soldiers.  Prolonged deployment of U.S. 
soldiers in Diyarbakir will negatively impact the 
Kurdish culture and values, he argued. 
 
 
7.  TURKISH RED CRESCENT TEAM IN SIRNAK 
(Milli Gazete)  A ten-person delegation 
representing the Turkish Red Crescent Society 
arrived in Sirnak\'s Silopi township to prepare for 
Iraqi nationals likely to cross into Turkey in the 
event of an intervention against Iraq.  The team 
will reportedly engage in the establishment of 
proposed tent cities (along the Iraqi border).  The 
team visited the Sirnak Governor\'s, the Silopi 
District Governor\'s, and the Habur Local 
Administrator\'s Offices, as well as the 
municipality of Silopi and other (public) 
organizations. 
 
 
8.  GAS MASK INTRODUCTION IN ADANA 
(Turkiye)  Residents of Adana, home to the Incirlik 
Air Base, are concerned over a possible U.S. 
operation against Iraq, while gas mask importers 
are now engaged in increased activities.  A gas 
mask supplier, together with a former Civil Defense 
Director, introduced gas masks that are guaranteed 
by the Turkish Standard Institute and can be used 
against chemical gases, urging citizens not to use 
cheap, illegally-imported gas masks.  The supplier 
said he was selling gas masks at TL 200 million 
(approx. USD 120) each and filters at TL 50 million 
(approx. USD 30) each.  He noted the bigger demand 
was from factories, companies and media 
organizations sending personnel to an environment 
of war. 
 
 
9.  RADIKAL:  TORTURE, PKK/KADEK ACTIVITIES 
(Radikal)  on January 10, the Parliamentary Human 
Rights Commission listened to National Police and 
Jandarma officials who in their report said the 
Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP), which they 
associate with PKK-KADEK, had failed to attain the 
results it had anticipated in the November 3 
Parliamentary elections.  The report said illegal 
organizations\' field of activity had expanded after 
the lifting of the State of Emergency (OHAL), with 
illegal organizations\' activities increasing in the 
offices of political parties, associations and 
culture centers.  \"The organization (i.e., PKK- 
KADEK) is preparing to stage demonstrations to 
abolish the village guard system,\" the report 
claimed.  In response to the commission\'s 
questions, national security directorate officials 
denied allegations of \"torturer police officers,\" 
describing such allegations as \"efforts by illegal 
organizations to increase the number of 
applications to the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR)\".  Speaking of a proposal to make torturers 
pay indemnity ordered by the ECHR, the officials 
said such a regulation would reduce the number of 
torture allegations. 
 
 
10.  OHAL GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
Evrensel reported that OHAL in the minds of police 
is not lifted.  Regarding the \"Evaluation of the 
State of Emergency (OHAL) and Adjacent Provinces\" 
report submitted by the National Security 
Directorate to the Parliamentary Human Rights 
Commission, the paper reported police viewed 
activities carried out by labor unions, students 
and workers asserting their rights in the Southeast 
as \"extension of illegal organizations and support 
to an illegal organization (i.e., PKK/KADEK).\"  The 
report characterized college students\' pro-native 
language (i.e., Kurdish) education petitions as \"a 
terror organization\'s (i.e., PKK/KADEK) legal work 
/ operation.\"  The report also described human 
rights violations cries from the Southeast and 
applications to the European Court of Human Rights 
as \"an effort to produce decisions against our 
country\".  Milli Gazete reported the formation of 
six sub-commissions by the Parliament to travel to 
inspect some provinces that remain within the 
jurisdiction of the OHAL Governor\'s Office, between 
January 10-13.  These provinces are Diyarbakir, 
Bingol, Mus, Batman, Mardin, and Tunceli. 
 
 
11.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS CONTINUE 
(Evrensel)  In Manisa, Batman, Van and Diyarbakir 
provinces, groups of people, including children, 
staged demonstrations and marches to protest 
isolation of KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
Ocalan was prevented from meeting with his 
attorneys and family members for the past six 
weeks.  The protestors shouted pro-Ocalan slogans, 
as police took intense security measures during 
these protest demonstrations.  In addition, 
Republican People\'s Party (CHP) Tunceli Deputy 
Sinan Yerlikaya, Justice and Development Party 
(AKP) Agri Deputy Halil Ozyolcu, AKP Bingol Deputy 
Feyzi Berdibek, and AKP Mardin Deputy Nihat Eri 
emphasized the need for the government to refrain 
from unlawful attitudes that might lead to tension, 
at a time when there was need for social peace. 
They said laws and rules must be applied to all, 
without discrimination.

12.  DIONYSUS STATUE DISCOVERED IN ANCIENT CITY OF 
     ZEUGMA 
(Radikal/Bolge)  A statue of Dionysus (God of Wine) 
symbolizing pleasure and amusement was unearthed in 
the ancient city of Zeugma when the level of water 
in the reservoir behind Sanliurfa\'s Birecik Dam 
decreased three meters, helping the statue surface. 
 
 
13.  KONUKOGLU:  WE CHANGED OUR ANCESTORS\' SHOPS 
     INTO HOLDING COMPANIES 
(Turkiye)  Abdulkadir Konukoglu, President of the 
Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company, said the 
fact that the State did not make investments played 
a big role in the success of the Anatolian (Eastern 
and Southeastern Turkey) industrial base. 
Konukoglu attributed Gaziantep\'s industrial 
development to no (State) investments other than 
the railway, the State tobacco and liquor monopoly 
TEKEL, and the cement sector, which was later 
privatized.  According to Konukoglu, in Gaziantep, 
Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Armenians lived 
together for centuries, starting their own 
businesses by learning about handcrafts from one 
another.  \"Our ancestors (grandfathers) turned 
these shops into small plants, our fathers into 
factories, and we into holding companies,\" he 
added.  \"If the State had made investments, my 
grandfather would leave his handcrafts business and 
become or wait to become a public employee, and 
then we would not have these plants.\" 
 
 
14.  MERSIN PLANT TEARS DOWN CHIMNEYS POLLUTING 
     ENVIRONMENT 
(Bolge/Turkiye)  Mersin-based Kromsan Factory, an 
affiliate of the Sisecam Holding Company, held a 
ceremony to bring down its two 19-year-old chimneys 
due to allegations that they had polluted the 
environment.  Mersin Governor Akif Tig attended the 
ceremony, during which he said the 100- and 110- 
meter chimneys were being torn down due to 
transition to new technology and for economic 
reasons.  Tig praised the factory for storing its 
(industrial) waste with the help of new technology, 
instead and added it had contributed to the 
national economy by exporting 70% of its 
production.

2.  BASES UNDER SCRUTINY 
(Radikal/Milliyet/Milli Gazete)  In line with an 
agreement between Turkey and the U.S., a 150-person 
U.S. military delegation began to survey bases and 
airports (in Turkey).  A team that had come from 
Germany to Ankara and Incirlik (Adana) is reported 
to have begun its survey of Diyarbakir, Mus, and 
Batman bases, as well as the ports of Mersin, and 
Iskenderun (Hatay).  The Incirlik team reportedly 
obtained information on whether or not construction 
projects will be carried out in areas they 
surveyed.  The team will leave the base after 
selecting the most convenient place on the base for 
unloading troops and ammunition and obtaining a 
construction permit.  Cumhuriyet claimed that 300 
million USD had been allocated for possible 
upgrading that might enter the agenda based on the 
delegation\'s findings. 
 
 
3.  ALLEGATIONS THAT U.S. WILL RECRUIT MERCENARIES 
(Turkiye)  While preparations continue for a 
possible U.S. operation against Iraq, rumors that 
the U.S. would hire mercenaries began to circulate 
in Silopi (Sirnak).  After the war, mercenaries 
would reportedly be given U.S. citizenship. 
Hearing the rumors, many Silopi residents rushed to 
apply to the offices of muhktars (village chiefs) 
who called the allegations baseless. 
 
 
4.  PLANE CRASH PILOT ERROR 
(All papers)  In a January 13 press conference, 
Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim gave

6.  ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS 
(Milli Gazete/Turkiye)  Adana Chamber of Industry 
President Umit Ozgumus said the possible U.S. 
operation against Iraq would give most damage to 
Turkey.  Bas called on Turkey to comply with U.N. 
resolutions.  Adana Chamber of Commerce (ACOC) 
President Saban Bas, for his part, said a war had

Celebi said DISK supported the anti-war attitudes 
displayed by the government, but did not find 
them sufficient.  Celebi indicated that the fact 
that DISK Regional Representative\'s Office had 
been re-opened in Diyarbakir after a long period 
of time was a significant step for workers.  He 
noted that the region had not experienced 
ordinary life for a long time, facing economic, 
as well as social and cultural, difficulties.  He 
added:  \"During this time, people could not enjoy 
their fundamental human rights and political 
freedoms.  New obstacles emerge just when some 
things are about to change.  A war threat and 
ploys of those expecting a profit from a war 
emerge.  The reason why we are having our meeting 
here is extremely obvious.  A war is at our 
doorstep, that is, right next to our Southeast. 
We will suffer its pains and difficulties all 
together.  Our citizens in Istanbul and those in 
Diyarbakir, Sirnak, and Hakkari will not live 
(suffer from) the problem at the same level.  Our 
Southeastern provinces and villages will be among 
targets of mortar shells and long-range missiles. 
Established orders (peace and order) will be 
disrupted, newly-established homes will be ruined 
once again.\"  Celebi stressed that DISK would 
shout anti-war cries at Sirnak\'s Habur border 
gate, (possible U.S.) war\'s zero point, on 
January 24 and start staging new anti-war 
demonstrations beginning on January 26.  Turkiye

Nuclear Engineer Yilmaz Bektur said Turkey was 
not under the threat of nuclear attack, claiming 
that the seminar was not related to war.  \"We are

nuclear energy has entered our lives at all

tongue education, as well as amendments to the 
Meetings, Demonstrations and Marches Law, as 
positive.  Demirtas claimed human rights abuses 
increased despite these improvements.  Demirtas 
noted that bans on the import of certain 
newspapers and magazines had automatically ended 
with the lifting of OHAL, but \"OHAL habits\" 
continued.  He pointed to a 101% increase in 
landmine accidents in 2002 compared to the 
previous year.  Arrests of pro-mother tongue 
advocates increased by 15%, with torture

turning into social unrest, endangering peace and 
compromise efforts in recent years.

removed his name from the list despite having 
received most of the votes during the elections 
held to name the rector.  Canoruc described the 
situation as \"inconsistent with good intentions.\" 
Canoruc claimed the situation had caused the 
university to lose blood because around 100 
teaching staff had not been given their academic 
titles although they had gained the right to become 
assistant, associate, and full professors.  He

Professor Kemal Guruz wanted to disrupt professors\'

incident was being exaggerated.  An official from 
the Brigade claimed that Kutlu\'s wife had been

memorandum to chief prosecutors\' offices for open 
prison visits during the nine-day Sacrifice Holiday 
beginning on February 9.  Inmates and prisoners in 
13 prisons across the country, including those in 
Adana, Gaziantep, and Mersin, will make use of open 
prison visits for a period of up to six days 
between February 9 and 14, thereby permitting 
prisoners and visiting family members to mix 
freely. 
 
 
16.  OVER 48 KILOS OF HEROIN SEIZED IN MERSIN 
(Turkiye/Milliyet/Cumhuriyet/Bolge)  Acting on a 
tip, Mersin police seized 48.4 kilograms of heroin 
smuggled in through Van\'s Baskale township and 
destined for other countries.  One suspect was 
arrested, while police are searching for two other 
suspects.  In a separate operation in Adana, police 
raided the home of a drug courier and arrested a 
total of six people preparing for a cocaine party. 
Ninety-four grams of cocaine and 20 ecstasy pills 
were confiscated.  Three arrestees were later 
ordered to remain in custody. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
17.  SUPPORT FOR ZEUGMA 
(Milliyet)  Bilal Necmettin Erdogan, son of AK 
Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, asked for 
assistance from Culture Minister Huseyin Celik when 
Bilal\'s archaeology teacher, a consultant to 
Hewlett Packard Humanities Foundation (HPHF), 
requested him to do so.  Minister Celik said Bilal 
had contacted him to help HPHF overcome 
bureaucratic difficulties regarding its sponsorship 
for archaeological excavations in the ancient city 
of Zeugma (Gaziantep) and establishing a museum. 
\"Being a foreign foundation, HPHF faced 
difficulties with respect to the excavations.  They 
(HPHF) will transfer USD 50 million for the 
excavations and we, as the Culture Ministry, want 
these excavations to continue,\" Celik added.  Celik 
noted that he was planning to bring together 
Gaziantep\'s Sanko Holding Company, which has 
Zeugma\'s name rights, and the Gaziantep Chamber of 
Commerce, an HPHF.  Abdulkadir Konukoglu, owner of 
Sanko, said the name \"Zeugma\" belongs to history. 
\"We will not put any obstacles before them (i.e. 
HPHF) if their goals are to be beneficial to 
Zeugma,\" Konukoglu argued. 
 
 
18.  GAZIANTEP CARPET EXPORTS UP OVER 50% IN 2002 
(Bolge)  According to Yalcin Konukoglu, President 
of the Gaziantep Carpet Producers and Merchants 
Chamber, machine-made carpet exports from the 
province increased 52% in 2002, rising to USD 126.9 
million from USD 83.5 million in 2001 despite the 
economic crisis.  Major customers included such 
countries as the U.S., the U.K., Greece, and 
Germany. 
 
 
19.  EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN (SILOPI) SIRNAK 
(Radikal/Bolge)  The Sirnak Governor\'s and the 
Silopi (Sirnak) district Governor\'s Offices spent 
TL 6 trillion (approx. USD 3.6 million) for 
educational projects in Silopi over the past three 
years.  In the same period, the number of 
classrooms across the district increased nearly 
100%, rising from 170 to 330.  As a result of these 
projects, the number of students fell from 100 to 
40 per classroom.  The projects were financed 
mostly through donations and revenues from the 
district\'s Habur border gate.  In addition, the 
National Education Ministry donated computer 
laboratories in some schools; a local school came 
first at a nationwide website design competition. 
 
 
20.  VILLAGE RETURN PROJECT INCREASES HONEY 
PRODUCTION Dunya reported that the Village Return 
Project had led to an increase in honey production 
in Bitlis, which reportedly has potential to 
produce nearly 800 tons of honey.

SUBJECT:  THE VIEW FROM SIRNAK PROVINCE: 
\"LET US REBUILD THE CHIMNEY-LESS FACTORY\" 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: In southeastern Turkey\'s Sirnak 
province, one of two bordering Iraq, the 
preoccupation of government officials, NGOs, and 
businessmen is less about war than about war\'s 
aftermath.  The populace is desperate to revive 
border trade and commerce.  Kurdish interlocutors 
worry that the GOT might continue to wall off 
northern Iraq in the interest of political-strategic 
considerations, at the expense of the economic well 
being of the region.  GOT officials and Kurdish 
representatives do not seem to gauge some human- 
rights demands - such as language rights and village 
return - with the same scale.  End summary. 
 
 
2.  (U)  On January 13-14, Adana Political-Economic 
Officer and FSN Political Assistant paid calls on 
government official, NGOs, and businessmen in Sirnak 
province.  The province has a population of 
approximately 250,000, probably 99 percent Kurdish. 
As a result of the armed struggle with the PKK, the 
province has seen a huge migration of villagers into 
the cities.  Of the twelve southeastern provinces 
placed under a State of Emergency in 1987, Sirnak 
province was one of the last two (the other being 
Diyarbakir province) to have the regime lifted -- on 
November 30, 2002. 
 
 
Cizre 
:::::::: 
 
 
3.  (U)  Cizre, located on the banks of the Tigris, 
is the largest city in the province, with a 
population of approximately 110,000.  Its economy 
has become hostage to the vicissitudes of cross- 
border trade between Turkey and northern Iraq. 
Almost certainly the most common profession in Cizre 
is that of trucker.  Rigs of various dimensions are 
everywhere.  At the moment, most are either idle or 
else rusting away in truck mass-graveyards sprinkled 
throughout the surrounding countryside.  As for the 
queue of trucks lined up on the Turkish side waiting 
to cross the nearby Habur gate into northern Iraq, 
we counted no fewer than 150. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  Adnan Elci, president of the Cizre 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the economic 
situation has been bad ever since the Gulf War more 
than a decade ago, and is getting worse.  Prior to 
the events of 9/11, many Cizre-area residents were 
able to make money by hauling goods to northern Iraq 
and bringing back diesel fuel for sale in Turkey - 
technically in contravention of the UN embargo but 
winked at by both Turkish and U.S. authorities.  In 
this diesel trade, truckers could expect to make one 
or two trips per month into northern Iraq.  On that 
basis, a Cizre-based trucker could make a living. 
At its peak, some 40-50,000 trucks were involved in 
the diesel trade.  The closing down of this trade 
after 9/11 brought the local economy to a 
standstill. Elci himself had recently spent a month 
in northern Iraq.  Daily life for residents of 
northern Iraq, according to him, was now better than 
it was for people on the Turkish side of the border 
- an opinion we heard from other interlocutors in 
Sirnak province.  When asked whether he thought the 
new AKP government would do anything from Ankara to 
improve life along the border, he flatly replied no, 
adding that he did not believe that the new 
government had the courage of its convictions.  As 
for the prospect that eventual EU membership for 
Turkey might improve life in Cizre, Elci flatly 
stated that EU membership would never happen. 
 
 
Silopi 
::::::::: 
 
 
5.  (U)  The Mayor of Silopi, Neset Oktem (formerly 
DYP, now independent), has been in office for two 
terms.  His city now has perhaps 80,000 residents, a 
very large percentage of whom came as migrants from 
the countryside.  As with Cizre, the economy is a 
border-city economy, and cross-border trade is its 
only \"industry,\" or, as we heard it described, its 
\"chimney-less factory.\"   Silopi is the closest city 
to the Habur gate between Turkey and northern Iraq. 
 
 
6.  (U)  Oktem wants change.  Like many other 
interlocutors in Sirnak Province, he offered his 
hope that war with Iraq could be averted and then 
followed up with a pregnant \"but.\"  Even though 
Silopi has no jobs, people keep coming, in the 
expectation that the border trade sooner or later 
has to revive.  (Note: It is not only rural job- 
seekers who have been coming to Silopi of late. 
Journalists, both foreign and domestic, have been 
thick on the ground lately, we were told.  Unable to 
get permission to go on into northern Iraq, thus 
stranded in Silopi, they have been interviewing 
residents willy-nilly, going so far as to interview 
Silopi primary schoolers about the looming war.) 
 
 
7.  (U)  Oktem saw the re-establishment of border 
trade as the overwhelming priority for the province. 
By comparison, an issue such as Kurdish-language 
rights \"gets me no votes,\" he said.  On this 
particular topic, in fact, the Mayor (who speaks 
Kurdish) showed a flash of indignation.  \"Why,\" he 
asked, \"should I be insisting on my children going 
to school in Kurdish?   Why shouldn\'t I be insisting 
that they learn English or French?\"  The Mayor, who 
incidentally visited four U.S. cities in 1986 on a 
(non-USG sponsored) Turkish mayors tour, went on to 
make other points that seem more likely to come from 
the mouths of Turkish officials than Kurdish 
activists.  For example, he maintained that it was 
now safe for villagers to return to the villages 
they were forced to abandon during the GOT/PKK 
conflict.   He was passionate in his denouncement of 
jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, to whom he 
ascribed responsibility for the more than 1,000 
deaths in his constituency, and vitriolic when 
discussing EU member states that sought to shelter 
Ocalan and his supporters. 
 
 
8.  (U) Kemal Palta is a Silopi-based oil-trader who 
owns a fleet of 10 trucks and also recently opened 
up a flourmill.  (Note: Palta\'s office features 
framed certificates from USAID\'s Office of Foreign 
Disaster Assistance for his role in Operations Quick 
Transit I and II in 1996.)   Mr. Palta\'s assessment 
of the current situation on the border was that, as 
war draws nearer, fewer truckers and traders are 
keen on crossing into Iraq. On the question of 
Kurdish-language rights, Palta opined that recent 
GOT reforms were not uppermost in the minds of 
people in the border region.  Not only was their 
primary concern economic survival, their appetite 
for Kurdish-language media can now largely be met by 
technology.  Short-wave radios and satellite TV 
dishes are commonplace, and some people have access 
to Kurdish websites. 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  Silopi has resident representatives of 
both the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR).  Erdogan Kalkan (UNHCR) and his lawyer 
brother Ihsan Kalkan (IOM Silopi and UNHCR Van) are 
natives of the region who returned after university 
education elsewhere.  In sharing their thoughts 
about the current refugee situation and the possible 
consequences of war, they noted that at the moment 
northern Iraqi Kurds were flowing in both 
directions.  That is, a significant number was now 
returning from Europe in order to resettle in 
northern Iraq.  Erdogan Kalkan cited several 
reasons: they were fed up with their status (or 
\"non-status\") in various European countries; the 
economic and security situation in northern Iraq had 
improved; families were reuniting; and \"Barzani and 
Talabani were calling back their people.\"   Ihsan 
Kalkan, when asked about UNHCR preparations for 
possible war in Iraq, commented that he believed 
everyone involved in refugee preparations and 
operations was better prepared than they had been in 
1991.  UNHCR had acquired experience, and lessons 
had been learned - not just here but also in other 
hot spots around the world over the past decade. 
UNHCR was also doing preparatory work in northern 
Iraq, specifically in Dohuk and Suleimaniye.  He 
emphasized there still remain too many hypotheticals 
in the mix to be able to predict with certainty how 
many refugees might be generated because of war, 
where they would come from, or where they would be 
received. 
 
 
Sirnak 
::::::::: 
 
 
10.  (U)  Unlike Cizre or Silopi, the city of 
Sirnak, the capital of the province, is up in the 
hills.  It is also smaller; its current population 
is probably about 40,000.  This figure is very much 
an estimate.  It has suffered even more than Cizre 
or Silopi from an influx of people from the 
surrounding countryside, and the strain shows. 
Inspectors recently discovered e. coli bacteria 
contamination in the city\'s drinking water, 
apparently due to a lack of money to pay for 
chlorification.  In the side streets of Sirnak cows 
wander freely and can be seen grazing out of garbage 
dumpsters. 
 
 
11.  (SBU)  As the provincial capital, Sirnak houses 
the governor,  Huseyin Baskaya, who has ten years 
experience in the province, having previously served 
as deputy governor.   The Governor prioritizes the 
problems facing the province as follows: 1. 
Commerce, economy, jobs.  2.  Access for livestock 
to high pasturage.  3.  Health and medical services. 
4.  Infrastructure.  5.  Education in general.  As 
for human rights issues - such as torture and 
Kurdish-language rights and village returns - they 
didn\'t make the cut, and he downplayed their 
importance.  He stated that there was no prohibition 
against use of Kurdish in public places, and said 
that Kurdish was freely spoken in his own building. 
There was no longer any restriction against Kurdish 
cassettes or videos, he said. 
 
 
12.  (SBU)  As for village returns, Baskaya provided 
the figure of 33 villages in the province to which 
return has been approved.  Of these, eight have seen 
actual return.  Why was the figure not higher?  His 
explanation was that there was only limited demand - 
a theme that other interlocutors in Sirnak province, 
some of them Kurds, echoed.  Those who want to go 
back to their villages were, he said, almost 
exclusively the elderly.  Younger people do not want 
to go back.  Going further, he outlined what he, as 
a representative of the Turkish government, had 
offered to potential returnees.  The government can 
provide roads, sewage, electricity, some basic 
building materials, and leveling of the ground to 
allow for new construction.  His tone implied this 
was a reasonable and generous offer by the state, 
and that it was up to villagers to do the rest.  He 
expressed the belief that many displaced villagers 
had unrealistic expectations that the state could, 
would or should do more.  This belief had perhaps 
been inadvertently encouraged, he noted, by the fact 
that the Sirnak authorities had in fact built a 
couple of \"model villages\" from scratch not far 
outside of town.  He also expressed suspicion that 
some displaced villagers were not in fact interested 
in village return per se, but rather in acquiring a 
second or \"country\" house.  He cited an example of a 
villager who sought to have the government pay him 
wages for time spent rebuilding his own house in his 
village.  We raised the question of what kind of 
paperwork, if any, displaced people must submit 
before being able to return to their village.  The 
Governor justified this requirement as being normal 
and sensible.  The State had an obligation to know 
where people were so that it could better protect 
them, he said, whether it be from land mines or the 
depredations of terrorists. 
 
 
13.  (SBU)  Around the corner from the Governor\'s 
office, in the office of Osman Cihan, the acting 
mayor (HADEP) of Sirnak, one hears a rather 
different take on the current situation.  Cihan said 
the people of Sirnak do not trust the government. 
In the matter of village returns, for example, he 
claimed that the Governor\'s good intentions might be 
one thing - but what about the military?  It was 
ultimately the military that ran the show and 
reserved for itself the final say about permitting 
returns.  The acting mayor\'s figures for number of 
villages opened for return, and number of villages 
to which return has taken place, did not match with 
those of the Governor.  Kurdish-language rights were 
important to the populace, averred Cihan, despite 
what the government might say.  People would indeed 
like to be able to use Kurdish as a language-of- 
instruction in school and be able to use Kurdish in 
court.  One area, however, where the acting mayor 
and the Governor did agree, however, was that the 
number one priority was jobs.  Cihan cited the 
example of a nearby coal mine, where some 400 jobs 
had been lost when the mine was privatized.  The 
ripple effect of that job loss had been enormous in 
an economy as bad off as Sirnak\'s.  (Note:  The 
acting mayor is a former coal miner himself; now he 
handles carbon in a different molecular 
configuration - his other profession is jeweler. 
End note.) 
 
 
14.  (SBU)  Our final call in Sirnak was on Kamil 
Ilhan, the president of the Sirnak Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry.  Ilhan had only recently 
returned from Iraq, in fact, from Baghdad, where he 
had been a member of Trade Minister Suzmen\'s 
delegation. Evidently, the Ministry had not thought 
to include any representatives from southeastern 
Turkey; Ilhan had raised a stink about it and gotten 
himself included.  Rather than fly with the 
delegation, he chose to drive all the way to Baghdad 
and back. 
 
 
15.   (SBU)  On his drive back to Turkey, Ilhan 
stopped at various places in northern Iraq.  He said 
northern Iraq was running a surplus in a number of 
agricultural items.  In this vein, he showed us a 
list he had prepared of agricultural products from 
northern Iraq that he planned to submit to Ankara 
for import approval.  It was his hope that these 
imported products could be processed in Sirnak.  He 
expressed doubt any such list would be approved by 
Ankara.  Even in a post-Saddam era, he declared, it 
was not clear whether Ankara would welcome bustling 
trade and economic development in the Kurdish region 
of southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq.   When 
asked what his chamber\'s wish list would look like, 
he named four things.  First, free trade across the 
border.  This would bring a huge multiplier effect. 
Truck traffic would spawn all kinds of ancillary 
economic activity, all the way from hotels and 
restaurants through automotive facilities all the 
way to little boys selling ice by the roadside. 
Second, the resumption of the diesel trade - even if 
Iraqis and not just Turks got into the business. 
Third, special concessions to businesses in Sirnak 
province for processing agricultural imports from 
northern Iraq.  These concessions would be 
necessary, he believed, to enable small Sirnak firms 
to stand up to the competition of large Turkish 
firms.  Fourth, permission for cross-border joint 
ventures.  There were so many family and cultural 
links across the Turkey-Iraq border that it would 
make economic sense.  As an example, he mentioned a 
chicken-processing plant he himself had opened in 
Sirnak province a while back, only to have it go 
into the red and fail.  If he could, he would open 
that same business in northern Iraq tomorrow.  That, 
however, he continued, may be precisely what the 
Turkish state feared. 
 
 
16.  (SBU) Comment:  While the debate about Iraq in 
Turkey and indeed throughout the world often seems 
to turn on questions of morality and international 
law, the view from Sirnak Province is pragmatic and 
it is focused over the horizon.  For one, Saddam 
Hussein is truly hated.  For another, almost 
anything would be better than the ongoing economic 
paralysis.  Turkish officialdom and Kurdish 
activists may not see eye to eye on the importance 
of language rights and village return, but they 
agree that the populace hungers for jobs and 
economic development.  The question being asked by 
people in Sirnak is whether their ties with Kurds 
across the border in Iraq will count as a positive 
or a negative in a post-Saddam era.  End comment.

1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Two staffers from the U.S. 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(aka Helsinki Commission) traveled to Diyarbakir 
January 15-18 for meetings with GOT officials, human 
rights activists, and religious groups.  Key agenda 
items included torture, language rights, and village 
return.  (Staffers\' discussions regarding religious 
freedom issues reported septel.)  In all areas of 
concern, staffers noted gaps between reforms pledged 
and reforms implemented.  End summary. 
 
 
2.  (U)  The staffers - Chadwick W. Gore, Commission 
Staff Advisor and Secretary to the U.S. Delegation 
to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and H. Knox 
Thames, Commission Staff Counsel - met in Diyarbakir 
January 15-18 with GOT officials, locally elected 
officials, and human rights activists in order to 
assess progress in implementation of human-rights 
reform legislation (Refs B - E). 
 
 
Torture - Still a Problem 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
3.  (U)  The number of  terrorism-related arrests is 
down, and so is the incidence of torture, Gore and 
Thames were told in January 15 meetings with Hakki 
Uzun,  Deputy Regional Governor for the former State 
of Emergency Region, and Sait Gurlek,  Diyarbakir 
Province Chief Public Prosecutor.  (Note: As the 
State of Emergency has been lifted, Uzun is now 
presiding over the closing down of his office. 
Saying he is under no particular deadline, he and 
his staff were in the process of filing, archiving, 
and handling administrative tasks.  End note.) 
 
 
4.   (U)  Gore and Thames met January 16 with 
Huseyin Nail Atay, a Deputy Governor of Diyarbakir 
Province.  In this meeting, as in others with GOT 
officials, the staffers handed over a copy of a 
letter to PM Gul signed by Members of Congress from 
the U.S. Helsinki Commission.  The letter contained 
praise for the new government\'s expressed 
commitments to human-rights reform while noting 
ongoing problems in that regard.   Torture was at 
the top.    Atay defended the GOT\'s recent record on 
torture as one of \"great progress.\"  He did not deny 
abuses had occurred, and do still occur, but 
commented that \"at the individual level, government 
officials make mistakes, in the United States, too.\" 
He went on to state that the HADEP party\'s 
provincial chairman had recently admitted that there 
had been no cases of torture of late.\"  (Note: We 
were not able to confirm this remark.  End note.) 
The province had built a new prison - a very 
expensive undertaking.  It met EU standards, he 
asserted. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  Gore and Thames met January 17 with a 
group of lawyers, physicians, and founding members 
of the Diyarbakir chapter of the Human Rights 
Foundation  (HRF) to discuss torture. According to 
the HRF representatives, it was too early to tell 
whether recent legal reforms were having an effect 
on torture.  After the raft of EU-inspired reforms, 
and after the lifting of the State of Emergency two 
months ago, there was now even less reason for 
Turkish authorities to turn a blind eye to torture 
allegations, they reasoned.  Nevertheless, they 
said, to date in Diyarbakir no police, security 
officials, or Jandarma have been brought to book. 
In 2002, the HRF received 80 new allegations of 
torture.  (Note: That means 80 cases first brought 
to their attention in 2002, not 80 cases that 
occurred in 2002.  End note.)   How was it possible, 
they asked, that not a single torturer had been 
punished, even when subsequent medical examination 
can confirm physical injury?  The staffers noted the 
instance of torture in Turkey was widely agreed to 
be decreasing, but asked the HRF about what it was 
seeing in its Diyarbakir office.  The HRF members 
replied that the statistics could be tricky; even 
though torture may nowadays be less common, the 
number of cases actually being reported to the HRF 
was not decreasing.  Cases from yesteryear are still 
popping up.  Since 1999 there have been  fewer 
detentions and arrests; however, the HRF claims, the 
people-in-custody/people-being-tortured ratio has 
not fundamentally changed.   For 2002, the HRF 
provided the following statistics.  Number of cases 
reported: 188.  Number of cases reported that 
alleged political reasons for detention: 186. 
Number of cases reported that were males: 141. 
Female: 32.  Children: 15.  Number of cases reported 
that were acute: 32.  Number of cases reported that 
were chronic: 156. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  In documenting the practice of torture, 
HRF members told the staffers they had observed 
that, as is widely known, practitioners had gotten 
more sophisticated.  \"Subtler\" techniques, designed 
to leave no trace, had been devised.  These include: 
hosing with cold water followed by exposure to cold 
weather or air-conditioning, use of blindfolds, 
painfully loud music, plastic bags to create 
breathlessness, applying gels before using electric 
shock, sand-filled bags instead of clubs for 
beatings, pointing of cocked weapons, and verbal 
threats up to and including death threats. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  A related risk for detained individuals - 
denial of access to lawyers - persists, according to 
HRF members, who described for the staffers a recent 
case in Diyarbakir province in which a large group 
of students was detained.  The security official in 
charge at first denied access to a lawyer, 
apparently unaware that recent changes in Turkish 
legislation guarantee access within 48 hours. 
Access was granted, however, after HRF members 
provided copies of the text of the new legislation. 
After the lawyer had met with the students, however, 
the security director attempted to hold onto the 
lawyer\'s notes.  (Note:  The students had been 
arrested for conducting a protesting against the 
alleged enforced isolation in recent weeks of 
imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.) 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  In summary, the HRF members said torture 
is difficult to eradicate in the region, and 
torturers continue to enjoy impunity, because the 
prevailing mind-set is that what is going on \"is 
being done for the well-being of the State and the 
State accepts this as necessary.\"  One will look in 
vain, they said, for examples of concrete steps 
taken by the State to police itself in this regard, 
that is, convictions of torturers, or even thorough 
investigation of allegations, or even unannounced 
inspections of detention centers.   The HRF claims 
that in the past 17 years, although charges have 
sometimes been brought, not a single public employee 
has been convicted of torture in Diyarbakir 
province. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) The staffers also discussed torture 
January 17 with representatives of the Diyarbakir 
Chamber of Doctors and Physicians Treating Torture 
Victims.   (Note: The Chamber is basically a roster 
of doctors who make themselves available to treat 
torture victims.  End note.)  Chamber 
representatives said recently reported torture 
techniques included exposure while naked to cold 
water and air conditioning, electric shock, and 
squeezing of the testicles.  On a psychological 
level, noted the Chamber representatives, state 
authorities also know how to bring pressure to bear 
on patients.  For example, it is common for law- 
enforcement officers to sit in the room while the 
doctor examines the patient, thereby creating 
intimidation.  The authorities have also taken 
action against certain doctors involved in treating 
torture victims.  For example, two HRF doctors were 
recently reassigned from their position at a state- 
run hospital in Diyarbakir to smaller, outlying 
districts.  (Note:  A doctor is free to open a 
private-practice, but doctors in the public sector 
must serve where assigned.  End note.)  The two have 
repeatedly applied for reassignment but have been 
stuck in place.  Other Diyarbakir doctors have 
suffered even more, serving prison sentences for 
having treated PKK members - wittingly or 
unwittingly.  Upon release from prison, their 
ability to practice medicine has been curtailed. 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  In a January 17 meeting the staffers 
asked Saban Erturk, Diyarbakir State Security Court 
(SSC) Chief Prosecutor, whether he had any current 
investigations underway that might lead to the 
prosecution of alleged torturers.  He replied that 
the SSC did not handle torture cases; they were 
handled by the regular criminal courts.  Erturk said 
changes in Turkish law (refs B and C) demonstrate 
that the Government was serious about ending the 
practice.  \"Any torturers will be accountable,\" he 
said.  He welcomed the idea of unannounced visits to 
detention centers.  When asked if the frequent 
discrepancy between statements given by detainees 
while in custody and statements given by detainees 
at trial might be attributable to torture, the 
Prosecutor said no.  \"They lie,\" he said.  (Note: 
In the Turkish legal system, a defendant cannot be 
charged with perjury.  End note.) 
 
 
11.    (SBU)  The Chief Prosecutor praised the SSC 
system as being an elite system.  (Note: He himself 
has 22 years experience as a prosecutor, and is now 
one of only seven Chief Prosecutors in the nation - 
arguably the one with the toughest circuit.   He is 
also a former International Visitor Program grantee. 
End note.)   He said the judges in the SSC system 
were first-rate and that 80 percent of the cases 
ended in conviction.  In this way, he said, the SSCs 
are fulfilling their mission of protecting the 
Turkish people from terrorism.  He commented that 
Americans often consider as \"rights\" certain 
activities that are explicitly prohibited by Turkish 
law, for example, questioning the indivisibility of 
the state or fomenting division along religious or 
Marxist grounds.   He had been to America and 
admired its \"vastness of freedom of expression,\" he 
said, but Americans must remember that \"in this 
country thousands of people had been killed by 
terrorists and up in the mountains there were still 
hundreds of terrorists\".  (Note: The day before, 
January 16, in Lice in Diyarbakir Province, a clash 
between Turkish military and PKK elements had 
resulted in one death and five wounded on the 
military side and an undisclosed number of 
casualties on the PKK side.  End note.) 
 
 
Language Rights - Still Waiting 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: 
 
 
12.  (U)  The staffers asked Diyarbakir Province 
Deputy Governor Atay whether broadcasting in Kurdish 
would begin any time soon. Atay replied, rather 
tangentially, that it was a mistake to consider 
Kurdish as a single language; there were several 
quite distinct dialects.  The staffers said they 
were aware of that, but were asking an 
administrative question not a linguistic one.  \"In 
the course of time it will probably happen,\" Atay 
opined.  Kurdish cassettes and videos now circulate 
freely, he added.  The staffers expressed the view 
that most international observers had assumed, after 
the passage of the recent legislation, that 
broadcasts would begin in a matter of days or weeks. 
Again, Mr. Atay replied obliquely, saying there had 
been an experience with local Kurdish-language 
television, but it had turned out to be 
\"separatist.\" This time control would be vested in 
TRT, the Turkish state television network.  Private 
Kurdish-language television channels in the future 
were a possibility, he believed.  In any case, the 
authorities have stopped trying to control the 
spread of satellite dishes; Kurds in Turkey have 
access to Kurdish-language programming from abroad. 
 
 
13.  (SBU)  In a separate meeting, members of the 
Diyarbakir Bar Association told Poleconoff and FSN 
Pol Assistant that the government was not making 
serious efforts to lift all obstacles to the use of 
Kurdish.  They said the Bar Association has sued 
RTUK (Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council) 
over this issue.  They believe the implementing 
regulation does not meet the spirit, or the letter, 
of the reform legislation passed in Parliament. 
Some Bar Association members went further, and 
stated that the cynical intent of RTUK and the 
Turkish authorities was to placate European critics 
while actually using Kurdish-language broadcasting 
as a tool for further cultural assimilation.  In 
this regard, they pointed out certain restrictions 
in the RTUK regulations (ref D) which, they said, 
undermined the spirit of the reform legislation. 
Concerning the use of Kurdish in classroom 
education, they ask, why should Kurds still be 
denied the kind of language-independence that was 
long ago granted to Greeks and Armenians by the 1923 
Lausanne Treaty, especially since there are so few 
Greeks and Armenians left in Turkey?  When asked 
about the practical day-to-day use of Kurdish in 
courtrooms, Bar Association members said that 
Turkish-Kurdish courtroom translation was haphazard, 
ad hoc, and at times denied.  Those accused of a 
crime were not granted the opportunity to read the 
indictment in Kurdish. 
 
 
Village Returns - Slow Going 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
14.  (SBU)  The Turkish Red Crescent\'s Regional 
Director in Diyarbakir, Muzaffer Karadede, argued 
that village return was of interest to the elderly 
and was not much sought after by young people. The 
villages have no jobs.  Additionally, the loss/lack 
of infrastructure and the obliteration of the 
villages\' former familial-communal support system 
make return less enticing.  Karadede, an 
ophthalmologist who spent a good portion of his 
professional career in Istanbul, is from an old 
Diyarbakir family.  He can hardly believe the 
transformation his city has undergone.  On top of 
what might normally have been expected for rural-to- 
urban migration in a country like Turkey, the long 
fight against the PKK drove so many villagers into 
Diyarbakir city that he now estimates that more than 
90 percent of the people living in the city were not 
born there.  Not a single member of the Diyarbakir 
city council was born in Diyarbakir.  In his view, 
given that the Turkish state never did much for 
peasants in the region\'s villages anyway, it was 
hardly surprising that not much was being done now. 
Karadede also asserted that the village guard system 
was now serving as a major factor in discouraging 
returns, and that the village guard system has taken 
on some of the characteristics of the region\'s old 
\"aga\" (feudal landlord) system, in which might makes 
right. 
 
 
15.  (SBU)  The village guard system was raised by 
staffers Gore and Thames with Diyarbakir Deputy 
Governor Atay.  Now that the PKK had been defeated, 
they asked, why was the village guard system not 
being dismantled and why were the guards themselves 
not being demobilized and disarmed?  Atay began his 
response by noting that as far back as the \"Village 
Administration Law\" of 1924 there had been 
provisions for something similar in the region.  Be 
that as it may, it was not now possible to eliminate 
the village guard system all at once.  Village 
guards were on the state payroll and would not take 
well to being dropped from it.  The GOT planned to 
reduce their number gradually, through attrition, by 
not appointing any new ones.  Also, in the future, 
their duties may be changed, e.g. to janitors in 
schools.  (Comment:  The staffers expressed some 
incredulity that a village guard might want to trade 
in his gun for a broom.  End comment.)  To what 
degree, asked the staffers, was village return being 
thwarted by village guards squatting on others\' 
land, intimidating, and using violence?  The 
problem, replied Atay, was exaggerated.  In the few 
cases where village guards had abused their 
authority, they had been arrested and dismissed. 
Sometimes what appeared as a case of village-guard 
violence had as its underlying cause a traditional 
blood feud.  The bad example of some village guards, 
he said, should not be used to obscure the fact that 
\"the village guards and the Army were part of a 
successful struggle for the territorial integrity of 
the country.\" 
 
 
16.  (U)  Leaving aside the debate about alleged 
obstacles to return (village guard, paperwork, no 
jobs, no infrastructure, lack of government 
investment), the staffers tried to ascertain how 
many villages in Diyarbakir province had in fact 
been re-opened for return and how many had actually 
seen returns  The only specific numbers came from 
the office of Deputy Governor Atay: 90 villages 
(\"koy\") and 303 hamlets (\"mezra\") evacuated during 
the conflict, of which 48 villages and 58 hamlets 
had seen returns.  Twelve villages had had requests 
for return that were denied -- on security grounds. 
As for the remaining 275 villages/hamlets, there had 
so far been no request.  (Note: To place this number 
in context, it is estimated that more than 3,200 
villages or hamlets in southeastern Turkey were 
evacuated during the course of the struggle between 
Turkish forces and the PKK.  End note.) 
17.  (SBU)  The staffers met with displaced 
villagers.  The Deputy Governor\'s office arranged 
for the staffers to visit Saklatkoy, a village 
outside Diyarbakir to which return had been approved 
and in fact achieved.  The village had electricity 
but no plumbing.  Many structures were damaged, but 
many have been repaired, and even some new ones have 
been built, including a new primary school building. 
The villager headman (muhtar), a man with three 
wives and 23 children, expressed appreciation for 
the chance to return.  Other villagers echoed this 
sentiment in their conversations with Gore and 
Thames, which took place with a representative of 
the Turkish government present.  Their only fear, 
they said, was that the PKK might come back.  Upon 
being driven back to Diyarbakir, the staffers had a 
chance to meet with a family that had not managed to 
return to its village (Koprulu, Mardin Province). 
The head of household was an illiterate itinerant 
laborer with 10 children. He claimed to have been 
denied permission to work as a pushcart peddler in 
Diyarbakir, and therefore leaves home for months at 
a time to live with his brother and work on 
construction sites in Izmir, some 700 miles away. 
He said he had unsuccessfully applied to return with 
his family to his village.  He was told that he 
would be allowed to return -- if he would agree to 
serve in the village guard.  He refused:  \"It\'s no 
good; brothers are going to kill brothers.\" 
 
 
18.    (SBU)  Comment:  It would appear that 
staffers Gore and Thames came away from Diyarbakir 
somewhat underwhelmed by the degree of actual 
implementation of human-rights reforms undertaken by 
the Turkish government.  As they explained to more 
than one interlocutor, the international community 
expected that reform efforts designed to make 
torturers accountable, ease language restrictions, 
and promote village returns would be bear fruit in a 
matter of days/weeks, not months/years.  Their 
report to the Congress is likely to conclude that 
human-reform pledges of the Turkish government still 
await implementation on the ground.  End comment. 
 
 
19.  (U)  Gore and Thames did not have an 
opportunity to clear this message.

          JANUARY 27, 2003 
 
1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for January 27, 2003.  Please note that Turkish 
press reports often contain errors or exaggerations; 
AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy of 
the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  DIGITALLY EQUIPPED U.S. TROOPS TO NORTHERN FRONT 
(Milliyet)  If the Turkish Parliament grants 
permission, 30,000 soldiers of the U.S. Fourth 
Infantry Division, the first digitally-equipped unit 
of the U.S. army, could enter Iraq through Sirnak\'s 
Habur border gate within days.  The division is made 
up of three infantry, one airborne, and one 
engineering brigade.  Airborne units have Apache and 
Comanche helicopters, while land units have M1A 
Abrams tanks and Bradley armored vehicles.  The 
division, led by Major-General Raymond T. Odierno, 
has a rich history. 
 
 
3.  CONTINUED ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS 
Evrensel reported nationwide anti-war protests 
against U.S. preparations to hit Iraq.  Thousands of 
people participated in these protests held in Mus, 
Batman, Bingol, Hatay, Amasya, and Sivas.  Ahmet 
Tas, President of the Cukurova (Adana) Handicapped 
People\'s Association, expressed opposition to the 
possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  \"We do not 
want to see war-stricken people in Turkey and the 
world,\" he added.  Turkiye quoted Kilis Governor 
Aslan Kutuk as announcing having taken all kinds of 
measures against a possible influx of refugees from 
Iraq, as well as chemical, biological, and nuclear 
attacks.  In Hakkari, the Civil Defense Directorate 
has provided 145 personnel with two-month training 
on nuclear weapons that might be used in a possible 
war.  Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company 
President Abdulkadir Konukoglu said he sided with 
peace and did not even want to articulate the word 
\"war.\"  In addition, \"health tourism\" from Iraq has 
declined almost to zero due to war rumors.  Nearly 
100 Iraqis had been given medical services in 
Gaziantep, to which no Iraqis came over the past two 
months.  Asim Guzelbey of the Abdulkadir Konukoglu 
Medical Center said that under a protocol agreement 
signed between his hospital and the Olimpik Hospital 
in Baghdad, Turkish doctors and health teams had 
from time to time served in Iraq.  He added that he 
had to cancel a January 22 trip to Baghdad due to 
these rumors.  Mersin Industrialists and 
Businessmen\'s Association (MESIAD) President Musa 
Timur opposed a possible war against Iraq because it 
would substantially affect the provincial economy. 
\"Bombs dropped during the 1991 Gulf Crisis fell on 
Mersin as economic bombs,\" he reacted.  Milli Gazete 
cited Felicity Party (SP) Elazig Provincial Women\'s 
Commission President Nazan Atasci as saying \"We have 
no children to send to the front.\"  Atasci 
characterized the possible war in Iraq as a dirty 
game of American imperialism and its search for 
hegemony.  \"It is not possible for those who for 
many years terrorized others, formed terrorist 
organizations, and fed terrorists to fight against 
terrorism,\" she added.  Bolge quoted the Grand Unity 
Party (BBP) National Vice President, Turan Guven, as 
saying that \"northern Iraq is too important for 
Turkey to be left to its own fate.\"  The Diyarbakir 
Labor Platform issued a press release against war. 
 
 
4.  HUNGER STRIKES 
Evrensel reported continued protest demonstrations 
in many provinces against the isolation of jailed 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and possible U.S.-led 
war.  Twenty members of the Prisoners and Inmates 
Families Initiative started a six-day rotating 
hunger strike at the Democratic People\'s Party 
(DEHAP) Kayapinar (Diyarbakir) office.  In Siirt, 
twelve relatives of inmates told the HADEP 
provincial organization that they had launched a 
two-day rotating hunger strike to protest isolation 
conditions in prisons.  A pro-Ocalan protest was 
also held in Mersin. 
 
 
5.  NINE HIZBULLAH SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN MALATYA 
(Cumhuriyet/Turkiye)  According to the Malatya 
Security Directorate, police arrested nine people, a 
woman among them, for providing support and shelter 
to Hizbullah members who had taken part in the 2001 
assassination of former Diyarbakir Security Director 
Gaffar Okkan.  The arrestees were accused of 
bringing the Hizbullah gunmen to Elazig and placing 
them in a Hizbullah safe house there 
A pistol, a cartridge clip, six cartridges, as well 
as false ID cards, false passports, and 
organizational documents, were also confiscated. 
Officials determined that the arrestees had been 
trying to establish Hizbullah safe houses in Ankara, 
Istanbul, Elazig, and Malatya, carrying out 
organizational activities in mosques and schools, 
extorting money and raising funds for the 
organization.  One of the arrestees had also been 
involved in the killing of a police officer in 
Elazig and preparing to travel abroad. 
 
 
6.  HADEP MAYOR ATTEMPTS TO DEMOLISH DIYARBAKIR 
MONUMENT 
(Hurriyet)  Remzi Azizoglu, HADEP Mayor of 
Diyarbakir\'s Yenisehir central district 
Municipality, wanted to demolish that district\'s 
Sehitler Aniti (Monument of Martyrs), in line with a 
decision made by his municipal council.  The State 
of Emergency (OHAL) regional governor\'s office had 
constructed the monument in Diyarakir in 
commemoration of soldiers and security officers 
killed during the Anti-Terror Struggle in the 
region.  The Diyarbakir Governor\'s Office blocked 
the mayor\'s demolition plans. 
 
 
7.  MILITARY VEHICLE OVERTURNS IN RURAL HAKKARI 
(Turkiye)  A military vehicle carrying foodstuffs 
for Jandarma stations along the Iranian border 
overturned in Yuksekova (Hakkari) on January 26. 
One NCO was killed and five soldiers were injured 
during the incident. 
 
 
8.  TEN DEHAP/HADEP MEMBERS HELD 
(Turkiye/Evrensel)  A Van court ordered ten 
Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP)/People\'s Democracy 
Party (HADEP) members to remain in custody for 
violation of the Demonstrations and Marches Law. 
They were among 80 people, including women, who had 
been arrested for faxing messages to the Justice 
Ministry protesting the possible U.S. operation 
against Iraq and the isolation of jailed PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan. 
9.  ATTEMPTED BOMB ATTACK BY FORMER VILLAGE 
(Evrensel)  Former village guard Zubeyir Kamal, who 
had three hand grenades on him, came to the Siirt 
Courthouse and threatened to pull the grenades\' pins 
unless he was allowed to meet with the chief 
prosecutor.  While police officers were trying to 
calm him down, several plain-clothes officers seized 
the grenades.  Kamal had been hired as a village 
guard in 1991, but his labor contract was terminated 
in 2001. 
 
 
10.  MISSING SILOPI (SIRNAK) HADEP OFFICIALS 
(Evrensel)  Three years have passed since the 
disappearance of People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) 
Silopi (Sirnak) district President Serdar Tanis and 
HADEP official Ebubekir Deniz in January 2000.  No 
information has been obtained about them since then. 
No progress has been made with regard to lawsuits 
opened by their families, who claim the assailants 
are known and call on the public to support for the 
case. 
11.  INVESTIGATION AGAINST TUNCELI JANDARMA 
(Evrensel)  The Erzincan Felony Court reversed a 
decision by the Pertek (Tunceli) Prosecutor\'s 
Office.  The Prosecutor\'s Office had concluded that 
there were no grounds for proceeding with an 
investigation launched against the Pertek Jandarma 
for the destruction of graves of two youths in a 
local village.  The court sent back the file to the 
Prosecutor\'s Office and ordered the initiation of an 
investigation against the Jandarma. 
 
 
12.  ADANA AGRICULTURAL DIRECTOR SHOT 
(Turkiye)  Police officer Mustafa Akinci, together 
with his brother Kerim Akinci, shot Adana 
Agricultural Director Fikret Coskun twice in the leg 
in his office on January 26.  Coskun had made a 
decision to transfer Mustafa\'s wife, an employee of 
the directorate, to another province due to a work- 
related problem.  The Akinci brothers shot Coskun 
when they failed to convince him to withdraw his 
decision.  The brothers were arrested by police 
officers, while Coskun was hospitalized.  In his 
testimony, Coskun reportedly said he did not know 
his assailants and why had been shot.  Meanwhile, 
Milli Gazete and Bolge reported that in fact Coskun 
had shot himself while cleaning his pistol. 
 
 
13.  \"CHANGING FACE OF SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY\" 
(Turkiye/Milli Gazete)  In Siverek\'s (Sanliurfa) 
Karakeci village, which is home to 15,000 members of 
the district\'s major clans, families have 
traditionally requested dowries ranging from TL 20 
billion to 30 billion (approx. USD 12,000-18,000) 
and kilograms of gold in return for their daughters 
eligible for marriage.  Today, however, families 
look for such qualities as college degree in 
prospective sons-in-law.  In the village, university 
graduates can marry young women without having to 
pay dowries. 
 
 
14.  SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND TEACHERS IN 
SEVERAL SE PROVINCES 
(Evrensel)  Health services at the Mus State 
Hospital are stalling due to a shortage of medical 
personnel.  The Hospital\'s Senior Physician, Dr. 
Mustafa Ates, said ten specialist physicians, ten 
general-practice physicians, and 54 nurses served at 
the 300-bed hospital.  Ates stressed the need for 
another 50 physicians, including 20 specialists, and 
250 nurses.  In Tunceli\'s only state hospital, there 
are only five expert physicians specializing in 
internal diseases, general surgery, and gynecology, 
maternity, and pediatrics.  That is, one specialist 
serves 20,000 patients.  The Bingol Maternity and 
Pediatrics Hospital\'s computer-assisted Intensive 
Care Center is not operational due to a lack of 
qualified personnel.  In addition, the Siverek 
(Sanliurfa) National Education Directorate said 
there was a shortage of teachers in all branches 
across the district.  Parents called for the 
appointment of new teachers for these vacancies. 
 
 
15.  POSSIBLE WATER-BORN DISEASES IN MARDIN 
(Turkiye)  In Nusaybin (Mardin), many State Water 
Works (DSI) officials were hospitalized after they 
had been \"poisoned\" by drinking water with which 
sewage had mixed.  DSI officials carried out an 
analysis on a sample of the water coming from a 135- 
meter-deep well and found out that it was 
contaminated. 
 
 
16.  TWO HUNDRED KILOS OF HASHISH SEIZED 
(Turkiye)  Syrian officials stopped a vehicle 
carrying three Turkish citizens at Syria\'s El Saleme 
border gate.  During the search of the vehicle, the 
officials confiscated 200 kilograms of hashish and 
arrested the three.  An investigation is underway to 
look into possible contacts in Turkey. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
17.  STATE MINISTER TUZMEN IN GAZIANTEP 
(Turkiye)  State Minister Kursat Tuzmen attended a 
celebration in Gaziantep to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the World Customs Day on January 26. 
In his speech, Tuzmen said he was planning to 
establish border trade centers and improve trade to 
the benefit of countries involved in it.  \"When our 
commercial ties with our neighbors have increased, 
this will create an excellent political platform, 
leading to permanent commercial and political 
relations.  Instead of being engaged in other things 
and spending huge amounts of money on security by 
purchasing weapons, this region will ensure its own 
development.  It will allocate money for health, 
education, research, and development,\" Tuzmen added. 
 
 
18.  ADANA-MALATYA RAILWAY SERVICES ON HOLD 
Evrensel reported that railway services between 
Adana and Malatya provinces have been suspended for 
the past eight months due to negligence on the part 
of the Turkish State Railways Administration (TCDD). 
The newspaper criticized TCDD for failing to repair 
a damaged tunnel, which eventually resulted in the 
tunnel\'s closure. 
 
 
19.  TURKISH GREEN CARDS 
(Turkiye)  Necmi Kurt, President of the Social 
Assistance and Solidarity Foundation, an affiliate 
of the Tarsus district Governor\'s Office, announced 
having issued Turkish green cards for 19,864 of the 
22,652 applicants in 2002.  These cards are issued 
to low-income families who cannot afford to pay for 
medical services, to make use of medical services at 
State-run hospital free of charge.

2.  MEASURES AGAINST A POSSIBLE INFLUX OF REFUGEES 
FROM IRAQ 
(Hurriyet)  Turkey has devised plans to prevent a 
possible influx of refugees from Iraq in the event 
of a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  A total of 18 
centers, including 12 in northern Iraq, will be 
established for the purposes of humanitarian 
assistance for refugees.  In addition, the Sirnak 
Governor\'s Office reportedly continues with measures 
against a possible wave of refugees, as well. 
Survey teams have begun to hammer stakes to put up 
tents near the province\'s Habur border gate. 
 
 
3.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS CONTINUE 
(Evrensel)  The Malatya chapter of the Labor Party 
(EMEP) organized a January 27 concert entitled 
\"Let\'s Praise Peace.\"  Over 1,000 war opponents, 
mostly youths, attended the concert, during which 
anti-U.S. imperialism and pro-socialism slogans were 
chanted.  Bolge reported continued criticism on the 
part of NGO\'s against a possible U.S.-led war in 
Iraq.  Yakup Sevki Ozturk, President of the Adana 
Young Businessmen\'s Association (AGIAD), emphasized 
\"the need to preserve economic and ecologic 
balances.\" 
 
 
4.  TRIAL OF ASSASSINS OF OKKAN CONTINUES IN 
DIYARBAKIR 
(Evrensel)  The trial of four suspected assassins of 
former Diyarbakir Security Director Gaffar Okkan 
continued in the Diyarbakir State Security Court. 
The defendants appeared for the trial and denied the 
charges.   The defendants\' attorneys requested that 
their clients and two eyewitnesses who had testified 
against their clients be brought face to face.  The 
court adjourned the trial for missing documents in 
the case file. 
 
 
5.  IDIL (SIRNAK) SURROUNDED, 30 PEOPLE ARRESTED 
(Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete)  Following a half- 
hour clash between security forces and PKK/KADEK 
members who had opened fire on military and police 
housing in Idil (Sirnak), security forces took 
large-scale security measures, blocking the district 
with armored vehicles.  Security forces raided 
several homes and arrested 30 (32 according to 
Cumhuriyet) people, including HADEP officials. 
Mahmut Akman, ANAP Mayor of the Sirtkoy district, as 
well as his cousin Sahin Akman, were also arrested. 
The Akmans are also village guards.  Sirnak Governor 
Huseyin Baskaya declared that a group of two-three 
(20 according to Cumhuriyet and Sabah) people had 
carried out the attack.  Cumhuriyet cites local 
sources as saying that seven soldiers were wounded 
during the attack. 
 
 
6.  SANLIURFA GOVERNOR A TARGET NOW 
(Cumhuriyet)  Over the past three years, there have 
efforts to remove Sanliurfa Governor Dilek from 
office for his efforts in fighting against gangs in 
the province, which has made him the target of 
gangs, clans, sects, and even some politicians. 
Former Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan had been 
appointed Dilek, Tantan\'s then secretary general, 
Sanliurfa Governor.  Dilek first became a target 
after the Motherland Party (ANAP) Provincial 
Chairman\'s son was arrested within the framework of 
an operation launched by the Turkish Electricity 
Distribution Corporation (TEDAS) to prevent illegal 
use of electricity in that province.  Dilek also 
drew reactions from Sanliurfa\'s Bucak Clan for 
repossessing State land, and from Nationalist 
Movement Party (MHP) members for preventing them 
from collecting entrance fees to the State Hospital. 
This time, it is an operation license his office 
refused to issue for an illegal gas station.  The 
newspaper says during his tenure, Dilek also 
- Suspended the distribution of weapon licenses; 
- Cracked down on a gang involved in bidding 
tenders; and 
- Investigated irregularities in Irrigation 
Cooperatives. 
Inspectors had been appointed to investigate Dilek\'s 
actions, but they had found him to be in the right.

plot of land for such purposes falls within the

(approx. USD 90,000).  The Ministry of Public Works

Presently, there are over 500 inmates in the 250-

help reduce unemployment and expedite village 
returns.  Mersin businessmen want due importance 
attached to the province\'s marine transportation. 
Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding Company President

      INVESTMENTS\"

products and factories whose chimneys are smoking, 
not war planes, he said.  Bas, together with ACOC 
members, went to the province\'s Organized 
Industrial Zone to inspect developments there and

exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  SIIRT ELECTIONS MIGHT BE CANCELLED DUE TO IRAQ 
WAR 
(Hurriyet)  A possible U.S.-led war in Iraq has 
overshadowed the March 9 Siirt elections, which was 
expected to open the way for AK Party leader Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan\'s premiership.  The Higher Election 
Council might \"postpone the elections due to de 
facto incapability\" if Turkey enters war. 
 
 
3.  TURKISH ARMED FORCES START REPAIR PROJECTS IN 
BASES 
(Radikal)  Following the recent site surveys by a 
team of U.S. experts of Turkish bases and ports, 
the Turkish Armed Forces has unilaterally started 
repair projects (to upgrade these bases and ports). 
Preparations are underway at the Incirlik (Adana) 
Air Base and the Diyarbakir Airport, which will 
reportedly initially be used in the event of an 
operation against Iraq.  The U.S. will meet the 
needs during a possible operation.  On February 3, 
a C-5 Galaxy plane landed at Incirlik, where the 
U.S. is stockpiling military equipment and 
materials.  A missile-like object and crates of 
spare parts from the giant cargo plane were 
uploaded on to two trucks.  The trucks later went 
to a nearby warehouse.  In addition, the number of 
KC-135 tanker planes at Incirlik has increased. 
 
 
4.  TURKEY, THE U.S. WILL ESTABLISH 15 CAMPS 
(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Turkiye)  Possible immigration 
(from Iraq) was discussed during recent evaluations 
held between Turkey and the U.S.  To prevent a wave 
of immigration, 15 different camps will initially 
be established in northern Iraq.  The number of 
these camps might rise to 23 if immigration 
increases.  The U.S. Time Magazine wrote that 
Turkey and the U.S. had agreed to establish 17 
refugee camps in the region, including 10 on the 
Iraqi side, if an operation started against Iraq. 
 
 
5.  SPECIAL TEAMS WILL BE WORKING IN CAMPS 
(Turkiye/Milli Gazete)  Officials have determined 
the names of nearly 1,000 people who will be 
working in tent cities to be established in 
northern Iraq in the event of a war against Iraq. 
The Diyarbakir Security Directorate will dispatch a 
team of 70 specialists to the border.  Efforts are 
also underway to prepare a 1,000-person list of 
health, Tele-com, and Village Affairs Directorate 
personnel in Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, Batman, 
Hakkari, and Van.  Also, the Diyarbakir National 
Education Directorate has produced a list of 200 
teachers to serve in these tent cities.

(Hurriyet/Milli Gazete)  The Turkish Armed Forces

equipment, including armored vehicles, to its units 
along the (Iraqi) border.  Security units have been 
warned against possible terrorist infiltration, and 
thermal cameras along the 280-km Turkish-Iraqi 
border are being checked.  Some banks and public 
organizations have established mobile units.  The 
number of tents set up by the Red Crescent has 
reached 300.  Four other tents were set up to store 
humanitarian assistance.  Cumhuriyet reported that 
troops, military equipment, and materials left 
Tekirdag, Adapazari, Ankara, and Istanbul are being 
kept in Sanliurfa for dispatch to the Southeast 
after the February 11-14 Sacrifice Holiday.  Bolu 
and Kayseri commando teams, which had been used 
during the anti-terror period in the Southeast, 
might also be dispatched to the region again. 
 
 
7.  \"THERE ARE NO STANDARD SHELTERS IN TURKEY\" 
(Turkiye/Bolge)  In line with an order from the 
Civil Defense Directorate General, the Malatya 
Civil Defense Directorate held a civil defense 
seminar.  In his speech, Malatya Civil Defense 
Director Ibrahim Ozay said his directorate was 
organizing activities in accordance with the 
possibility of a war that might break out as a 
result of the tension between the U.S. and Iraq. 
Ozay noted that there are no shelters built in 
accordance with the standards.  He added that, in 
case of an emergency, the basement of public 
buildings, car parks, aparmant buildings, and 
business centers would be used as shelters.  In 
addition, a meeting entitled \"Effects of Chemical 
and Biological Agents\" was held in Adana\'s 
Physicians\' Chamber.  In his speech, Assistant 
Professor Ferdi Tanir of Cukurova University 
(Adana) said that not all shelters would save lives 
because the province\'s shelters are insufficient. 
Tanir stressed that shelters must be in an 
appropriate location and have necessary equipment 
to protect against chemical gases. 
 
 
8.  MERSIN BUSINESS LEADER AGAINST WAR 
Dunya reported that Mersin businessmen are 
concerned over a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq. 
Musa Timur, President of the Mersin Industrialists 
and Businessmen\'s Association (MESIAD), voiced 
opposition to a possible war, claiming that the 
provincial economy fell from the fifth province to 
the 19th on a nationwide list.  \"It feels like 
bombs dropped on Iraq have fallen on Mersin.  A new 
war will cause the Mersin economy to hit the 
bottom,\" he added. 
 
 
9.  PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS CONTINUE 
(Evrensel)  Demonstrations were held in Igdir, 
Hakkari, Batman, and Sanliurfa to protest the nine- 
week isolation of jailed KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan.  In Tunceli, relatives of prisoners and 
inmates began a hunger strike.  In addition, a pro- 
Ocalan campaign was launched in Bismil 
(Diyarbakir).  Under the campaign, demonstrations 
will be held every day until February 15.  Also, 
pro-Ocalan marches were held in Diyarbakir\'s six 
different districts on February 3.  Pro-Ocalan 
slogans were shouted during the marches, while

refused to grant permission for a press conference 
which the Diyarbakir Democratic Youth Platform 
wanted to organize in protest of a possible U.S.- 
led operation against Iraq and prison isolation. 
When a group of 200 people, including women and 
HADEP Youth Commission members, insisted on holding 
the press conference, police told HADEP officials 
that it was unlawful to hold a press conference and 
wanted them their demonstration.  Some members of 
the group instead staged a sit-down demonstration 
and shouted pro-KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan 
slogans.  Then, police intervened to disperse them. 
During the scuffle, many people were reportedly 
injured and over 20 others arrested. 
 
 
11.  TEACHERS INVESTIGATED FOR ATTENDING A RALLY 
(Evrensel)  Under Article 130 of the Law number 
657, the Diyarbakir National Education Directorate 
has launched an administrative investigation 
against sixty local teachers, all members of the 
State Employees\' Union Confederation (KESK).  The 
investigation stemmed from the teachers\' 
participation in the August 2002 KESK rally in 
Ankara.  The law requires public employees to 
receive official permission for travel outside 
their province.  The Diyarbakir Egitim-Sen teachers 
union President, Abdullah Demirtas, called the 
investigation \"arbitrary.\" 
 
 
12.  OHAL CIRCULAR STILL IN EFFECT 
(Evrensel)  The former government of Bulent Ecevit 
had published a circular to prevent the 
reinstatement of public employees transferred from 
the State of Emergency (OHAL) region.  Following 
the lifting of OHAL, former Diyarbakir teacher 
Abdurrahim Kutlu petitioned the Diyarbakir 
Governor\'s Office to be reinstated.  However, the 
Governoer\'s Office, presumably based on the 
circular, refused to process Kutlu\'s petition, 
saying \"it was inconsistent with the regulation.\"

BORDER 
(Turkiye)  AK Party Kilis Deputy Hasan Kara, who 
had accompanied State Minister Kursad Tuzmen during 
his trip to Syria, said the Syrian government 
favored the idea of establishing open-air markets

military units deployed in northern Iraq to prevent 
the infiltration of PKK terrorists during a 
possible influx of refugees in the event of a war 
in Iraq.  Military vehicles transported commando 
units to Uludere (Sirnak) along the Iraqi border. 
They then crossed into northern Iraq to assume 
assigned duties there.  Based on intelligence that 
there are around 500 (PKK) terrorists in Iraq\'s 
Sinaht Valley across from Uludere, security forces 
are preparing for a large-scale operation.

to be ready for an operation as the U.S. was 
expected to launch its possible operation against 
Iraq between February 15-27.  Radikal pointed to 
expedited war preparations in military and civilian 
bureaucracy, with leaves suspended at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, as well as critical military 
units.  Mobilization duty order files have been 
updated.  Security measures have been elevated in 
such public institutions as MKE, TUPRAS, PETKIM,

of a possible U.S.-led operation against Iraq, the

ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
17.  SYRIAN BUSINESS DELEGATION VISITS ADANA 
(Dunya)  A 30-person delegation of Syrian 
businessmen arrived in Adana as part of a trip 
organized by Turkey\'s Aleppo Consulate General and 
TUYAP.  The businessmen visited the province\'s 
Organized Industrial Zone.  They said the purpose 
was to increase the volume of trade between Turkey 
and Syria.  Bilateral relations had previously 
declined to the point of zero due to the Hatay 
issue and terror. 
 
 
18.  SIGNALS OF ECONOMIC CRISIS IN MALATYA DUE TO 
IRAQ WAR 
(Milli Gazete)  Muzaffer Ersan, the President of 
the Malatya Active Businessmen\'s Association 
(MAKIAD), said that the provincial economy had 
suffered substantial losses during the 1991 Gulf 
War.  According to Ersan, the Iraq crisis has 
caused danger bells to ring again.  Evrensel 
reported the presidents of 22 Chambers of Commerce 
and Industry in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey

a possible war in Iraq and the current economic 
situation. 
 
 
19.  MINE EXCITEMENT IN SIIRT

Parliament from Siirt, has begun to exert efforts 
to put Siirt\'s Sirvan mine back into operation.

open way for AK Party leader Erdogan\'s candidacy in 
Siirt.  The mine, located in Siirt\'s Sirvan 
village, has a reserve of 16 million tons of 
copper.  The Eti Holding (Company) owns the mine\'s 
operating license.  According to Gul, with an 
investment of USD 280 million by German SKW firm, 
the mine will create employment for thousands of 
people. 
 
 
20.  \"DIE\'S INFLATION FIGURE SERIOUS SIGN OF 
WARNING\" 
(Bolge)  In his evaluation of the State Statistics 
Institute\'s (DIE) inflation figure for the month of 
January, Adana Chamber of Industry Umit Ozgumus

operation against Iraq, increased petroleum prices, 
and a 7.7% increase in the price of agricultural 
products. 
 
 
21.  ANIMAL HUSBANDRY 
(Bolge)  The Gaziantep Commodity Exchange (GCE)

SUBJECT:  INCREASING UNREST IN SE TURKEY 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Imprisoned PKK/KADEK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan has been denied access to lawyers 
and family by the GOT since November 2002.   In 
SE Turkey, reaction against this enforced 
isolation has been angry.  There have been 
demonstrations, hunger strikes, and Molotov- 
cocktail threats. Kurdish interlocutors believe 
the prolongation of Ocalan\'s isolation has the 
potential to set off a new wave of violence. 
Within the past three weeks, perhaps 
coincidentally, there have been two armed clashes 
between GOT security forces and the PKK.  End 
summary. 
 
 
Ocalan\'s Isolation Provokes Increased Tension 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: 
::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
2.  (U)  Press reports -not denied by the GOT - 
indicate imprisoned PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan has not met with his lawyers or family 
members since November 2002.   The GOT has 
offered the explanation that inclement weather 
has prevented boats from reaching Imrali Island 
in the Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan has been 
incarcerated ever since his capture in 1999. 
This explanation is widely dismissed as bogus by 
Kurdish representatives. 
 
 
3.  (U) Starting in December 2002, anger about 
the enforced isolation of Ocalan has been 
bubbling up in SE Turkey.  We have reports from 
press and consular contacts of nearly 50 
demonstrations or other incidents since December 
8.  They have included public rallies, marches, 
slogan-chanting, proclamations, bonfires and 
tire-burnings, roadblocks, and hunger strikes. 
The venues have been all over the SE: Diyarbakir, 
Batman, Siirt, Saniurfa, Van, Bingol, Mersin, 
Adana, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Agri, and Mardin. 
Police, in some cases using truncheons and 
armored personnel-carriers, have made numerous 
arrests, including students and DEHAP members. 
In at least one case, police claimed to have 
found Molotov-cocktails that were being readied 
for use.   In some of the demonstrations, protest 
against a possible U.S. strike against Iraq has 
been mingled with the call for an end to Ocalan\'s 
isolation. 
 
 
Tanks Return to the Streets 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  In recent travel in the Consular 
district, both Poleconoff and Principal Officer 
heard simmering rage from Kurdish interlocutors 
about the continued isolation of Ocalan.  More 
than one interlocutor remarked the situation even 
had the potential to trigger armed attacks by 
PKK/KADEK elements.  In the city of Diyarbakir, 
at the end of January, Principal Officer observed 
the armored personnel-carriers and tanks moving 
about and learned that some sections of the city 
had been cordoned off for security purposes.  The 
security presence was the more visible than at 
any time she could recall over the past two 
years. 
 
 
GOT-PKK Armed Clashes Escalate 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: 
::: 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  It is worth noting that the anger over 
Ocalan\'s isolation has coincided with two GOT-PKK 
armed clashes within the past three weeks. The 
first, near Lice in Diyarbakir Province, took 
place on January 16; the second, on January 27 in 
Idol in Sirnak province.   In the Lice skirmish, 
one Turkish soldier and an unspecified number of 
PKK fighters were killed.  In Idol, press reports 
indicate the PKK forces started the engagement, 
which left one Turkish soldier dead.   If so, 
this would represent the first time in a long 
while that the PKK has mounted an offnsie 
operation. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Consulate contacts in the Kurdish 
community agrees that the temperature seems t be 
risng  Te iyarbakir B 
Asocatin resdet 
tld s hatKuds in prpoteousth GO 
explaation hat Oclan ha been nable o 
reciv viit frm amiy embrs or lawyers for 
the past nine weksbeause of  \"weather\".  He 
opined that some elements could perceive Ocalan\'s 
isolation as a provocation to incite violence and 
thereby provide a pretext for the GOT to hit back 
hard.  A DEHAP member from Sirnak offered us the 
view that ordinary people find it very hard to 
see Ocalan\'s enforced isolation as anything other 
than a violation of his human rights.  (Note: 
Amnesty International has now spoken out against 
Ocalan\'s isolation, too.  End note.)  A human 
rights contact of ours said that Ocalan\'s health 
was a matter of genuine concern - if Ocalan were 
to fall seriously ill or die in custody, it would 
be easy to imagine a renewal of suicide bomb 
attacks, as occurred shortly after Ocalan\'s 
arrest in Kenya.  A former president of the 
Batman Bar Association emphasized that if the 
GOT, in denying Ocalan access to his lawyers and 
family members, is seen to be reneging on its 
promise to uphold Copenhagen Criteria and EU 
norms, it will dash many hopes in the region. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment:  Whatever the real reason 
PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah Ocalan has been denied 
access to visitors since November 2002,  our 
contacts blame the GOT for renewed anger and 
tension and tanks in the streets.  End Comment.

(Tercuman)  Turkish Military Electronics Industry 
(ASELSAN) Secretary General (ret.) Colonel Serdar 
Erdurmaz, in his book entitled \"Weapons of Mass 
Destruction in the Middle East, Weapons Control, 
and Turkey,\" has written that Turkey\'s defenses 
against nuclear, biological, and chemical warhead 
attacks are inadequate.  However, Erdurmaz 
pointed to two trump cards Turkey has:  its air 
force and the deployment of anti-ballistic 
missile systems in eastern and southeastern 
Turkey, under the U.S. National Missile Defense 
System. 
 
 
4.  ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS 
(Evrensel)  A cockfight was held in Elazig to 
highlight protest against a possible U.S. attack 
against Iraq.  Two roosters named \"Saddam\" and 
\"Bush\" were made to fight, which ended with the 
victory of \"Saddam.\"  Also, a group of youths 
issued an anti-war press release in front of 
Elazig\'s Post Office.  Regarding a possible U.S.- 
led war in Iraq, they said that remaining silent 
in such a situation meant being involved in the 
massacre of thousands of people in Iraq.  In 
addition, the Tunceli Anti-War Platform decided 
to stage new anti-war demonstrations on February 
5.  Under the new decision, the Platform will 
form \"a peace chain against war\" in the 
provincial capital on Saturday.  The Platform 
will also ask local merchants to close their 
places of business for an hour. 
 
 
5.  BOMB HOAX ON DIYARBAKIR PLANE 
(Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Diyarbakir)  A telephone call 
that there was a bomb on Turkish Airlines\' (THY) 
mid-February 6 Diyarbakir-Ankara plane caused 
panic.  Shortly after take-off, the plane 
returned to the airport and the passengers were 
evacuated under intense security measures.  Bomb 
experts searched the plane, but could not find 
anything suspicious.  The plane took off again an 
hour later, with its 99 passengers and crew. 
Former State of Emergency (OHAL) Gokhan Aydiner, 
who has been appointed the new Security Director 
General, and former Diyarbakir Governor Cemil 
Serhadli, were also on the plane.

SOUTHEAST 
(Evrensel)  Hunger strikes launched in protest of 
the isolation of jailed KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan continue in the Southeastern provinces of 
Batman, Hakkari, Van, and Gaziantep.  Illegal 
pro-Ocalan demonstrations were also held in those 
provinces.  In Adana, ten women arrested for 
staging a pro-Ocalan sit-down demonstration in 
front of the Adana chapter of the AK Party were 
released.  In addition, the HADEP Mayor of 
Adana\'s Kucukdikili district, Mehmet Yasik, 
called for support from all sectors so Turkey\'s 
internal peace is not disrupted.  Yasik claimed 
Ocalan\'s isolation and a possible U.S. attack 
against Iraq were related. 
 
 
7.  DIVORCED WOMAN KILLED FOR \"WALKING AROUND 
WITH MEN\" 
(Sabah)  In Diyarbakir, two brothers strangled 
their 19-year-old sister, Gulseren T. on January 
27, 2002, due to rumors that she was meeting with 
men.  Gulseren had gotten divorced two years ago. 
After killing Gulseren, they melted nylon on her 
face in an attempt to make her body 
unidentifiable and threw the body near a local 
school.  The next day, teachers and students 
found the body and informed the police, who 
interrogated Gulserens\'s parents, who revealed 
that Gulseren\'s two brothers had murdered her. 
 
 
8.  PULUMUR EARTHQUAKE 
(Evrensel)  A delegation of professors from 
Elazig\'s Firat University Geology Department 
prepared a report regarding the January 27 
earthquake in Tunceli\'s Pulumur district.  The 
report attributed most damage to the district\'s 
public buildings to their construction on a slope 
on an active fault line and their being multi- 
storey structures. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
9.  SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT

Industrialists Association (TGSD) and the 
Southeastern Anatolia Industrialists and 
Businessmen\'s Association (GUNSIAD) jointly 
organized a meeting entitled \"Effects of A 
Possible War on the Turkish and Regional Economy\" 
in Diyarbakir.  Participants focused on ways of 
getting out of a possible war with the least 
loss.  Industrialists called for a regional 
development plan.  TGSD President Umut Oran 
pointed to the vital significance of qualified 
industrial zones under the law number 4325, which 
he wanted implemented as soon as possible. 
 
 
10.  NEW CLA SIGNED IN MALATYA MUNICIPALITY 
(Evrensel)  The Malatya Municipality has signed a 
new collective labor agreement (CLA) covering its 
500 employees.  CLA foresees a 15% increase in 
the employees\' salaries within the first six 
months and a 10% increase within the second six 
months.  In addition, Adana\'s Agricultural 
Complex (Cukobirlik) has paid its workers a total 
of TL 1.5 trillion (approx. USD 900,000) under a 
recent CLA signed between Cukobirlik and a labor 
union. 
 
 
11.  COURT REVERSES WATER PRICE HIKE 
(Hurriyet)  The Adana Metropolitan Municipality\'s 
Water and Sewage Administration (ASKI) \"secretly\" 
increased the price of its drinking water, as 
well as wastewater discharged from homes and 
places of business, by 360% in 2002.  Three 
Municipal Council members petitioned the Adana 
Administrative Court to reverse the price hike. 
The court reached a verdict reversing the price 
hike.  Also, the Council of State upheld the 
verdict.  Now, ASKI is expected to repay the 
amount collected unjustly.

2.  KANADOGLU:  ERDOGAN CANNOT RUN IN SIIRT 
ELECTIONS 
(All papers)  Sabih Kanadoglu, Chief Prosecutor 
of the Supreme Court of Appeals, stressed that, 
under Article 16 of the Member of Parliament 
Election Law, AK Party leader Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan cannot nominate himself in the March 9 
Siirt elections.  Kanadoglu noted the March 9 
elections were a continuation of the November 3 
Parliamentary elections.  Kanadoglu did not 
object to Erdogan\'s nomination because the Higher 
Election Council (YSK) had authority to 
investigate the matter out of its own accord. 
Tercuman reported that ballots would be published 
in the Official Gazette on February 26.  Sabah 
newspaper said the Republican People\'s Party 
(CHP) Leader, Deniz Baykal, had viewed Siirt in 
his \"On the Anatolian Roads\" article:  \"We 
proceeded from Anamur (Mersin) to Antalya and met 
with Baykal there.  He was listening to the 
public.  In answer to a question, he said CHP 
would not cooperate with HADEP in Siirt.  \"I will 
not involved in an initiative that will block 
Erdogan,\" he indicated. 
 
 
3.  ANTI-WAR PROTESTS 
Milli Gazete reported continued criticism of a 
possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  According 
to the paper, anti-war protests were held in the 
Southeastern provinces of Van and Adana, as well 
as in Izmir and Ankara. 
 
 
4.  EXPANSION AND RENEWAL PROJECTS 
(Cumhuriyet)  Repair and renewal projects 
continued after the U.S. received construction 
permission for nine bases and three ports, as 
well as railways connections to these bases and 
ports.  These bases and ports are mostly in the 
Southern and Southeastern regions.  A project to 
expand the runway of the Incirlik (Adana) Air 
Base, which is likely to be used as a central 
base during a possible war in Iraq, has been 
expedited.  There has also been an increase in 
the number of planes of various tonnages taking 
off from and landing at Incirlik.  Patriot and 
other missile ramps, as well as anti-aircraft 
weapons will be placed around the base and its 
runway.  Tercuman reported that a delegation of 
U.S. experts surveyed the Mersin and Iskenderun 
(Hatay) Ports. Activities have increased in 
Mersin Port\'s wharves allocated to NATO. 
 
 
5.  GROUND EXERCISES IN INCIRLIK

C-17 and a civilian cargo plane at the Incirlik 
Air Base, which was repaired and painted during 
the (Sacrifice) Holiday.  Another AWACS plane 
joined two early warning planes giving support to 
warplanes engaged in Operation Northern Watch. 
Also, a command plane landed at Incirlik at noon. 
Bolge reported that, after an hour of ground 
exercise, warplanes took off from Incirlik to 
carry out flights in northern Iraq.  While 
preparations continue due to a possible operation 
against Iraq, two military cargo planes landed at 
the Adana Airport on February 17.  Material 
unloaded from the planes was reportedly taken to 
the Incirlik Air Base, as well as to Mersin\'s 
Seka and Tasucu Ports. 
 
 
6.  U.S.\' B PLAN 
(Turkiye)  The U.S. will implement plan B without 
Turkey if the Turkish parliament fails to pass a 
memorandum enabling the deployment of U.S. 
soldiers in Turkey.  According to the plan, a 
fleet carrying the Fourth Division of the U.S. 
Navy will pass through the Suez Canal and 
position in the Persian Gulf.  The Bermani, Beni 
Harr and Suleymaniye airports in northern Iraq 
will be renewed and Patriot missiles will be 
deployed there.  In addition, U.S. soldiers, 
including those at Incirlik Air Base, will be 
flown to these airports.  These soldiers will 
assume the responsibility of protecting oil wells 
in Musul and Kirkuk. 
 
 
7.  U.S. SOLDIERS IN DIYARBAKIR 
(Dunya/Milliyet/Evrensel)  2000 U.S. soldiers 
arrived in Diyarbakir to modernize bases to be 
used in the event of a possible U.S. operation 
against Iraq.  U.S. soldiers reportedly wanted to 
stay in luxurious hotels in the province, but 
their requests were not accepted due to possible 
activities by the terror organization KADEK/PKK. 
Instead, comfortable tents were set up for the 
American soldiers at the Diyarbakir base. 
Preparations are also underway for a 370-person 
military delegation from the Netherlands.  C-130 
cargo planes affiliated with the U.S. Air Force 
continue to transfer soldiers and ammunition, 
while U.S. experts will expand the base\'s current 
runway and construct a second one.  Radikal 
reported the February 17 landing at Diyarbakir\'s 
Second Tactic Air Base of two cargo planes 
affiliated with the U.S. Air Force, reportedly 
carrying U.S. soldiers and equipment from 
Incirlik. Americans reportedly installed a 
special radar system in Diyarbakir to guide and 
monitor planes, as well as simultaneously 
evaluate satellite photographs taken during an 
operation.

Turkish national intelligence agency (MIT), 
Turkish and U.S. generals, and northern Iraqi 
Kurdish leaders met in Habur (Sirnak) on February

President Ahmet Aga, as well as Turkish and 
American generals, Turkish General Staff Special 
Forces Deputy Commander Brigadier General 
Abdullah Kilicarslan, representatives from MIT 
and MFA, attended the meeting. Turkish officials 
indicated that the PKK had gained strength during 
the 1991 Gulf War, but would not allow such a 
vacuum this time.  Kurdish leaders, who are 
against the presence of Turkish soldiers in the 
region, were asked to give up their demands. 
 
 
9.  CONTINUED DISPATCH OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND 
SOLDIERS 
(Dunya)  The dispatch of military vehicles and 
equipment from various parts of Turkey to the 
Iraqi border continues.  A convoy of 20 military 
vehicles and personnel left Diyarbakir for Silopi 
(Sirnak).  On February 17, a Turkish Naval ship 
carrying military vehicles and soldiers anchored 
at the Mersin Port.  The ship will reportedly 
provide security for the U.S. Navy affiliated war 
ships that may come to the port.

February 17, while protesting the continued 
isolation of jailed PKK leader Abdulla Ocalan. 
Police intervened to disperse a group of people 
who wanted to issue a press release in Mardin\'s 
Kiziltepe district.  In Adana\'s Seyhan district, 
police fired five shots into the air and beat a 
youth they arrested.  A hunger strike in support 
of Ocalan at the Seyhan chapter of DEHAP ended 
(peacefully). 15 people were arrested in Adana\'s 
Ceyhan district over the past two days.  Five 
pro-Ocalan demonstrators were arrested in Batman.

Turkish bases, 200 people were sent to Batman. 
Cumhuriyet reported the arrival of 200 American 
soldiers at the Batman Air Base on February 19. 
The soldiers settled in tents that had been set

Suez Canal.  Americans will pay the Iskenderun 
port USD 3 million per month.  An agreement has

will receive a monthly payment of USD 2,000. 
Milliyet reported that a crisis was experienced 
during the entrance of nine busloads of U.S. 
soldiers from Incirlik to the Iskenderun port. 
The soldiers had to wait in the buses for nearly 
an hour before they were admitted on to the port. 
A delay in the receipt by port officials of a 
list of these soldiers reportedly caused the 
crisis.  Cumhuriyet reported that the unloading 
of U.S. tanks and other heavy equipment at the 
Iskenderun Port, prior to the passage of a 
memorandum for the use of bases and ports, caused 
controversy.  The Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
reportedly gave permission for the unloading, 
which caused disturbances among other public 
organizations.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs

particularly to Zaho and Dahok, along with 
soldiers placed in strategic passages and hills.

soldiers and materiel unloaded at the Iskenderun 
(Hatay) Port.  Evrensel reported the deployment

ground services.  Modernization projects continue 
in some parts of the base. 
 
 
8.  WAR ALARM FOR HEALTH PERSONNEL 
(Hurriyet/Tercuman)  While preparations continue

General of the Red Crescent and Civil Defense 
switched to the \"extraordinary situation\" code, 
under the direction of the Heath Ministry. 
Orders prepared for such extraordinary situations 
as wars and natural disasters have been put in 
effect.  Temporary-duty timetables have also been 
prepared for hospitals and health personnel.  An

the Health Ministry initiated an effort to 
purchase anthrax and smallpox vaccines from the 
U.S.  Milli Gazete reported that the Red Crescent 
Adana Blood Center, through billboards, is urging 
citizens to donate blood.  Turkiye quoted Red

anti-isolation press release.  The officials were 
summoned to the Prosecutor\'s Office for 
questioning. 
 
 
13.  HRA DIYARBAKIR OFFFICIALS ACQUITTED 
(Evrensel)  A hearing was held in the Diyarbakir 
Court of General Criminal Jurisdiction on 
February 20 in the case of seven Diyarbakir Human 
Rights Association (HRA) officials charged with 
displaying posters during Newroz celebrations at 
the province\'s Southeastern Journalists\' Society 
in 2002.  Attorney Muharrem Erbey represented the

ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
15.  ECONOMIC REVIVAL POSTPONED UNTIL AN UNKNOWN 
DATE DUE TO WAR 
Sabah columnist Esen Evran wrote that while 
Turkey is focused on tense Iraq bargaining 
ongoing with the U.S., the Southeast\'s agenda is 
much more intense.  While a possible operation 
against Iraq is a brake on the economic revival 
expected to come after the economic crisis, 
everything in the Southeastern provinces has been 
on hold until an unknown date.  Abdulkadir 
Konukoglu, President of the Gaziantep-based Sanko 
Holding Company, said he was disturbed by a 
possible war in Iraq, but there was not much he 
could do about it.  \"Everyone comes up and asks 
what we will do.  I tell them to stay where they 
are.  We do not have the strength to move our 
factories,\" he added.  Gaziantep Chamber of 
Industry President Nejat Kocer pointed to 
uncertainty and shrinkage in business in the 
region during this process.  Diyarbakir Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry President Kutbettin Arzu 
said the possible war in Iraq impacted the 
region.  \"In the west of the country, people 
postpone their purchase of television sets and 
overcoats, while people here in the region do not 
buy anything other than bread, sugar, and cooking 
oil,\" he noted.  Turkiye cited Van Commodity 
Exchange President Feridun Irak as complaining 
that Turkey\'s total trade volume with its 
neighbors was around 5%, way below the desired 
level.

to stock a good quantity of Atropine, 
particularly used against poisonous gas. 
Iskenderun Port has been unofficially declared a 
\"Forbidden Zone\" by the Brigade  Command who 
overtook the security at the port. Protection of

Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet/Evrensel/Milli 
Gazete/Radikal: The Commander of US Forces in 
Europe, Gen. Burwell Bell, accompanied by Turkish 
military officers, inspected Mersin and 
Iskenderun ports yesterday and flew to Incirlik 
AB by  helicopter. Cumhuriyet: The Turkish

MOU with Washington, was military equipment 
dispatched at Iskenderun port. The TGS emphasized 
that the shipment did not contain any combat 
components. Radikal: Based on the permission 
given by the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the

secure flights. Hurriyet: Activities continue at 
Iskenderun and Tasucu ports which are ready for 
war ships to dock. The Iskenderun port where 522

missile batteries, were unloaded, resembles a 
military headquarters. Following unloading of 
military equipment, 290 US soldiers from Incirlik 
AB were also dispatched to the port where

into press. The group\'s attorney, Mahmut Oktem, 
and the plaintiff, attorney and DYP provincial 
chairman, Sermet Atay attended the hearing. A

Anti-Turkish Christian Comments Criticized 
 
 
Milliyet: The Turkish National Assembly\'s Human 
Rights Commission\'s sub-committee which held 
inspections in Mardin determined that Syriac 
Christians could constitute a problem for the 
unitary structure of Turkey in the future. The 
sub-committee\'s report received adverse 
reactions. CHP\'s Mardin deputy, Muharrem Dogan, 
said Syriacs were not a danger but a benefit for 
Turkey, and added that the sub-committee was 
misinformed, there was no such danger in the 
region. MP Dogan said \"We grew up together with 
these people, we are cohabiting. That they are a 
danger for Turkey is not true. This is 
discrimination, racialism and abuse of religion. 
Their religion may be different. They believe in 
the Bible.\" 
 
 
8.  Ocalan Supporters arrested 
 
 
Milli Gazete: Three Ataturk University (Erzurum) 
students writing pro-PKK/KADEK slogans such as

quarters of Erzurum were arrested by anti-terror 
police. The suspects were taken to Erzurum State 
Security Court following their interrogation by 
police. 
 
 
9. Turks Plan for possible N. Iraq Entry 
 
 
Milliyet: The Turkish Armed Forces who will enter 
Northern Iraq to cope with influx of refugees and 
install security equipment almost completed their 
preparations. With these personnel, the number of 
2nd Army affiliate troops at the border region 
reached 100 thousand. The military units under 
Gen. Fevzi Turkeri\'s command were inoculated 
against contagious diseases. 50 thousand Turkish 
soldiers are expected to enter Northern Iraq if 
the Turkish Parliament  decides to join the 
oepration. Jandarma General Command affiliated 
jandarma units will be in charge of relief 
efforts, while military units affiliated with the 
land Forces Command will provide security. 
 
 
10.  Siirt Elections 
 
 
Milliyet: Prior to the March 9 by-elections where 
AKP chair, Tayyip Erdogan, will run for 
parliament,  Interior Minister, Abdulkadir Aksu; 
Public Works and Resettlement Minister, Zeki 
Ergezen, and 7 AKP MPs visited Siirt. Cumhuriyet 
reports that Mr. Erdogan plans to visit his 
constituency twice during the election, and will 
make his first visit to Siirt on February 28 or 
March 01. DEHAP who got 26,980 votes in November 
3 general elections in Siirt announced that they 
would cooperate with CHP in the upcoming 
election. There are a total of 119,210 registered 
voters in Siirt province, but only 88,397 voted 
on November 3. DEHAP was the clear winner of the 
November 3 elections in Siirt, but because it did 
not pass the 10 percent national bar, it was 
unable to elect any deputies. DEHAP\'s Deputy 
Secretary General claimed if they joined CHP, CHP 
 
SIPDIS 
could win the three seats in Siirt.

detergent. 8 persons were ordered held by the 
court. 
 
 
12.  Fears of OHAL\'s Return 
 
 
Turkiye: Inhabitants of East and Southeast Turkey 
are uncomfortable about the possibility of 
declaring state of emergency in the region again 
if war starts. It is also speculated that because 
of the deployment of US troops at Sabiha Gokcen 
Airport in Istanbul, Istanbul might become the 
terrorists\' target, and in the light of such a 
danger, state of emergency could be declared in 
Istanbul, too. Another worry is that the innocent 
Kurdish people in the region might suffer in the 
combat with the PKK. Claims that the US will hire 
former village guards to fight in Northern Iraq 
and pay them between 2 to 4 thousand dollars has 
created a bomb effect in the region. 
 
 
 
 
13.  Local Business Boom Due to Incoming 
Americans

torture and hold the perpetrators accountable for 
their actions. 
 
 
15. MP Denied Access to Iskenderun Port 
 
 
Hurriyet: CHP\'s Hatay MP, Gokhan Durgun, who 
attempted to conduct an inspection at the 
Iskenderun port where US troops and military 
equipment are deployed was denied access by 
Turkish authorities on the grounds that they 
could not guarantee his physical security. MP

1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for February 24, 2003.  Please note that Turkish 
press reports often contain errors or 
exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch 
for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  Hurriyet: The European Committee for 
Prevention of Torture (CPT) who last week visited 
PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali prison 
by helicopter provided by the Justice Ministry 
determined that Ocalan was physically sound. The 
two-person CPT delegation met with Ocalan for 
five hours.  They determined that his sole 
complaint was isolation. The following points 
were underlined in the CPT report: Ocalan is in 
good health. The Turkish authorities provide 
regular physical examinations and report the 
results to Ankara. Ocalan\'s family and lawyers 
were being taken to the island every Wednesday by 
the Justice Ministry\'s official boat. However, 
when the winds are too high (Level 4), such boat 
journeys are not doable. No one has able to visit 
Ocalan for a long time - since the end of 
November. Thus, there has been an obstacle to 
such boat visits.  The CPT team is of the 
impression that this obstacle is being created 
deliberately. Ocalan has access to daily 
newspapers. He has a transistor radio on which he 
can listen to TRT (Turkish Radio and Television). 
The CPT believes that, even with limitations or 
conditions, a means of telephone communication 
should be created for Ocalan. 
 
 
3.  Hurriyet: It is reported that the wave of 
migration Turkey expects in the likely war on 
Iraq already started in Northern Iraq\'s region 
close to Hakkari province. It is gathered that 
the migration movement that started in Barzani\'s 
KDP controlled region has not reached Turkey yet, 
and the immigrants are living on their own means, 
and that Kizilay, the Turkish Red Crescent, has 
undertaken all sorts of precautions to provide 
relief to the immigrants in the event they 
appeared at the Turkish border. Although 
Barzani\'s KDP and Talabani\'s PUK claim that there 
won\'t be a migration like the one in 1991, 
Turkish officials believe migration will be 
inevitable. Turkey has had a military presence in 
northern Iraq since 1993, and is worried that the 
United States is depending on Mesud Barzani\'s 
forces too much. 
 
 
4.  Hurriyet/Radikal:  IKDP\'s spokesman, Hosyar 
Zebari threatened Ankara by warning that the 
Turkish army should not enter the region, and 
they would clash with them if they did. Zebari 
was quoted as saying, \"We understand Turkey\'s 
sensitivity, and we guaranteed it repeatedly. Our 
purpose is not to found an independent Kurdistan. 
We have showed in the past that we could work in 
coordination with Turks. Even a minor 
intervention will cause clashes. Any intervention 
on any pretext will cause clashes. No one should 
think that we are bluffing.\" Zebari said that 
there was nothing that required the Turkish army 
to enter the region, and that they could take 
care of anything needed in the region. He said 
there was no discrimination against Turcomans, 
and that they were their co-citizens and 
partners. Talabani\'s spokesman, Latif Resit, also 
expressed that they were against Turkish army 
penetration into the region, and in response to 
whether or not they would enter Kirkuk, Mr. Resit 
said \"our forces will remain as part of Iraq\'s 
forces.\" 
 
 
5.  Milliyet/Turkiye: Turkish armed forces\' 
military build-up in the region continues. 
Military convoys carrying ammunition and military 
equipment from various towns are first destined 
for Cizre and Silopi townships. Three convoys -- 
consisting in total of 25 trucks, 15 jeeps and 20 
TIR trucks carrying armored vehicles and 
artillery -- passed through Cizre yesterday. 
Preparations for a possible refugee influx into 
Turkey continue. It is said that 75 teachers will 
be assigned to tents to be set up for  refugees 
on the Turkish side of the border. 
 
 
6.  Milliyet: It is reported that the 
infrastructure improvement projects at Incirlik 
AB have been expedited, and that a large number 
of heavy-duty machines were seen digging a three 
meter deep pit in the size of a soccer field. It 
is said that the excavations were made for 
building new hangars.  An increase in the number 
of tents at the site allocated for ONW soldiers 
was also reported. The number of \"giant tents\" 
increased to three during the weekend. It is said 
that these giant tents will be used as a 
revolving door by the US troops when the Turkish 
national Assembly authorizes deployment of US 
forces in Turkey. It is also reported that the 
ground where the US tankers are located has been 
hardened, and painting of the runways has been 
completed. 
 
 
7.  Cumhuriyet: It is reported that the United 
States has asked the Turkish government to double 
the capacity of Incirlik AB or else build a new 
base similar to the one in Incirlik in Batman. In 
addition to the current issues and hot 
developments in the region, bilateral long-term 
strategic talks are also taking place between the 
two governments. 
The US wants to use Turkey as a \"central logistic 
base\" for its plans to shape the Middle East and 
Caspian and Balkan triangle in the 21st century, 
and therefore wants to use almost all Turkish 
ports and airports from which military aircraft 
could operate. It is reported that the US has 
made the following demands from the Turkish 
government. 
- Sign a new agreement for doubling the capacity 
of Incirlik AB. 
- If that doesn\'t work, turn over the Batman base 
and the  installations around the base. 
- During the use of airports and ports by the 
Turkish military, there may be a shortage of 
warehouse space. Therefore we should work on a 
rental arrangement for the areas surrounding the 
bases. 
- We should also work on the railway and roads to 
facilitate our transportation. 
8.  Bolge: As the possible war on Iraq 
approaches, government officials have not 
disclosed how they are going to provide for 
citizens\' security.  The people of Adana do not 
know what to do in the case of an attack by Iraq 
using weapons of mass destruction. Civil defense 
authorities said they had determined the type of 
precautions to be undertaken in case of an 
attack, but because they had not received 
approval from the governor\'s office, they 
couldn\'t announce it to the public. 
 
 
9.  Turkiye: A spokeswoman for the Women\'s 
Platform of the Human Rights Association\'s 
Diyarbakir chapter said the number of sexual- 
harassment and rape cases in Mardin has increased 
recently. She said a 12 year old girl was 
recently found to have been trafficked and 
serially raped, even by government officials. The 
investigation caused detention of many government 
officials, and the investigation continues. Necla 
Akdeniz, another girl, who was raped by village 
guards in Mardin, was subsequently shot to death 
by her own family. A girl named Semsiye was also 
killed; her head was bashed in with stones, for 
having a forbidden love affair. 
 
 
 
 
10.  Evrensel: 2500 Petrol-Is Union members in 
Batman who did not receive their overtime pays 
for four months will go on strike today and press 
for 700 contracted workers whose contracts will 
end in March to be put on permanent payroll. The 
union\'s Batman chapter president, Nimetullah 
Sozen, said their unpaid overtime totaled to TL 
800 billion ($620 thousand. 
 
 
11.  Sabah: Adana mayor, Aytac Durak, who did not 
report 38 pieces of real estate and 583,825 
square meters of land in his statement to the tax 
office faces a court hearing on March 13. If 
Mayor Durak fails to persuade the jury about the 
shortcomings in his statement he will face an 
imprisonment term from 3 to 8 years and will be 
banned for life from public service. As a result 
of a tip-off, the Interior Ministry launched an 
investigation in 2001 and his file was submitted 
to Chief Public Prosecutor\'s Office of Adana.

POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  Bolge/Milli Gazete/Milliyet: In his written 
statement, Saban Bas, the President of Adana\'s 
Chamber of Commerce, said that since it is 
impossible to avert the possible war on Iraq 
investment should continue so that the war would 
not have a negative impact on the economy. Bas 
said the war should not cast a shadow over the 
economy, and that no one has the luxury of 
forgetting the impact of the 1991 Gulf War. 
Milliyet reports that Mr. Bas claimed Turkey\'s 
losses due to the 1991 war and post-war crisis 
were between 100-150 billion dollars and that 
Adana\'s exports dropped to 3 million dollars from 
20-25 million dollars. 
 
 
3.  Turkiye: The first group of 210 Dutch 
soldiers assigned to work on the Patriot air 
defense systems sent to Turkey by Holland will

360 soldiers will leave Holland for Turkey on 
February 28. The Dutch soldiers will land in 
Adana and be dispatched to Diyarbakir and Batman. 
The Patriot air defense systems sent by freight 
ships by the Government of Holland are expected 
to arrive in Turkey shortly.

Northern Iraq was postponed due to adverse 
weather conditions. The meeting is rescheduled 
for February 28. A total of 366 reporters, 
including 242 foreign reporters with 
accreditation, will pass from Habur Border gate 
to Northern Iraq to follow the meeting in 
Selahaddin town under IKDP\'s control. About 50

attend the meeting. 
 
 
6.  Tercuman: It is reported that the first US 
military unit will land in Gaziantep. 
Preparations have been made for landing of six 
thousand US soldiers at Gaziantep airport. It is 
claimed that the land around the airport has been 
rented for setting up desert tents. Soldiers from 
the famed 101st Airborne Brigade are expected to 
be deployed in Gaziantep. 
 
 
7.  Evrensel: In Batman, people talk about the 
war at every opportunity, and at night protest 
the US by participating in the nationwide 
\"turning lights on and off\" campaign. In Batman, 
shopkeepers are affected most from the 
preparations for the war because of stagnation in 
commerce because missile defense systems had been 
deployed behind Batman\'s industrial site. 
 
 
8.  Cumhuriyet: While US preparations for the war 
on Iraq are intensified, people in the Southeast 
have already started to suffer. The oil tankers 
bringing oil from Northern Iraq to Turkey form 
long queues at the border. Tanker drivers claimed 
that 130 km trips required all of 10 days because 
of intensified traffic due to US convoys. In the 
meantime, one segment of the people suffering 
badly from the war are merchants, who said 
because of the uncertainty added to the existing 
economic crises they have no customers and have 
closed their doors. 
 
 
9.  Radikal: In addition to military equipment 
brought to the Iskenderun port under the 
modernization program, a second freighter named 
Antares (Norwegian-flagged) unloaded 310  pieces 
of military equipment and 52 military vehicles. 
Activities were also seen at warehouses rented by 
Americans. 
 
 
10.  Milliyet: The Executive Board President of 
Adana\'s Environment and Consumer Protection 
Association, and East Mediterranean Environment 
Associations\' Representative for Adana, Attorney 
Remzi Umit Akay, said the possible war on Iraq 
would not only kill people but also damage the 
ecosystem because of the chemical weapons that 
would be used. Akay said that war was a crime, 
and Turkey should not become a partner in this 
crime, and added that the ones who counted each 
death in this war would feel that every bomb was 
thrown at their conscience. 
 
 
11.  Bolge: The President of Mersin\'s Chamber of 
Maritime Trade, Cihat Lokmanoglu, announced that 
because of its position, location, and distance 
to Asia, Europe, and Africa continents, the port 
of Mersin was the most important sea gate of the 
Eastern Mediterranean and Turkey. It was 
expressed that the tourism potential in Antalya 
should be carried over to the Mersin region and 
the maritime transportation between Antalya and 
Mersin should definitely be established. In order 
to enliven sea tourism in the province, 
Lokmanoglu opined that the 500-yacht-capacity 
Mersin marina and 200-yacht-capacity Kumkuyu 
marina currently under construction should be 
completed as soon as possible. Lokmanoglu also

resources, history, and culture, Mersin was 
important for its proximity to other historical 
and tourist sites such as Kapadokya and Hatay. He

2. Tercuman: In its session on February 28, the 
Turkish National Security Council is going to 
evaluate the idea of declaring state of emergency 
rule or martial law in Diyarbakir, Batman, 
Mardin, Sirnak, Siirt, and Hakkari provinces in 
order to prevent any kind of disorder that might 
take place in the event of war in Iraq. 
 
 
3. Evrensel: Although officially not declared, 
the OHAL administration is in effect reinstated 
in Diyarbakir. All the checkpoints that existed 
during the OHAL period have been re-activated, 
while special-team units and armored personnel- 
carriers have been deployed in town. ID checks 
are being conducted more frequently. Diyarbakir 
inhabitants are unhappy about the reappearance of 
these OHAL practices. 
 
 
4.  Milliyet/Turkiye/Tercuman/Milli 
Gazete/Cumhuriyet: It is reported that Kurdish 
leaders Mesut Barzani and Celal Talabani in 
northern Iraq wrote a joint letter to President 
Bush demanding that Turkish soldiers should not 
be allowed to enter northern Iraq, and asked for 
\"urgent protection\" from the US. The two Kurdish 
leaders expressed in their letter that Turkey 
aimed at diminishing the \"democratic government\" 
formed in northern Iraq, and that there would be 
clashes with Turkish soldiers if Turkish soldiers 
came. 
In Erbil, the Kurdish National Assembly decided 
to oppose the presence of Turkish forces in 
northern Iraq.  The Vice President of the IKDP 
Group, Ahmet Salar, stated that \"It is not 
Turkey, but rather the Iraqi people and Iraqi 
Kurds, who are responsible for the territorial 
integrity of Iraq. We can provide our own 
security.\" 
 
 
5.  A commission to improve relations between 
Turkey and Barzani\'s IKDP was formed by Iraqi 
opposition groups. Cuneyt Mengun from the 
Turcoman Front was also included in this 
committee. After the commission\'s meeting with 
Barzani, an anti-Turkish demonstration planned in 
Erbil was ordered stopped by Mesut Barzani. Sami 
Abdurrahman, an IKDP official, said they were not 
as afraid of threat by Saddam as afraid of 
Turkey. He said Saddam killed many Kurds, but 
Turkey would kill Kurdish people\'s ambitions and 
hopes. 
 
 
6.  Hurriyet: Per the agreement between Turkey 
and the United States, some 62,000 American 
soldiers will be deployed in tent cities to be 
set up in Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Malatya, 
Batman, and Silopi. The American soldiers -- who 
will come via Iskenderun port -- will be 
concentrated in Gaziantep and then dispersed to 
their stations via Sanliurfa highway, and 
eventually enter northern Iraq through the Habur 
border gate. It is reported that the US has 
promised financing for the resurfacing of the 
Gaziantep-Urfa highway after the conclusion of 
the war. 
The designated tent-city centers are: 1) 
Gaziantep airport and its adjacent area, 2) 
Malatya\'s Erhac airport and its adjacent area, 3) 
Diyarbakir airport and its adjacent area, 4) 
Mardin airport and its adjacent area, 5) Batman 
airport and its adjacent area, 6) Silopi township

Gazete/Sabah/Radikal: 
A 48,143 gross ton US Navy affiliate vessel named 
\"Capella\" docked at Iskenderun port yesterday but 
did not unload. After the Navy vessel, other 
ships named \"Gute\" and \"Rozana\" also approached 
the docks.  The American Delegation rented a 52- 
bed capacity, fully equipped private hospital in 
Batman. Fifteen doctors in various specialties 
work at the hospital. The US delegation visited 
some of the doctors in their private offices, 
too. 
 
 
8. Turkiye: An Antonov-124 Russian cargo plane 
brought Patriot missile ramps that will be 
installed at Diyarbakir and Batman airports. The 
teams who had come to Turkey for installing the 
Patriot missile systems will start work in the 
coming days. A military convoy of 40-50 vehicles 
carrying five heavy cannons (mortars), three 
ambulances, two cranes, and several trucks 
traveled from Adana to the southeast yesterday. 
 
 
9. Cumhuriyet: Teachers Union\'s Diyarbakir 
chapter president, Abdullah Demirtas, said 
although the ratio of the schools constructed in 
the region increased progressively the number of 
students per classroom was still very high. He 
said there was an average of 60-70 students in a 
class, and their main problem was the shortage of 
teachers.  Demirtas said 1200 teachers had been 
appointed to the region, but because of 
retirements and transfers there was still a big 
shortage of teachers, and in some schools, they 
had heating problems, and in addition there was a 
need for another 1200 school janitors. 
 
 
10.  Hurriyet: 26 persons charged of raping a 12 
year old poor girl were arraigned in a secret 
session at the 1st Felony Court of Mardin. Two 
women who allegedly were involved in trafficking 
the girl were also charged. It is claimed that 
the girl recognized all the persons who allegedly 
raped her. The inmates apparently stated in their 
interrogations that they were wealthy, reputable, 
and mature persons living in Mardin and 
Kiziltepe, and it was impossible for them to 
attempt to do such a thing. They claimed that 
they saw the girl at the court for the very first 
time, and that in Mardin there was a mafia that 
tried to extort money from them by blackmail. The 
sub-governor\'s secretary -- who is one of those 
accused of having raped the girl -- defended 
himself saying that many people apply to his 
office for assistance, and some people whom he 
couldn\'t help may have tried to take their 
revenge from him by such an accusation. The 
hearing was adjourned to an unspecified date. 
 
 
11.  Milliyet/Turkiye/Sabah: Because of heavy 
rainfall in Reyhanli township of Hatay, the level 
of water in the Asi River has swelled 
dramatically and villages are flooded. Tayfur 
Sokmen, Terzihoyuk, Kurtulmus, Cumhuriyet and 
Karcancik villages are on stand-by for evacuation 
should the water level rise even further. 
 
 
12.  Radikal: The Bush Administration has chosen 
Eric Edelman, Vice President Cheney\'s \"prince,\" 
to become the new U.S. Ambassador to Ankara. 
Edelman, 51, who served as U.S. Ambassador to 
Finland previously, is an expert on Russia.  He 
will take up his posting this summer, pending the 
Senate\'s confirmation of his nomination.

2.  Evrensel/Hurriyet: PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, who had not been able to meet with his 
family and lawyers for 12 weeks, was granted the 
chance this week.  The meeting did not come off, 
however. His lawyers from Asrin Hukuk Burosu -- 
Dogan Erbas, Firat Aydinkaya, and Aysel Tugluk - 
along with his sister, Hava Keser, came to Gemlik 
and boarded the Turkish-government\'s boat for 
Imrali island, where Ocalan is imprisoned. 
Halfway between Gemlik and Imrali, the seas 
became rough, and the boat turned around. 
Acording to Hurriyet, a five-page report giving 
information about PKK/KADEK\'s situation and 
prospects in the event of war on Iraq was found 
sandwiched between newspapers that were being 
carried by attorney Aysel Tugluk for Ocalan. 
Turgluk explained that the report might have been 
put among the papers by employees at the legal 
office.  The papers reported several incidents 
throughout the region protesting either war 
and/or Ocalan\'s isolation, including Van, 
Diyarbakir, and Gaziantep.

States gets ready for war on Iraq, the military 
bases and airbases in Turkey also became very 
active. There was a heavy air traffic at Incirlik 
AB from evening till early morning yesterday. Two 
tanker planes, one cargo plane, and one Prowler 
landed at the base during morning hours. It is 
reported that some American dependents have 
started leaving the base.  Modernization projects

fuel there.  More than 10 cargo planes have 
ferried in military equipment to Diyarbakir 
Military Airport in the last three days. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye/Dunya: Turkey recalled its Ambassador

Baghdad, as a precaution against uncontrolled 
activities that would erupt.  Meanwhile, Turkey 
has sealed its Habur Border Gate for any entry or 
exit. Turkish employees working for contracting 
firms in Iraq and truckers currently in Iraq were 
warned to return to Turkey. More than 12,000

transportation between Turkey and Iraq. 
 
 
7.  Cumhuriyet: As talks that started on Saturday 
between Americans and Turks continue, 80 US ships 
carrying military vehicles and equipment await 
off-shore in the Mediterranean. It is reported 
that the ships carry combat materiel that will be 
used in the operation. M1 tanks, missile ramps, 
and other armored equipment are among the ships\' 
cargoes, which can only be discharged after

repaired, and mobile bridges have been erected at 
designated military transit points. 
 
 
9.  Turkiye: The Mersin Security Directorate 
disclosed that, based on a tip, they seized a

2. MILITARY ATTACHES TURNED AWAY AT BORDER 
(Milliyet/Hurriyet) Military attaches, Daniel 
Bates and Joseph Collins from the American 
Embassy in Ankara and 50 American soldiers, were 
stopped by Turkish security forces in Cizre and 
were told to return.  The attaches drove to 
Diyarbakir in vehicles belonging to the American 
Consulate in Adana, and later settled in the 
Dedeman Hotel.  Reportedly the Attaches will go 
back to Northern Iraq once they receive necessary 
documents from the American Embassy.  The 
American soldiers returned to Incirlik. 
 
 
3. ORDER TO RETURN 
(Hurriyet/Dunya/Turkiye/Radikal)  Civil trucks at 
the Iskenderun port which were carrying American 
military vehicles, were preparing to go to 
Eastern Turkey yesterday when they were held at 
the gate upon orders from Ankara. American 
officials came to the port to hold a meeting on 
March 1, after the Turkish parliament voted 
against American troops using the country as a 
base in case of a possible war with Iraq. 
 
 
4. SECURITY MEASURES IN MEDITTERANEAN 
(Milliyet/)  Strict security measures are being 
taken in the eastern Mediterranean region 
especially at the ports of Iskenderun and Mersin 
that America wishes to use in a possible war 
against Iraq. In Iskenderun, it is prohibited to 
approach within 200 meters of vessels. A similar 
ban is being applied to fishing boats In Mersin 
and Tasucu. 
 
 
5. EX-MAYOR SUPPORTS LOCAL PRESS 
(Bolge/)  Yuregir ex-Mayor, Omer Topcu, took 
action by demanding reform on the new bid law 
that has brought the local press to a halt. 
Topcu sent letters to members of the commission 
who prepared the law and to ministers of Adana. 
In his letter, Topcu states that the law has 
given a blow to the organs of the local press 
since it came into effect in January 2003.  Topcu 
also stated that this new law takes a large 
portion of bid advertisements from local 
newspapers and transfers them to the official 
newspaper, which is not read by the public at 
large. 
 
 
6. NEW BRIDGE TO HABUR 
(Dunya)   A new bridge is under construction at 
the Viransehir- Kiziltepe section of E-90 that 
connects to the Habur border gate.  It is 
reported that E-90 is an important route in terms 
of military transportation to the border. 
Officials note that the old bridge is too high 
and its columns cannot support heavy vehicles. 
 
 
7. NO TO WAR, ISOLATION AND OHAL 
(Evrensel)  Solidarity and collaboration with 
Prisoner Families Association (TUHADER), made a 
press announcement in Diyarbakir saying `no\' to 
war, isolation of PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan and `no\'to a return to possible OHAL 
(state of security).  The president of the 
association, Mahmut Bayhan, said they will 
continue to support peace, brotherhood and 
freedom.  Bayhan noted the possible war that has 
been escalated by America is a potential threat 
to Turkey and to the region.

8. PARLIAMENT DECISION IS WRONG SAYS GUNSIAD 
(Dunya)  President of SouthEastern Industrialist 
and Business Association,Bedrettin Karaboga, made 
an announcement regarding the decision of the 
parliament not to let American troops use bases 
in Turkey.  Karaboga said that Turkey needs to 
protect its interests by not separating itself 
from America, economically or politically. 
Karaboga also added that the decision would 
adversely affect the Turkish economy and 
political structure, since Turkey is dependent on 
America in terms of economics and politics. 
 
 
9. PEOPLE BEGIN STOCKING FOOD 
(Sabah)  Silopi and Cizre are provinces that 
border Iraq. In the gulf war of 1991, people in 
these regions were unable to find food, and 
therefore, this time they are preparing for a 
possible war by stocking fundamental food items 
such as flour, oil and cracked wheat.  Bekir 
Sahin,who runs a flour factory in Silopi says 
that they are having difficulty supplying flour 
due to the increased demand. He also notes that 
their work capacity increased 10 times.  As such 
they are working 24 hours a day to catch up.

2. ELECTION EXCITEMENT  IN SIIRT 
( Dunya/Tercuman/Turkiye)   Excitement increases 
as the elections in Siirt approach.   It appears 
as though AK Party leader Recep Erdogan will gain 
his presidency from Siirt. Erdogan was  banned 
from politics because of a speech he gave 4 years 
ago in the same town.  AK Party is confident they 
will bring out 3 deputies, since DEHAP withdrew 
from the elections. The election will be held on 
Sunday March 9, between 6:00 and 15:00.   The 
following parties will participate in the 
election: TKP (Turkish Communist Party), IP 
(Labor party), CHP (Peoples Republican Party) and 
AK Party (Justice and Development Party). The 
other parties have announced that they will not 
participate in the election. 
 
 
3. WAR PREPARATIONS CONTINUE IN BATMAN 
(Evrensel)  Ramps for Patriot missiles have been 
set up in Batman airport and will be operated by 
Dutch soldiers.  It is reported that 200 trucks 
carrying equipment arrived at the Batman airport 
under the modernization project. Large numbers of 
work machines from various provinces were brought 
to Batman Village Services Directorate.  It is 
reported that the machines are going to be sent 
to the camps that will be set up for refugees. 
 
 
4. ERBAKAN`S DEMAND REJECTED 
(Cumhuriyet/Sabah)  The State Security Court in 
Diyarbakir rejected a request to purge the 
judicial records of Necmettin Erbakan, the last 
president of the closed Refah party (Prosperity 
Party).  Erbakan`s attorney, Mehmet Ener pointed 
out that the decision would not affect Erbakan`s 
right to vote or to be elected.

Industrialist and Businessmen`s Association in 
Mardin, said \"no to war\" and voted against 
permitting American troops use Turkish bases.  On 
the other hand, he rented his factory in 
Kiziltepe, Mardin to the American army.  Duyan`s 
reply to the criticism regarding the issue was 
that he had rented a factory that belonged to 
him, which is not of interest to anyone and it is 
not a contradiction, it is only trade.  It is 
reported that security forces prevented an 
American military attachQ to enter the region.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PHUM, TU, OSCE, ADANA 
SUBJECT:  THE VIEW FROM THE SOUTHEAST, 
ERDOGAN SET TO WIN 
 
 
REF:  ANKARA 1410 
 
 
Summary: Reftel reported the view from Ankara 
that AK Party and its leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
seems poised to win March 9 special election in 
Siirt.  Indications from our contacts in 
predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey also 
point to a comfortable victory for Erdogan and 
AK. There are three seats at stake in Siirt. 
While AK officials in Siirt naturally predict a 
clean sweep, CHP representatives there hope to 
win one, or at most two seats.  The province\'s 
most popular party, DEHAP, is furious at not 
being allowed to contest the election; acting 
apparently on instructions from headquarters, 
local DEHAP supporters are being informally urged 
to boycott or spoil their ballots.  Widespread 
anxiety among Siirt Kurds about war in Northern 
Iraq and possible Turkish military involvement 
there does not seem to be pushing voters toward 
CHP in sufficient numbers to offset AK\'s 
advantage.  End Summary. 
 
 
1) Consulate Adana poloff toured Siirt Province 
March 4-5 to gauge trends prior to the March 9 
parliamentary by-election.  Siirt province likely 
has 80,000 voters. (Note: Like most other SE 
Turkey provinces, Siirt is almost entirely made 
up of ethnic Kurds, with the exception of small 
pockets of Turks sent to work for the Government 
and Turkish traders of Arab origin. Endnote.) 
 
 
2) In all locals, (note:  We toured the 
provincial capital, Siirt (est. population 
100,000), and three smaller townships, Kurtalan 
(est. pop. 30,000), and Baykan (est. pop. 12,000) 
End Note.) in proportion to their size, the 
normal election-campaign apparatus and 
apparatchiks were on display: banners, pennants, 
posters, the occasional deputy or minister from 
Ankara shaking hands, and campaign buses cruising 
the streets blaring a mixture of slogans and 
music.  We are unaware of any opinion polling 
going on in the province prior to the election. 
 
 
------------------------- 
AK Predicting a Landslide 
------------------------- 
 
 
3) In conversations with AK Party officials at 
all locations, we found them almost giddy with a 
sense of imminent triumph.  They are not going to 
be satisfied with a 3-0 sweep over their only 
serious rival, CHP.  Rather, we repeatedly heard 
the figure of eighty percent as their predicted 
vote total.  AK Party headquarters in all 
locations gave an impression of being hectic and 
chaotic, but flush with resources, including 
plenty of campaign workers. 
 
 
4) It appears AK Party has indeed been applying 
its advantage as the party of government. 
Although we heard from AK Party officials about 
effective government, from other party officials 
and from random citizens we heard anecdotal 
evidence of how AK has been focusing resources on 
Siirt in the run-up to the election.  For 
example, an isolated hamlet might finally get its 
road or its electricity repaired after many years 
of waiting. (Note:  Road repair crews were in 
evidence as we drove around several towns.) 
Similar promises for future delivery of services 
are allegedly being made widely.  In Eruh, one 
citizen said he had heard of (but not seen), 
voters being bought - for as little as 50 million 
Turkish Lira (approx USD 30). 
 
 
5) AK Party officials and supporters seemed 
unconcerned that the party and Erdogan 
specifically would pay a price at the ballot box 
in Siirt because of the government\'s, and 
Erdogan\'s, support of the defeated resolution 
concerning US troops coming to Turkey and Turkish 
troops in northern Iraq.  As one party official 
somewhat disingenuously explained, \"Mr. Erdogan 
is not in the parliament, so the responsibility 
cannot be assigned to him.\" Besides, he said, 
lots of AK deputies voted against the resolution 
anyway. 
 
 
6.)  One final factor that gives comfort to AK in 
Siirt is the depth of religiosity in the 
province. (Note:  In Ottoman times Siirt was 
known for its holy men and shrines honoring them 
are unusually common.End note) The religious vote 
in Siirt will go for AK, to spite the secular 
CHP. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
CHP Gamely Hanging in There 
--------------------------- 
 
 
7).  In all CHP headquarters we visited, 
officials described a frustrating two-front 
battle.  Firstly, they had to find a way to 
appeal to voters through ideas rather than 
through instant or promised \"pork, \" which is the 
prerogative of the party in power. Secondly, they 
seemed to be getting nowhere in their personally- 
made pleas to their DEHAP counterparts to vent 
protest via a CHP vote rather than abstention. 
The CHP in Siirt, based on their dealings with 
DEHAP there, believe DEHAP\'s boycott instructions 
came from the top, not spontaneously from its 
Siirt supporters. 
 
 
8)  CHP believes that the popularity of the anti- 
war and anti-US-troops-in-Turkey stance of the 
party and CHP Chairman Deniz Baykal in particular 
is helping - but not enough.  It would seem 
perhaps logical that Kurdish voters might reward 
the CHP and punish AK, as it was the AK cabinet 
that proposed allowing US troops to come to 
Turkey and Turkish troops to go into northern 
Iraq.  However, as one frustrated CHP official 
put it, \"DEHAP wants to punish everybody.\" 
 
 
9) No CHP official or supporter in Siirt told us 
that the party would be shut out, nor that it 
would take all three seats.  One seat, or two, if 
turnout was high in Siirt City, was their 
refrain. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
DEHAP: Anger at an Anti-Democratic Election 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
10) Not surprisingly, without exception DEHAP 
members and supporters rejected the upcoming 
March 9 election as illegitimate and 
undemocratic.  Noting that DEHAP was easily the 
major party in the province, why was it being 
blocked from participating this time, they 
wondered. This was particularly galling, they 
noted, in light of the fact that two, completely 
insignificant parties - the Workers Party and the 
Communist Party - had been allowed to run this 
time, and were doing so.  (Note:  While the 
Communist Party is all but invisible in Siirt 
right now, the Workers Party has managed to put 
up posters and run some campaign buses; their 
slogan is \"No to American Soldiers!\" End note.). 
 
 
11) DEHAP people in Siirt do not feel warm 
towards AK Party.  Their demands have not found 
resonance with this government, and in Siirt they 
are still waiting for the State to get off their 
back, i.e., put Kurdish language liberalization 
into practice, facilitate village returns, end 
the enforced isolation of Abdullah Ocalan, and in 
general, as one interlocutor put it, \"stop 
treating us like animals.\"  Although DEHAP 
officials acknowledged the logic of expressing 
disappointment with AK by casting votes for CHP, 
they said that a boycott and spoiled-vote 
strategy was preferable.  The need to highlight 
the anti-democratic nature of this election - and 
of Turkish politics writ large - was the 
overriding objective. 
 
 
12) When asked to predict the likely outcome of 
the election in any case, most DEHAP members 
handicapped it as a likely 2-1 outcome, with 
either AK or CHP on top.

for March 12, 2003.  Please note that Turkish 
press reports often contain errors or 
exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch 
for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
Milli Gazete: It is reported that the Kurdish 
units stationed in Dohuk, close to the Turkish 
border, returned to their bases on weekend to 
confront Turkey\'s likely military incursion into 
northern Iraq. Babaker Zebari, the commander of 
Kurdish forces in the region, claimed they were 
ready for any Turkish intervention. Zebari 
claimed that \"if Turks wanted problems, they 
would be held responsible for them.\" The Kurdish 
commander said that they would attack the Turkish 
forces the moment they came, even though they had 
only RPGs against the Turks\'tanks. He remarked 
that they might not be able to hold the front but 
would launch guerilla attacks. In his TV program 
on Saturday, Mesut Barzani claimed that 
penetration of Turkish troops into Northern Iraq 
would create \"serious consequences\" and that he 
hoped the US would not betray the Kurds. 
 
 
Milliyet: Based on its interviews with ordinary 
Turkomen in Erbil, BBC claimed that the Turkomen, 
as opposed to the Turkomen Front supported by 
Ankara, were generally happy with their status 
and did not need any protection from Turkey. The 
BBC reporter said the number of Turkomen in 
northern Iraq reached 2.5 million. Cevdet Naccar, 
a Turkomen, said: \"We enjoy the same rights as 
the Kurds in Northern Iraq. There is no need for 
the Turkish army to intervene on the pretext of 
rescuing the Turkomen.\" An antique dealer named 
Halis Yunus said: \"They (the Turkish army) cannot 
protect us against theft and looting anyway.\" A 
Turkomen jeweler expressed the view that the 
Kurds, Arabs, and Turkomen lived together and 
could settle their problems among themselves. The 
BBC reporter claimed that the only group that 
actively supported Turkey\'s intervention was the 
Turkomen Front, headed by Sanan Ahmet Aga, who 
received his orders from Ankara. 
 
 
Radikal/Turkiye: Families and NGO representatives 
protested against statements made by northern 
Iraqi Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani. 300 
people who gathered in front of the Martyrs 
Monument in Diyarbakir yesterday morning shouted 
anti-Barzani and anti-Talabani slogans and 
dispersed peacefully after singing the Turkish 
National Anthem and the delivering of the speech 
by Ahmet Buyukburc, President of the Martyrs 
Association\'s Diyarbakir Chapter. 
 
 
Milliyet/Sabah/Hurriyet: LA Times\' photographer 
Donald Bartletti, ABC News cameraman Alan Weeks, 
and Turkish producer Elif Ural tried to cross 
into northern Iraq illegally.  They were arrested 
by jandarmas who opened fire in the air. The 
jandarmas on patrol had noticed the journalists 
as they were wading across the Hezil River. The 
journalists and the person who assisted them were 
given a physical examination and interrogated at 
Silopi Jandarma Command, and then were brought 
before a court in the morning. The journalists 
were given a fine of USD 54 for violating 
immigration laws. As the journalists took a cab 
to Onsar Hotel in Cizre, they were escorted by 
police. It was decided that Bartletti and Weeks 
would be deported from Turkey.  (Note: That is 
correct.  End note.) 
Radikal: There has been a boom in demand for 
rental property, due to its proximity to the 
Iraqi border. The rents for houses, shops, 
storage facilities, and vacant land have 
increased by 300 to 500 percent. Agit Ozdemir, a 
pioneer who opened the first real estate office 
in Silopi, said he rented out 19 houses in one 
week. 
 
 
Milliyet/Radikal: War preparations in Mardin, 
which is in the position of being the US 
operation center, continues at full speed. The US 
intensified work at a furniture factory rented in 
the Organized Industrial Zone of Mardin. Mobile 
toilets, bunk beds, mobile telephones, 
foodstuffs, and all sorts of logistical material 
are being stored in the furniture plant. 
Meanwhile, Turkish armored units conducted 
maneuvers in empty fields along the highway in 
Kiziltepe. Appearance of the armored vehicles in 
town created excitement. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Bolge: Under the first modernization 
of ports and airports motion submitted to the 
Turkish National Grand Assembly, the US keeps 
sending military equipment. The majority of the 
shipments to the region come to Iskenderun port, 
where 5000 US troops and 20-25 ships are reported 
to be waiting off shore at Karpaz. 
 
 
Radikal: Truck drivers who agreed with 
contracting firms on transporting military 
equipment from Iskenderun port to the Southeast 
for USD 100 per day said they would stop carrying 
the material because they had not been paid for 
18 days. Thanks to the intervention of Turkish 
military officials, the contracting firms gave an 
advance to each trucker and transportation 
resumed only thereafter. 89 TIR truck left 
Iskenderun port while 15 TIR trucks loaded with 
military equipment departed Incirlik AB for the 
Southeast yesterday. 
 
 
Dunya: Because of lack of storage room, some U.S. 
military vehicles and materials were put in a 
yarn factory outside the Mardin Organized 
Industrial Zone. The Americans are trying to rent 
500 shops in Evren Industrial Site in Sanliurfa 
as well. Turkish-speaking US soldiers walking in 
Diyarbakir\'s streets are meeting with the local 
people and trying to obtain information about the 
region. It is reported that Americans are looking 
for a fully equipped hospital or medical center. 
It is gathered that the US plans to fly wounded 
soldiers to hospitals to be rented in Diyarbakir, 
where they have already made offers to five big 
private hospitals. 
 
 
Sabah/Tercuman/Hurriyet: The Patriot missiles 
deployed at the 8th Main Jet Base Command of the 
2nd Tactical Command in Diyarbakir were shown to 
the press. The Dutch commander of Patriot Air 
Defense Systems Command, Lt. Col. Eric Harry 
Abma, remarked that two of the three units of the 
system were deployed in Diyarbakir, while the 
other was deployed in Batman. He was quoted \"We 
are here to protect people of Diyarbakir and 
Batman from Iraq. This is our military and 
political mission.\" The systems were made 
operational on March 11. 
 
 
Hurriyet: The US Consulate in Adana opened an 
exhibition of photographs by famed American 
photographer, William Albert Allard, at the 
Seyhan Municipality Building. The exhibit - some 
70 photographs reflecting American culture taken 
by National Geographic Society veteran Allard -- 
was opened by the American Consul, Adana Deputy 
Governor Bulent Egriboz, and Seyhan Mayor 
Yildiray Arikan.  Turkish and American invitees 
attended the opening reception.

parliament had focused on or truly understood the 
technicality of needing an absolute majority, 
i.e. a majority of all votes cast (for, against, 
abstentions).  Thus, some parliamentarians, 
including themselves, reckoned that they had a 
vote to \"waste.\" 
 
 
3.  Why, though, vote against something that you 
support?  \"Because,\" they said, \"we wanted to 
send a signal to the country and the world that 
Turkey is a democracy, and that it can\'t be 
`bought\' by the United States.\" 
 
 
 
 
4.  The embarassing pandemonium that followed the 
vote - in which all networks inaccurately 
reported at first that the resolution had passed 
- was a consequence of the fact that not only 
parliamentarians, but also the press, are hazy on 
Turkish parliamentary procedure, and lends 
credence to this explanation.

SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, 
          MARCH 13, 2003 
 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for 
March 13, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press 
reports often contain errors or exaggerations; 
AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy 
of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
1.  Milliyet/Dunya: It is reported that the UN is 
also going to establish a humanitarian assistance 
center in Mardin, and relief items to be sent by 
the will be distributed from Mardin. Officials 
announced they had initially considered 
Gaziantep, but because of the distances involved 
preferred Mardin. 
 
 
2.  Radikal/Sabah/Dunya/Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet: 
Around 100 Turkish Communist Party members 
shouting slogans tried to enter the Iskenderun 
port. Soldiers and policemen intervened. When the 
protesters resisted, the soldiers fired warning 
shots in the air, and the port was put on alarm. 
As the demonstrators persisted, the military 
commander drew his soldiers back. Police 
reinforcements tried to disperse the group with 
their clubs. American soldiers who came to the 
gate were kept back from the gate by Turkish 
military officers.  All the demonstrators were 
taken to the police station in Iskenderun, and 
eventually those detained were released by the 
court.  According to Sabah, after the events, CHP 
Hatay Deputy Aziz Yazar visited the Iskenderun 
port\'s facilities.  When he wanted to visit the 
ones hired by the US, he was told that TGS 
permission was required. MP Yazar said \"Our ports 
are occupied, and we condemn this situation,\" and 
claimed that no modernization activities were 
indeed being conducted at the port. 
 
 
3.  Radikal/Sabah/Evren: Regarding Abdullah 
Ocalan\'s trial at the State Security Court (SSC), 
the European Human Rights Court (EHRC) rendered 
its verdict, saying Turkey had violated the 1st 
and 3rd Paragraphs of Article 6 of the European 
Human Rights Convention. Turkey has been found 
guilty for exceeding the alloed detention period, 
not providing a fair trial, and mistreatment 
(specifically for giving the death penalty to 
Ocalan). The EHRC did not find replacing of the 
military judge with a civilian one sufficient for 
fair trail, and remarked that the defense lawyers 
were not given time and means required for 
defense. The lawyers\' claim that Abdullah Ocalan 
was arrested in, and brought from Kenya, to 
Turkey in an illegal way and thus subjected to 
discrimination was refused by the court. The 
court also announced that there had been no 
violations in Ocalan\'s imprisonment conditions. 
Despite the violations, EHRC did not demand 
Turkey pay any indemnities other than the sum of 
100,000 euros for court\'s expenses. Regarding the 
court\'s decision, Ocalan\'s lawyer, Hasip Kaplan, 
said the infringements of their defense rights 
were obvious, and that he would appeal the 
decision concerning illegal arrest, as well as 
other articles. Turkey, meanwhile, also opposed 
to the court\'s decision, saying it lacked solid 
grounds. 
 
 
4.  Evrensel/Hurriyet: Cukurova University 
students protested US-led war on Iraq by throwing 
eggs at posters of President Bush yesterday. The 
students, who demonstrated in front of the 
Education Faculty, shouted anti-US slogans, 
danced folk dances, and read poems of peace 
versus war. 
5.  Evrensel: Ten students from Gaziantep 
University were detained on charges of pro-KADEK 
activities.  Emine Celebi, a member of the 
Womens\' Flank of DEHAP in Kars, who was arrested 
for saying \"No to Isolation (in Prison)\" during 
March 8 International Women\'s Day demonstrations, 
was released by the court. 
6.  Bolge: Adana DEHAP\'s weekly \"sit-in at Inonu 
Park to protest aainst war and against isolation 
in prisons has turned into a tradition. The 
security forces took away \"No to War and 
Isolation\" banners carried by DEHAP supporters. 
DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman, Mehmet Can Celik, 
declared that the seizure of the banners by the 
police was an anti-democratic act, that protestos 
would continue sitting in the park. 
 
 
7.  Hurriyet: It has been determined that foreign 
media representatives following developments in 
Mersin and Iskenderun ports have given small 
cameras and offered money to truckers to take 
pictures inside the ports. Security officials 
also determined that the foreign reporters have 
offered money to truckers operating between 
Turkey and northern Iraq. Evaluating this 
information, the Foreign Ministry and Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) decided that any reporters 
detected doing so would be deported from Turkey 
immediately and truckers receiving money would be 
severely punished. Some Spanish reporters who 
were given a five-day permission by TGS to 
observe the meeting of the Iraqi Opposition in 
Selahaddin in Northern Iraq but subsequently did 
not return to Turkey will definitely not be 
allowed to reenter Turkey. The Spanish Embassy 
wrote an apology to the Turkey Foreign Ministry, 
but the TGS\'s response was that Turkey was a 
serious country, and the rules were given to the 
reporters earlier, and they would make no 
exception. 
 
 
8.  Radikal: Ambassador Pearson denied 
allegations that the US had gone beyond the 
permission given within the framework of the 
modernization project for Turkish bases. 
Ambassador Pearson said: \"All of our ongoing 
activities are within the framework of the 
permission given for the modernization of the 
bases on February 6. We are behaving honestly and 
carefully.\" 
 
 
9.  Sabah: After Mesut Barzani, now Celal 
Talabani has also started sending messages to 
Ankara through the western press. In an exclusive 
interview with the Italian La Repubblica paper, 
Talabani said Turkish soldiers should return to 
Turkey after Saddam\'s regime was ended, and the 
Americans should leave at most one hour after 
their job in Iraq was concluded. In response to 
what would happen if Turkish troops entered 
Northern Iraq alone, Talabani said Turkey could 
enter only in limited numbers to a certain place 
along with the Americans. Talabani said the 
Turkish FM Undersecretary, Ugur Ziyal, guaranteed 
that Turkey would not disarm the peshmergas and 
that the Turkish operation would be for 
humanitarian assistance. When asked if he 
believed Turkey\'s intervention would be limited, 
the Kurdish leader said they were very anxious 
about it but with the US they felt more 
comfortable. 
 
 
10.  Milliyet: The Iraqi Turkomen Front\'s 
representative for Turkey, Mustafa Ziya, claimed 
that the Turkomen were under great threat, and 
that they asked for protection from the UN, the 
US, and Turkey. Mr. Ziya claimed Kurdish groups 
in the region, including the KDP and PUK, had 
secret plans, and would put them into effect the 
 
SIPDIS 
moment the war started. He said that the Kurdish 
groups had agreed among themselves to enter 
Kirkuk.  Ziya said the US and Turkey had pledged 
that they would not allow such a thing to happen. 
 
 
11.  Radikal/Dunya: The US and Turkey are 
preparing to receive 600,000 thousand refugees 
who could come to the Turkish border in a war on 
Iraq. The relief that will be provided by the 
United Nations (UN) will be extended to refugees 
on the Iraqi side of the Turkish-Iraqi border. 
The Turkish Red Crescent is already deployed at 
the border.

\"the indivisibility of the state\", the political 
party HADEP was ordered definitively closed by a 
unanimous vote by the Constitutional Court good 
per articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution under 
articles 101 and 103 of the Political Parties 
Law. HADEP\'s property will be turned over to the

Court of Human Rights.  At the same time, the 
Chief Public Prosecutor of the Court of 
Cassation, Sabih Kanadoglu, also filed a petition 
at the Constitutional Court against DEHAP, 
founded as the substitute for HADEP, and demanded 
DEHAP\'s closure for good. 
 
 
Hurriyet: Turkey gave support to clearing of land 
mines, which killed 668 citizens during intensive 
PKK terrorism. According to the proposal, Turkey 
will clear all these land mines in 7 years. CHP 
deputy, Onur Oymen, pointed that despite the 
halting of PKK terror, some 16 persons, including 
children, were killed by land mines in 2001. 
Oymen said dismantling of the land mines would 
cost Turkey USD 300-400 million. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Bolge: The US Land Forces Vice 
Commander, Gen. Michael Dotson, who was 
accompanied by high ranking American officials 
from Incirlik AB, met with Lt. Gen. Yalcin 
Kavukcuoglu, the Commander of Turkish Navy 
Command in Iskenderun. After the talks at the 
Navy Command, Gen. Dotson visited the Iskenderun 
port and was briefed about the military 
shipments. After Gen. Dotson\'s visit to 
Iskenderun, the Turkish Land Forces Commander, 
Gen. Aytac Yalman, also inspected Turkish 
military units in Adana and Iskenderun. Gen. 
Yalman said the Turkish units were in excellent 
condition and were ready to fulfill any mission 
the Turkish people would give them. 
 
 
Radikal: In order to rescue the historical 
monuments in the Southeast from becoming a target 
in a war on Iraq, the Cultural Ministry will hang 
white and blue posters on them. The posters will 
be visible to pilots.  It is reported that 
objects in regional museums will be transferred 
to Kayseri when the war breaks out.  According to 
Hurriyet, Mardin\'s Provincial Director of 
Culture, Mustafa Kemal, said  warning flags would 
be hoisted at the Mardin museum, the Deyrul 
Zafaran Monastery, the Mardin castle, the Grand 
Mosque, the Kasimiye Medrese, and the Kirklar 
Church, while artefacts in the Mardin museum 
would be moved to Ankara. 
 
 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Sabah: It is required of Turkish 
journalists working in the region to carry a 
yellow press card, and foreign journalists must 
get credentials from the Prime Ministry\'s Press 
and Information General Directorate. In addition 
to the press center at the Dedeman Hotel in 
Diyarbakir, it has been decided that press 
centers should be established in Silopi and Cizre 
as well. The number of the reporters, most of 
whom are foreigners, has reached to 400.  Another 
press center has been established at Iskenderun 
Navy Base Command. 
 
 
Evrensel: The Sirnak Governorate distributed 
handbooks on \"Chemical and Biological War\" sent 
by the Civil Defense Directorate. The pamphlets 
contain information about \"Biological & Chemical 
War and Countermeasures\" and \"First Aid.\" A civil 
defense meeting to which the public will be 
invited will be held at the Municipal Wedding 
Hall. 
 
 
Evrensel: The Americans are parading in 
Diyarbakir\'s streets in foreign plated cars. One 
can see them in all luxurious restaurants, 
hotels, shopping centers, and places of 
entertainment. It is also claimed that they have 
rented luxurious houses in Hamravat and 
Demetevleri complexes. In Birecik, some 
unidentified persons stoned the convoy carrying 
US military equipment while passing the bridge 
over the Euphrates. 
 
 
 
 
Cumhuriyet: CHP\'s Provincial Chairman of Siirt, 
Mervan Dilek, resigned from his position. He had 
been CHP\'s provincial chairman for a decade. 
Mervan Dilek\'s brother- in-law, Dr. Ekrem Bilek, 
was elected to the parliament on CHP\'s ticket on 
November 3, 2002, but was not reelected on March 
9, 2003. 
 
 
Bolge: A group of anti-war lawyers in Adana, 
announcing a press statement in front of the 
Court Hall, said Turkey was literally being 
occupied by US soldiers and insisted on peace. 
 
 
Bolge: The hearing of Adana Mayor, Aytac Durak, 
who was accused of false tax statements, started 
at the Court of First Instance in Adana. During 
the closed hearing, Mayor Durak denied the 
allegations. Mayor Durak said all the real estate 
that belonged to him and his wife had been 
reported correctly. He said he owned a 
construction company with his brother before he 
was elected, and had built houses for more than 
2,000 families. The court decided to wait for

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Hurriyet/Sabah/Milliyet/Radikal/Milli 
Gazete/Turkiye/Tercuman: The PUK Leader Celal 
Talabani, the Leader of Turkoman Front Sanan 
Ahmed Aga, and IKDP Representative Necirvan 
Barzani came to Ankara. The leaders of the Iraqi 
Opposition crossed into Turkey from Habur Border 
Gate yesterday and flew from Diyarbakir to Ankara 
where they were met by their party 
representatives in Turkey. In response to 
reporter\'s questions, Celal Talabani said they 
were going to talk about matters that concern 
their Turkish brothers and American friends. 
Sanan Ahmet Aga also drew attention to the 
importance of the Opposition Group\'s meeting 
tomorrow, saying it would be a turning point for 
the future of the Turkomen, and the policy Turkey 
would follow in northern Iraq. 
 
 
3.  Hurriyet: An anonymous U.S. official told AP 
News Agency that the U.S. has put into effect war 
plans excluding Turkey, and that the primary 
focus of the contacts Zalmay Halilzad has been 
having in Ankara is to persuade Turkey about not 
deploying soldiers in Northern Iraq. The 
anonymous US official claimed Turkey\'s unilateral 
penetration into northern Iraq would cause 
clashes and problems with the coalition forces, 
and expressed his concern that, if Turkey entered 
northern Iraq without the coalition forces, 
clashes might even take place between  Turkish 
and U.S. military units. The same source said the 
USD 15 billion-dollar grant and loan package had 
been withdrawn.  It was not sure if the package 
would be re-discussed, even if the motion passed 
from the National Assembly. 
 
 
4.  Hurriyet/Milli 
Gazete/Evrensel/Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: Freighters 
have discharged Patriot missiles, Stinger missile 
batteries, Hummer jeeps, vehicles including 
military trucks, and military equipment in 211 
containers at the port of Iskenderun since 
February 19. Because Turkey did not grant 
permission for foreign soldiers to be deployed in 
or transit through Turkey, 36 ships carrying the 
United States\' Fourth Infantry Brigade\'s tanks, 
armored vehicles, and ammunitions still wait off 
shore in the Mediterranean. 
 
 
5.  Hurriyet: On the 15th anniversary of Saddam\'s 
use of chemical gas which killed 5 thousand 
people instantly in Halepce town of Northern 
Iraq, demonstrators from Istanbul\'s DEHAP Youth 
Organization, Socialist Democratic Party, The New 
Democrat Youth, No to War in Iraq Committee and 
other non-governmental organizations posted 
banners, and shouted slogans in Turkish and 
Kurdish. When DEHAP demonstrators started 
shouting pro-KADEK and pro-Ocalan slogans, anti- 
riot police arrested 26 persons, including two 
women. In Diyarbakir, Democracy Platform members 
who wanted to make a press announcement in front 
of the Human Rights Monument were not allowed 
into the park by police. As a consequence, the 
police arrested 10 demonstrators for undertaking 
an \"illegal demonstration.\" 
6. Milliyet: Dozens of animals died in Doyuran 
village of Kiziltepe at the Syrian border 20 days 
ago. The villagers are suspicious of the 
Americans who visited their village two weeks 
ago. Doyuran villagers said the chickens died 
first, and then about 50 head of cattle perished 
in the past 10 days. Sheep, calves, and birds in 
the region have also become the victims of 
mysterious death.  The villagers said some 
foreigners visited their village in two black US 
jeeps two weeks ago.  One of the villagers, Ahmet 
Sahin, said he lost all his chickens and about 20 
sheep, and that an equal number of sheep were 
also sick. The village headman, Osman Kilic, said 
his sheep also had died. Kiziltepe sub-governor, 
Tayyar Sasmaz, said there was no epidemic disease 
in the region but would assign officials from 
Provincial Agricultural Directorate and Health 
Committee to investigate the issue. 
 
 
7.  Milliyet: In response to TGS\'s demand to 
initiate State of Extraordinary Rule in six 
provinces should the war start, Interior Minister 
Abdulkadir Aksu said no weakness had been seen in 
their combat with terrorism since OHAL was ended. 
During parliamentary debates about his ministry\'s 
budget, Minister Aksu said the region was 
normalized following the lifting of the OHAL and 
thus gave an indirect answer to TGS\'s desire to 
declare OHAL in Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, 
Siirt, Batman, and Hakkari provinces. 
 
 
8.  Evrensel: Anadolu New Agency reported that 
the Chief Public Prosecutor investigating 
Kahramanmaras DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman Metin 
Gonulsen prepared an indictment accusing him of 
\"threatening the country with civil war\" and 
\"making propaganda for a terror organization.\" 
Based on the prosecutor\'s instructions, Mr. 
Gonulsen was apprehended and ordered held by 
court. After his arrest, anti-terror teams 
obtained a court warrant, and subsequently 
searched DEHAP\'s provincial and district offices. 
 
 
9.  Evrensel: Newroz Organization Committee of 
Mersin applied to the governor\'s office for 
permission to celebrate the \"Newroz\" (new year 
celebrations) in Mersin. Two persons were killed 
during the celebrations last year. Regarding the 
issue, the Provincial Administrator, Ilhan Tas, 
said their application was accepted.  Tas said 
the chances for celebrating the Newroz this year 
were high, and that the committee would request 
an appointment from the governor and the security 
director on March 17.  Adiyaman Democracy 
Platform also applied to the governor\'s office to 
celebrate the Newroz.  Committees have been 
formed for the celebration of Newroz in Hakkari. 
A local singer, Nevzat Alter, is reported to 
participate the March 21 celebrations in Hakkari. 
In Adana, the Labor, Peace and Democracy Block 
applied to the governor\'s office for Newroz 
celebrations. DEHAP Central Committee Members who 
applied to the governor\'s office said they would 
celebrate the Newroz at three separate locations 
and was expecting 150,000 participants at 
celebrations in Adana and 20,000 in Ceyhan.

SUBJECT:  NEWROZ CELEBRATIONS IN SE TURKEY 
 
1.  (SBU)  Newroz (Turkish spelling \"Nevruz\") 
falls on Friday, March 21.  This spring festival 
is the most important holiday for Kurds, and 
since the 1990s has become increasingly linked to 
Kurdish political aspirations.  Our contacts in 
the region predict large public celebrations will 
take place.  While our contacts in both the 
Kurdish community and the GOT emphasize they want 
the celebrations to remain peaceful and lawful, 
the imminence of war in Iraq could spark trouble. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  DEHAP officials in Adana have applied 
to the provincial governor and security director 
for permission to hold Newroz celebrations.  As 
of yesterday, no answer has been received.  DEHAP 
says it is in control of its rank-and-file and 
has warned against responding to \"provocations\". 
They expect a crowd of up to 100,000 people in 
Adana for a celebration to be held at a large 
vacant lot off a main thoroughfare in Adana. 
(Note:  Last year\'s Newroz celebration in Adana 
drew approximately 50,000 people.  End note.) 
The Security Directorate for Adana told us he did 
not anticipate any violence. 
 
 
3. (SBU)  Similarly, DEHAP in Diyarbakir is also 
expecting a response from GOT provincial 
officials to a request to hold Newroz festivities 
there.   Timing is important, because, according 
to the law, such permission has to be obtained 48 
hours in advance.  Last year, Newroz was 
celebrated by more than 300,000 people at a 
fairground some 15-km outside Diyarbakir on the 
way to Elazig.  This year, DEHAP has requested to 
use open land in the Huzurevleri neighborhood of 
Diyarbakir municipality. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)   Newroz could not be coming at a more 
sensitive time, given the imminence of war.  Both 
Kurdish and GOT interlocutors are pledging a non- 
confrontational approach.  That said, the 
potential is there for things to spin out of 
control.  It should be recalled that the Newroz 
holiday - celebrated by Kurds everywhere - is not 
only a spring festival but also part of the 
Kurdish people\'s foundation mythology, 
celebrating a successful rebellion against an 
ancient evil tyrant named Dahhak.

SUBJECT:  POPULATION MOVEMENT IN NORTHERN 
          IRAQ NOT TOWARD TURKEY 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  According to contacts in 
southeastern Turkey, population movements in 
northern Iraq in anticipation of war are not 
toward the Turkish border.  Rather, those on the 
move are generally seeking to leave cities for 
the perceived safety of villages higher up in the 
hills.  The Habur gate is calm for now.  End

quite fluid, we offer the following information 
relayed to us on March 18 by various contacts in 
southeastern Turkey. 
 
 
Hakkari

3.   (SBU)  The mayor of Hakkari and one of our 
Hakkari human-rights contacts both confirm that 
they have received no information about refugees 
heading toward Hakkari province\'s border with 
Iraq.   That border is covered with snow, they 
note. Their contacts in northern Iraq have spoken 
of internal refugee movements within northern 
Iraq only. 
 
 
Sirnak 
:::::::::: 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  The UNHCR Coordinator in Silopi, who 
has been travelling extensively, said he had 
neither seen nor heard of refugee movement toward 
the Turkish border for now.  He believed the 
pattern of internal movement inside northern Iraq 
consists of people leaving cities (notably Mosul 
and Dohuk) for the countryside, particularly the 
mountains.  The migrants\' logic is that cities 
are perceived as more likely to be attacked. 
Sirnak province\'s Habur gate between Turkey and 
Iraq is very calm at the moment, he said, 
something that was confirmed by an oil-trader in 
Silopi who has good contacts in northern Iraq.

village reacted to Americans wanting to rent the 
state hospital. A delegation of eight Americans 
visited the hospital and gathered information 
concerning the capacity of the hospital.  It is 
reported that residents are worried that the 
hospital will no longer be able to serve them in 
case the hospital also serves Americans. 
 
 
4. U.S. ESTABLISHES SECOND BASE IN NUSAYBIN 
 (Milli Gazete/Evrensel/Dunya)  While preparations 
continue in Mardin and Kiziltepe, the U.S. is now 
preparing the Organized Industrial Zone in 
Nusaybin as a second \"base\". It is reported that 
the Zone is expected to be completed by March 23. 
The zone is a very large area, the equivalent of 
roughly six city blocks, and will include a

5.NEVRUZ PREPARATIONS 
 (Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet)  Nevruz preparations 
continue across the country.  The DEHAP 
provincial organization in Urfa held a press 
conference at the Harran Hotel and announced 
celebrations will take place at the local 
fairgrounds.  In Tunceli, EMEP and DEHAP applied 
to the governorate for permission to celebrate 
Nevruz on March 21 at the town center.  Despite 
the call from the Diyarbakir governorate to have 
mutual celebrations, the civilian and official 
activities will be held separately again this 
year.  The Nevruz organization committee\'s 
request to include Kurdish music in the 
celebrations was turned down; consequently DEHAP, 
after getting support from non-governmental 
organizations, decided to have a separate 
celebration in Diyarbakir. 
 
 
6. MARDIN WORRIED AND HELPLESS 
 (Evrensel) Residents in Mardin, which is filled 
with U.S. soldiers, are worried and helpless. 
Due to the closing of the Habur border gate, the 
oil trucks are sitting idle in front of their 
owners\' homes, and ever since the region has 
become the site for locating U.S. bases the 
economy has come to a halt.  Workers have lost 
jobs, and those who are hired by American firms 
to work in construction are working at minimum 
wages. 
 
 
7.  PRESS CENTER IN MARDIN 
 (Turkiye)  In Diyarbakir, a press center has been 
established under the governorate where 
journalists receive accreditation cards and 
bullet proof vests.  The press center is located 
at the first floor of Dedeman hotel. 
8.  AMERICANS ARE WEARING BULLET PROOF VESTS 
(Radikal)  The U.S. has deployed 1000 military 
vehicles in Mardin, which has become the most 
important logistic base for the U.S.  American 
soldiers have began wearing bulletproof vests in 
the past two days, which they continue to wear 
during heavy work.  This is interpreted as a sign 
that the possible war is close.  The number of 
military vehicles that have arrived from 
Iskenderun by railway to the Mardin rope factory 
has increased.

toward the Turkish and Iranian borders. The 
number who have left their houses has reached 
20,000 people. Thousands of people leaving 
Kirkuk, Mosul, Dohuk and its townships moved 
toward locations close to the Turkish border, 
such as Selidiza, Sersing, Batufa, Begopva, and 
Bamerni. While some of the Kurds stay with their 
relatives in those places, the others set up 
tents. In the meantime, Kurdish holders of 
passports with dual citizenship entered Turkey 
from Habur border gate. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: Turkey is considering setting up 
camps in northern Iraq to help thousands of 
refugees in the war. Turkey is not planning to 
seal its borders but will allow \"controlled 
passes\" into Turkey. Iran announced that it would 
not except refugees into the country but would 
help them on the Iraqi side of the border. While 
civilians in Kirkuk try to go to safer 
mountainous Kurdish region in the North, it is

The Federation expects to give services to at 
least one million people a month in those units. 
The Federation has prepared sheltering facilities

administration.  An independent Kurdish will not 
be founded.  The US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, 
warned the Kurds against rioting. Turkey said it 
could unilaterally enter northern Iraq to stop 
refugee flows; the Kurds rejected Turkey\'s 
possible unilateral incursion. Khalilzad 
announced Turkey should act in harmony with the

now it was not available at any of the 50 
pharmacies in town. The citizens complained that 
neither the Provincial Health Directorate nor the

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
Radikal: The US applied to Turkey for permission 
to use Incirlik, Batman, and Malatya air bases 
for striking Iraq as it faced difficulty in 
advancing to Baghdad from the south. The Turkish 
government responded that Incirlik AB could be 
used for transporting wounded soldiers and 
damaged vehicles, but a motion was required for 
using new bases and for purposes other than 
specified above. It is also reported that 
reciprocal suspicion concerning goals in Northern 
Iraq have not been totally eliminated. While 
Turkish diplomatic sources complain about lack of 
knowledge about \"what the US has exactly promised 
to the Kurds\", the US suspects that \"Turkey bears 
undeclared intentions about Northern Iraq.\" 
 
 
Radikal/Sabah/Tercuman: In order not to 
experience the difficulty it has been facing in 
the south in the war on Iraq, the US wants to 
include Turkey in the Military and Humanitarian 
Relief Coordination Center to be established in 
Salahaddin and thus form an air bridge that would 
connect Northern Iraq to the Mediterranean. The 
US reported its expectations from Turkey within 
the framework of this plan to Ankara recently. As 
it was disclosed by the US Commander in 
Selahaddin, Lt. Gen. Henry Osman, establishment 
of a liaison office in Silopi has been requested. 
The US request\'s conformity with the Turkish 
Constitution and laws is being examined, and a 
meeting between the US, Turkey, and Northern 
Iraqi Groups is being considered. The sides are 
in total agreement that Turkey should supply all 
sorts of needs of the refugees who would flow to 
the Turkish border, but the needs of the Northern 
Iraqis who would remain in their houses, 
including food, energy, medicine, infrastructure 
and security should be provided by the US. It is 
believed that the US units hundreds of kilometers 
away from their nearest headquarters in Iraq 
could not fulfill this task without cooperation 
of Turkey. 
 
 
Radikal/Milliyet: Two days after they evacuated 
their base in Nusaybin, the Americans resumed 
construction work at the factories they rented in 
the Organized Industrial Zone on Kiziltepe-Mardin 
highway. The US soldiers surrounded the factories 
with barbed wire, and sand bags. The US also 
rented land behind a yarn factory for 
constructing a helicopter pad, and carried 
logistical material in trucks. Reporters were not 
allowed to the site which had been turned into a 
logistical support center. The soldiers 
positioned on the roofs of the factories remain 
on guard round the clock and control the area 
with binoculars. Tens of armored vehicles, 
antiaircraft batteries, medical equipment, and 
radio equipment are deployed on the base. 
Radikal: In addition to physical measures taken 
in Cukurca of Hakkari and Silopi of Sirnak for 
the likely flow of refugees to the Turkish 
border, the Health Ministry announced it would 
send 30 thousand units of protective shots, and 
dressing kits in addition to the medical supply 
they would dispatch to Van, Hakkari, Sirnak, and 
Mardin provinces. The officials said the refugees 
to be admitted to Turkey would be given 
protective shots, and dressing kits would be kept 
in hospitals. 104 health clerks temporarily 
assigned to the Southeast from Istanbul were 
dispatched to the region by military aircraft. 
 
 
Radikal/Hurriyet/Milliyet: The US and Dutch 
soldiers deployed at Batman AB will be fined on 
grounds of contaminating the environment. It has 
been determined that the soldiers who have been 
staying on the base for 25 days now have been 
dumping their waste into Batman River that flows 
by the base. Batman Directorate of Environment 
has the authority to give a fine ranging from 
approximately $-6,000.- to $-56,000.- per day. 
Hurriyet/Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Dunya/Mil li 
Gazete/Sabah/Bolge/Tercuman: At a press 
conference in Diyarbakir yesterday, the head of 
TGS, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, gave important messages to 
the domestic and international public about how 
the Turkish Armed Forces viewed the Iraq war. 
Gen. Ozkok said only under the following three 
conditions the Turkish army would penetrate into 
Northern Iraq. 
1. There are components of the Turkish Army 
in Northern Iraq. In case of an attack at 
these forces of the Turkish army. 
2. Eruption of a large flow of migration, 
depending on the developments in the war. 
3. Eruption of instability due to clashes 
that might brake out between armed forces 
in the region, or attacks at civilians. 
Gen. Ozkok said if they reached the conclusion 
that the  existent forces could not cope with 
threats and dangers 
that might erupt, a decision for the Turkish 
Armed Forces to send additional forces to Iraq 
could be made, and added they would not enter 
Northern Iraq to fight or occupy if developments 
reached to that point, and had no intention of 
forming permanent buffer zones there. The general 
said suspicious, unjust and sometimes humiliating 
statements by some friends and allies effected 
the Turkish people deeply, and he had difficulty 
in understanding the attitude of the ones talking 
about the oversea threat to themselves not 
finding Turkey\'s claims of the same threat right 
beyond its borders. Gen. Ozkok said they would 
provide support to prevent any instability from 
happening in Northern Iraq, had no secret 
objectives or hostility against anybody, and 
would not enter into hot clashes with anybody 
except in self-defense circumstances. 
 
 
Evrensel: As a result of unknown armed clashes 
between village guards on duty in rural Karamese

drill was required.

Gaziantep decided to stop implementation of a 
decision by Harran University in favor of seven

grounds of filing a petition with the university 
for teaching of Kurdish as an elective class at 
university. The students will be able to attend 
school again. 
 
 
Radikal/Turkiye: The Court of Cassation\'s Chief 
Public Prosecutor, Sabih Kanadoglu, charged DEHAP 
provincial chairmen in Hakkari, Gaziantep, 
Kahramanmaras, and Kars of \"assisting and 
harboring the separatist terrorist organization\" 
and demanded in writing from DEHAP to terminate 7 
of its administrators in a month. In case DEHAP 
does not terminate its provincial representatives 
in provinces mentioned above, Kanadoglu will be 
able to apply to the Constitutional Court to give 
a reprimand to DEHAP, and sue DEHAP. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete: 34 mayors from HADEP, 
closed down by Constitutional Court, joined DEHAP 
and transferred their staff to the same party 
yesterday. Former HADEP mayors and supporters 
will take positions in the administration in 
DEHAP after its national convention in May. In

and-foot disease campaign for the spring of 2003 
still continued in 13 townships of Adana, and 
27,715 of 112,772 cattle were already given 
shots. Mr. Keskin asked the citizens to help 
their teams and reminded them that they would 
suffer a loss of 40-50 percent in meat and other 
dairy products if they failed to have their 
cattle shot. 
On the other hand, Mr. Keskin said as the crops 
in the region grew, yellow-rust disease was seen, 
and that he would notify the villagers when to 
use pesticides.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Sabah: It is estimated that there are 3,000 
PKK/KADEK militants at \"Mahmur Camp\" in northern 
Iraq just south of the 36th parallel. The PKK 
authorities have been sending messages recently 
through Kurdish groups in northern Iraq to the US 
so that the coalition forces would not bomb them. 
The PKK claims the presence of many civilians in 
the camp. It is believed that Celal Talabani and 
Mesut Barzani are conveying the PKK\'s message to 
US forces. The PKK fears meeting the same fate as 
the al-Qaida-affiliated Al-Ansar organization 
that has been bombed by the US in Halabja. 
Sources in Washington have reported that the US 
has just started thinking about what to do about 
the camps like \"Mahmur.\" The \"Kurdish Summit\" in 
Ankara being chaired by President Bush\'s special 
envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, agreed upon ending the 
terrorist activities of all terrorist groups in 
the region. An anonymous US official said 
Washington accepted PKK/KADEK as a terrorist 
organization but so far US military forces have 
only bombed Al-Ansar and Komala camps in Halabja. 
What will happen to the PKK camps is going to 
become a serious examination for Turkey-US 
relations. The US has three options, according to 
reports. 
(1) To bomb the PKK/KADEK camp, given that the 
organization is officially recognized as a 
terrorist organization by Department of State. 
(2) To disarm the militants in the camp and 
surrender them to Turkish authorities who could 
grant them an amnesty. 
(3) To not touch the PKK/KADEK. 
 
 
3.  Milliyet: The US troops deployed at Mardin\'s 
Industrial Zone were put on alert when they 
received a suicide car bomb threat. The soldiers 
have been reinforcing security at the base. The 
soldiers scan the base perimeter with projectors 
and use night-vision binoculars. Soldiers pointed 
their guns at a DHA (Dogan News Agency) reporter 
who wanted to take pictures; the stand-off was 
ended after a US military officer checked the 
journalist ID card. 
 
 
4.  Bolge: KESK (Public Employees Unions 
Confederation) and Adana Chapter Platform members 
held an anti-war protest meeting at Ugur Mumcu 
Square by the Railway Station in Adana.  KESK 
affiliates also marched past the Consulate, 
shouting slogans, e.g. \"Murderer America, Get Out 
of Turkey.\" 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: An anti-war demonstration drew 
participation of 100 people in Adiyaman. The 
participants shouted slogans such as \"Damn US 
Imperialism,\" \"Budget not for war but education,\" 
and \"US the murderer, AKP the collaborator.\" In 
the southeast, smaller but similar demonstrations 
took place in Tunceli, Malatya, Elazig, and 
Mersin, as well.  Milliyet: In addition to two Dutch 
Patriot Missile Batteries at the 2nd Tactical Air 
Base in Diyarbakir, two US Patriot Missile Batteries 
and 200 soldiers arrived yesterday. It is anticipated 
that one of the batteries will be deployed in 
Mardin, where the US has established a logistical 
support center. 
 
 
6.  Cumhuriyet: Because Turkey announced refugee- 
flow would be a reason for a Turkish incursion in 
northern Iraq, Kurdish groups there have decided 
to send refugees to Iran and Syria instead, if 
unable to cope with refugees internally. 
 
 
7.  Radikal: Because it is anticipated that the 
Iraqi government would cut the electricity 
supplied from Baghdad to Zakho, a team of eight 
electricians was dispatched from Batman to 
northern Iraq to assess the situation.  Officials 
announced that they were waiting for instructions 
from the Ministry of Energy for providing 
electricity. 
 
 
8.  Milliyet: It is reported that the 
Coordinating Governor of Diyarbakir, Nusret 
Miroglu, has in hand \"a blank check\" to cope with 
any refugee problems that might erupt.  It is 
reported that some 3,000 refugees would be able 
to go to European countries, via a procedure, 
which Turkey would arrange, by land and air and 
sea, primarily to Belgium, France, Holland, and 
Denmark. 
 
 
9.  Radikal/Hurriyet/Cumhuriyet: The European 
Commission announced it is interested in the 
retrials at the Ankara State Security Court (SSC) 
of (now-defunct) DEP party former Turkish 
parliamentary deputies Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, 
Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak. The Commission\'s 
announcement said the cases would be followed 
very closely and reiterated the importance it 
attaches to \"freedom of expression and 
association\" and its application in practice in 
Turkey. 
 
 
10.  Milliyet:  With regard to the DEP deputies 
trial, it is reported that 17 members of the 
Babat clan, who had previously given testimony 
against the former deputies, had decided not to 
appear in court, despite summons sent by the SSC. 
The witnesses reportedly stated that they could 
make their statements via letters rogatory, but 
the European Human Rights Court had instructed 
the SSC that presence of the witnesses was 
required. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
11.  Milliyet/Turkiye: The Hungarian Ambassador 
to Turkey, Zsolt Szalay, has been visiting the 
Cukurova Region to evaluate its economic 
potential for promoting economic ties. The 
Ambassador visited Adana\'s Chamber of Commerce, 
Chamber of Industry, Commodities Exchange, 
Governorate, and Organized Industrial Zone.  He 
announced that a large Hungarian Trade Delegation 
would hold a meeting in Istanbul on May 15 to 
focus on how to increase trade volume between the 
two countries. 
12.  Turkiye/Milli Gazete: TEK, the Turkish 
Electricity Distribution Company, sued 5 township 
and 8 district municipalities in Malatya province 
for not paying electric bills in the amount of 
USD one million. TEK is demanding confiscation of 
the assets of the municipalities. 
 
 
13.  Bolge: Thanks to efforts by Adana AKP 
Provincial Chairman and eight deputies from the 
region, crop dusters that had been banned from 
flying, due to the war on Iraq, have now been 
granted permission to fly again, for the purpose 
of dusting wheat fields with pesticides.

2. Hurriyet/Tercuman/Radikal/Dunya/Milliyet/ 
Evrensel/Bolge: Trucks carrying US military 
equipment were stoned by a group of people in 
Sanliurfa. The group dispersed after the police 
came to the scene. The windshields of some trucks 
were broken, and the convoy proceeded under 
security escort. One week after evacuation of the 
base in Nusaybin, the US evacuated its logistical 
support center in the Organized Industrial Zone 
in Kiziltepe of Mardin yesterday. Following the 
loading of military equipment and vehicles on 
trucks, the US soldiers left by buses from Mardin 
to Incirlik AB. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: The US wants the coordination 
cell to be established in Silopi to be 
represented at the rank of a colonel. Turkish 
officials are uncomfortable about the status of 
the Kurds to be represented at the CC. Different 
options are still under discussion. The US is 
reluctant to sign any documents about the 
coordination cell, and the Turkish side is still 
not satisfied with verbal declarations by the US 
about protecting Iraq\'s territorial integrity and 
sharing the oil wealth of Iraq among all its 
peoples. In response to the news that Kurds are 
as close as 20 kilometers to Kirkuk, President 
Bush\'s Special Envoy to Iraq, Zalmay Halilzad, 
reminded his Turkish counterparts that \"The Kurds 
will not enter Mosul and Kirkuk. Should such a 
thing happen, they will have spoiled the game. We 
will prevent that even before you do.\" 
 
 
4.  Hurriyet: Armed US troops are taking very 
stringent security measures at the airbase at the 
Gaziantep airport, where 250 US military vehicles 
and tons of equipment are stored. Turkish 
soldiers provide security with armored vehicles 
at the entrance of the airport. 
 
 
5.  Milliyet: The US is continuing to amass 
military equipment and armored vehicles for 
transport by aircraft into northern Iraq. As 
Iraqi forces withdrew from Chamchamal toward 
Kirkuk, a 30-kilometer-area was taken under 
control by the Kurds. The PUK fighters positioned 
around Kirkuk are waiting for US heavy armament 
and armored vehicles to arrive for the offensive, 
and are preparing measures against possible 
looting in the region. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: Some 90 empty trucks that 
belonged to the Turkish Armed Forces arrived in 
Mardin and were subsequently dispatched to a tank 
battalion in Midyat. The trucks are expected to 
carry armored vehicles from Midyat to Silopi. It 
is reported that Turkey will send armored 
personnel carriers to northern Iraq and withdraw 
its tanks and military vehicles from the Iraqi 
border. 
 
 
7.  Turkiye: An alleged Hizbullah member, Huseyin 
Celik, was arrested in Kavak hamlet of Ucyol 
village in Hasankeyf township in Batman. He was 
ordered held by the court. 
 
 
8.  Cumhuriyet: TIHAK, Turkish Human Rights 
Institution, announced that 14,500 torture 
incidents, 261 extra-judicial executions, 518 
killings under detention, and 216 disappearances 
under detention occurred in Turkey between 1990- 
2002. According to TIHAK\'s data, 4,820 cases have 
been opened against Turkey in the European Court 
of Human Rights; Turkey lost 286 and won 12 of 
the cases, 513 were resolved amicably. 107 cases 
were not found acceptable by the court. TIHAK 
President, Nevzat Helvaci, announced during its 
4th Ordinary Convention that the torture issue in 
Turkey had not been resolved yet.  Although the 
case alleging torture of young men from Manisa 
was taken to the highest court in the country, 
because of statue of limitations the perpetrators 
would most likely escape  accountability. 
 
 
9.  Hurriyet/Milliyet/Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet: 
As a result of explosion in a two-story factory 
producing yeast and additives for bakers in 
Adana, eight people died and 13 others were 
wounded. While bomb experts attributed the 
explosion to chemical reactions, the security 
director of Adana said they were taking into 
account claims of a sabotage as well.

1,200 US soldiers are already deployed, intensive

Mosul and Kirkuk, and the Iraqi forces withdrew 
further south. KDP and PUK affiliated peshmergas

between Turks and Kurds. 
 
 
3.  Milliyet/Sabah: Turkey and the US agreed on 
Turkey\'s not penetrating into northern Iraq in 
the absence of solid reasons. The US guaranteed 
that the Kurds in the region under would act

concerns. 
 
 
4.  Bolge/Tercuman: Six young men protesting the 
war on Iraq chained themselves to the US 
Embassy\'s fence in Ankara yesterday morning. The

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Radikal/Milliyet: The U.S.Department of 
State\'s Human Rights Report for 2002 has been 
published. The section covering Turkey emphasized 
that the government, in general, was respectful 
toward human rights and had realized some 
fundamental reforms. However, torture, use of 
excessive force and paucity in accountability for 
crimes committed by security forces still 
remained as serious problems. It is reported that 
State Department\'s annual Human Rights Report 
used to have a serious effect in the world, but 
because the US also has been violating human 
rights in the operations it has undertaken in 
various countries questions have been raised 
about the credibility of the report. The State 
Department draws heavily in its report on 
information gathered in Turkey by the Human 
Rights Foundation, Human Rights Association, and 
Amnesty International.  Newspapers go into 
considerable detail about the kudos and 
criticisms directed at Turkey in the report. 
 
 
3.  Radikal: 48 planes and 1,400 soldiers 
deployed at Incirlik AB for Operation Northern 
Watch are ready to leave the base within the week 
depending on the consequence of developments with 
Colin Powel\'s visit to Turkey. The US had built 
up an immense amount of military equipment prior 
the war at the base, which has not been allowed 
by the Turkish government to be used in air 
strikes against Iraq. 
 
 
4.  Milli Gazete: A US Prowler plane made an 
emergency landing at Incirlik AB last night. 
Tight security measures were taken around the 
runway and, after landing, fire brigades 
surrounded the plane, at the rear of which flames 
could be seen. The plane taxied to the hangar 
half an hour later, and it took off from the base 
around midnight. Two C-130 cargo planes took off 
from the base early morning as well. 
 
 
5.  Milli Gazete: Siirt Governorate has been 
giving classes in 59 subjects at its Public 
Training Center for free. Regarding the issue, 
Siirt Governor Nuri Okutan said the percentage of 
children enrolled in preschool education 
increased, as did the percentage of girls 
enrolled in schools.  In addition, the 
Governorate has tried to reach out to around 
6,000 women and young girls without education by 
involving them in weaving cooperatives and 
multipurpose social centers. 
 
 
6.  Evrensel/Cumhuriyet/Turkiye: Dagyani 
villagers of Sanliurfa who threw stones and eggs 
at US experts coming from Incirlik AB to remove 
fragments of a missile that erroneously fell 
nearby the village were detained by jandarma and 
released by the court after a hearing. Sanliurfa 
human rights activists reacted angrily to the 
interrogations of the villagers and demanded a 
similar response be shown to the US military, 
which is threatening the physical security of the 
people with missiles. 
 
 
7.  Evrensel: Van\'s former administrator of 
HADEP, Bazi Aslan, and a City Councilmember, 
Cihat Kara, were each sentenced to 10 months of

2.  Cumhuriyet/Bolge/Tercuman/Milliyet: It is 
reported that PKK-KADEK has expedited armament of 
its militants in Northern Iraq by reinforcing 
them with rockets and missiles. It is believed 
that the PKK has been seeking chemical weapons, 
too. Some 44 of these PKK militants had 
surrendered to security forces during operations 
in February and March 2003, while 192 had 
deserted from the organization. It is believed 
that the organization has 743 active members 
within Turkey, and 4550 of its armed militants 
are in northern Iraq. It is alleged that the 
organization purchased a 5 kilo chemical 
\"substance\" worth of Euro one million and brought 
it to northern Iraq via Iran, and subsequently 
has been keeping it under tight control. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: In an interview with Washington 
Post, a Kurdish leader, Nursirvan Mustafa, said 
there were 6,000 underground fighters in Kirkuk 
who were ready waiting for a nod from the US to 
start an uprising in the town. Mustafa said he 
did not know the reason why the US did not give 
approval for the uprising.  The Kurdish leader 
said the Kurds wanted to be active participants 
in the war and \"enhance their autonomy\" in the 
post-war restructuring of Iraq. Mustafa said the 
total number of US troops in northern Iraq did 
not exceed 3,000 for the time being, and that the 
northern Front was still a \"ghost front\". 
 
 
4.  Cumhuriyet: Saddam Huseyin warned Celal 
Talabani in northern Iraq that he should not 
support the US in this war. In the message read 
by his Information Minister, Saddam said to 
Talabani: \"I am warning you not to get engaged in 
activities that you would regret. You and your 
forces in alliance with the foreigners should 
avoid warring against the Iraqi people and its 
army.\" 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: In a press release yesterday, a 
DEHAP member, Osman Ozcelik, warned the Turkish 
government not to use Kurds as a pretext for an 
operation in northern Iraq.  He asked the Turkish 
government to give up its paranoia about the 
situation south of the Turkish border.  Ozcelik 
added that \"The existence of an autonomous 
Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, and its 
becoming one of the fundamental components of a 
possible federation to be established, are a 
reality of Iraq and an event that takes place 
beyond our borders.\" Ozcelik said that the 
portrayal of PKK-KADEK militants as an obstacle 
to military operations in Iraq was not convincing 
because those militants were positioned in camps 
at Iraq-Iran border some 300 kilometers away from 
the Turkish border. Ozcelik said necessary legal 
changes should be made to enable PKK militants to 
abandon their weapons and participate in 
democratic life in Turkey, and that there was no 
other way of removing PKK from being a danger. 
 
 
6.  Evrensel: Abdullah Ocalan\'s lawyers went to 
Gemlik Jandarma Station in order to visit their 
client at Imrali Island, but were not allowed to 
go to the island on the grounds of adverse 
weather conditions. The lawyers returned to 
Istanbul and announced that they had formally 
requested the Justice Ministry buy a new boat. 
Meantime, Diyarbakir DEHAP\'s Provincial Womens\' 
Committee Organization members held a press 
announcement in which they protested both against 
the war and against Abdullah Ocalan\'s isolation, 
calling for an end to the war and a general 
amnesty. In Adana and Siirt, DEHAP\'s women 
members protesting the war and Ocalan\'s isolation 
handed out carnations. Of 20 suspects arrested on 
the grounds of holding pro-Ocalan demonstrations 
in Yuksekova, two persons, Nuri Kurt and Serbest 
Abi, were ordered held on charges of assisting 
and harboring PKK-KADEK. 
 
 
7.  Cumhuriyet/Bolge/Tercuman/Evrensel: On one 
hand the US dispatches its military vehicles and 
equipment from the region, but on the other, they 
still keep their vehicles and equipment in the 
three factories they have hired in the Organized 
Industrial Zone nearby Kiziltepe.  In addition, 
the U.S. has been building a helicopter pad at 
the KIDAS yarn factory inside the Organized 
Industrial Zone. The US continues shipping 
vehicles and equipment from the bases in Mardin 
and Tasucu of Mersin to Iskenderun port and 
Incirlik Air Force Base. It is reported that more 
Patriot batteries will be unloaded from a 
freighter that is expected to dock at Tasucu port 
today. 
 
 
8.  Dunya: During his one-day visit to Ankara, 
Secretary of State Colin Powell called on the 
 
SIPDIS 
Turkish President, Prime Minister, Foreign 
Minister, and Chief of TGS. Powell said they 
would be in cooperation with Turkey in rebuilding 
of Iraq, and that Turkey was an important member 
of the coalition forces, and while emphasizing 
Turkey\'s concerns about northern Iraq, the 
Secretary of State remarked that \"There is no 
 
SIPDIS 
need for the Turkish soldiers to cross the 
border.\" Turkey and the US agreed on the 
following points, which will not require 
parliamentary approval: humanitarian convoys will 
go to northern Iraq via Turkey, and Turkey will 
be the intermediary for the humanitarian relief 
directed to Kirkuk; fuel for vehicles of US units 
deployed in northern Iraq will be supplied from 
Turkey, and will be carried in Turkish tankers; 
Turkey will facilitate US search-and-rescue 
operations in northern Iraq, from bases in 
Turkey; Turkey\'s inspection regime along the 
Iraqi border will be lightened, and the channels

          APRIL 04, 2003 
 
 
1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for April 04, 2003.  Please note that Turkish 
press reports often contain errors or 
exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch 
for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Radikal: Turkish and US officials started 
working on activating the issues Turkey and the 
US agreed on during the Secretary of State\'s 
visit to Ankara. Ambassador Pearson discussed 
with his Turkish counterpart, FM Undersecretary 
Ugur Ziyal, about where the Turkish-American-led 
center that will provide military coordination 
with Northern Iraq should be headquartered. 
Turkey, in order to escape debates about the 
\"legal structure of the center,\" asked that the 
unit\'s center be in northern Iraq, while the US 
insisted having it headquartered in Diyarbakir or 
Silopi with a liaison office in Suleymaniye. 
Military and civilian officials will be employed 
at the to-be-formed coordination unit with 
participation from Turkish, US, PUK, IKDP, and 
Turkomen Front officials. The fundamental purpose 
of the coordination unit will be to handle 
refugee and security issues. The center\'s sources 
of information will be the information gathered 
by Turkish and US intelligence. The center will 
gather information about PKK/KADEK and Al Ansar 
activities in the region, assess refugee flows, 
and monitor Kurdish groups vis-Q-vis Mosul and 
Kirkuk. President Bush\'s special envoy, Zalmay 
Khalilzad, is expected to come to Ankara on 
Tuesday to give the final shape to the matter. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: People living in Dohuk and Semele 
towns in Northern Iraq have started moving to the 
mountains and villages close to the Turkish 
border as a precaution against an attack by 
Saddam. The people who had migrated to areas 
close to the Turkish frontier earlier had 
returned their homes, but after artillery fire in 
the vicinity of Selahaddin, Suleymaniye, and 
Erbil, people became anxious again and the ones 
living in Dohuk and Semele migrated to Mt. Beyaz 
and Mt. Zavita regions. It is reported that the 
US and British soldiers, along with Kurdish 
peshmergas, have been put on alert around Dohuk, 
Suleymaniye, Mosul, and Azre, and the US soldiers 
have been primarily positioned at Zavo Mountain 
near Dohuk. Peshmargas and US soldiers have been 
digging positions on the hills at Semele and 
Desta Dubane, and the radar systems set up on Mt. 
Zavo has enabled US soldiers to observe military 
movements in Iraq and Iran. The Gircepel hill 
close to Syria, which was evacuated by Iraqi 
forces, was bombed by US troops. The purpose of 
bombing of the hill has been interpreted as being 
to intimidate Syria. 
 
 
4.  Turkiye: Police in disguise have been taking 
stringent security measures around Tarsus 
American College.  The school, which has produced 
many important statesmen in Turkey, has been 
operational for more than 110 years. The security 
measures will remain until the conclusion of the 
war. 
5.  Evrensel: A group of people who gathered 
yesterday in Ovacik quarter of Seyhan district of 
Adana organized a demonstration on the occasion 
of the foundation of KADEK and Abdullah Ocalan\'s 
birthday. The crowd lit a bonfire and shouted 
slogans. 
 
 
6.  Radikal: The US Embassy put a new \"Visa 
Information Service\" for Turkey into operation 
yesterday. From now on, the applicants will 
acquire visa-related information by calling an 
Istanbul call center number (212-340-4444) 
instead of phoning the Embassy or Consulates. 
Callers will be able to get visa appointments as 
well as information.  For this purpose, they will 
have to pay an equivalent of USD 16 in Turkish 
lira for the phone call.  Until April 9, however, 
the call will be free of charge. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND CULUTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
7.  Cumhuriyet: The war on Iraq and the ongoing 
economic crisis has been having a negative impact 
on Gaziantep\'s economy. While production lines 
have been running at 30 percent capacity, many 
have sent their employees on leave without pay, 
and as a result a 30 percent decrease in 
commodity exchange has been reported. Gaziantep 
is the most important regional town with respect 
to trade with Middle Eastern countries.  A 
substantial portion of food items exported to 
Iraq under the oil-for-food program are supplied 
from Gaziantep. The US attack has caused 
stagnation in the region\'s economy. The President 
of the Executive Committee of Gaziantep\'s 
Organized Industrial Zone, Akif Ekici, said 
Gaziantep had an important place in Turkey\'s 
economy, and was a model town for development in 
Anatolia. Ekici said that there were 485 
operational factories and 120 others under 
construction in the four industrial zones, which 
cover an area of 24 million square meters in 
town. Ekici added that 55 factories suffered 
losses during the 1991 Gulf War, and estimated 
the town\'s financial losses in this war at USD 30 
million.

definite yet where the Patriot missiles will be 
deployed. 
 
 
3.  Tercuman/Cumhuriyet: The US troops deployed 
at two factories in Mardin\'s Organized Industrial 
Zone have now evacuated the factories. The US 
troops left the region in 11 buses and a convoy 
of over 150 trucks yesterday. The military jeeps,

leaving Mardin was heading for Iskenderun port. 
 
 
4.  Sabah/Milli Gazete/Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: 
Incirlik Air Force Base, which had been quiet for 
some time, experienced a very active day 
yesterday. Around 100 trucks carrying military 
equipment and generators, including Hummer jeeps, 
entered the base yesterday evening. Twelve F-16 
fighters  and six F-15 fighters took off from the 
base for an unknown destination early in the 
morning, after which bombers, one passenger 
aircraft, one tanker plane, and one hospital 
plane also took off from the base. 
 
 
5.  Evrensel/Turkiye: As a result of the 
explosion of a land mine the previous night in 
Esenyamac village of Baskale (Van) right on the 
Turkish-Iranian border, two villagers were 
killed. It is reported that the land mine victims 
were engaged in fuel-smuggling. 
 
 
6.  Milliyet: PKK/KADEK, which declared a 
unilateral cease fire  after its leader Abdullah 
Ocalan was arrested in 1999, and had pulled the 
majority of its militants into camps in northern 
Iraq, has been using the war situation for its 
propaganda in a region populated by the 
international press. A Reuters reporter visiting 
a PKK camp yesterday transmitted photographs of 
female militants, and heard PKK demands for 
political and cultural rights. 
 
 
7.  Evrensel: Although the Turkish Supreme Court 
had lifted the ban on naming children in Kurdish, 
the Court of First Instance in Ayvalik 
(Balikesir) did not honor it. A resident in 
Ayvalik, Abdullah Aric, wanted to name his son 
(b. May 10, 2002) as \"Rojhat.\"  The name means 
\"New Day\" in Kurdish.  When he applied on May 13, 
2002 to the Population Registry Office in Ayvalik 
his request was refused. After struggling for 
three months, the father managed to have his son 
registered as \"Rojhat.\" In the meantime, the 
Population Registry Office sued the father on the 
grounds that the name \"Rojhat\" was \"not in 
conformity with Turkish names and traditions.\" 
The suit sought that the baby\'s name should be 
annulled, per article 16/4 of the Population Law, 
which mandates that \"names that hurt public 
opinion and are not in compliance with national 
culture, moral values and regulations cannot be 
given.\" The court decided to erase the name 
\"Rojhat\" from the registry on March 27, 2003. 
8.  Bolge: Around 300 members of Anti-War 
Platform of Adana undertook an anti-war 
demonstration at the entrance of Incirlik town 
where the military airbase is located. The 
demonstrators shouting anti-US and anti-AKP 
slogans set fire to an effigy of President Bush 
and smashed light bulbs that had been dipped in 
blood. Jandarma took stringent security measures 
and restricted the protesters\' activities to a 
nearby vacant lot. The demonstrators carried 
banners with slogans such as \"Close Incirlik 
Airbase,\" \"Murderer USA, Collaborator AKP,\" \"No 
to imperialist occupation,\" \"Don\'t be silent; 
scream and stop the War,\" \"Do not barricade 
people, but rather the USA,\" and \"AKP\'s bulb is 
dipped in blood.\" 
9.  Turkiye: In Hakkari, where there is a 
shortage of doctors, inhabitants are taking their 
patients to other provinces for treatment. 
Hakkari Governor, Erdogan Gurbuz, he could not 
understand why doctors did not come Hakkari to 
work. Governor Gurbuz announced that he and the 
security force members were serving in the region 
happily, that there were no security problems, 
and that he could provide fully equipped lodging 
facilities for 500 doctors. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
10.  Dunya: The President of Chamber of Industry 
of Gaziantep, Nejat Kocer, said investment has 
halted in many regions, but that Gaziantep city 
deserved praise for its creating new job and 
investment opportunities. Kocer added that banks 
had reduced their loan capacities because of the 
economic crisis continuing for two years now, 
causing some Gaziantep companies to resort to 
importing raw material, machinery, and spare 
parts with loans obtained abroad. 
 
 
11.  Evrensel: Van Province\'s Drivers and 
Automobile Owners Association President, Sefik 
Alpaslan, claimed that the Turkish Ministry of 
Industry and Commerce\'s decision to not include 
diesel in the list of items within the framework 
of border trade would cause 120,000 people to 
face starvation. Aplaslan said 2,720 trucks in 
Van would become idle due to the decision by the 
ministry, and estimated that an annual figure of 
USD 4 million was generated from the diesel trade 
between 1987 and 2000.

2.  Milliyet: Osman Ocalan, the brother of PKK 
leader Abullah Ocalan, announced to Reuters that 
the war on Iraq created a new opportunity for the 
PKK, which now seeks to benefit from 
disagreements between Washington and Ankara. 
Osman Ocalan was interviewed by a Reuters\' 
reporter in PKK/KADEK camp at Kandil Mountain in 
northern Iraq.  He claimed the disagreement that 
resulted by Ankara\'s refusal of the motion gave 
them an opportunity to push their issues forward, 
and assessed that it would be possible for the 
PKK to establish ties with the US.  He expressed 
his wish to form an alliance with Washington. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Tercuman/Milli Gazete: It 
is reported that some of the 12 Patriot missiles 
unloaded at Iskenderun port and forwarded on to

Mardin industrial zone, the rented facilities 
will be turned over to the owners again. 
 
 
4.  Sabah: Iskenderun will become the center for 
transportation of food items to be exported to 
Iraq under the oil-for-food program administered 
by the United Nations. An independent company, 
Cotegna, which has been selected by the UN, will 
start working in Iskenderun to coordinate the 
deliveries. Turkish firms interested in exporting 
to Iraq will also apply to the office in 
Iskenderun. It is reported that about 250 trucks 
will carry foodstuffs from Iskenderun to Iraq on 
a daily basis. Because the Habur border gate to 
northern Iraq is sealed, the foodstuffs are being 
kept in warehouses rented in Gaziantep for the 
time being.

food items to civilians in northern Iraq under 
the World Food Program. One thousand tons of

last week. 
 
 
6.  Radikal/Milli gazete: American doctors, who 
evacuated their logistical support center in 
Mardin, made rounds at the State Hospital in 
Mardin. It is claimed that the Americans have 
been doing such a study in order to evaluate the 
possibility of bringing their wounded troops to 
the hospital. The police visiting the hospital 
afterwards determined that the US doctors had not 
obtained permission from the governor\'s office to 
visit the hospital. The police informed local 
officials of the case. 
 
 
7.  Turkiye/Bolge: Based on a tip, the police

underway. 
 
 
11.  Milliyet/Tercuman: The number of families in 
Yenikoy hamlet near Siverek (Sanliurfa), dropped 
from 15 to 3 due to ongoing blood feud that 
stemmed from land dispute between the Gurkan and 
Gurkmen families of the \"Kiran\" tribe five years 
ago. Some 13 people have been killed in the fight 
between the two families who, as a consequence of 
the feud, were unable to cultivate their land or 
send their children to school. While many people 
have evacuated the village, the remaining 
inhabitants, mostly women and children, have

Mesut Barzani has been directing Turkomen 
refugees to Turkey, in an effort to influence 
northern Iraq\'s demographics in favor of the

Northern Iraq, has been keeping the Kurds who 
would like pass into Turkey in northern Iraq by

pretext,\" \"No to war,\" and \"Damn America.\" 
Holding a press conference at the scene, the 
President of the Adana chapter of the union, 
Orhan Yavuz, said that the US was testing out its 
weaponry on the people of Iraq. He urged 
consumers and shopkeepers not to buy US and 
Jewish products, because each penny they 
(Americans and Jews) made from such trade 
returned to them as bullets, tanks, missiles, 
bombs, and chemical weapons. 
 
 
4.  Evrensel: Adana DEHAP will hold its 3rd

and order to the Middle East. 
 
 
5.  Cumhuriyet: The \"Coordination Center\" planned 
to be established between Turkey, the US, and 
northern Iraqi groups has not become operational 
yet. It is reported that the Kurdish groups and 
the Turkomen have each reported to Washington and 
Ankara two names designated for the unit, and 
Turkey has been considering \"a retired soldier\" 
and a diplomat for the slots. Should Washington 
give the nod to formation of the \"Coordination

7.  Milliyet: The port of Mersin is being 
evacuated by the US. A Spanish flag-carrier

turned over to the owners. In Nusaybin, the 
President of Merchants and Craftsmen Association 
said they were trying to complete the 
construction of the Industrial Zone with the 
money they earned from the US for rent; the US 
left the bases in Nusaybin some time ago. In 
Sirnak, 47 reporters from various news agencies - 
- including TRT, Star, IHA, Show-TV, Channel 7, 
Channel D, Yeni Safak, NTV, CHA, STV, and BBC -- 
filed petitions through the Press Center set up 
in Cizre with the Sirnak Governorate and the 
Cizre Sub-Governorate to facilitate working 
conditions in the region. In their petitions, the 
reporters demanded to be allowed to work without 
hindrance along the Sirnak-Hakkari line that 
forms the border with northern Iraq, as well as 
to be allowed to cross into northern Iraq via the 
Habur Border Gate in order to observe the 
humanitarian relief and refugee conditions in 
northern Iraq. Currently Habur Border gate has 
been sealed off and some regions have been 
declared a \"special military zone.\" 
 
 
9.  Cumhuriyet: Because of increased military 
activity in northern Iraq, Turkey has put out the 
alarm for a possible wave of refugees. Following 
the accord made with Secretary of State Powell 
concerning relief assistance to Iraq, some 500 
tons of foodstuffs were brought to Dohuk by 20 
Turkish trucks. The UN also purchased 6,244 tons 
of flour from Turkey. Foodstuffs for 25,000 
people -- along with tents, blankets, and mobile 
kitchens for 50,000 people -- were dispatched to 
Silopi, which has been designated as the 
Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Center in 
Turkey. Foodstuffs that would suffice for 100,000 
people are being kept in Turkish Red 
Crescent(Kizilay) warehouses.  Some 30 Turkish 
deputy governors who have been trained in 
humanitarian relief issues are stationed in 
Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, and Silopi. 
 
 
10.  Turkiye: It was announced by the Diyarbakir

ongoing. 
12.  Evrensel: Distribution of magazines 
published by student organizations at Cukurova 
University (Adana) is being blocked on minor 
pretexts by the university rector, who claims 
that there should be only one publication at the 
university. Magazines freely sold in town are 
prohibited at the university. Two seniors at the

interrogation for publishing the 2nd issue of the 
magazine titled \"Gara.\"

4.  Milliyet/Radikal/Evrensel: A US delegation 
headed by a Capt. Todd Plotner turned over to 
Turkish officials from Ankara the airport at 
Gaziantep.  US troops had been sent there under 
the \"modernization program\" accord. 
 
 
5.  Bolge: The ban on US soldiers at Incirlik AFB 
going off base, which had been in effect since 
March 18, was lifted as of yesterday. The 
soldiers are now permitted to go off the base 
between 09:00-19:00 hours. 
 
 
6.  Milliyet/Tercuman: 14 villagers from 
Sanliurfa\'s Buyuk Murdesi hamlet, where a US 
missile had fallen erroneously, asked for legal 
assistance from the Bar Association.  They are 
being arraigned at a court in Sanliurfa for 
throwing stones and eggs at the US delegation 
that came to the village to recover fragments of 
the errant missile. 
 
 
7.  Evrensel: It is claimed that two villagers, 
Haci Olmez (37) and Mevlut Olmez (30) from the 
village of Andac (Sirnak), who had left their 
village the previous evening to look for their 
lost sheep, were fired upon by soldiers 
affiliated to Andac Jandarma Battalion. It is 
further alleged that Haci Olmez was killed in the 
incident and that his body was taken to the 
Turkish-Iraqi border by soldiers. 
 
 
8.  Evrensel: In response to a lawsuit brought 
against soldiers by villagers who back in October 
2002 had gone hunting near Baldan village of 
Tunceli and were then wounded there by soldiers\' 
gunfire, the Tunceli Governor did not give 
permission to for an investigation to be 
conducted.  He stated that \"the security forces 
had not abused their authority, and therefore no 
crime had been constituted.\" The villagers\' 
attorney said they would appeal the Governor\'s 
decision. 
 
 
9.  Cumhuriyet: The President of the Chamber of 
Doctors of Istanbul, Prof. Dr. Gencay Gursoy, 
announced at a press conference that physicians 
dispatched from Istanbul to Cukurca (Hakkari) by 
Health Ministry due to war on Iraq, were unable 
to reach their destinations.  Roads were still 
closed, and the physicians have been staying at a 
military facility in Van at their own expense. 
The physicians dispatched to Silopi (Sirnak) have 
also been staying at military facilities and the 
hospital they would work in has not been set up 
yet.

1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for April 14, 2003.  Please note that Turkish 
press reports often contain errors or 
exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Evrensel/Bolge: The US and its collaborators 
were condemned at a \"Today Iraq, Tomorrow Turkey\" 
protest meeting in Adana yesterday. Carrying 
banners and shouting slogans, approximately one 
thousand people gathered at  Railway Station 
Square. The head of the organizing committee -- 
an employee of Radio Arkadas, Mehmet Eraslan -- 
called out to everybody to resist against 
oppression. He added that everybody was watching 
the occupation from live TV programs and the 
whole world saw Bush\'s and the US\'s true face. 
Journalists, such as Abdurrahman Dilipak and 
Sanar Yurdatapan, and the President of the 
International Assistance Foundation, Bulent 
Yildirim, also participated. 
 
 
3.  Sabah/Hurriyet: Ankara was comforted as 
diplomatic and military sources in Iraq reported 
that there were no systematic attacks against 
Turkomen in Kirkuk. The reports by Turkish 
liaison officers verified that there had been 
some individual attacks but attributed that to 
the prevailing disorder in the country. The 
Turkish officers talking to locals in Kirkuk and 
Mosul reported that most of the property-deed 
records were intact, as only some had been 
damaged due to looting. The report emphasized 
that the majority of the peshmergas in Kirkuk had 
pulled out but some had stayed in town under the 
US forces\' control to provide security. The PUK 
officials ensured they would withdraw the rest of 
their forces as more US units arrived in the 
town. On the other hand, an armed attack killing 
one child and wounding four adults was launched 
yesterday evening at the Turkomen Front in 
Kirkuk, which blamed PUK peshmergas for it. 
 
 
4.  Sabah/Dunya: While the PUK leader, Celal 
Talabani, warned neighboring countries not to 
intervene in their domestic affairs, the KDP 
leader, Barzani, demanded that Turkey should give 
up claims to ownership of the oil fields. It is 
reported by IRNA (Iranian News Agency) that at a 
Kirkuk meeting the previous day -- attended by 
Kurdish, Arab, Turkomen, and Assyrian 
representatives - Talabani said all these 
communities lived in Kirkuk in a peaceful 
atmosphere. Barzani stated that KDP respected all 
the accords signed with the coalition forces and 
the Iraqi Opposition. 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: The body of Murat Ekinci, 22, who 
was doing his military service in the 8th Commando 
Unit of the 3rd Mountain and Commando Battalion in 
Semdinli (Hakkari) was returned to his family in 
Diyarbakir for burial. A military officer calling 
the Ekinci family on April 10 told them that 
their son was wounded in an accident but he was 
in good health. Nevzat Ekinci who called the 8th 
Commando Unit to find out more about his 
brother\'s condition was told by another officer 
that his brother had passed away because of 
committing suicide, and expressed his 
condolences. The military officials told the 
Ekinci family that the dead body would be flown 
by helicopter to Diyarbakir the same night, and 
there was no need for the family to go all the 
way to Hakkari. The family was told next morning 
that the corpse had been dispatched by land 
transport. Nevzat Ekinci said the request for 
conducting an autopsy on the body was refused by 
military officials, on the grounds that they 
already had run the autopsy and the deceased was 
ready for burial. The family was not allowed to 
see even the face of the dead body. Nevzat Ekinci 
said his family demanded legal assistance from 
HRA\'s Chapter in Diyarbakir for a determination 
whether his brother had committed suicide or been 
murdered. 
 
 
6.  Evrensel: In order to investigate an April 5 
explosion that killed two persons in Esenyamac 
(Baskale, Van Province), a delegation made up of 
lawyers and human rights advocates called on 
Baskale\'s Chief Public Prosecutor and Sub- 
governor yesterday. The delegation will start is 
investigation in the village today. 
 
 
7.  Milliyet/Turkiye: At the Commando Battalion 
in Palu (Elazig), a commando private who went 
insane killed two soldiers and wounded two others 
with whom he had had a quarrel about the duty 
roster. 
 
 
8.  Evrensel: The Adana Cukurova University 
students who boycotted their classes on March 21 
to protest US killing of Iraqi people are being 
interrogated by the university. Some 40 students 
have been interrogated by the university 
administration as of April 4. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
9.  Turkiye: The EU and Turkey\'s Merchants and 
Craftsmen Confederation has started the \"Women 
Entrepreneur Support\" project. It is gathered 
that five centers have been opened nationwide in 
Ankara, Bursa, Corum, Denizli, and Mersin. The 
aim of the project -- initiated with EU one 
million in February 2003 -- is to provide 
training and consultancy to  women and thus 
support women\'s\' entrepreneurship in the 
selected towns.  The project aims to strengthen 
women\'s status in the society and their role in 
developing investment. 
 
 
10.  Turkiye/Bolge: A 90-person Trade Delegation 
that visited Athens and Thessaloniki announced 
that their visit was a success, and it is 
reported that many of them have already made 
business connections. The President of the 
Chamber of Industry of Adana, Umit Ozgumus, 
announced that they achieved their goals with the 
visit to Greece, during which they had the 
opportunity to meet with hundreds of Greek 
companies on a one-to-one basis. Ozgumus said, 
taking the advantage of proximity, they could 
easily increase their annual volume of trade with 
Greece from existing USD 6 million to USD 60 
million in a short period of time.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, SCUL, TU, ADANA 
SUBJECT:  RURAL-TO-URBAN MIGRATION BY KURDS: 
          OBSERVATIONS OF A SOCIOLOGIST 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Mehmet Erbas, a junior 
faculty member at Mersin University, has 
conducted scholarly research about the migration 
of Kurds from the countryside to the cities of 
Turkey.  He believes that \"Kurdish identity\" will 
survive transplantation to the metropolis as long 
as Kurdish migrants see a benefit to it.  The 
Turkish State has no ability to influence this 
process.  End summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  Mehmet Erbas, a young assistant 
professor of sociology at Mersin University\'s 
Science and Literature Faculty, has carved out a 
niche in the study of a very significant 
phenomenon of contemporary Turkey: the massive 
migration by rural Kurds to urban areas.  This 
migration has dramatically changed the 
demographics of cities like Mersin, as well as 
other cities in the southeast, and indeed 
throughout the country.  Istanbul, by some 
reckonings, is now the largest Kurdish city in 
the world. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Erbas is not Kurdish.  He hails from 
Ordu, on the Black Sea.  He does not speak 
Kurdish.  Nevertheless, he has undertaken the 
study of Kurdish migration because he feels it is 
a crucially important topic for understanding 
where Turkey is headed. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  In a wide-ranging April 11 discussion 
in his office at Mersin University, Erbas offered 
some perhaps unconventional thoughts about the 
nature, and consequences, of large-scale rural- 
to-urban migration by southeastern Kurds. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  First, \"it\'s not about language.\" 
According to Erbas, the ability to speak Kurdish 
is not crucial to Kurdish identity in Turkey. 
There are politicized Kurds who do not know the 
language.  He cited the case of the large Kurdish 
diaspora from Turkey that now resides in Western 
Europe.  These Kurds, he said, have made no 
attempt to set up Kurdish language schools for 
their children.  This stands in contrast to 
Turkish emigrants in Western Europe, who have 
done so.  At the same time, he noted, Kurds 
living in Western Europe who came from northern 
Iraq did work to set up Kurdish-language 
education for their children - in effect, 
replicating the Kurdish-language educational 
system they had back in Iraq. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Second, \"it\'s not clear how much of 
the tenacity of the culture is its Kurdishness 
and how much is its ruralness.\"  This observation 
would likely be agreed upon by many residents of 
Turkey\'s cities who have been urbanized longer, 
and who have noted, often with dismay, the 
persistence of rural folkways (in dress, in 
ritual, in family stucture) in the city.  A 
family slaughtering its Kurban Bayram sheep on a 
fifteenth-floor balcony of a high-rise in an 
apartment complex is as likely to be Turkish as 
Kurdish. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  Third, there is class-consciousness 
among Kurds, but it has a twist.  There is a 
large number of well-off, even wealthy, Kurds in 
a city like Mersin.  Those who buy a summer beach 
house do not go out of their way to make sure 
they will have Kurdish neighbors there.  On the 
other hand, if one goes to a typical Newroz 
(Nevruz, the Persian-Kurdish March 21 celebration 
of Spring) celebration in a large Turkish city, 
the crowd is likely to be made up of middle and 
lower-class Kurds.  Wealthy Kurds do not usually 
attend.  Why?  Interestingly, according to Erbas, 
it is not out of snobbery.  Rather, it is out of 
fear that being seen at such events by Turkish 
authorities might open them to accusations of 
being overly \"politicized\" in their Kurdishness. 
(Note:  Some contacts recall for us that in the 
1980s and 1990s there were wealthy and powerful 
Kurds who disappeared mysteriously.  End note.) 
A prosperous and successful Kurd in Turkey still 
might worry about the risks of \"guilt by 
association\" with more radical elements. 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  Fourth, the basic motivation for 
maintaining one\'s Kurdish identity after the move 
from the country to the city is, in Erbas\' view, 
\"to get something from it.\"  The \"something\" he 
has in mind is not an ineffable kind of ethnic 
pride.  Rather, it is something pragmatic in re 
housing and jobs.  Uniquely among citizens of 
Turkey, the Kurds of the southeast over their 
history developed an elaborate system of \"clan\" 
or \"tribe\" (\"asiret\" in Turkish) affiliation. 
This system is part and parcel of the phenomenon 
of the \"aga\" (large feudal landowner) system - 
also peculiar to Kurdish lands in southeast 
Turkey.  The salience of the clan system 
persists.  Polling done among Kurdish youth in 
the southeast, for example, is ambiguous; 
depending on how one looks at it, young people\'s 
belief in the value of the clan system is either 
(predictably) fading or (remarkably) still alive. 
(Note: It was in angry reaction to the 
\"feudalism\" of the clan and \"aga\" system that a 
young Kurd named Abdullah Ocalan first embraced 
revolutionary politics as a Marxist at Ankara 
University in the 1970s.  End note.) 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  As it effects rural-to-urban 
migration, the relevance of enduring clan values 
among southeastern Turkey\'s Kurds is that a 
typical Kurdish rural-to-urban migrant is not, 
and cannot be, \"an individual actor.\"  While a 
random rural Turkish family from, say, Erzurum 
might be drawn to a neighborhood in Istanbul or 
Ankara that offers hometown contacts, there are 
many other neighborhoods to choose from.  The 
tighter bonds of clan connection in the Kurdish 
world dictate differently.  Clan is expected to 
seek out and be helped by clan.  To fly in the 
face of that practice, according to Erbas, means 
that an incoming migrant simply might not be 
cold-shouldered.  Concretely, that might mean not 
being offered informal assistance with job- 
seeking or not being invited to settle in a 
neighborhood, particularly a squatter 
(\"gecekondu\" in Turkish) neighborhood.  Thus, 
maintaining one\'s \"Kurdishness\" is a practical 
necessity for access to housing and employment 
and social acceptance. 
 
 
10.  (SBU) Comment:  As long as new migrants 
remain dependent on personal, family, and clan 
networks to survive, Kurdish ethnic identity is 
likely to survive in contemporary urban Turkey, 
no matter what actions Turkish State authorities 
take.  End comment.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Milli Gazete/Bolge: Incirlik AFB became 
active once more yesterday noon as five C-130s 
took off and another one landed at the base. It 
is reported that the cargo planes carried 
military equipment brought to the AFB from other 
US bases in the southeast and Iskenderun port. 
Bolge reports the \"Maersk Rostock\" freighter 
discharged 10 containers of US humanitarian 
relief to be forwarded to Iraq via southeastern 
Turkey. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: Goc-Der, The Immigrants Social 
Assistance and Cultural Association has launched 
a campaign to end the village guard system, which 
is perceived as the most important impediment for 
return to the villages. Many people moved to 
urban centers because of the terror that started 
in the southeast in 1984. While GOT officials 
have stated that some 375,000 people left from 
some 3,000 southeastern villages and hamlets, 
some NGOs have estimated much higher, citing 
millions of internally displaced people. With the 
support of NGOs and municipalities, Goc-Der is 
going to prepare a \"Migration Map\" of Turkey. The 
project aims primarily to determine: the exact 
number of migrants stemming from the 15-year-long 
clash; how many of them managed to return; what 
are their living conditions; and what is the 
status of uncultivated land.  At Goc-Der\'s 
initiative, petitions with 18,000 signatures 
demanding return to the villages were submitted 
to the Turkish parliament. According to the 
parliament\'s Human Rights Commission report of 
April 2003, a total of 58,513 persons from 10,511 
families have been returned to 456 villages and 
347 hamlets. Clashes between village guards who 
have been settled in the evicted villages and the 
returnees have been reported, and thus Goc-Der 
portrays the village guard system as the main 
obstacle. 
 
 
4.  Turkiye: Acting on a tip, Van Security 
Directorate teams seized over 20 kilos of 
Iranian-origin heroin in the secret compartments 
of a private car. Two persons arrested in 
connection with trafficking of the drugs were 
ordered held by the court. The police searching 
the houses of the suspects and there seized one 
unlicensed pistol and EU 10,600. 
 
 
5.  Turkiye: Jandarma teams, acting with a search 
warrant issued by Adana State Security Court, 
seized 37 illegal publications, books, magazines, 
and documents at Ramazan Elcin\'s house in Gecitli 
district and Mehmet Sefik Arslan\'s house in Misis 
district of Yuregir township. An investigation 
has started, the officials said. 
 
 
6.  Hurriyet: An independent parliamentary deputy 
from Hakkari, Mustafa Zeydan, joined ANAP. With 
his transfer, ANAP will henceforth be represented 
in the Turkish parliament. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
7.  Turkiye: It is reported by the Gaziantep- 
based Southeast Anatolian Exporters Union that 
there has been a more than five percent increase 
in pine nut exports in the first three months of 
the year. The Exporters Union also announced 
similar increases in nuts, red lentils, 
chickpeas, and in wheat flour. More dramatic was 
the decrease in exports of pistachios, sugar, 
electric-electronic items, oil seeds, cement, and 
livestock. 
 
 
8.  Hurriyet: As oil tankers could not come to 
Yumurtalik because of the war in Iraq, the 
Turkish Ministry of Energy asked to halt pumping 
of oil last week because the pipes were already 
full. Between 5 to 5.5 thousand cubic meters of 
oil had been pumped daily from the lines, but no 
oil tankers were able to ship the oil from the 
storage in Yumurtalik to the international 
markets.

SUBJECT:  MERSIN BUSINESS ELITE GLAD FOR REGIME 
          CHANGE IN IRAQ 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Mersin, one of the largest 
ports in the Eastern Mediterranean, suffered 
years of downturn after the first Gulf War. 
Mersin\'s business leaders are optimistic they 
will benefit from new opportunities in the new 
Iraq.  They do worry, however, the U.S. might 
seek to \"punish\" Turkey for insufficient wartime 
support, including perhaps the demise of the QIZ 
idea. End summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  On April 11 we called on leading 
businessmen in Mersin to get their take on the 
new dawn in Iraq.   Mersin (Icel Province) on the 
south central coast is Turkey\'s third largest 
port, after Istanbul and Izmir.  It is also a 
major shipping hub in the Eastern Mediterranean. 
The city - with its estimated population of 
600,000 putting it among Turkey\'s top ten - is 
also home to a reasonably diversified economy. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Mersin was a good example of the 
persisting negative economic impact of the first 
Gulf War on Turkey.  That war and subsequent 
sanctions on Iraq deprived Mersin of a 
significant export market, deprived Mersin port 
and shippers of transport trade revenue, and 
arguably stunted Mersin\'s ambitions to expand its 
tourism industry.  All of that, however, is 
yesterday\'s news, say Mersin\'s hopeful business 
leaders. 
 
 
What It Was Like With Saddam 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: : 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  Mahmut and Huseyin Arslan are brothers 
who run the ARBEL company, a major trader and 
exporter of foodstuffs based in Mersin.  The 
elder brother, Mahmut, is also a major figure in 
both Turkish and international associations of 
food exporters.  The ARBEL company had 
considerable experience supplying Iraq under the 
UN\'s oil-for-food program. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  Mahmut Arslan was in the habit of 
visiting Iraq every couple of months during the 
past six years, i.e. during the era of the UN 
oil-for-food program.  Arbel was a regular 
supplier under the program; it accounted for 
approximately six percent of the firm\'s export 
volume. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  In recalling the oil-for-food program, 
Mahmut Arslan recounted how it was a politicized 
exercise, on various fronts.  For one, he claimed 
that there were Turkish-nationalist 
parliamentarians (MHP party) in Ankara who 
expressed their displeasure that ARBEL was 
getting the business.  (Note:  The Arslans are 
Kurdish.  End note.)  For another, he claimed it 
was clear the Iraqis played favorites with 
suppliers on the basis of nationality.  The 
French and the Russians got the sweet deals. 
Arslan recalled going to Moscow to clinch part of 
an oil-for-food contract and meeting there with a 
Russian businesswoman whose firm was in on the 
deal; the woman, looking at samples of the ARBEL 
merchandise that were to be shipped via her 
company, could not correctly identify the samples 
for what they were: chickpeas and lentils. 
Finally, he told yet another story about how the 
Iraqis themselves tried to freeze ARBEL out at 
one point in the six-year program -- accusing 
ARBEL of dealing with Israel.  It took a while to 
demonstrate to the Iraqi authorities that the 
ARBEL shipments in question had actually gone via 
Israel to UNRWA - the Palestinian refugee camps 
run by the UN - at which point ARBEL got back 
into the game. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  Now that a new day has dawned in Iraq, 
the Arslan brothers are optimistic their company 
and others like it in Mersin and in Turkey stand 
to benefit.  They say Turkish businessmen 
traditionally have been well received in Iraq. 
In fact, Mahmut Arslan went out of his way to 
compliment Trade Minister Tuzmen for his flesh- 
pressing skills with the old regime Baghdad; 
Turkish firms benefited from his efforts.  With 
the sanctions gone, Turkish firms are poised to 
do even better.  Furthermore, and most 
importantly, the Arslans believe Turkey will 
indeed be very competitive in the Iraqi market in 
certain sectors.  They specifically mentioned 
foodstuffs and construction.  As for petroleum 
and related services, the brothers smiled and 
commented that it would seem that other countries 
have something of a leg up. 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  Turning from the specifics of their 
own export and trading business to the more 
general question of how Mersin might benefit from 
the opening up of Iraq, the Arslan brothers were 
quick to point out that Mersin\'s port is a 
natural gateway for exporters to Iraq.  The port 
of Mersin is modern and large and is already used 
by shippers as a major hub in the Eastern 
Mediterranean.  The Turkish  port to Mersin\'s 
east  - Iskenderun - does not have the facilities 
for container-cargo that Mersin does.  Iskenderun 
is also quite a bit smaller than Mersin as a 
port.  That said, Iskenderun\'s port does have a 
deep draught, which makes it more suitable for 
bulk cargo vessels.  Therefore, Iskenderun, too, 
could do well from a ramped-up flow of goods into 
Iraq for the simple reason that the entire 
indigenous port capacity of Iraq (i.e. Umm Qasr) 
is too small to handle it alone.  There should be 
plenty for everybody, in other words.  The 
Arslans recalled that it was the Jordanians who 
had benefited when Mersin and other Turkish 
entrepots lost the Iraq trade after the first 
Gulf War.  Now, they say, it is time for Turkey 
to get some of that back.  And when it does, 
Mersin - like port cities everywhere - will 
inevitably see the positive economic ripple 
effects from the increased activity of ships and 
cranes and trucks. 
 
 
The Chamber of Commerce & Industry: \"What\'s with 
the QIZ?\" 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  In our meeting with representatives 
from the Mersin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
we were probed about the status of Mersin\'s 
application to be a QIZ.  Their question had a 
follow-up: given the \"rough patch\" that Turkey 
and the U.S. went through because of Iraq, was 
the whole QIZ concept now dead? 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  This anxiety on the part of the 
Chamber members was a sub-set of a more general 
uneasiness that the US perhaps was going to seek 
\"retribution\" against Turkey for failing to 
support the war in Iraq.  A couple of 
participants in the meeting told us stories about 
how they had done deals in anticipation of  the 
U.S. troop presence in Turkey, only to have the 
contracts cancelled when the troops never came. 
For this they fundamentally blame the Turkish 
parliament, but they know that at the micro-level 
some Turkish  businessmen took a hit. 
 
 
11.  (SBU)  The Chamber members described Mersin 
as having a reasonably balanced distribution of 
economic activity across shipping/transport, 
manufacturing, agriculture, and services.  There 
is also an NGO - largely funded by the Chamber - 
which is working specifically on economic 
development.  This NGO admits, though, it is 
still at the beginning in the laborious process 
of getting relevant actors (business, government, 
labor, universities) to understand and buy into 
the concept.  They have high hopes, but realistic 
expectations. 
 
 
12.  (SBU)  On the down side, the Mersin Chamber 
members immediately acknowledged as their biggest 
problem the very same thing we heard from every 
other single interlocutor we spoke to in Mersin: 
the flood of poor and uneducated rural folk into 
the city.  The strain is evident everywhere: in 
the labor market, in the educational system, in 
the criminal justice system.  We were told, for 
example, that Mersin used to have a per capita 
income that was three times the Turkish national 
figure.  Now, apparently, Mersin\'s figure has 
fallen to match the national one. 
 
 
The View from the Top 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
 
 
13.  (SBU)  Mersin has gone from a population of 
30-40,000 to roughly 600,00 in a matter of a few 
decades.   It is estimated that more than half of 
the current population consists of new arrivals 
from southeastern Turkey, i.e. Kurds.  This 
massive migration has not only challenged the 
economic infrastructure of the city, but also the 
Mersin elite\'s image of its city.  Mersin was an 
unimportant town in Ottoman times, until - oddly 
enough - the American Civil War.  It was at that 
time that the Confederate States turned to the 
Ottoman Sultan for cotton, in the wake of Great 
Britain\'s boycott.  The Ottomans brought to 
Mersin some Francophone cotton traders from Egypt 
and the Levant to establish the business. 
Therefore, starting in the middle of the 19th 
century, Mersin grew up with a somewhat more 
cosmopolitan feel than many other Anatolian 
cities.  In fact, it is still a point of pride 
among some in Mersin that the city has the only 
Ottoman-era cemetery in Turkey in which Muslims 
and Christians and Jews were buried together, 
rather than in separate sections.  This kind of 
quaintness or quirkiness is now basically being 
buried under the weight of migration from the 
southeast, it appears. 
 
 
14.  (SBU)  This civic history was transmitted to 
us by Cihat Lokmanoglu and Atahan Cukurova, 
president and general secretary respectively of 
the Mersin Maritime Chamber of Commerce.  These 
two men - born in Mersin, graduates of Tarsus 
American College, and then U.S. universities - 
represent the pro-American social and business 
elite of Mersin.  Like the Arslan brothers and 
like the Mersin Chamber of Commerce & Industry, 
they also are optimistic that both their own 
businesses and the fortunes of Mersin in general 
are due for an upturn in the wake of Saddam\'s 
overthrow. 
 
 
15.  (SBU)  The only cloud they see on the 
horizon is, again, the possibility that the US 
might devalue its partnership with Turkey, either 
out of spite for Turkey\'s failure to support the 
war or out of Turkey\'s diminished strategic value 
in the region.  What they find particularly 
galling is the possibility that a possible 
\"tipping\" factor for US-Turkish relations might 
be northern Iraq.  Having fought and won its own 
war against the PKK - costing 30,000 lives over 
15 years --  and having done so with the tacit 
blessing of the US, it would be bitterly ironic 
if the US and Turkey were to have a major falling 
out over Kurds in another country.  Both 
Lokmanoglu and Cukurova lamented the failure of 
the March 1 vote in the Turkish parliament, 
attributing it to the \"parochialism\" of neophyte 
AK Party politicians. 
 
 
16.  (SBU)   Given their long experience in 
maritime trade, Lokmanoglu and Cukurova can look 
back on not only the bad years of the economic 
embargo against Saddam\'s Iraq but also headier 
days from Saddam\'s \"first\" war.  Looking at each 
other and laughing, the two men swapped tales 
from era of the Iran-Iraq war, during which time 
Mersin did a nifty business in cargo bound for 
both sides.  Indeed, they said, during that 
conflict there even were ships that came to 
Mersin laden 50-50: half for the Iraqis, half for 
the Iranians.  \"Do you remember,\" one of them 
said, \"the time that there was that mix-up, and a 
load of Iranian military uniforms got sent to 
Iraq and the Iraqi uniforms went to Iran?\" 
 
 
17.  (SBU)  Comment:  In Mersin, as in other 
parts of Turkey, we are now seeing optimism about 
the economic consequences to flow from the change 
of regime in Iraq, albeit tinged with some 
concerns specific to the US-Turkey partnership, 
including the status of the QIZ legislative 
proposal.  End comment.

2.  Tercuman/Turkiye/Evrensel/Cumhuriyet: The 
Turkish General Staff announced that some of the 
1,166 US soldiers deployed in Turkey under ONW 
and \"Site Preparation\" left for Germany on 10 
aircraft yesterday, and that the rest would 
leave Turkey today. Reverse shipment of the 
military equipment, vehicles, and materiel 
brought to Turkey under the \"Site Preparation\" 
project will take place from Iskenderun port 
between April 15-23. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: Following the fall of Kirkuk to 
peshmergas affiliated to PUK, Celal Talabani 
held a meeting with representatives of various 
groups and told the \"Kurdistani News\" paper that 
the PUK was taking into account Turkey\'s 
concerns.  He added that the people of Iraq will 
determine the future of and the type of 
administration in Iraq. We are not going to 
allow our neighbors\' intervention.\"  He said 
that he would not agree to Syria\'s saying \"Mosul 
is an Arab town,\" Turkey\'s saying \"Kirkuk is a 
Turkomen town,\" nor Iran\'s saying \"Karbala and 
Najaf are Iranian towns.\"   In this light, he 
warned that if Turkey opened up the issue of 
Kirkuk, then Kurds would bring up the issue of 
Diyarbakir and other towns. 
 
 
4. Evrensel: In Adana, police raiding some 
houses in various sections of the city detained 
two Cukurova University students, Yalcin Aslan 
and Ozer Erener, and two other individuals, 
Emine Cig and Remzi Aslan. The detainees are 
being interrogated at the Security Directorate 
of Adana.  The charges are not mentioned. 
 
 
5. Evrensel: Attorney Muharrem Sahin, a member 
of Diyarbakir Bar Association\'s Prisons 
Inspection Committee, filed charges against the 
prison administration of Bitlis for putting 
pressure on his clients who are inmates, as well 
as other inmates.  He cited a lack of a 
designated room for lawyers to meet with their 
clients as an example of inmates being denied 
fundamental rights. Attorney Sahin\'s filed 
complaint also stated that searches in female 
cells were done by male wardens, and that they, 
too, listened in on the conversations between 
the lawyers and their inmate clients. Sahin said 
he would apply to both the Justice Ministry and 
international organizations in order to end such 
practices. 
 
 
6. Bolge/Milliyet/Hurriyet: The Turkish 
President, Prime Minister, former President 
Demirel, and political party leaders are 
expected to attend May 4 opening ceremonies for 
the completion of one of Turkey\'s largest 
potable water projects, which will bring water 
from Catalan Dam to Adana. Mayor Aytac Durak of 
Adana will host the event. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
7.  Dunya: In response to newspaper allegations 
about a \"fictitious export\" business, Gaziantep- 
based SANKO Holding\'s President, Abdulkadir 
Konukoglu, denied the allegations and added that 
his company paid between around USD 4,250,000 of 
VAT to the state annually, and would never 
consider cheating the state of a mere USD 
122,000 with that type of scheme. Konukoglu 
said, it was later determined that the subject 
company had a tax penalty but that it 
legitimately benefited from the AKP-sponsored 
Tax Reconciliation Law just like everybody else. 
Konukoglu remarked that it was unfair to blacken 
a company just because it has reached a certain 
level of visibility. 
8.  Evrensel: Because no oil prospecting and 
drilling is being done, oil production by the 
Turkish Oil Company (TPAO) has dropped by 50 
percent since 1980. While officials have stated 
simply that there was \"no oil\", Halliburton 
Company today is producing 5,500 barrels a day 
from a recently drilled well in Batman. 
Currently, TPAO is producing only 35,000 barrels 
a day. Its production in 1980 was 70,000 barrels 
a day. Oil Workers Union President for the 
Batman Chapter, Nimetullah Sozen, said the 
reason why TPAO did not invest was a \"political 
question,\" and TPAO made a profit of over USD 
600 million. Sozen also claimed that Turkish 
workers at foreign oil prospecting companies 
worked under poor conditions and made only about 
USD 200 a month because they had been forced to 
resign from the union.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
Radikal: In response to what the fate of the US 
military presence in Saudi Arabia and Turkey 
would be as there was no more need for no flight 
zones in southern and northern Iraq, US Defense 
Secretary Rumsfeld, declared that together with 
 
SIPDIS 
Ankara, the mission of ONW, and the military 
presence previously in Turkey for that objective 
had been deployed elsewhere. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete: The US is continuing to 
remove military vehicles and equipment deployed 
at Iskenderun port. It is reported that the 
movement of the soldiers and equipment from 
Turkey would be completed by April 23. After 
departure of freighter \"Cape Taylor\" the previous 
day, a big quantity of military equipment, 
including six UH-60A type ambulance helicopters, 
were loaded on freighter \"Cape Vincent\" which 
will also carry the Patriot missile systems at 
Incirlik AFB. The lease term at Iskenderun port, 
where the US had been amassing military equipment 
since February 18, will expire tomorrow. But it 
is speculated that the US has extended the lease 
contract until April 23, and it is expected that 
the shipment of troops and military equipment 
would be completed by then. In the meantime, 40 
more US soldiers left Batman base. 
 
 
Sabah: The indictment wherein villagers threw 
stones and eggs at the US soldiers who went to a 
village near Sanliurfa where a US missile had 
erroneously fallen some time ago is kept 
confidential. It is reported that the Chief 
 
SIPDIS 
Public Prosecutor of Sanliurfa proposed to the 
Court of First Instance to keep the file 
confidential after the news about the case 
 
SIPDIS 
appeared in Sabah paper. Thus the villagers and 
their lawyers have been denied access to the 
files. In response to lawyers\' demand for lifting 
the decision, the court said confidentiality of 
the file was essential for the successful result 
of the case. 
 
 
Turkiye/Bolge: As a result of operations launched 
by Adana police, 6 alleged PKK militants were 
captured. The PKK suspects whose names have not 
been disclosed by the security officials are 
still under interrogation. 
 
 
Evrensel: A hearing continued about Hasim 
Beyazgul, a deaf and mute shepherd, was killed on 
September 19, 2001 by soldiers affiliated with a 
Jandarma Unit while grazing his sheep. The father 
of the victim sued the soldiers at a court in Van 
on charges of \"deliberate killing and 
unauthorized burying.\" Only the victim\'s father 
and his attorney, Murat Timur, attended the 
hearing yesterday which involved seven soldiers 
being tried in absentia. The hearing was 
adjourned to June 6, 2003 on the grounds that the 
documents had not been completed yet. 
 
 
Sabah: Because of the amendments made in the 
Retirement Law, which now mandates retirement for 
public employees aged 61, 11 governors recently 
appointed by the AKP face compulsory retirement 
if the cabinet does not prolong their tenure with 
a special decree. The TNP General Director and 
Former Regional Governor, Gokhan Aydiner and 
governors of Hakkari and Van in the Adana 
Consular district will also be retired per the 
law. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet: Turkey has been considering opening a 
2nd Border Gate with Iraq and rescheduling Turkish 
Airlines, THY, flights to Baghdad. The Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs\' Coordination Meeting attended 
by public and private sector representatives 
decided the following issues: 
THY would start working on direct flights to 
Baghdad; work on opening the second border gate 
would be expedited, in addition to Habur gate; 
efforts would be made to ensure that foodstuffs 
and humanitarian relief items would be purchased 
and transported from Turkey; efforts would be 
made to build a direct railway to Iraq; the 
contracting sector would be enlivened; special 
projects credits would be given by Turkish 
Eximbank to promote exports and contracting 
services in Iraq; attempts would be made for 
Turkish companies to do oil prospecting in Iraq; 
and a competent representative would be sent to 
the office set up by the US for rebuilding of 
Iraq. 
 
 
Bolge: The Turkish Air Lines\' scheduled flights 
to Gaziantep, which were cancelled due to 
deployment of US troops at the airport for the 
war on Iraq, will restart on April 18.

2.  Bolge: A visible decrease is seen in the 
number of US military vehicles and equipment 
deployed at Iskenderun port as more of them are 
being sent back to other destinations.  A 
freighter named \"Cape Ducato\" docked at the port 
yesterday for onward shipment of US military 
vehicles and equipment.  The part of the port 
known as the \"chrome area\" has been totally 
cleared of military equipment.  A group of US 
military officials and Turkish port authorities 
are working on an inventory to assess the 
maintenance, repair, and renovation works made at 
the port. 
 
 
3.  Bolge: Following the ending of Operation 
Northern Watch (ONW), some of the US troops 
deployed at Incirlik AFB have already left the 
country, and the ones who have remained are 
conducting war-games exercises for security 
purposes.  The ONW mission deployed at Incirlik 
AFB was jointly fulfilled by US and British 
troops with a December 25, 1996 decision by the 
Turkish National Assembly, and ended on March 19, 
2003.  During the scheduled exercises, gas-masked 
and armed US soldiers defended hangers 
successfully against possible attacks.  Turkiye 
reported that Washington was going to minimize 
its military presence in Turkey and Jordan, and 
planned to establish four permanent military 
bases in Iraq while evacuating Incirlik AFB. 
Thus, the US aimed to control the Middle East, 
Southeastern Asia, and the Indian Ocean from the

4.  Evrensel: Zehra Barin, a women with three 
children who was seriously wounded as a result of 
an explosion of a land mine while picking wild 
cardoons (an edible root plant) in a village of 
Sirnak, died at the university hospital in 
Diyarbakir.  Mrs. Barin said she was picking 
cardoons during the early morning in a fenced 
area where some villagers were grazing their 
cows.  She said her three-year-old nephew 
accompanied her and she thought soldiers would 
warn them if that area had been a military zone. 
Her husband, Nurettin Barin, said that although 
they were made to wait at two jandarma stations, 
one in the village and another one at Kasrik 
Pass, for a total of about two hours, her health 
worsened after she was given anesthesia at the 
hospital.  The President of HRA\'s Diyarbakir 
Chapter, Selahattin Demirtas, held the military 
responsible for the land mines, and said they 
would conduct the necessary investigations and 
would apply to the European Human Rights Court 
after all the domestic legal avenues had been 
exhausted.  He added that the problem of land 
mines would not diminish unless the Kurdish issue 
was resolved. 
 
 
5.  Milliyet/Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet/Sabah/Hur 
riyet: The Governor of Hatay, Ismet Gurbuz 
Civelek, passed away due to a heart attack he had 
in Izmir yesterday. His body was sent to Ankara 
for burial. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: A mysterious e-mail 
dated March 11, 2003 from Germany, which read 
\"Only 70 days are left for the happening of the 
most important event in 2003,\" put the Turkish 
National Police (TNP) and other intelligence 
units on alert.  The security officials believe 
that the message hinted a likely terrorist 
attack. Taking the e-mail message into account, 
an Anti-Terror Directorate circular ordered the 
related security agencies to revise their 
protections for primarily the airports and other 
sensitive buildings and facilities, and be 
extremely vigilant during and after May 19, the 
National Sports and Youth Day. It is speculated 
that the Islamist radical group in Germany known 
as \"Kaplancilar\" may have sent the message. 
 
 
7.  Evrensel:  According to the studies made by 
Woman\'s Status and Problems (WSP), and Woman\'s 
Social Status Research and Examination 
Association, the difficulty of being a women in 
Turkey varied from region to region. The result 
of research conducted in 19 provinces revealed 
that 45.8 percent of women have not enjoyed any 
education at all, 4.3 percent have left school 
without completing their elementary school 
education, while only 33.5 percent had completed 
the five-year compulsory elementary schooling. 
Of the educated women in Turkey, 81 percent are 
graduates of junior high schools, 5.8 percent of 
senior high schools and only 2.6 percent are of 
universities.  Thirty-nine point six (39.6) 
percent of educated women between the ages of 15 
and 24 are unemployed nationwide.  The ratio of 
unemployed women in urban centers is reported to 
be around 37.4 percent while it is 45.3 percent 
in rural areas. The Secretary for Teachers Union 
Women\'s Organization, Senay Ozmen, said the main 
problem the women faced in the region was that 
the girls were not sent to schools for education, 
and remarked that the economic and social 
dimensions of the issue were parallel.  Because 
the girls were married at a very young age, they 
were deprived of their rights, and the girls 
constituted 2/3rds of the uneducated children in 
Turkey.  Ms. Ozmen said the girls were used in 
the fields and gardens in the rural areas, and 
because of that they were unable to express 
themselves in any subject and unable even to help 
their children when they got married. As a 
sample, she said, 51 percent of Diyarbakir\'s 
population was made up of males, and the 
education ratio among them was 30 percent while 
this ratio was 19 percent among the female 
inhabitants.  Finally, she said that development 
could not take place unless regional differences 
were eradicated.

Radikal: It is reported that the person code 
named \"Mahmut\" who committed suicide during the 
security forces\' PKK/KADEK operation in Silopi, 
was the PKK\'s person in charge for Cudi Mountain. 
It is claimed that \"Mahmut\" whose ID has not been 
disclosed yet, was a Syrian national. The police 
in Silopi started surveillance last Friday of a 
PKK/KADEK suspect, Abdullah Kayhan, who met with 
two persons known as \"Mahmut\" and \"Harun.\"  When 
the security forces arrested Harun, Mahmut, 
recognizing that he also would be arrested, 
committed suicide. 
 
 
Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Sabah/Radikal/Hurriyet:  In 
its most recent issue, Time Magazine selected the 
chairwoman of Diyarbakir-based Ka-Mer (Women\'s 
Center), Nebahat Akkoc, as one of the 38 persons 
identified as \"the heroes of the modern age.\" 
The contestants were selected from people living 
in Europe and the Middle East.  The magazine 
emphasized that Akkoc struggled for defending the 
rights of Anatolian women exposed to domestic 
violence, and added that according to the UN 
figures, 58 percent of women in Anatolia were 
exposed to violent acts by their spouses.  The 
mother of two children, Mrs. Akkoc, who lost her 
husband to a mysterious killing in 1993, founded 
Ka-Mer in Diyarbakir in 1997, and has been 
providing legal and psychological support at its 
seven branches in the southeast to women 
subjected to violence.  Currently, Mrs. Akkoc is 
focused on fighting against honor killings in the 
rural regions, a common practice, and has managed 
to rescue a young girl for whom a death decision 
was made. 
 
 
Turkiye/Bolge/Milli Gazete: The new courthouse of 
Adana, the construction of which started five 
years ago and cost approximately USD 9.375 
million, was opened for service. Regarding the 
new courthouse, the Chief Public Prosecutor, 
Cemal Sahir Gurcay, said he attached great 
importance to security, and had assigned 58 
policemen in addition to the jandarma for that 
purpose.  Gurcay added that he was particularly 
interested in the internal security of the 
building in order to eradicate the negative 
reputation of the former courthouse famed for 
fights among the families attending the hearings. 
 
 
Turkiye/Bolge:  In Adana, the police arrested 10 
persons, including three women, for being members 
of \"Cakarlar,\" a gang which extorted money from 
citizens in various quarters of the town by 
threat or blackmail. The suspects were arrested 
when the police launched an operation to arrest 
the perpetrators of armed assaults at two tea- 
shops and a house in Seyhan district.  While 
searching the suspects\' homes, the police seized 
one automatic Kalashnikov, one hunting gun, and 
ammunition for those weapons.  The suspects were 
taken to the State Security Court following the 
completion of their interrogation at the Security 
Directorate.  The suspects threatened a 
journalist with death as they left for court. The 
police are still looking for the alleged leader 
of the gang, Tarik Cakar. 
 
 
Turkiye:  Based on a tip, the police in Adiyaman 
arrested Dogan Tanriverdi red-handed while he was 
trying to sell 4 kilos of heroin in town.  An 
investigation is underway, the officials said.

2.  Radikal/Tercuman/Dunya: The Undersecretary 
for Customs Ministry, Nevzat Saygilioglu, 
announced that the border trade that would be 
realized through Border Trade Centers would 
initially be opened at the gates with Syria. 
Saygilioglu said border trade centers would be 
founded in the customs zones on an area of 2000 
square meters and would mainly target trade with 
local businessmen and passengers. Goods belonging 
to both countries would be marketed at the 
shopping centers expected to become operational 
in June. The model shopping centers along the 
Syrian border will be opened at the gates in 
Cilvegozu and Yayladag (Hatay), Karkamis 
(Gaziantep), Oncupinar (Sanliurfa, and Nusaybin 
(Mardin). Such trade centers will in turn be 
opened at the border gates with Iran, Georgia, 
and Nakhichevan. Saygilioglu said Turkey expected 
a volume of USD 150-200 million turnover in trade 
at the five trade centers to be opened along the 
Syrian border, and added that type of trade would 
revive the economy and create employment 
opportunities in the region. 
 
 
3.  Evrensel: Abdullah Ocalan\'s sister and 
lawyers who went to Gemlik in order to visit 
Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali prison were not taken 
to the island by the officials on the grounds of

Ocalan\'s sister and attorneys were denied a visit 
to Ocalan last week. One of Ocalan\'s lawyers, 
Aysel Tugluk, announced they had been denied the 
meeting with their client on the pretext of 
\"diverse weather conditions\" despite the fact the 
weather was clear and sunny. She added  they had 
been prevented from seeing Ocalan for 14 weeks 
because of officials\' decision some time ago. 
Urging sensitivity to the issue, attorney Tugluk

2.  Milliyet:  Ankara is undertaking a major 
legal arrangement to bring PKK militants down 
from the mountains because it is not being 
satisfied with the results of the \"repent law\" 
for dissolving the PKK.  The expanded legal 
arrangements, which aim to contribute to social 
reconciliation, have been made in light of the 
evaluations at the summit of the state to 
eradicate the terrorist components and their 
arms. The projects has also been evaluated at the 
National Security Council, and it is assessed 
that such an arrangement will become more 
effective to enhance the national security 
because of the likely political atmosphere and 
structure taking place in postwar Iraq.  Ending 
the chaotic situation and filling the vacuum of 
authority in the region will also encourage the 
PKK/KADEK militants to benefit from the new 
repent law. Officials said that previous repent 
laws were unfruitful, and the desired results 
were not attained from them despite distribution 
of thousands of handouts by helicopters to the 
militants in the mountains.  The current repent 
law would give short-term light sentences 
followed by pardoning the militants.

2.  Cumhuriyet: The dead body of Siddik Kaya, the 
victim of a mysterious killing in Varto, was 
found on the bank of the Murat River. The 
Istanbul Forensic Medicine Department determined 
firearms had killed Kaya before he was thrown 
into the river. The HRA announced that more 
disappearance cases were being reported to their 
chapters after Kaya\'s body was found. The family 
of Riza Koc also applied to Mus\' HRA Chapter to 
help them determine the whereabouts of their son. 
Riza Koc closed his grocery store in Mus the 
night of September 13, 2002, and left with a 
friend.  He was never seen or heard from again 
after he separated from his friend. According to 
reports, Koc told his wife one-day before his 
disappearance that two pedestrians followed him. 
The inhabitants of the quarter where Koc lived 
reported a suspicious vehicle was constantly 
moving in their neighborhood and they reported 
its license plates. After some research, it was 
discovered the Security Directorate of Mus owned 
the suspicious vehicle. After receiving no 
affirmative responses from the Mus\' Security 
Directorate about Riza Koc\'s whereabouts, Koc\'s 
relatives sought assistance from the HRA Chapter 
in Mus. The HRA President in Mus, Sevim Yetkiner, 
said \"Koc\'s family did not apply to us for 
reasons such as lack of education and fear, but 
we will investigate their case. It is very 
interesting that the Koc case has not been 
exposed up to now.\" Another mysterious killing is 
reported from Yuksekova. Mustafa Kanbas (49) 
wanted to swap his car with the car of Master 
Sergeant Riza Karabacak from the Yuksekova 
District Jandarma Command. After dropping off a 
relative of his at the 4th Jandarma Border Brigade 
in Sirnak on April 18, Kanbas set off for 
Yuksekova the next morning. One week later, 
Kanbas\' dead body was found on a heap of sand on 
the shores of the Zap River.

Rights Court (EHRC) interrogated Turkey between 
April 28 and April 30 at hearings closed to 
public in a Courthouse in Ankara. The judges 
heard claims that Serdar Tanis and Ebubekir Deniz 
disappeared while detained under the supervision 
of Silopi\'s District Chairman of HADEP. The 
judges took statements from 30 persons, including 
military officers and villagers. Some of the 
villagers made their statements in Kurdish. Tanis 
and Deniz were last seen at Silopi District 
Jandarma Command on January 25, 2001. Then

to the European Human Rights Court (EHRC). Later, 
MAY 01, 2003 
the police kicked the 55 year-old woman off the 
car and into the street. The woman said she was 
cooking for her family when the police raided her 
house on April 23, 2003, and asked her to 
withdraw her application to EHRC. She said the 
police left her house so that her neighbors would 
not become suspicious. She stated she went to the 
Turkish Red Crescent\'s Policlinic on April 28 to 
receive medical care.  She had been receiving 
medical care there because of the torture she had 
experienced in 1996. She further said, she gave 
an account of her experience with the police to 
the Human Rights Association. She recalled the 
police forced her into their car while she was 
buying bread from a booth, and cursed her as they 
shut her eyes and mouth, and finally, kicked her 
from the car. She added, because of fear of the 
police, her neighbors did not dare to visit her 
even when she was sick, and claimed that she was 
being isolated. She filed a petition of complaint 
with the Chief Public Prosecutor.

parallel in southern Iraq, started in 1997. 
 
 
6.  Radikal/Turkiye/Tercuman: In its \"2002 Global 
Terrorism,\" report, the US Administration 
signaled it was open to a dialogue with Syria, 
which was shown as a target after Iraq. The 
report mentioned Syria and Libya, Cuba, Iran, 
Iraq, North Korea, and Sudan, as \"countries 
supporting terrorism\" and outlined Syria\'s and 
Libya\'s support of terrorism had decreased. In 
addition to DHKP-C, PKK/KADEK has also been 
included in the list of the terrorist 
organizations. 
 
 
7.  Hurriyet: The \"2002 Global Terrorism\" report 
published by the State Department announced the 
PKK/KADEK organization armed 8,000 warriors. The 
report said KADEK continued arming about 8,000 
trained warriors in and around Turkey while it 
claimed it was abiding by the peace initiative it 
had declared. The report announced Turkey was one 
of the US\'s steadfast allies in combating 
terrorism. It was noted Turkey had suggested 
assigning a special force of 90 soldiers for 
combating terrorism in Afghanistan and had 
participated to the UN-led ISAF in Afghanistan 
with 1,400 troops. From Turkey, DHKP-C and 
PKK/KADEK have been included in the terrorists\' 
list that named 36 foreign terrorist 
organizations.

Gul\'s visit to Damascus, the Syrian Head of 
State, Beshar Essad, suggested Syria market its 
natural gas in Europe versus in Turkey and Gul 
proposed Turkey would clear the 850 kilometer- 
long Turkish-Syrian border of land mines. The 
collective belief is that the water and Hatay 
issues would be resolved more easily if economic 
cooperation between both countries developed. The 
parties decided holding a Turkish-Syrian Joint 
Economic Meeting in Syria on May 15, and the 
Turkish-Syrian Business Council Meeting in Turkey 
on May 20. The Turkish and Syrian sides decided 
on signing an agreement exempting trade between 
both countries from taxes.

2.  Turkiye: Although the US had announced the 
PKK/KADEK as a \"terrorist organization,\" the US 
gave permission to the PKK/KADEK to open an 
office in Mosul. It is believed that the US has 
been disregarding Turkey\'s warnings about the PKK 
because, after the collapse of Saddam\'s regime, 
the US turned a blind eye to the PKK\'s seizure of 
some of Iraq\'s weapons in northern Iraq. The PKK 
has expedited its reorganization in northern Iraq 
and has opened many offices throughout the 
country, including Mosul. It is further claimed 
that the US is trying to take its revenge from 
Turkey because of the TGNA\'s failure to endorse 
the motion that would have allowed the deployment 
of US troops in Turkey. It is also reported that 
the PKK has been making serious preparations to 
infiltrate into Turkey again. 
 
 
3.  Evrensel: In order to protest the shortening 
of the time allowed for Abdullah Ocalan to meet 
with his family and lawyers at Imrali prison, all 
KADEK defendants in Turkey will boycott their 
weekly meetings with their families. Making an 
announcement on behalf of all KADEK inmates, 
Nasrullah Kuran, said shortening Abdullah 
Ocalan\'s meeting with his family and lawyers to 
15 and 45 minutes respectively was inhumane and 
illegal, and such applications are intended to 
undermine the Kurdish-Turkish brotherhood. 
 
 
4.  Sabah: Sabah paper claimed that, according to 
two documents seized from Saddam\'s Secret 
Intelligence Organization\'s (SIO) archives in 
Baghdad, the PKK and Osman Ocalan had established 
ties with the SIO. The first letter, written by 
Osman Ocalan, gave information about former Prime 
Minister Ecevit\'s visit to the US in January 
2002, and suggested persuading the Prime Minister 
about the Northern Front. The second document 
suggested taking advantage of the PKK for 
contacting the DHKP-C (Revolutionist Peoples 
Communist Party-Front) which wanted to attack 
Incirlik AFB in Adana. The documents indicated 
the presence of a liaison between the PKK and 
Iraq\'s Intelligence Organization. 
 
 
5.  Turkiye: The President of the Executive Board 
of Gaziantep-based Sanko Holding, Abdulkadir 
Konukoglu, gave a one-million USD check to Prime 
Minister Erdogan in order to address the wounds 
of the earthquake in Bingol. The money was raised 
in a campaign in Gaziantep to help the earthquake 
victims. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye/Milli Gazete/Milliyet: The Chief 
Public Prosecutor of Bingol, M. Ali Erbay, said 
an investigation was started against the 
contractors, comptrollers, and project designers 
of the buildings that collapsed in the 
earthquake. Erbay said a warrant of arrest had 
been issued for the contractor of the boarding 
school that collapsed killing 84 students. The 
contractor would face between one to six years of 
imprisonment for failure of his obligations. In a 
recent cabinet meeting, the government decided to 
build 2,566 houses for the earthquake victims by 
the end of the year. The government blamed the 
PKK for the earthquake-victims\' demonstrations in 
Bingol. After the quake in Bingol, the boarding 
schools in the region are being inspected. 
Because of cracks in the buildings, 500 students 
in the boarding schools in Batman were sent to 
other schools. 
 
 
7.  Turkiye: The sound-bomb that exploded in 
front of the Finance-Investment building on Inonu 
Street in Mersin at 22:30 last night caused 
material damages. No organization has claimed 
responsibility. According to police officials, an 
investigation is underway. 
 
 
8.  Cumhuriyet: In his address at DEHAP\'s 
Provincial Convention in Diyarbakir, DEHAP\'s 
Chair, Mehmet Abbasoglu, claimed that his party 
did not compete with other political parties in 
the November 3 General Elections; rather, DEHAP 
competed with the public prosecutors. Abbasoglu 
stated, \"As a political party founded five years 
ago, the government did not give us any financial 
support, and was trying to close us down 
permanently.\" Abbasoglu added that the Prime 
Minister did not visit the Bingol Municipality 
after the earthquake to express his condolences 
to the people, and, therefore, the Prime Minister 
should apologize to the inhabitants of Bingol. 
Abbasoglu claimed that isolation was being 
imposed on Abdullah Ocalan at Imrali Island, and 
it was a shame that people from Turkey could not 
go to the island. 
 
 
9.  Bolge: Because of the rumors that DYP\'s Adana 
Provincial Chairman, Yavuz Tekeli, and Seyhan 
District Chairman, Mustafa Tumer, will be 
terminated by the party\'s headquarters, both 
chairmen will resign from their parties today. It 
is also reported that DYP\'s chairmen for Yuregir 
and Kozan districts have also been making 
preparations for their resignations.

10.  Tercuman: The Mardin Cement Plant signed an 
agreement with Syria to export cement to that 
country. According to the first phase of the

exported. The director of the plant, Ilker Guner, 
announced that they already had achieved their 
export goals for 2003, and they were now working 
on their export objectives in 2004. He added that 
they would make USD 11 million from the exports 
to Syria. 
 
 
11.  Radikal: After four months of closure, the 
Habur Border Gate between Turkey and Iraq was 
reopened to transit transportation as of 
yesterday. The people in Silopi and Cizre are 
extremely happy with the reopening of the gate 
because the gate is perceived to be the artery of 
the economy in the region.

2.  Cumhuriyet: Turkish President Ahmet Necdet 
Sezer\'s visit to Bingol with the Head of TGS,

Bingol\'s DEHAP Mayor, Feyzullah Karaaslan, went 
to the 49th Domestic Security Brigade Command to 
welcome the president on behalf of the people of 
Bingol, but was denied access to the military 
compound.  Bingol\'s Governor, Huseyin Avni Cos, 
seeing that the mayor was denied entry to the 
military compound, did not intervene in the case. 
After Mayor Karaaslan returned to his tent in the 
park to continue his activities, he received a 
call from a captain saying there had been a 
misunderstanding and invited him back to the 
Brigade Command, but Mayor Karaaslan refused to 
go. Mayor Karaaslan said he would not go to the 
place he had been dismissed from. 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Milliyet: Bingol\'s DEHAP 
Mayor, Feyzullah Karaaslan, complained that all 
the humanitarian relief items sent to the 
municipality following the earthquake were seized 
by the governor\'s office.  Mayor Karaaslan said 
the municipality tried to cooperate with all 
government agencies in town from the very 
beginning of the earthquake, but because of the 
governor\'s efforts to render the municipality 
ineffective, the municipality decided to withdraw 
from the \"Crisis Table\" headed by the governor. 
He stated that the needy people did not get the 
relief items, adding the \"Crisis Table\" seized 
all the relief assistance coming to the town and 
stored them in military facilities, a gymnasium, 
and in an orphanage.  He also claimed the Crisis 
Table was prevented from receiving humanitarian 
assistance sent by other municipalities in the 
region. In addition, Karaaslan said that rather 
than supplying the needs of the people, the 
Crisis Organization Center and its officials 
drove their cars and APCs against the people, and 
responded with gunfire by Special Operation 
Teams.  He further claimed yesterday police 
seized food and shelter materials sent by

allegedly tortured by police in Kiziltepe of 
Mardin on the charges of assisting and harboring 
the PKK, claimed she recognized the policewoman 
who had maltreated her, Hanife Sennur Pat, and 
sued.  Police said Aslan rolled herself on the 
ground and traces were left on her body when they 
grabbed her by the arm to lift her from the 
ground.  Aslan claimed she was tortured 
constantly while under detention, but could not 
see the faces of the male police officers because 
of black plastic bags put on her head.  She said 
four to five policemen beat her all the time, and 
she tried to remove the plastic bag when she was 
out of breath. Aslan said it was at that time 
that she saw the policewoman who tortured her. 
The court adjourned the hearing to an unspecified 
date.

the demonstration in Bingol claimed a group of 
approximately 1,500 people, including 
instigators, tried to attack Governor Huseyin 
Avni Cos, and the Special Operation Team- 
affiliated policemen opened fire in the air to 
disperse the crowd. The report claimed that the

DEHAP supporters. Twelve persons were arrested by 
police on the charges of involvement in 
demonstrations. While the court released ten of 
the detainees, two were held in custody for 
membership in illegal organizations.

1. (SBU)  Summary: Recent meetings with our 
regular Kurdish contacts reveal SE Turkey Kurds 
are optimistic about the resolution of the 
\"Kurdish question\" and are pinning their hopes 
on the international community, most notably 
the United States.  They also believe an 
amnesty for PKK/KADEK members is critical to 
achieving peace within the country.  Local 
Turkish officials, nevertheless, maintain that 
while not opposed to amnesty in principal, such 
an amnesty will only antagonize the problem 
further.  In any event, Ankara seems willing 
only to consider a broadened repentance law, 
without attendant economic and social 
incentives.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------- 
Hope for a solution? 
--------------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU)  Following the Coalition victory in Iraq, 
Southeastern Kurds are cautiously optimistic 
that a solution to Kurdish issues will be 
found.  While it will take time to fully 
resolve the situation, the war in Iraq and the 
United States\' \"improved attitude\" towards the 
Kurdish people signal a beginning to stronger 
international involvement in their plight.  Our 
contacts vehemently state that only pressure by 
the USG on the GOT to solve this issue and 
inclusion of Kurds in the new Iraqi government 
will allow the Kurdish people the opportunity 
to live peacefully with a Kurdish 
identification in the region. 
 
 
3. (SBU)  Our meetings also reveal Kurds believe 
the first step to improving relations with the 
GOT is the freedom to identify themselves as 
Kurdish.  However, our contacts also suggest 
that until Turkey completes its democratization 
process, this issue cannot be resolved; 
Turkey\'s current procedures, institutions, and 
Constitution are not equipped to permit ethnic 
groups, such as the Kurds, the opportunity to 
practice their traditions and live peacefully 
with other groups.  Our contacts conclude that 
continued and strengthened pressure by the USG, 
as well as other international bodies such as 
the European Union, on the GOT, to fully 
democratize will give way to a peaceful 
solution to the tensions between the GOT and 
the Kurdish people. 
 
 
4. (SBU)  Prominent Adana Kurdish activists stress 
that amnesty would give PKK/KADEK members the 
opportunity to integrate into society creating 
peace in the country.  They emphasize that the 
Kurdish people have lived peacefully with their 
neighbors in the region, including Iraq, and 
the GOT must play a facilitating role to 
maintain this.  These Kurdish leaders believe 
amnesty would allow PKK/KADEK members the 
ability to live free of in fear of GOT 
repercussion for their previous acts, and allow 
them to fully lay down their arms and establish 
a peaceful role for themselves and their 
families within society. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
\"If they won\'t accept the Turkish Flag, they 
shouldn\'t integrate into Turkish society!\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU)  Our local GOT contacts, however, say 
such an amnesty is not a feasible solution; 
nationalistic or ethnic identification only 
lends to the divisions within Turkish society. 
The opportunity to give such an amnesty would 
strengthen Kurdish identity and continue to 
divide the country.  According to one contact, 
Kurdish people prefer to identify themselves 
with the smaller, \"Kurdish\" identity rather 
than the \"Turkish\" national identity; 
consequently, this regional identity leads to a 
weakening of society by dividing the country. 
Other contacts add that amnesty only achieves 
its purpose if both the perpetrator and the 
victim are in agreement.  If the crimes are 
political in nature and hence committed against 
the State, the State may grant amnesty; but, if 
the crimes are against another person, only the 
victim or his/her family may grant amnesty. 
They argue that while some of the PKK/KADEK\'s 
crimes were political, many innocent families 
lost loved ones in the war; it should be their 
choice whether to grant amnesty.

Comment

6. (SBU) Comment: Kurdish contacts in the 
Southeast are optimistic that the 
disappointment suffered by the United States 
when the Turkish Parliament failed to pass the 
motion allowing US troops to be based out of 
Turkey will encourage the United States to give 
more credence to their plight and less sympathy 
to the GOT.  However, aspirations for an 
amnesty are unrealistic; the most the Turkish 
State might be willing to bear in a broadened 
repentance law.  Even that would not resolve 
the problem without attendant economic 
incentives and social measures.  In this regard 
we see no signs either that Ankara has any 
creative ideas or that Kurdish businessmen or 
groups in the Southeast are willing to take 
initiatives on their own.    End comment.

This cable is sensitive but unclassified; please 
protect accordingly. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Prominent Adana and Mersin 
businessmen are optimistic for increased 
economic opportunities relating to the 
Coalition victory in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
They also are hoping to take advantage of the 
SARS outbreak to export more textiles to 
Europe.  While they believe there may be 
openings in Iraq for Turkish companies and that 
trade will soon resume with Iraq, they caution 
that without significant steps by the GOT and 
strong relations with the United States, Turkey 
\"has no chance\" to improve its economic 
situation.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Hopeful for business alliances with Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
2. (SBU)  Prior to the beginning of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, southeastern Turkish businesses 
were proving to be stagnant as the uncertainty 
of the war, and its effects, loomed. 
Businesses, mainly exporters, were finding 
their international clients looking for 
alternate suppliers in case Turkish companies 
could not fulfill their orders.  However, 
according to local business owners, while 
Turkey remains in a deep economic crisis, the 
war did not produce any direct negative 
economic ramifications.  Rather, the 
Coalition\'s victory in Iraq has the potential 
to open many economic opportunities for Turkey; 
\"Iraq can, in the long term, buy services and 
products from Turkey using its oil revenue.\" 
 
 
3. (SBU) However, according to our contacts, the 
re-establishment of Iraq as a major trading 
partner depends upon the United States\' 
willingness to encourage the new Iraqi 
government to work with the Turks.  The failure 
of Turkey to play a significant role in the war 
may have denied Turkey an opportunity to 
quickly improve its economic situation with 
contracts in post-war Iraq and with the US 
economic package.  Nonetheless, according to 
some sources, the failure of the February 2003 
motion to allow US troops in Turkey did provide 
two abstract economic benefits: (1) problems 
with Turkey\'s neighbors who did not support the 
Coalition did not materialize allowing Turkey 
the opportunity to maintain, perhaps even 
strengthen, these relationships; and (2) money 
that would have been received from the USA 
would have gone directly to the politicians and 
not to the businesses and people who most need 
it requiring the Turkish private sector to 
continue to work hard to overcome the current 
economic crisis.  Whether or not these 
intangible \"benefits\" are true, many of our 
contacts fear the strains caused by the 
motion\'s failure in the US-Turkish relationship 
will cause the US to `overlook\' Turkey in post- 
war Iraq. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Blaming the USG and GOT for a Weak Turkish 
Economy 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  Some of our contacts expressed strong 
anger towards the United States for 
\"sidelining\" Turkey economically.  According to 
these sources, the US\'s failure to lift all 
textile quotas for Turkey, the US\'s 
unwillingness to permit Turkey to play a vital 
role in the reconstruction of Iraq, and the 
US\'s failure to \"live up to its promises\" after 
the end of the first Gulf War, produced a 
strain on the US-Turkey relationship.  \"Now, as 
the GOT does everything it can to relieve 
Turkey of its economic problems, the US, our 
supposed ally, does not show her support (i.e., 
in the form of waived quotas, guaranteed 
contracts, et al).\" 
 
 
5. (SBU) \"While it is easy to blame the 
Americans,\" most businessmen believe Turkey\'s 
current economic situation can only be resolved 
if the GOT takes meaningful steps to streamline 
its costs and improve the financial climate in 
Turkey.  \"Many Turks are frustrated because 
while Turkey has the resources, people, and 
knowledge it takes to improve the country, the 
government has consistently failed to do so.\" 
 
 
6. (SBU) According to our sources, four tasks must 
be achieved by GOT to put Turkey on the road to 
economic recovery: privatization, population 
control, smaller government and streamlined 
government spending, and improved foreign 
investment policies.  Our contacts have 
consistently stated that privatization would 
allow for redundant governmental positions to 
be eliminated and streamlined programs to be 
implemented.  Population control, especially a 
problem in the Southeast where low education 
and high birth rates abound, could be achieved 
with targeted education campaigns.   A more 
manageable population would, in turn, produce 
less strain on already strained governmental 
programs.  Frustrated businessmen argue current 
government practices to continue hiring people 
in an effort to slow unemployment have created 
false statistics and excessive government 
spending.  Finally, prevailing GOT foreign 
investment policies must be improved to reflect 
willingness and desire to have foreign 
investors in Turkey.  Currently bureaucratic 
procedures involved in investing and 
establishing foreign companies in Turkey 
strongly deters would-be investors. 
 
 
 
 
------------------------------- 
SARS: An Interesting Side Note 
------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU)  Our contacts also believe the SARS 
outbreak will drive more contracts to Turkey as 
people begin to turn away from the Far East in 
fear of the disease.  According to Free Zone 
leaders, while many Turkish businessmen have 
sought out these types of contracts, many 
textile contracts have sought out Turkey as a 
future supplier.

2.  Radikal/Milliyet: The police and jandarma 
have been alerted to arrest seven contractors of 
the buildings that collapsed and killed many 
people during the earthquake in Bingol on May 1. 
Pictures of the wanted contractors have been 
distributed to the security officials, and a 
warrant of arrest has been issued for the 
contractors. Hurriyet reports that under the \"Do 
not let our schools collapse\" campaign initiated 
by Hurriyet Paper and Channel-D, a delegation of 
eight experts from Middle East Technical 
University started examining the schools in 
Bingol by taking samples of concrete for 
analyzing in their labs in Ankara. 
 
 
3.  Milli Gazete: The earthquake victims in 
Bingol are afraid to go into their damaged 
houses. Three families are staying in one tent in 
Bingol\'s Asagikoy village with 81 houses, 500 
inhabitants. The villagers were afraid to go into 
their houses because of aftershocks, and only 25 
tents have been issued to their village with 81 
houses. The village headman, Abdulkerim Boztimur, 
said 20 persons were staying in one tent and 
asked for more tents rather than any relief 
material or foodstuff. Bingol Governor, Huseyin 
Avni Cos, announced that they delivered 13 
thousand tents and 400 tons of foodstuffs in 
Bingol to date. 
 
 
4.  Milliyet: According to the State Statistic

percent in Istanbul and 16 percent in Ankara of 
the employed population are engaged in 
agricultural sector, this ratio is 83 percent in 
Mus and 78 in Ardahan. While 64 percent of 
employees work in service sectors in Ankara, only 
13 percent are employed in this sector in Mus. 
While 32 percent of the employed persons are

2.  Cumhuriyet/Milli Gazete/Turkiye: It is 
claimed that around 90 PKK/KADEK militants have 
infiltrated into regions close to Turkish 
borders, and 300 more are in motion. After 
Barzani\'s IKDP, and Talabani\'s PUK, it is claimed 
PKK/KADEK wants to become the third major force 
in northern Iraq, and it is both continuing to 
threaten Turkey, and trying to increase its 
negotiation power with the US. Gathering at 
Kandil Mountain in northern Iraq, the 
organization\'s Presidency Council, which did not 
find the US demands acceptable, dispatched 90 
militants toward the Turkish border, and moved 
300 more to Gara and Gabbar. 
 
 
 
 
3.  Cumhuriyet: T.O., who was tortured by 
dripping melted plastic on her arms, and whose 
father was killed in front of her eyes by village 
guards in Omerli township of Mardin in 1994 when 
she was 12 years old, is still being threatened 
to withdraw her case charging 33 village guards 
with murder. T.O. and her father, Zeki Ozdemir, 
were stopped by village guards and jandarma for 
an ID check and taken to a farmhouse. The 
officials accused her father of taking food and 
ammunitions to the PKK, attacked her father with 
their rifle butts, and burnt plastic on her body. 
She said although her father was killed at the 
scene, no legal action was taken, and the village 
guards evicted them from the village a few days 
later. Ramazan Demiray left his village in 
Diyarbakir due to pressure to become a village 
guard in 1992. In the meantime, Demiray\'s land 
was used by village guards for eleven years. 
After filing a petition with the local Public 
Prosecutor\'s office in 2001 that his land had 
being expropriated without permission, charges 
were brought against the village guards. The 
court ordered the village guards to pay 
approximately USD 10 thousand to the land owner. 
 
 
4.  Radikal/Evrensel: The provincial chairmen of 
Peoples Democratic Party (DEHAP) announced in 
Ankara that, instead of the \"repent law\" on the 
agenda, a general amnesty, which would include 
PKK/KADEK militants as well, should be declared 
to establish reconciliation in the society. The 
DEHAP Provincial Chairmen said important 
developments that affected the region and Turkey 
were taking place as a result of US\'s 
intervention in Iraq, which created a historic 
chance for resolving the Kurdish issue. They said 
a non-discriminatory amnesty covering the 
PKK/KADEK components as well was essential in 
order to make the cessation of clashes lasting. 
 
 
5.  Sabah: Dr. Hasan Arslan, the Chief Doctor of 
State Hospital in Yukeskova of Hakkari, claimed 
he was kidnapped by three persons two days ago. 
Arslan said he had been beaten, his money and 
cellular phones seized, and he had been forced to 
sign promissory notes and resign from his 
position after he was interrogated. Arslan said 
the kidnappers had introduced themselves as 
members of \"Yukesekova Gang.\" Three of the four 
persons Dr. Arslan reported were later arrested. 
Special Operations Team members, village guards, 
the mayor, and PKK confessors were tried at court 
for membership in the \"Yukeskova Gang\" some time 
ago. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye: Security forces from the 3rd Border

examination, were relased by the court for 
extradition. Two Turkish national harboring the 
fugitives were detained. 
 
 
7.  Milliyet/Hurriyet: The President of Adana\'s 
Street Children Association, Prof. Dr. Fazilet 
Aksu, said because of eastern and southeastern 
families\' desire to move to bigger towns to 
improve their economic lives the number of the 
street children increased. At a conference by 
Adana\'s Chamber of Pharmacists, Prof. Aksu said 
the situation of the street children aged between 
12 and 14 had become an acute wound in the 
society. Aksu added that they conducted 
interviews with approximately 500 street children 
who mostly had migrated from Sanliurfa, Mardin, 
Diyarbakir, Siirt, and Kayseri provinces. The 
children said their families had moved to Adana, 
Istanbul, and Izmir in order to improve their 
economic conditions, but the migration had 
scattered the household members. In order to 
contribute to their families\' income, the young 
children sell chewing gum, wipe windshields of 
the cars, and beg. Aksu said the majority of the 
children were illiterate, and were exposed to 
abuse and various diseases. Aksu mentioned that 
the association did not have the power to provide 
a humane life for those children, and the state 
did not fulfil its obligation in that regard. The 
Security Directorate of Adana estimated the 
number of street children at five thousand. 
 
 
8.  Bolge: Adana Provincial Jandarma Command 
announced that 34,029 roots of hemp, 300 hemp 
seeds, and 215 grams of heroin were seized in

Mersin to contribute to the economic, social and 
cultural development of the town. Karalar said 
they would fulfil their obligations as a business 
association and an NGO, and would try to find 
remedies to economic issues by arranging economic

2.  Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Milli 
Gazete/Turkiye/Milliyet/Hurriyet: As a result of 
clashes between the security forces and members 
of illegal organizations in Tunceli, two privates 
were martyred while four organization members 
were killed. A group of PKK/KADEK militants 
firing on the soldiers near rural Atacinar 
village in Tunceli the previous night killed two 
soldiers. Reinforcement units dispatched to the 
scene encircled the terrorist group, but clashes 
continued throughout the night. Officials said, 
in the region, there were around 30 PKK/KADEK 
militants who had infiltrated into Turkey some 
time ago. During clashes between security forces 
and a group of TKP/ML (Turkish Communist 
Party/Marksist Leninist Faction) and TIKKO 
(Turkish Workers Villagers Communist Army) 
members, four members of the illegal organization 
were killed. 
 
 
3.  Evrensel: Based on the permission from the 
governor to return to their village, 
approximately 500 people from Yesiloz village in 
Sirnak left Van, Hakkari, and Cizre on May 16 for 
their village. The families were not allowed to 
go to the village by the Sub-govern orate and 
Jandarma Command on grounds that the village 
lacked the necessary infrastructure. The 
villagers are being kept under military 
supervision in an open space in the Village 
Services Department\'s workshop. The villagers\' 
request for tents has not been met. Villagers 
claimed the problem stemmed from the Chief 
Village Guard and Tribal Leader, Kemal Aslan, 
having denounced the villagers to the Brigade 
Command for allegedly assisting the PKK some time 
ago. 
 
 
4.  Evrensel: Emin Ete, who was apprehended at 
his store in Siirt on April 19, filed a petition 
with the local public prosecutor claiming he was 
taken by police to a field where he was exposed 
to physical and psychological pressure. Ete also 
claimed the police cut his fingers with a knife. 
The court dropped the charges against the 
policemen Sinasi Cetin and Senol Kutal, who are 
stationed at the Anti-terror Department of Siirt 
Security Directorate, on the grounds that there 
was no evidence that police had wounded the 
accuser. Opposing the court\'s decision, Ete said 
police seized the physical report he obtained 
after he had been wounded, and that he would 
appeal the case.

it permissible to name children in Kurdish. The 
ban in the Political Parties Law in regard to 
campaigning in languages other than Turkish will 
also be lifted, and amendments will be made in 
the RTUK Law (Radio Television High Council). 
Broadcasting on public and private TV channels 
and radio stations of different languages and 
accents the Turkish citizens use in their daily 
lives will be permitted. 
 
 
6.  Turkiye: Police teams from Adana arrested 
eleven Somali nationals in a bus at the Adana Bus 
Terminal. The Somalis had illegally crossed into 
Turkey from Hatay at the Turkish-Syrian border, 
and were planning to go to Italy. The Somalis 
will be brought before the court for \"coming into 
the country through illegal ways.\" 
 
 
7.  Milliyet: Teams from the Organized Crimes 
Department of the Adana Security Directorate 
arrested a Tarik Cakar, the so called leader of 
\"Cakarlar,\" a gang involved in theft, pick- 
pocketing and extorting money from shopkeepers in 
various quarters of the town. It is claimed that 
Cakar was involved in four murder cases. 
 
 
8.  Turkiye/Milliyet/Hurriyet: The Government and 
UNICEF\'s joint project \"The Child and Family 
Education Program\" was started in Mersin today. 
Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Diyarbakir, Samsun, and 
Mersin have been picked as pilot cities for the 
program. Regarding the program which aims to end 
domestic violence, the Deputy Governor of Mersin, 
Ibrahim Seker, said three thousand families would 
be educated throughout the province within the 
framework of the program.

please protect accordingly. 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A cross-section of GOT 
officials, NGOs, and businessmen in Turkey\'s 
Southeast reveals little, if any, change in 
economic or social conditions.  Lower-level GOT 
officials, unaccustomed to and uncomfortable 
with meeting foreign diplomats, paint an 
unrealistic picture, touting the Southeast as a 
model for other developing countries.  Many of 
these officials assert that economic conditions 
are improving and were not affected by the 
recent war in Iraq and that human rights 
violations rarely occur.  However, according to 
our NGO contacts, the economic situation 
remains stagnant and social conditions have not 
changed since the third EU reform package was 
passed in August 2002.  Kurdish contacts 
anticipate a resolution of Kurdish-Turkish 
tensions.  However, they associate this 
resolution with increased US participation and 
continue to think that the rise in awareness of 
the Kurdish problem in the international arena 
is a major step in compelling Ankara to begin 
serious efforts to mend ties with citizens of 
Kurdish origin.  End summary.

2. (SBU) Poloff met with a wide variety of 
provincial education and health directors, sub- 
governors, and local NGOs and prominent 
citizens in Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Hilvan, and 
Diyarbakir between May 13-16.  While most of 
our scheduled appointments were eager to meet 
with us, some provincial education and health 
directors did not appear or sent their deputies 
to meet with us.  As it was explained, either 
the directors were \"in another meeting\" or they 
did not have the permission of their superiors 
to meet with us.   Often, the deputies were 
enthusiastic to discuss their roles, 
workplaces, and issues relating to working in 
the Southeast.  Aside from these contacts, many 
of those who did meet with us gave an 
identical, too rosy picture of conditions in 
the Southeast: in the health system, almost 
every child is immunized, birth control and 
population control is taught, there are no 
language or communication barriers, and there 
is adequate health care in each village; in the 
education system, all children are provided 
schooling and high school attendance is on the 
rise, there are no language or communication 
barriers, and technology is the only thing 
lacking in their schools. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
... But Lower Level Contacts Bemoan Bureaucratic 
    Nightmares 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
3. (SBU) In contrast, the deputies assigned to 
speak with us often portrayed a different 
picture.  In Diyarbakir\'s Social Security 
Hospital, the hospital director spoke of 
bureaucratic nightmares in which he had been 
corresponding with his central ministry in 
Ankara in order to fix a broken piece of 
equipment for three months and still had yet to 
receive the funding to repair it.  According to 
procedures, all appointments must be made 
through an appointment system; however, many 
women speak only Kurdish and are unable to 
obtain an appointment on their own.  Often, 
these women must rely on a male family member 
to translate and choose not to receive medical 
care if the condition is of a private nature. 
The central headquarters also seems to place a 
higher emphasis on new buildings, rather than 
staff; Sanliurfa\'s State Hospital is expected 
to move into a new 500-bed hospital in August 
2003 but, according to its deputy chief doctor, 
\"while it will be nice to have a new facility, 
it is even more important to have a full 
staff.\"  Nurses are in high demand and the 
shortage is so great that ten nurses (of the 
100 employed at this hospital) miscarried due 
to the strenuous load of hours they worked. 
Sanliurfa\'s deputy chief doctor summed up the 
situation by stating, \"the only efficient 
system within the GOT is the military; if the 
GOT adopted a similar system to healthcare, we 
would have the capability to utilize our 
resources to effectively care for our 
patients.\"  Many of our health contacts also 
expressed optimistic skepticism for the 
Ministry of Health\'s plans to refresh Turkey\'s 
healthcare system: \"we have heard it before but 
will be pleased to see it happen this time.\" 
 
 
4. (SBU)  The education system also shares some 
language problems but the primary issue remains 
attracting girls to school and getting all 
students to continue to high school.  In 
Hilvan, there are approximately 9700 students 
attending school; of these roughly 500 attend 
secondary school while 9200 attend the 
compulsory primary school.  The Provincial 
Education director atributes this wide 
discrepancy to wealthier parents sending their 
children to school in Sanliurfa.  (Note: Hilvan 
is not known to be a wealthy province and 
poloff noticed more horses and carts than cars 
in the city center.  End note.)  Girls have 
begun to enter school but some of our contacts 
estimate that 70 percent of the region\'s female 
population remains illiterate.  In one of 
Diyarbakir\'s newest high schools, the principal 
spends approximately half of his time 
soliciting local businesses and the Ministry of 
Education for money and equipment to outfit his 
school. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Still a Man\'s World 
------------------------ 
 
 
5. (SBU) Almost every NGO contacted stated that 
the human rights situation in Southeastern 
Turkey had not changed for the better after the 
EU reform package was passed in August 2002 or, 
for that matter, in the last five years. 
Kurdish language broadcasting, guaranteed under 
the EU reform package, still has yet to be seen 
in a regular, unobstructed way and activists 
often cite conflicting laws within the GOT and 
general GOT unwillingness as primary reasons. 
Prison guards often disconnect inmates and 
family members who speak in Kurdish during 
visiting hours.  Torture continues freely 
against inmates accused of being PKK- 
affiliated; although the torture inflicted is 
often more mental than physical and the 
physical beatings are confined to those that 
will leave the least lasting physical effects. 
6. (SBU) According to KA-MER, a Diyarbakir-based 
woman\'s group, suicides amongst women and girls 
are on the rise in the Southeast, especially in 
Diyarbakir and Batman.  KA-MER worries, that 
because these deaths are rarely investigated, 
many of them could be honor killings designed 
to look like suicides.  According to KA-MER\'s 
founder, the lack of education combined with 
economic hardships and a strict religion 
propels many families to take this drastic 
action against their daughters who have or have 
been perceived to bring dishonor to the family. 
The organization applauds the local 
municipality for its help in arranging 
replacement identification cards to women who 
have sought KA-MER\'s protection.  Women in 
Southeastern Turkey continue to play a 
traditional, uneducated role and remain tied to 
the male members of the family\'s wishes for 
food, shelter, and education. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Renewed Kurdish Hope 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Kurds living in Southeastern Turkey 
describe to us a cautious hope for a resolution 
to what they see as heir main problems because 
it appears the Kurds will play a role in the 
new Iraqi government and their situation has 
been propelled to the international arena. 
However, our contacts frequently warn that, 
without US support, a resolution will not 
happen.  \"We support the US war in Iraq but we 
also support the GOT\'s failure to pass the 
February motion allowing US troops in Iraq 
because, had the government passed the motion, 
Turkish troops would have moved into Northern 
Iraq and the Kurdish role would have 
diminished.\" 
 
 
----------- 
Comment 
----------- 
 
 
8. (SBU) Officials\' apprehension, or failure, to 
meet with us and the deliverance of the same 
party line given to us by many GOT bureaucrats 
portrays a strong fear of repercussion by their 
superiors.  It is curious to note how some of 
our appointments would usher us out the door 
after a few minutes of small talk in order not 
to be accused of discussing something 
inappropriate.  In meetings with higher level 
officials, including the new Diyarbakir 
governor, we were given a biased, but clearer 
view of the region: \"there are still problems, 
namely within healthcare and education, but our 
situation is improving daily.\"  Also, we heard 
that many mid-level GOT bureaucrats often 
choose to extend their tours in the region 
because of the \"easy way of life.\"  They are 
often provided added monetary incentives and 
enjoy an elite standing in the province.  These 
officials frequently seem satisfied with the 
status quo and seemed to prefer not taking the 
extra steps it would require to improve much of 
their territory because it could potentially 
upset their way of life. End Comment.

2.  Cumhuriyet: Before he was killed, the former 
Security Director of Diyarbakir, Gaffar Okkan, 
had disclosed the names of 26 Hizbullah members. 
Hizbullah\'s leader in Turkey, Mehmet Besir Varol, 
AKA \"Melle Mizgin,\" was arrested in Konya on May 
17. Mehmet Cicek and Nurullah Gulsever who were 
also arrested have been identified as important 
militants in the organization. The Hizbullah 
militants were taken to Diyarbakir for 
interrogation. So far, eight of the terrorists on 
Okkan\'s list have been arrested while two others 
were killed some time ago. The militants were 
ordered held by Diyarbakir State Security Court. 
Cicek and Gulsever are accused of involvement in 
18 incidents. 
 
 
3.  Turkiye: A meeting dubbed \"Family Planning 
and Methods to Prevent Pregnancy\" was organized 
at Cukurova University (CU), by CU\'s Women\'s 
Problems Research and Application Center. Vice 
Rector Prof. Dr. Nebahat Sari said a major 
portion of women are affected by health problems 
in the country. Sari added that two million women 
become pregnant in Turkey annually, and of 450 
thousand miscarriages, 280 thousand are 
intentional. She said approximately 30 thousand 
children were stillborn, and more than 700 
mothers a year lose their lives due to various 
health problems. 
 
 
4.  Bolge: At a City Council meeting, the 
Governor of Adana, Kemal Onal, said the 
government had built houses for the earthquake 
victims in Adana in 1994. Governor Onal said two 
thousand families persisted living in the damaged 
and inhabitable houses rather than moving to the 
government-built houses. The governor added that 
those families would forcibly be evacuated by the 
security forces from those unsafe houses. 
 
 
5.  Milliyet: Because of the authority vested in 
the OHAL Governor (State of Extraordinary Rule 
Governor), the administrative decisions made by 
his office could not be reversed. Such a 
prevention in the provinces under the OHAL  has 
been found to be against the law. The OHAL 
Governor wanted to transfer a teacher in 
Diyarbakir for his activities. The teacher filed 
a petition with the Administrative Court for the 
reversal of the action, but the court dismissed 
the case. The teacher appealed the case to the 
Supreme Court which demanded the reversal of the 
action and submitted the file to the 
Constitutional Court. While five members of the 
Constitutional Court decided against the 
reversal, 6 decided in favor of the decision.

6.  Bolge: After McDonalds unilaterally decided 
to cancel its contracts in Turkey, the owner of 
the McDonalds outlet in Mersin, Mustafa Yuksel, 
put a pad lock on his facility with a ceremony to 
protest the decision. Yuksel said he  had spent 
USD 450 thousand for the McDonalds, and had 
signed a contract for 20 years. Yuksel claimed 
that McDonalds\' unilateral decision caused 19 of 
42 McDonalds outlet owners in Turkey to go 
bankrupt. Yuksel said, on a monthly basis, he 
paid 18 percent of his gross for rent, 5 percent 
for advertisement, and 5 percent for use of the 
brand name in addition to $45 thousand he had 
initially paid for franchising. Yuksel said he 
was offered only $75 thousand for closing down 
his facility where 25 people were employed.

2.  Evrensel: It is claimed that MKP-HKO (Maoist 
Communist Party-Peoples Liberation Army) member 
Aycan Tato, killed in the clashes at Dinar Deresi 
of Tunceli on May 24, was the victim of an extra- 
judiciary killing. Eyewitnesses claimed that 
security forces opened gunfire, without any 
warning, on Tato as he walked toward the wooded 
area from the house the security forces were in. 
It is claimed that no weapons were found on Tato. 
 
 
3.  Evrensel: Nine presidents of Bar Associations 
in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey prepared an 
alternative Draft Law to the Repent Law. At a 
press conference, the presidents demanded a 
\"general amnesty.\" They proposed no action to be 
taken against people who had not been subjected 
to any investigation in the past, and that these 
people should benefit from the law provided they 
applied within one year of the date the law was 
enforced. The Bar Association presidents also 
proposed a five year suspension of sentences for 
inmates and prisoners with definite sentences. 
 
 
4.  Cumhuriyet: The Chief Public Prosecutor of 
the Diyarbakir State Security Court, Saban Erbas, 
sent to Ankara a report on the draft Repent Law. 
The report, which expressed the views of the 
officials in the region, is deemed as a \"road 
map\" for the draft Repent Law which will be 
handled at the National Security Council\'s 
meeting tomorrow. Erbas, whose judiciary 
jurisdiction covers Batman, Bingol, Diyarbakir, 
Mardin, Sirnak, and Sanliurfa provinces, said 
that the armed combat with terrorism should be 
supported with legal arrangements and 
psychological operations as well. Saban 
emphasized that the state did not achieve its 
objective of persuading the terrorists to come 
down from the mountains because of the lack of 
legal arrangements. Saban added that developing 
technology and diversity in communication 
devices, and domestic migration made it difficult 
to follow terrorist organizations; he emphasized 
that it was important to know the organizational 
structure of terrorist organizations in combating 
them. Regarding the most recent Repent Law, 
declared on August 26, 1999, Saban said it was 
not successful because of its narrow scope. He 
added, \"In order to bring down the terrorists in 
the mountains, security forces constantly claimed 
that the terrorists could benefit from the repent 
law. The terrorists who surrendered to security 
forces as a result of this propaganda were 
disappointed with the fact that the repent law 
was not applied. They reached the conclusion that 
the security forces\' propaganda did not reflect 
reality.\" 
 
 
5.  Cumhuriyet: One single house has not been 
built for the 1966 earthquake victims in Mus. The 
earthquake victims in Mus warned the Bingol 
earthquake victims not to be deceived by promises 
made by politicians, and that they should take 
care of themselves.  Regarding the situation of 
the 1966 earthquake in Mus, Mayor Abdulbari Han 
said: \"The officials promised houses for 4,400 
people. With contributions from the World Red 
Crescent, the British government built 589 
temporary barracks for the victims, and officials 
promised that permanent houses would be 
constructed in a very short time. Although 37 
years have passed since the earthquake, no houses 
have been built in Mus, and most of the people 
qualified for the houses have died.\" 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
6.  Turkiye: Mustafa Caliskan, the President of 
the Adana Chapter of MUSIAD (Independent 
Industrialists and Businessmen Association), said 
the sugar price in Turkey was fivefold that of 
world prices, and added, \"the state should end 
the period of loading its losses on the shoulders 
of 70 million people.\" Caliskan said a kilo of 
granular sugar was sold for approximately one USD 
while it was only 0.20 USD in the world markets. 
Caliskan said while sugar is overpriced in the 
country, the General Directorate of the Sugar 
Plants was seeking permission to export its 
excessive sugar stocks for half the price 
determined for exportation. He said the issue 
should be investigated.

2.  Radikal: An investigation was begun against 
Enis Alkan, a senior student at Ataturk 
University in Erzurum, because officials believe 
Alkan made a pro-Kurdish statement with his 
signature while filing a petition with the 
university for mid-term exams. The report from 
the security directorate stated, \"although the 
meaning of the signature is not being examined in 
our laboratory, the signature resembles the word 
Kurtculuk (Kurdism).\" Alkan was dismissed from 
the university. Alkan\'s request for suspension of 
the act by the university was denied at the local 
administrative court on the grounds that there 
was no serious opposition to the law or 
irrecoverable losses. Alkan is waiting for the 
result of the appeal he made to the Regional 
Administrative Court. 
 
 
3.  Radikal: In Kazanci village of Diyarbakir, 
the elementary school teacher required a sick 
student to read an anthem that begins with \"happy 
is he who says I am a Turk.\"  Because the student 
chanted it silently, the teacher misunderstood 
the student, and thought he said \"happy is he who 
says I am a Kurd;\" and charges were brought 
against the student at the State Security Court. 
The unidentified student, who was tried at 
Diyarbakir State Security Court, was acquitted on 
the grounds that moral components of the crime 
were not constituted. 
 
 
4.  Radikal: Police in Hakkari used an 
interesting method to determine people who 
shouted pro-Ocalan and PKK/KADEK organization 
slogans during the Newruz festivities in Hakkari 
on March 21. Thirteen persons viewed with open 
mouths in pictures taken by police were 
interrogated for having shouted pro-separatist 
organization slogans. The police filed a petition 
with the office of the Chief Public Prosecutor of 
Hakkari against the suspects for \"supporting and 
harboring the organization,\" and demanded a 
warrant of arrest in absentia be issued for eight 
suspects not found at their addresses. Five other 
suspects were arraigned. Later the court released 
the suspects because of lack of solid evidence. 
The suspects\' attorney, Mikhail Demiroglu, said 
the police did not have sound records of the 
people accused, and it was difficult to 
understand what was said and by whom at a place 
where thirty thousand people had gathered. 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: A court in Tunceli gave a one month 
imprisonment sentence to 30 persons, including 
HADEP\'s former Provincial Chairman Alcan Onlu, 
and the former Provincial Chairman of EMEP, Salih 
Gundogan, for attending the May 1 Labor Day 
Meeting in Tunceli. Regarding the issue, an 
attorney from Tunceli Bar Association, Baris 
Yildirim, said, although the OHAL (State of 
Emergency Rule) has been lifted, its effects 
still continue. Yildirim said the people had 
gathered to celebrate Labor Day, and making a 
press release was not a crime by law. Yildirim 
said they would appeal the court\'s decision. 
 
 
6.  Milli Gazete/Bolge: Adana Governor Kemal Onal 
said there was a pressing need in Adana for five 
thousand classrooms in elementary schools and 925 
classrooms in secondary schools. Governor Onal 
said because Adana received influxes of 
immigrants, the need for classrooms increased. 
The Governor also stated 300 teachers, appointed 
to Adana for health and family reasons, were 
receiving their salaries without teaching any 
classes. Onal claimed that most of the immigrants 
had multiple children and the need for classrooms 
was mainly felt in Yuregir and Seyhan districts 
of the town. Governor Onal said he was expecting 
support from private citizens and companies to 
resolve the issue. He added they spent 
approximately 2.750 million USD for 
transportation of 13,500 students throughout the 
province. 
 
 
7.  Hurriyet: Three hundred physicians and nurses 
from various towns were trained on \"Family 
Planning Standardization Education\" at the 
Yavuzlar Infirmary in Adana. Adana Provincial 
Health Director, Dr. Serdar Mercan, stated their 
objective is to give standard, good quality

Southeastern regions. Bas said the fair would be

3.  Cumhuriyet: The Assyrian origin citizens, who 
migrated from Sarikoy village in Sirnak in the 
mid-1990s due to terrorist events, are afraid to 
return to their village because of the village 
guards. The citizens, with Bishop Samuel Aktas in 
Midyat of Mardin acting as the intermediary, 
asked the governor to expel the village guards 
from their houses. Assyrians have begun to return 
due to the June 12, 2001 circular by former Prime 
Minister Ecevit ordering the facilitation of the 
return of Assyrians. The Assyrians are uneasy 
about returning because of the obstacles created 
by the village guards. In their petitions to the 
governor, the villagers claimed the village 
guards had occupied their homes and had been 
cultivating their land and orchards, and their 
property rights were also violated. 
 
 
4.  Cumhuriyet: Sanliurfa, the \"City of

New Testament throughout the world. The 
representative of the Bible Society, Behnan 
Komutgan, said it was unfair to label them as 
missionaries because the Bible Society members 
are honorable Turkish citizens. Komutgan said the 
first four chapters of the Bible were translated 
into Kurdish under the name of \"Mizgin\" (Good 
News), and the translation into Kurdish of the 27 
chapters of the entire Bible would be completed 
by the end of the year. Komutgan added that the 
Holy Books had been translated into 2,040 
different languages and accents in the world. 
 
 
6.  Hurriyet/Radikal: Following the May 1 
earthquake in Bingol, 713 of 1,770 teachers in 
Bingol province applied for a transfer to other 
regions. As the Provincial Education Directorate 
failed to persuade the teachers to stay in the 
area for another year, the teachers\' petitions 
for transfers will be submitted to the Ministry 
of National Education on May 30. It is reported 
that all of the teachers who have asked for a 
transfer are homeless. 
 
 
7.  Hurriyet/Bolge: Because of demand by women, 
the Adana City Council\'s Women Committee, the 
Women Consultation Center, and the Association to 
Establish Women Shelter Houses are working 
together to open a \"Women\'s Shelter House\" in 
Adana. The president of the association, Nurten 
Mersinli, said the Adana Municipality promised to 
support their efforts.

8.  Bolge: Adana\'s Provincial Director of the 
Labor and Employment Department, Hasim Meydan, 
said 7,783 workers were laid off during the first 
four months of 2003. Meydan added his Department 
had paid a total amount of three million USD to 
eligible workers since the enforcement of the 
\"Unemployment Insurance Law.\"  Meydan gave the 
number of registered jobless persons as 18,568

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
2.  Sabah/Hurriyet: As a result of ensuing 
clashes between the security forces and a group 
of PKK-KADEK militants who had set up an ambush 
near Bingol yesterday evening, one soldier was 
killed while seven others were wounded. As 
clashes continued, enforcement units were 
dispatched to the region. 
 
 
3.  Hurriyet: Charges were brought against a 
shepherd named Suleyman because he grazed his 
live stocks in Bingol at night. The court 
demanded two and a half months of imprisonment 
for the shepherd for acting in opposition to the 
orders given by authorities. The shepherd 
appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court acquitted Suleyman on the grounds 
that the state was responsible for promoting live 
stock raising and supporting the live stock 
raisers for increasing production, and that the 
ban was not in confirmation with the 
Constitution. 
 
 
4.  Hurriyet: After his speech at the War Academy 
on EU and assorted issues, the Vice Chief of TGS, 
General Buyukanit, clarified his views about his 
abstention on use of mother tongue in 
broadcasting. General Buyukanit was quoted as 
saying, \"When there are thousands of terrorists 
in the country, we can not pretend as though they 
do not exist. It would not matter if broadcasting 
on the country\'s television was made in Chinese 
or Arabic if there had been no terrorist threat 
in our country.\" Drawing attention to the 
difficulty in controlling the TV channels, 
General Buyukanit said \"RTUK\'s (Radio and 
Televison High Council) offices in Anatolia are 
being closed down. Who is going to inspect these 
private broadcasts? Once it was debated on a 
private TV channel in Diyarbakir whether the 
Independent Kurdish State should be Islamist or 
secular. Controlling is not as easy as it is 
thought. First of all, the idea would emerge, and 
then weapons would be given to people. At the 
moment, there are 900-armed PKK militants within 
the borders. Is this a threat? At a time, Kocero 
(a bandit) was only one person, and he was a 
threat. From this angle, we perceive broadcasting 
in the mother tongue as a threat.\" 
 
 
5.  Sabah: The Batman Women\'s Platform decided to 
arrange a poem and essay competition in Turkish 
and Kurdish on \"War, Peace and Women.\" The 
platform applied to the governor\'s office to 
obtain permission. The authorities denied its 
request on the grounds that no such entity 
legally existed. The governor\'s decision is found 
odd because Turkey is trying to pass bills to 
make it permissible to broadcast in Kurdish on 
private TV channels. An inmate in Batman prison, 
Fahriye Ceylan, hoping the permission for the 
contest would be granted, sent a poem in Kurdish 
to the jury. The poem was illegible because it 
was entirely scratched out by the prison 
administration. The prison administration\'s note 
on the poem stated, \"It has been scratched out 
because it was written in a not understandable 
language.\" 
 
 
6.  Milliyet: Adana\'s Mayor Aytac Durak, who 
faced up to one year of imprisonment on the 
charges of abuse of authority while in office, 
also benefited from the amnesty law. Durak was 
charged of violating several laws and rules 
between 1996 and 1998. His file has been 
suspended for five years. If Mayor Durak commits 
a crime within five years, he will be given a 
penalty for the previous charges as well. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
7.  Bolge/Cumhuriyet: Although the harvesting of 
wheat has started in the Cukurova Plain, the 
government has not announced the basic rate for 
the product yet. The producers said they suffered 
approximately a 10 percent loss in yield due to 
extreme heat and northeast wind in May. The 
farmers said the government should take world 
market prices into account and announce a basic 
price not less than 0.26 or 0.28 USD per kilo. 
Merchants have been buying wheat at 0.21 or 0.22 
US dollar per kilo. The President of Yuregir\'s 
Chamber of Agriculture, Sahin Tekin, said TMO 
(Soil Products Office) was not friendly to 
farmers anymore because it acted in a business- 
minded manner. Tekin said it was impossible to 
feed 70 million people with imported wheat, and 
therefore, he said the government should support 
the farmers to increase the wheat production.

2.  Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Evrensel: Tension rose 
between a group of soldiers on leave in downtown 
Tunceli and private citizens yesterday. Around 
two thousand people gathered in the city\'s main 
square and shouted, \"peace could not be 
disrupted; Dersim (Tunceli) would became a grave 
to fascism; [and] Damn Jitem (jandarma 
Intelligence Center.\" When the quarrel between 
the soldiers and locals turned into a fight, one 
of the soldiers fetched a long-barreled weapon 
from the Jandarma Central Command and started 
shooting at random.  He broke the some windows of 
buildings and damaged some cars; his colleagues 
finally stopped him.  The police did not 
intervene in the incident in order not to magnify 
the event. In the meantime, Tunceli Governor Ali 
Cafer Akyuz announced from municipal loudspeakers 
that an unwanted incident had burst out in town. 
The governor added that action was taken against 
the perpetrators, and called upon everybody to be 
calm. The crowd dispersed after the governor\'s 
announcement. Regional Jandarma Commander Sakir 
Altinbas claimed one soldier was beaten in the 
course of the quarrel, and added that legal and 
administrative actions were initiated against the 
soldier who had opened fire in the air. 
 
 
3.  Turkiye: Two brothers, Yunus (14) and Idris 
Uzun (17), were killed when they tried to open a 
mortar found near Bingol at their home. Their 
younger brother, Onur Uzun, was also wounded. 
Onur was taken to Firat University Hospital in 
Elazig. 
 
 
4. Evrensel: The police arrested two students in 
the Hani township of Diyarbakir on the grounds of 
making insinuating remarks in Kurdish to their 
female teacher during Children\'s Day celebrations 
on April 23. Based upon the teacher\'s complaint, 
two policemen from the Hani Security Directorate 
detained the students. It is claimed the police 
beat the students in a cell in the basement of 
the security directorate and placed human 
excrement to the faces of the two students. 
According to reports, the police then toured the 
students in town and exhibited them to the 
public. The students\' attorney, Mehmet Zulfu 
Dundar, described the incident as \"shameful.\" 
Dundar said they would sue the policemen in 
coming days. Because of the petition filed by the 
teacher, the students are charged with 
molestation. The next hearing has been adjourned 
for June 4. Regarding the issue, the teacher and 
the two policemen said they could not make any 
announcement because they were public employees. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
5.  Turkiye: The basic price announced for wheat 
by TMO (Soil Products Office) received negative 
reaction from the farmers in the Cukurova plain. 
TMO announced the price for a kilo of wheat is 
approximately 0.22 USD. The merchants are buying 
wheat from the market at 0.24 USD per kilo. The 
farmers\' expectation of the basic price was 0.27 
or 0.28 USD per kilo. Regarding the issue, the 
Adana Farmers\' Union President, Cumali Dogru, 
said the government left the farmers to their own 
destiny. Dogru added that the wheat from Cukurova 
plain deserved a basic price of not less than 
0.25 US dollar per kilo.

Bingol Governor Huseyin Avni Cos announced at a 
press meeting that seven of eight persons 
detained on charges of \"assisting and harboring 
the PKK/KADEK terror organization\" were ordered

the students had brought in order to sell. Three 
students were wounded as they tried to prevent a

ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
7.  Sabah: As the peshmergain Northern Iraq 
increased the dinar\'s rate of exchange against 
the USD arbitrarily, truckers carrying goods from 
Turkey to Iraq went on a strike for three days. 
The truckers started carrying goods to Iraq again 
only after the authorities resolved the issue. 
The ROE was 20 Iraqi dinars to USD 1.00 until a 
week ago, but because of a vacuum of authority, 
the peshmerga charged 3.50 Iraqi dinars to USD 
1.00. As a result of the arbitrary application, 
the Iraqis increased the transit fee to 120 US 
dollars. After the truckers\' strike, the transit 
fee was dropped to 20 US dollars. Sirnak Deputy 
Governor Resul Celik said only Turkish truckers 
passing from Habur border gate were exposed to 
such an application which aimed to make the trade 
from Turkey difficult.

2.  Radikal/Evrensel: Elbeyli Sub-governorate in 
Kilis organized a conference on May 30 so as to 
turn public opinion against \"Armenians\' 
Fictitious Claim of Genocide.\" It was mandated 
all public employees in town attend the 
conference. Assistant Associate Prof. Dr. Mehmet 
Kabacik from Kilis\' Educational Faculty was the 
speaker of the conference. Kabacik got furious 
when Hulya Akpinar, a member of Teachers\' Union 
Executive Board, asked Kabacik if Turkey had an 
integrated policy in the event the Armenians 
managed to make their case accepted because of 
the strong Armenian lobby in the United States 
and Europe. Kabacik asked the teacher who she 
was, with what title, and on whose behalf she 
dared to ask such a question. Kabacik\'s reaction 
disturbed the audiences. In order not to prolong 
the argument with Kabacik, Akpinar left the 
conference room with her five colleagues and 
returned later. Acting Elbeyli Sub-governor 
Ramazan Yildirim prepared a report expressing 
that the six teachers provoked the conference. 
The court accused Akpinar of \"making statements 
and behaving in a manner that would cause 
indignation in public.\" The judge decided on 
releasing Akpinar on bail of approximately one 
thousand USD. The rest of the teachers were 
released on the condition of reporting to the 
court when needed. Because Akpinar could not 
locate an official to deposit the bail, she 
remained under detention the previous day. After 
depositing the bail last evening, Akpinar was let 
free. 
 
 
3.  Milliyet: According to a piece of news wired 
on the internet by \"Kerkuk-Kurdistan,\" the 
Kurdish Institute in Istanbul, KII, claimed 
Kurdish and Kurdish culture was under pressure in 
Turkey. The KII and the Kurdish Cultural 
Foundation in Sweden, KCFIS, asked for financial 
support from the Swedish Consul in Istanbul for 
printing one hundred thousand books in Kurdish 
and distributing them in Eastern and Southeastern 
Turkey for free. It is claimed that the Swedish 
government has appropriated approximately 377 
thousand USD for publishing 20 books in Kurdish

4.  Cumhuriyet: A union is being established in 
Sirnak for the first time after the lifting of 
the State of Emergency from the Southeast. The 
groups affiliated to KESK (Public Employees\' 
Unions\' Confederation) applied to the governor\'s 
office for opening their branches. The State of 
Emergency, declared in the region in 1987, 
thwarted opening union branches and prohibited 
many activities. It is going to be hard for the 
unions to find public employees who would qualify 
to become members to their unions because the 
employees generally serve in Sirnak for a period 
of two years. 
 
 
5.  Bolge/Turkiye: Three people kidnapped Nusret 
Gulec, director of Is-Bank in Pozanti, Adana, and 
held her for ransom. A person coming to the bank 
yesterday morning asked the bank director to ride 
with him on the pretext of visiting a client. As 
the director got into the car two other fellows 
got into the car, too. When Gulec realized that 
he was being kidnapped, he struggled with the 
drivers and the fellows in the car. The car ran 
into a bus cruising on E-5 highway. Gulec and the 
kidnappers were wounded in the accident. The 
police arrested the kidnappers.

2.  Cumhuriyet: A political party, under the name 
of \"Democratic Republic Party,\" will be founded 
to substitute DEHAP. The chief prosecutor of the 
Supreme Court had sued DEHAP and demanded its 
permanent closure some time ago. The case is 
still pending. Taking into account the likely 
closure of DEHAP prior to local elections in 
2004, former HADEP members had made preparations 
for founding a new party under Ahmet Turan 
Demir\'s leadership. Demir was one of HADEP\'s 
former chairs. The petition for founding the new 
party will be submitted to the Interior Ministry 
tomorrow. Demir said the new party would follow a 
democratic socialist line. 
 
 
3.  Sabah: A Republican Peoples Party (CHP) 
parliamentarian from Diyarbakir, Muhsin Kocyigit, 
in a resolution to the Grand National Assembly, 
asked the Interior Minister if  beating and 
placing human excrement on the faces of two 
students in Hani (Diyarbakir) was true or not. It 
is alleged that the police detained, beat, and 
placed human excrement on the faces of two 
students for making insinuating remarks in 
Kurdish to their female teacher at Children\'s Day 
celebrations on April 23. 
 
 
4.  Evrensel/Milliyet: The Diyarbakir governorate 
investigating the (above) case decided that there 
was no solid evidence that the policemen in Hani 
had beaten, toured and placed excrement on the 
faces of students. The governorate dropped 
bringing the policemen to trial, and denied all 
the students\' allegations. Based upon the 
governorate\'s decision, the office of the Chief 
Public Prosecutor in Hani also announced that 
there was no evidence that required bringing 
public charges against the policemen. At a court 
hearing in Hani, the teacher, who had sued the 
students, withdrew her complaint. The court 
adjourned the case to an unspecified date to 
listen to the students\' account of the event. The 
students attorney, Zulfu Dundar, sued the 
policemen, Hasan Sezgin and Ergun Sahin. 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: At a press meeting in Human Rights 
Association\'s Chapter in Sanliurfa, the Urfa 
Democracy Platform, announced that the \"repent 
law\" proposed for the Kurdish issue; the 
personnel law damaging reconciliation at job 
sites; the law opening the path for depriving 
laborers of unions; the local administration law; 
and the isolation applied in F-type prisons; had 
increased tension in society. The spokeswoman for 
the platform, Gulay Koca, proposed declaring a 
general amnesty for installing peace and order in 
lieu of the repent law under consideration. 
DEHAP\'s provincial office in Diyarbakir launched 
a three-day signature campaign demanding a 
general amnesty. DEHAP\'s Provincial Chairman, 
Firat Anli, asked all segments of society to be 
sensitive about resolving the Kurdish issue, and 
to participate in the signature campaign.

2.  Cumhuriyet: Egitim-Sen (Teachers\' Union) 
members in Diyarbakir lived through a difficult 
period for twelve years because of applications 
during the State of Emergency Rule. Twenty-seven 
union members fell victim to mysterious killings 
while one hundred ninety six others were deported 
from the region. Egitim-Sen\'s Diyarbakir Chapter 
is going to prepare a report on the problems its 
members and administrators faced during this

3.  Turkiye: It is reported that PKK/KADEK has 
decreased the number of its militants in camps in 
Northern Iraq as a precaution against a likely US 
operation against the PKK/KADEK in the region. 
The militants have been scattered from their 
winter camps to a more expanded area in smaller 
groups. It is claimed that the terrorist 
organization has instructed one hundred fifty 
militants in Northern Iraq to infiltrate into 
Turkey from the borders with Iraq, Syria, and 
Iran; and the ones in Turkey have been told to 
move to new bases in rural Bingol and Agri 
provinces. Because it is afraid that the Repent 
Law under consideration would encourage the 
militants to desert from and expedite the 
dissolution in the organization, PKK/KADEK 
instructed its militants it would never abandon 
arms. 
 
 
4.  Evrensel: Youth and Women Organizations of 
DEHAP in Diyarbakir, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Adana, and 
Batman provinces announced that the Repent Law on 
the country\'s agenda would deepen the problems, 
and emphasized, instead, a general amnesty, which 
would install peace and order in society, should 
be declared. The security officials in Batman did 
not allow the women\'s organization to make a 
press announcement in front of DEHAP\'s provincial 
office. 
 
 
5.  Evrensel: One hundred thirty families evicted 
from Yesilgoz village in Sirnak a number of years 
ago have not been allowed to return to the 
village; they have been kept at the entrance to 
Beytussebab for twenty days on the grounds that 
the village road is closed. The governor had 
earlier given the villagers permission to return 
to their village. A prominent villager, 
Abdurrahman Aslan, said Sirnak Governor, Vehbi 
Avuc, initially told him the reason the villagers 
have been kept in Beytussebab was because there 
was no fuel to open the village road. He said the 
governor later stated Aslan had not obtained his 
permission to return and he would not give such 
permission. When the AK Party district chairman 
suggested his party would buy fuel to open the 
village road if the governor granted permission, 
the governor scolded the party leader not to 
speak nonsense.

to her. During her interrogation at jandarma,

(SSC) of Ankara initiated two new investigations

thousand armed militants; it had decided to 
increase the number of the armed groups in the 
Southeast; and, it had four hundred suicide 
bombers at Zab and Kandil regions in Northern 
Iraq waiting for instructions. Gungordu, who is

Regulations About the Language of the Radio and 
Television Broadcasting which permits 
broadcasting in Kurdish. The path for 
broadcasting in Kurdish will be closed should the 
Supreme Court reverse the case or decide on 
halting the execution of the regulation. 
Broadcasting was made permissible after RTUK 
(Radio and Television High Commission) made 
amendments in the RTUK Law for the first EU 
harmonization laws passed last year. RTUK\'s 
arrangements of the regulation based on that law 
came into effect as of December 18, 2002. 
According to the regulation, TRT would broadcast 
Kurdish programs prepared by RTUK\'s experts; 
however, because amendments have not been made in 
TRT\'s Law, TRT demanded the reversal of RTUK\'s 
decision on the grounds that it could not 
broadcast in opposition to its regulations. Only 
private TV channels will be permitted to 
broadcast in Kurdish if the Supreme Court 
reverses the case.

EDUCATION 
 
 
4. Cumhuriyet/Turkiye: A joint study by UNICEF and 
Turkish National education revealed that one- 
eighth of the girls in Turkey are not sent to 
schools at all. Many shortcomings have been 
reported from East and Southeast Turkey before 
the academic year starts on September 15. It is 
reported that in Diyarbakir alone at least 200 
classrooms and 7500 teachers are needed. The 
ratio of the girls deprived of any education is 
even greater in East and Southeast Turkey. 
Approximately one-third of the girls deprived 
of education in those regions. The number of 
girls aged six to fourteen and who have not 
enjoyed any education in Diyarbakir, Bitlis, 
Batman, Agri, Hakkari, Mus, Sanliurfa, Siirt, 
and Sirnak provinces reaches 250,000. A \"Hurry 
up, Girls to School\" campaign initiated by 
UNICEF aims to reduce the ratio of uneducated 
girls by half. Regarding the issue, UNICEF\'s 
Representative for Turkey, Edmond Mcloughney, 
said all segments of the population, 
particularly the media, had to take part in 
that activity. 
 
 
5. Sabah\'s Guney Supplement: The existing capacity 
of the schools in Adana do not meet the demand 
since no new classrooms have been built. The 
Provincial National Education Director of 
Adana, Omer Simsek, said they had 57 students 
per classroom in Yuregir district and 69 
students in Seyhan district of Adana. He added 
that they needed 5,000 more classrooms in order 
to have thirty students per classroom, which is 
required for a normal education. The state is 
expecting assistance from charitable 
organizations to fill the gap for the schools.

          IN SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY 
 
 
REF:  ANKARA 4499 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Most contacts affiliated with 
the possible beneficiaries of this law see no 
change between this law and previous versions. 
They told post\'s political FSN that the recently 
enacted law would not be successful in 
encouraging PKK/KADEK militants to disarm.  As a 
result, only two groups appeared to be taking 
advantage of this law, PKK/KADEK supporters not 
guilty of any violent action and members of the 
(Turkish) Hizbullah. Reliable information on the 
numbers of persons who have applied for the 
benefit is difficult to come by-press reports 
vary and government officials are reluctant to 
give out information on the number of applicants. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) A senior official in the Siirt chapter 
of a respected, credible human rights NGO 
expressed the belief that many (Turkish) 
Hizbullah members are applying to benefit from 
this law because the current Interior Minister 
Abdulkadir Aksu (who held the same office during 
the early 1990s) allegedly has ties with the 
organization.  The official believes that it is 
more likely that (Turkish) Hizbullah members, as 
opposed to PKK/KADEK militants, will apply to 
benefit from the law. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) A prominent legal association official 
with credible ties to the human rights NGO 
community in Diyarbakir stated that more 
militants would apply if not required to give 
information to the security forces.  He claimed 
that, because PKK/KADEK is not an underground 
organization, the organization took 
responsibility for all of its actions and that 
these actions were well known to the government. 
Therefore, the militants\' disclosure of 
information was not necessary.   He believed that 
PKK/KADEK demonstrated willingness to lay down 
its arms, but the 12-year sentence imposed for 
previous participation in violence represented a 
serious deterrent.  According to the official, 
the government\'s reluctance to establish a 
dialogue with NGOs while drafting the law also 
served as an impediment to PKK/KADEK militants 
laying down their arms and taking advantage of 
the \"reintegration\" law. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) A prominent Hakkari attorney described 
the beneficiaries of the law as belonging to the 
following two groups: prisoners charged with 
\"sheltering and harboring PKK/KADEK militants\" 
and a group of persons who had cut their organic 
ties with the organization about ten or fifteen 
years ago, previously lived in Iraq or Iran and 
were now married with children.  The militants 
inquired about the law but no one applied to 
benefit from it after the PKK/KADEK\'s 
leadership\'s announcement that banned members 
from doing so.  The Hakkari Mayor and the Mayor 
of Sirnak stated that, if the law had been 
presented in the form of a general amnesty, the 
organization\'s leadership would have applied. 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Information on the numbers of persons 
who have applied for benefit is difficult to come 
by.  The Diyarbakir State Security Court (SSC) 
directed inquiries to the Justice Ministry. The 
Sirnak Deputy Governor stated that the daily 
figures could be obtained from the Interior 
Ministry.  So far post has been unable to obtain 
any official figures. The reported numbers of 
people taking advantage of the \"Reintegration 
law\" vary widely in the press, anywhere from 100 
to 547 in Diyarbakir.  In the August 27, 2003 
Milliyet, Army Corps General Ataman announced 279 
applicants in Elazig, but only 2 from rural 
areas. 
 
 
6. (U) According to a September 2, 2003, 
\"Milliyet\" report, 2,138 people applied to take 
advantage of the \"reintegration\" law that went 
into effect on August 6, 2003.  The number of 
those who turned themselves in voluntarily was 
211.  The daily wrote that 1,507 of the total 
applicants were mostly PKK/Kadek and Hizbullah 
inmates in prison. 
 
 
The following is a list of their affiliations: 
 
 
PKK/Kadek               1169 
Hizbullah               338

REF:  A) ADANA 271 B) ADANA 272 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Southeastern Turkey has seen 
an increase in violent clashes since the 
beginning of September. According to credible 
press reporting which the consulate has been able 
to corroborate on multiple occasions, there have 
been ten significant clashes resulting in 
multiple deaths and injuries, of which eight 
appear to be at PKK/KADEK initiative and one 
which appears to be at the GoT\'s instigation. 
One violent attack in Tunceli is difficult to 
attribute; Tunceli in the past has seen both 
DHKP-C and PKK/KADEK activity.  In the preceding 
months of July-August, there were six total 
attacks, while there were ten attacks in May-June 
2003.  While the scale and scope of the attacks 
are still limited, the PKK/KADEK appears to be 
taking the initiative to attack what it considers 
to be vulnerable GoT targets in Bingol, Hakkari, 
Diyarbakir, Mardin, Adana and Agri provinces, as 
well as along the Tunceli/Bingol provincial 
border.  Finally, PKK/KADEK has declared to the 
press that it has established a \"new unit\" 
calling itself the \"People\'s Protection Force.\" 
It appears to have undertaken at least one 
offensive operation, but corroboration of 
information on both the unit and this attack 
currently is limited.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.(SBU)  Most of the recent attacks have been in 
rural or village areas, although two attacks 
recently have occurred in urban zones bordering 
larger population centers.  For example, on 
October 15, \"terrorists,\" widely considered to be 
PKK/KADEK-associated, attacked a Jandarma minibus 
in the Kurkculer suburb of Adana at approximately 
2000L.  The attack occurred near an Adana prison 
and the minibus may have been carrying Jandarma 
personnel who had completed a shift change at the 
detention facility.  One Jandarma soldier was 
reportedly killed in the attack and two more were 
reportedly injured.  Police report finding 
approximately 65 shell casings in the vicinity of 
the attack site in post-attack investigations 
(REFS.A-B). 
 
 
3.(SBU) Additionally, there have been numerous 
clashes between DEHAP protestors and GOT security 
forces which have resulted in arrests and or 
violence resulting in non-lethal injuries.  These 
clashes have taken place in Mersin, Adana, 
Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Siirt, Sirnak, Van and 
Mardin provinces. 
 
 
4.(SBU)  There are four reports of civilians 
killed or seriously injured by stepping on 
landmines or encountering unexploded ordnance in 
parts of regions associated with past PKK/KADEK 
activity. 
 
 
5.(SBU) Finally, PKK/KADEK has declared to 
friendly press outlets that it has established a 
\"new unit\" calling itself the \"People\'s 
Protection Force (Heze Parastine Gel in 
Kermanji)\" to retaliate against GoT security 
forces it considers to have used force \"against 
peaceful Kurdish demonstrators.\"  This unit, 
however, also has claimed responsibility for an 
Oct. 13 attack in a rural area of Hakkari linked 
to an earlier PKK/KADEK cadre clash with security 
forces.  Reportedly up to ten GoT forces were 
killed during this attack and several more 
wounded.  Consulate corroboration on this unit\'s 
alleged attack is limited. 
 
 
6.(SBU)  Comment: Who has instigated these 
clashes is not clear, but the restart of violent 
attacks by PKK/KADEK plays into the hands of 
those in the Turkish State who want to keep 
southeastern Turkey under tight security control.

SUBJECT:  COMMERICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SE TURKEY 
 
 
1.(SBU-BUS SENS)   Summary:  The business mood in 
the southeast Turkey commercial community remains 
downbeat with deep concerns about cotton prices 
and persistently high unemployment typifying most 
commercial discussions.   There is an element of 
hope voiced by some border provinces regarding 
future export opportunities to Iraq and Syria 
which is somewhat tempered by concerns about 
security in Iraq and as yet unclear outcomes in 
the Iraq reconstruction major bidding arena for 
which many southeast Turkish businesses aspire to 
be significant subcontract recipients.  The EU is 
also interested in commercial development in the 
region, adding a new EU Information Center in 
Adana on January 14 to its existing EU 
Information Center in Gaziantep. End Summary. 
 
 
Cotton (prices) are king - and erasing already 
thin margins 
 
 
2. (SBU BUS)  Recent conversations with both 
major Adana and Gaziantep textile producers, such 
as BOSSA and SANKO, reveal broad concern about 
very high cotton raw material prices brought on 
by major Chinese buying.  For those companies 
whose leading textile outlets are in the U.S., 
the concurrent drop in the value of dollar- 
denominated revenues is only squeezing margins 
more and even major textile producers in the 
region already are predicting, at best, break- 
even to losing years in 2004.  A leading cotton 
importer commented to PO recently that the sudden 
recent spike in cotton raw materials was 
unanticipated by most -even major - textile 
producers and was hitting regional textile 
producers\' bottom lines very hard.  PO 
discussions with major producers corroborate this 
importer observation.  The major importer also 
observed that Chinese purchases of  synthetic 
textile raw material is also causing similar 
consternation in the non-cotton textile producing 
sector in Southeast Turkey.  He summed up the 
situation by saying, \"four-fifths of the textile 
people (in the southeast) are scared by the raw 
material price increases and the other fifth are 
just plain fatalistic about where the textile 
market is headed.\" 
 
 
Gazing toward border trade for economic renewal 
 
 
3. (SBU SUS SENS)  Municipalities and chambers of 
commerce and industry throughout  southeast 
Turkey are concerned about persistent high 
unemployment and lack of job creation, appealing 
for special treatment in Iraq reconstruction 
business because of  perceived losses from the 
last decade of sanctions imposition on Iraq. 
Business leaders make similar appeals, but 
grudgingly seem to accept explanations about 
transparency and open competition in the Iraq 
reconstruction process sooner than their local 
government counterparts. 
 
 
4.(SBU BUS SENS)  Business leaders in Adana, 
Mersin, Iskenderun, Antakya and Gaziantep have 
voiced great interest in developments in Iraq 
reconstruction contracting and some 
disappointment upon realization that few, if any, 
of them are sufficiently large to qualify for the 
major contracts on the immediate Iraq 
reconstruction . Many, however, are looking 
forward to public award of the major contracts so 
that they can strategize to attract significant 
subcontract work.  Others, while still very 
interested in gaining subcontracts, seem to be 
more blindly relying on southeast Turkey\'s 
proximity to Iraq or unspecified \"natural 
advantages for Turkish business in Iraq\" to 
deliver work to them. 
 
 
Some Turkish companies already exploring 
footholds in Iraq 
 
 
5.(SBU SUS SENS)  Consulate personnel have met 
with about a half dozen contacts in the last 
month who are already doing work in Iraq or 
setting up offices to perform contracts and/or 
find Iraqi partners for future joint ventures. 
Some of these contacts are performing limited 
contracts for the U.S. military, such as 
providing a motor pool in Kirkuk, or catering for 
a military unit. Most of these business 
activities seem perceived as test projects by the 
Turkish companies, many of whom have experience 
in military contracting on Incirlik air base. 
The Adana Chamber of Commerce claims that two 
million dollars of commerce have taken place 
between Adana and Iraq this year, but details on 
that trade flow have not been forthcoming. 
 
 
6.(SBU BUS SENS) Other companies and chambers of 
commerce are thinking longer-term and setting up 
offices in Iraq to host Turks looking for 
businesses and contracts to serve as long-term 
business relationships. The Sabanci Group soon 
will set up in or near Irbil while the Adana 
Chamber of Commerce is looking to establish a 
\"guest house for businessmen\" in or near Kirkuk. 
Other Gaziantep and Silopi consulate contacts are 
already setting up small textile production 
businesses and investing in small real estate 
ventures and construction, with local Iraqis, as 
far south as Mosul.  These Turkish textile 
producers are asking whether there will be quotas 
on textiles produced in Iraq that they might wish 
to sell in the U.S., while the real 
estate/construction investors are interested in 
OPIC coverage of their assets sent to Iraq for 
projects. 
 
 
Talking seriously about Syria 
 
 
7.(SBU BUS SENS) Since even before the recent 
Assad visit to Ankara, local southeast Turkey 
press has buzzed with news of Syrian and Turkish 
border trade meetings. Most have centered on 
visits to regional chambers of commerce by the 
Aleppo chamber of commerce.  Interest in 
increased border trade seems highest in Hatay, 
Gaziantep, Kilis, and Adana provinces.  Still, 
despite the talk of future increased trade and 
sincere mutual Turkish-Syrian interest in its 
development, few contracts seem to have 
materialized.  The effort seems to first aim to 
legitimize ongoing grey area cross-border traffic 
as a first step toward expansion into new 
business sectors.  To this end, the Syrian trade 
delegation in Gaziantep will become a consulate 
soon and the Aleppo Chamber of Commerce will 
start \"sister chamber\" relationships in Adana, 
Gaziantep and Antakya. 
 
 
8.(SBU BUS SENS)  Additionally, (presumably) 
wealthy Syrian consumption of (relative) Turkish 
luxury goods is apparent throughout Hatay, where 
Mercedes with heavily tinted windows and Arabic 
license plates, are frequent sights and Adana\'s 
small mall, where Arabic is now a frequently 
overheard language at dress shops, perfume 
counters and toy stores, as well as the Real and 
Carrefour department stores.  The Real has even 
set up a diplomatic exceptions window to cater to 
these Syrian customers who seem to have 
diplomatic credentials as the information at the 
new counter is in Arabic. (N.B. The  U.S. 
Consulate is the only diplomatic mission in 
southeast Turkey other than the newly-opening 
three-person Syrian consulate in Gaziantep, two 
hours drive away with a similar small mall.) 
 
 
EU interested, but in what? 
 
 
9.(SBU BUS SENS)  The EU is also interested in 
commercal development in the region, adding a 
new EU Iformation Center in Adana on January 14 
to its xisting EU Information Center in 
Gaziantep.  Cosulate personnel attended the 
office\'s opening o find that no EU personnel 
were in attendance a the opening.  Turkish 
organizers were mildly dsappointed about the 
lack of EU personnel involement, but expained 
that EU interest this weekwas inEU Preident 
rodi\'s trip to Ankara.  Acoringto severl f 
te offices\' organizers, th Adana office is one 
of the  eight offices apprved for Turkey by the 
EU.  They further explaind that eleven offices 
were proposed by Turkish rganizers, but the EU 
refused to support the thee proposals which 
asked to be coordinated throuh the Turkish

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Contacts in Adana tell us 
incumbent Mayor  Durak is certainly running for 
re-election.  His party affiliation remains 
unclear, but an official close to the mayor 
asserts that AK Party will announce Durak\'s 
candidacy after the February Sacrifice Holiday. 
Because of mass Kurdish migration from southeast 
Turkey, candidates from the main stream political 
parties will need to attract immigrant voters in 
order to win Adana\'s mayoralty.  Gaziantep 
appears to be a two-horse race between CHP and AK 
Party.  According to contacts, DEHAP is still in 
the lead in the Diyarbakir mayoralty race as well 
as in smaller southeast Turkey municipal races. 
Cizre DEHAP may well opt to run a Diyarbakir 
resident on the DEHAP mayoral ticket due to 
alleged torture of local DEHAP candidates, 
according to a consulate contact there.  Still 
indecision and party internal fragmentation 
indicate these races are not automatic locks for 
DEHAP As an example, he predicted that local 
voters would not readily accept an outsider and 
so DEHAP might lose in Cizre.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
ADANA: MAYOR SEEKS THE PARTY OF CHANGE OR JUST TO 
CHANGE HIS PARTY? 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Consulate personnel spoke on January 14 
with an official close to current Adana Mayor 
Aytac Durak.  Durak is certainly running for re- 
election (with which party he will be affiliated 
is the question).  Durak\'s ideological stance 
remains a bit unclear.  At one time he belonged 
to DYP, but he was most recently elected on the 
ANAP\'s ticket. The official stated that Durak 
definitely intends to join the AK Party and run 
as their candidate. According to repeated press 
reports, Durak conducted polls in recent months 
to ask the Adana voters to which party he should 
belong.  Durak commands a strong following 
according to the official, probably at least 30% 
of the voters.  This official asserted that 
another 60% was split evenly between CHP and AK 
Party.  He predicted to consulate personnel that 
the winning ticket would be the one with Durak on 
it. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Durak may be caught in the middle now. 
Press reported both that ANAP chairman Nesrin Nas 
will not accept him as ANAP\'s candidate because 
he has changed parties too often and that AK 
Party Adana chairman Abdullah Dogru would not 
accept Durak as AK\'s candidate unless the Ankara 
party leadership appointed him. Dogru stated 
that, of course, the Adana AK Party leadership 
would respect Ankara\'s ultimate decision: \"We 
would show respect even if Ankara appointed Fidel 
Castro.\"  The official close to the mayor 
maintains that AK Party will announce Durak\'s 
candidacy after the February Sacrifice Holiday. 
Although Durak prefers AK Party, the official 
confided that CHP wasn\'t out of question 
entirely. 
 
 
ALLIANCES MAY BE THE KEY 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Because of the mass migration from 
southeast Turkey to the Cukurova region, 
candidates from the mainstream political parties 
need to attract immigrant Kurdish ethnic voters 
in order to win Adana\'s mayoralty.  Leftist 
parties and DEHAP are reportedly exploring 
negotiations with CHP for an alliance.  Local 
observers predict that, in part because of 
national incumbency, and in part, because of the 
conservative nature of Southeast Turkey\'s 
population, AK Party should do well in the 
upcoming local elections.  The southeast Turkey 
immigrant bloc and the bloc in support of Durak , 
most observers believe, will be determinative. 
Since these two voting blocs, according to the 
mayoral official, will go with either CHP or AK 
party, it is shaping up to be a two-party race. 
 
 
GAZIANTEP:  TWO HORSE RACE-CHP VS AK PARTY 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Consulate personnel met with a 
prominent Gaziantep businessperson and long-time 
newspaper owner to discuss his perspective on the 
possible outcomes of local elections. Like in 
Adana, it appears to be a two-horse race between 
CHP and the AK Party. According to the business 
contact, CHP may nominate the current Gaziantep 
mayor, Celal Dogan, to run on its ticket and the 
newspaper owner believed the yet-to-be announced 
AK Party candidate could strongly challenge 
Dogan.  The reason, he said, was that many of the 
recent immigrants to Gaziantep from southeastern 
Turkey would likely vote AK Party rather than 
DEHAP, as they might have in their former 
districts farther east (Note: he estimated about 
800,000 immigrants to Gaziantep from southeast 
Turkey in recent years).  He noted that the 
Islamic political parties had provided services 
to underprivileged areas in order to secure their 
votes.  He also noted that the immigrants 
practiced a more conservative Islam and 
identified with the AK party for this reason. 
The businessman expressed concern at the prospect 
of an AK Party mayor and expressed his belief 
that, if that were the case, his newspaper would 
be subject to increased political pressure.  He 
related that most newspapers in Turkey cater to 
the incumbent party to secure economic advantage. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) The mixed economic atmosphere in which 
the Gaziantep elections will be held is typical 
of the larger cities in southeast Turkey.  On the 
day of the meeting with this businessman, 
consulate personnel also attended the opening of 
the Gaziantep Shoe Fair.  State Minister 
Abdullatif Sener opened the fair, an impressive 
collection of regional Turkish manufacturers and 
importers.  Sener\'s appearance highlighted the 
importance the current government ascribes to the 
Gaziantep commercial scene and the possible gain 
of an AKP mayoralty there. In contrast, our 
business contact related how he had opened a 
bookstore in Gaziantep and quickly lost 300,000 
USD because nobody purchases any books.  He 
attributed this to a lack of both money and 
education. Most contacts agreed that the AK Party 
in Gaziantep is very wealthy and yet their 
potential new voting bloc may be those recent 
immigrants from southeast Turkey who have little 
money or education. 
 
 
AK PARTY\'S PLAN--WILL IT BE MUTLU OR GUZEL (HAPPY 
OR BEAUTIFUL)? 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Another business contact in Gaziantep 
(long known to both the Embassy and the 
Consulate) also related to consulate personnel 
the AK party strategy for the upcoming mayoral 
race.  The current mayor, Celal Dogan, recently 
re-joined CHP and is considered a possible 
candidate for either the Gaziantep or Istanbul 
mayoralty.  He stands a good chance of winning in 
Istanbul, the businessman asserted, because there 
is a \"large and influential population of voters 
from Gaziantep\" who are currently living and 
doing business in Istanbul.  On the other hand, 
he still remains popular in Gaziantep should he 
run for re-election. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) AK party reportedly will nominate 
PETKIM official Mustafa Mutlu if CHP chooses 
Dogan to run in Istanbul, believing that he has a 
solid chance of winning without Dogan\'s 
competition.  If Dogan runs on the CHP ticket in 
Gaziantep, it is thought that Dr. Asim Guzel will 
be the AK party nominee.  With Dogan in the race, 
our local contact says that AK party officials 
project that their candidate is a long shot to 
win anyway and the businessman believed that it 
serves AK party interests to run their stronger 
candidates elsewhere. 
 
 
FARTHER EAST: DIYARBAKIR AND BEYOND 
 
 
9.  (SBU) A human rights contact in Diyarbakir 
with broad regional contacts told PO on January 
19 that DEHAP is still in the driver seat in the 
Diyarbakir mayoralty race. He said DEHAP, 
nevertheless, was still not decided as to whether 
to re-endorse incumbent mayor Feridun Celik. 
While he saw AKP quite active in building its 
Diyarbakir base, their chances of success were 
slim unless DEHAP waited too long to pick a 
definitive candidate to head its ticket. 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  Further afield in the Southeast, he 
saw some changes brewing.  He said AKP might win 
in Gaziantep and definitely believed that DEHAP 
would lose in Elazig and Bingol, either to 
popular local independents, ANAP or DYP 
candidates.  He also noted DEHAP and SHP might 
run joint candidates in many smaller southeast 
Turkey mayoral races.  Nevertheless, he said that 
conventional wisdom still held that most 
southeast mayoral races were DEHAP\'s to lose 
(Comment: DEHAP\'s popularity in southeast Turkey 
is ideologically-based, not personality-based or 
even performance-based.  In most cases, the DEHAP 
candidate chosen is of little interest to the 
voters. End comment). 
 
 
HOW DEHAP MIGHT LOSE SOME. 
 
 
11.  (SBU) A longtime consulate contact without 
political affiliation in Cizre explained that 
DEHAP-affiliated politicians in Cizre had been so 
either \"tortured\" (he did not specify how) or 
harassed by local Jandarma and TNP that Cizre 
DEHAP may well opt to run a Diyarbakir resident 
on the DEHAP mayoral ticket.  He predicted this 
approach was likely to fail since local aghas 
rarely embraced outsiders, even fellow Kurds, and 
may opt to support a local AKP candidate. 
 
 
12. (U) Comment: We will continue to try to gauge 
whether the AK bandwagon in the rest of Turkey is 
as strong in a region which has become more 
Kurdish nationalist over the past 15 years and 
where local feudal landlords and tribal leaders 
can still be swayed by the highest bidder.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT:  BUSINESS COMMENTS ON IMPACT OF IRAQ 
TRADE ON SE TUREKY 
 
1.(SBU)  Summary:  Southeast Turkey business 
people have demonstrated continuing interest in 
doing business in Iraq in discussions with 
consulate personnel, but have yet to commit 
significant resources pending resolution of 
questions regarding security, export status of 
goods and business viability assessments, 
including business licensing and financing 
issues.  Agricultural trade, primarily cotton, 
and textile manufacturing are at the center of 
much local Turkish business interest.  Meanwhile, 
residents of the two closest Turkish border towns 
to Iraq, Cizre and Silopi, note the negative 
impacts of border trade on their incomes and 
quality of life. End Summary. 
 
 
2.(SBU-BUS SENS)  A prominent Adana-based SABANCI 
Holdings representative told PO recently that the 
SABANCI group is disappointed that it recently 
lost a small-medium bus manufacturing joint 
venture bid in Iraq, but said it is determined to 
find long-run investments in Iraq to pursue.  He 
offered AKBANK involvement in the Trade Bank of 
Iraq as proof as well as the soon-to-open SABANCI 
representative office in Irbil.  He wondered how 
textile exports from Iraq to the U.S. might be 
viewed, too.  Meanwhile he said that there are 
some steady sales of SABANCI Group HAYAT bottled 
water into Iraq, as well as LASSA tire sales 
through Turkish-based retail distribution re-sale 
to independent Iraqi outlets.  He closed the 
discussion by saying that the SABANCI Group is 
also very interested in investing in state 
enterprises once privatization commences, 
mentioning specific interest in the cement 
sector. 
 
 
3.(SBU-BUS SENS)  When asked where he thought 
there might be evidence of recent heavy U.S. 
investment positively affecting southeast 
Turkey\'s economy, he discounted the impact that 
the 2003 U.S. government approximately 700 
million dollar in purchases would have locally. 
He said most of the U.S. purchases were devoted 
to fuels and that those monies stayed in Istanbul 
or offshore.  He said that drivers recruited from 
southeast Turkey to deliver fuels and perishables 
to Iraq were being paid low wages and now had to 
declare income openly that they pre-war had 
shielded from tax authorities.  He also said that 
many local agha\'s in the southeast played a major 
role in regional trucking and were receiving the 
lion\'s share of transportation expenditures.  He 
described this group as having \" little tradition 
of save and re-invest in the region,\" saying they 
may have started purchases of construction 
commodities related to new up-scale personal 
housing, but that most money had probably found 
its way to Istanbul or elsewhere outside the 
region. 
 
 
4.(SBU)  EUCOM Forward liaison contacts who have 
been working the ground line of communications 
since Spring 2003 note some economic development 
along the approximately 600 KM route, including 
more available consumer goods in Silopi and the 
appearance of several truck stop-like break areas 
on the western and central parts of the route. 
They note, however, that the roadbed on the route 
is in bad repair, especially sections between 
Gaziantep and Sanliurfa, and in Mardin and Sirnak 
provinces.  Comment: Consulate concurs based on 
its own recent travel along route. End Comment.) 
 
 
5.(SBU-BUS SENS)  SANKO representatives have 
indicated that they have little exposure to 2003 
Iraq border  trade beyond significant sales of 
SANKO-Group NESTLE joint venture bottled water. 
They described these plants as working at almost 
full capacity, but declined to consider expanding 
bottling capacity, viewing the market as 
profitable, but short term since Iraqi water 
bottling soon would start. They said that they 
would await further security stabilization before 
considering participation in the Iraqi market, 
focusing instead on increasing efficiency in high 
value-added textiles and expanding their 
synthetic textile production. 
 
 
6.(SBU-BUS SENS)  The SANKO representative hinted 
that the group would like an outside investor to 
join them in significantly expanding their small 
naptha-cracking facility in Yumurtalik, near 
Adana,  to build their synthetic fiber source 
base, among other uses.  They said that they 
already have more than adequate land at the 
existing site for significant plant expansion. 
 
 
7.(SBU-BUS SENS) A young, yet successful and 
quickly rising, member of a Diyarbakir integrated 
textile firm which is entirely owned by a 
prominent Kurdish family told PO in late January 
that he had visited Iraq twice recently and found 
it highly underdeveloped.  Nevertheless, seeking 
early access to projected later growth sectors, 
he wanted to buy a currently empty entire textile 
factory in Kirkuk and added that he was willing 
to buy all northern Iraqi cotton output for 2004 
to get the plant running. He projected that he 
could employ up to 400-500 people should he be 
able to complete the sale.  He said that 
completing the transaction was still unclear 
because his family found it somewhat \"disloyal\" 
for him to invest in Iraq now because the 
southeast Turkish economy was suffering so. 
Nevertheless, he said that he had found a good 
Iraqi lawyer to \"work the system in northern 
Iraq\" and would proceed over family whisper 
dissent if he could find adequate trustworthy 
Iraqi management for the enterprise and a manner 
to secure a durable business license and 
transparent tax treatment.  He also strongly 
stressed his desire to see at least the U.S. 
import Iraqi-source textiles on a quota-free 
basis. 
 
 
8.(SBU-BUS SENS)  In the interim, he said that he 
was starting a northern Iraqi-based water 
bottling business, even though he had little 
experience in the sector, in conjunction with a 
more experienced Turkish partner.  He said that 
he found a suitable source when looking for 
textile factory sites during a November 2003 
visit to Iraq. 
 
 
9.(SBU-BUS SENS)  A Cizre local contact presented 
another side of the Iraqi border trade to PO 
recently.  He said that the heavy truck traffic 
heading into/out of Habur Gate had heavily 
damaged area roads and created environmental 
damage, including major air and water pollution. 
(Comment:  Silopi and Cizre municipal officials 
and local travel corroborate this statement. End 
Comment)  This contact also noted that local 
traders now have to pay \"rich businessmen\" for 
the right to carry a legitimate cargo into Iraq 
in order to buy low-cost Iraqi fuel to bring back 
to Turkey to sell on the gray market. Given 10-12 
day transit times through Habur and the 100 
dollar a load \"cargo access fee\" supposedly 
involved, he said local truckers were getting by 
on perhaps 500-600 dollars a month, much of which 
they had to spend on food and board in Iraq 
waiting to clear lengthy Turkish customs 
procedures on each trip. He said that this was 
deepening the \"rich-poor divide\" in deep 
southeast Turkey and building resentment at the 
border trade situation.

SUBJECT:  ADANA MAYOR VISITS THE NEW 
CONSULATE 
 
REF: ADANA 0017 
 
 
1. (SBU) On January 30, incumbent Adana Mayor 
Aytac Durak paid a courtesy call on the PO.  The 
Mayor expressed total confidence in his victory 
in the upcoming municipal election no matter 
which party finally placed him on its ticket (see 
reftel).  For weeks, officials close to the Mayor 
repeatedly expressed confidence in Durak\'s 
nomination by AK Party, despite press reports to 
the contrary.  Again, on the margins of this 
meeting, his advisor stated that it was 90% sure 
that AK Party would announce his nomination 
shortly after the Sacrifice Bayram (the first 
week of February). 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Durak related to the PO that politics 
in Adana and Mersin was more personality-based 
than other cities in the Southeast.  For example, 
the Mayor pointed out that DEHAP could run just 
about anyone in Diyarbakir and win.  In contrast, 
Durak recounted, that in the 1999 election, MHP 
took the Adana parliamentary election with a 
large majority, but he won the mayoralty running 
on the ANAP ticket.  According to Durak, voters 
in Adana just don\'t follow parties blindly like 
they do in other cities; they follow 
personalities. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) The Mayor expressed dissatisfaction 
with the Adana electoral structure.  Although he 
is mayor of the Buyuksehir Municipality, it 
contains two sub-municipalities, Seyhan and 
Yuregir.  The sub-municipalities elect their own 
mayors, who according to Durak, sometimes work 
against him.  This, he explained, made it 
difficult for him to efficiently manage the city 
overall (Note: For example, the Consulate must 
work with the Yuregir sub-municipality, where it 
is located, to improve the adjacent road. 
However, the Consulate must request assistance 
for connection to the storm system from 
Buyuksehir Municipality. End note).  He also 
noted that because the sub-mayors could be from 
other parties, there was political motivation for 
a lack of cooperation. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The Mayor expressed his apologies for 
his inability to assist post in finding a new 
site.  During a tour of the consulate compound, 
consulate and contractor personnel discussed the 
need for the Consulate\'s connection to the 
municipality storm system with the Mayor\'s 
advisor.  Durak (an experienced contractor 
himself) promised to discuss the possibility with 
municipality engineers (Comment: The Mayor was 
cordial and seemed genuinely willing to assist 
the consulate.  Consulate and contractor 
personnel will follow-up with municipality 
engineers. End comment).

1.(SBU)  Summary:  Southeast Turkey human rights 
contacts report a positive change in  relations 
between GoT authorities in some southeast areas 
and community leaders, but note that 
implementation of recent EU-related reform 
packages has been inconsistent.  Southeast Turkey 
contacts also report the continued desire of the 
majority of the region\'s Kurdish population for a 
general amnesty for PKK/KADEK/KHK .  End Summary. 
 
 
2..(SBU)   Syriac Christian contacts in the 
Midyat region of Mardin province told  AMCONSUL 
Adana PO and Embassy Ankara econoff    that their 
community\'s relations with authorities had 
improved  somewhat in the last few months. 
However,   many issues, such as the continued 
occupation by village guards of abandoned homes 
in the region, prevented the successful return of 
Syriac Christians who fled the region in the 
1990s due to the PKK-related conflict.  .  A 
senior religious leader said that a few people 
were trying to return from western Europe, but 
progress was slow and most efforts were best 
characterized as \"exploratory\" for now.  He  said 
some local churches are being assessed slowly for 
reconstruction or remodeling by their local 
congregation members, but village guards and some 
police are hampering  these  efforts.   Overall, 
community members whom the U.S. diplomats saw 
said that the new reform packages had produced a 
calmer atmosphere in the area, but implementation 
was yet to be forthcoming in any conclusive 
fashion. 
 
 
3.(SBU)   Syriac community and religious leaders 
said  they feel far freer  when visiting Syriac 
communities and monasteries in Syria than they do 
in their own community in Turkey.  They also said 
that the recent thawing of relations with the GOT 
seemed linked to efforts by the prior governor, 
who  departed in December 2003 to assume the 
governorship in Bingol.  Their relationship with 
the new governor is still a question mark.  They 
also noted that many congregation members report 
regularly to community leaders that the real 
force behind  the  pressure on the community 
stems from Army and Jandarma forces, as well as 
their village guard counterparts.  The community 
leaders wondered whether these influences might 
be limiting local Islamic  leaders\' efforts to 
pursue  a more amicable relationship with the 
Syriac community.  They also reflected that 
Islamic leaders from elsewhere in Turkey have 
visited the area\'s Syriac monasteries quite 
openly  in recent years, limiting the religious 
aloofness to a local phenomenon. 
 
 
4.(SBU)  A Diyarbakir human rights NGO contact 
said that little has  changed in the human rights 
situation in the city and province.  He noted 
particular Turkish police (TNP) and Jandarma 
sensitivity to, and physical crackdowns on, 
gatherings of any  groups larger than  5-10 
individuals.  He said  the TNP/Jandarma quickly 
resort to violent disruption of any gatherings in 
Diyarbakir that involve  political speech.   A 
gathering that focuses on social demands, such as 
better housing or health care, usually will only 
be encircled and watched by security forces, but 
the use of a Kurdish word or display of a banner 
denoting a political affiliation is often the 
trigger for a crackdown.  He described the use of 
truncheons and nightsticks, as well as water 
cannons, by security forces as the most 
frequently used recent control tactics. 
5.(SBU)  This same contact said that security 
authorities routinely fail to inform detainees of 
their  right to attorney representation, or only 
do so almost a day after arrest and 
interrogation.  There are also numerous accounts 
in recent months of arrestees being discouraged 
from exercising that representation right when 
requesting it. 
 
 
6. (SBU)  He said that the Diyarbakir Kurdish 
language institute is close to opening its doors 
and will probably be the region\'s largest.  The 
institute will  focus on Kermanji instruction and 
will not feature Zaza education materials.  The 
institute does  not seem to face the zoning 
obstacles encountered by its Sanliurfa 
counterpart recently.  It will  use a curriculum 
drawn from the Istanbul Kurdish language 
institute.  He predicted considerable interest in 
the institute\'s curriculum for written language 
among better-educated Kurds, explaining that this 
group is \"curious after the language has been 
suppressed for the last fifteen years.\" 
Nevertheless, he said that he doubted  many 
parents would seek Kurdish written education for 
their children, opting instead to devote those 
language instruction resources to a foreign 
language, mentioning English and German as 
examples. 
 
 
7. (SBU)  Finally, the contact expressed a broad 
regional Kurdish sympathy for declaration of a 
general amnesty for the PKK/KADEK/KHK .  He said 
there is no way out for the organization without 
an amnesty.  If they are attacked, they will have 
no choice but to use violence, and will choose to 
fight rather than surrender.  He said that he 
feared a return to violence in southeast Turkey 
in the spring because he foresaw the likelihood 
of an attack on the PKK as weather improved in a 
few months.  This prospect deeply concerned him 
and he predicted it would set the region\'s 
development back even further and deepen the 
sense of depression that he said pervades 
southeast Turkey. 
 
 
8.(SBU)  A Cizre/Silopi  religious leader without 
political affiliation who is a longtime Embassy 
and Consulate contact echoed desires for a 
general amnesty for the PKK/KADEK/KHK , saying 
people \"want their children to come back from the 
mountains, but do not want them to betray the 
Kurdish cause to do so.\"  He maintained that few 
PKK/KADEK/KHK  cadres had actually engaged in 
violence and should be welcomed back into  Turkey 
without question.  As for organization leaders, 
he said that they did not deserve to be punished 
severely for their actions either.  \"We should 
just see everyone in the southeast give up their 
arms, go back to their villages and return to the 
fields together now so that we can move on and 
put our past behind us,\" he said.

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL VISIT TO 
ADANA 
 
REF:  ADANA 0017 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Edelman on 
February 10th made his initial visit to Adana. 
Ambassador met with incumbent Adana Mayor Aytac 
Durak to discuss both USG foreign policy and the 
current conditions in Adana.  When the Ambassador 
asked Durak what he considered Adana\'s most 
significant problem, Durak responded that it was 
internal migration.  The Mayor noted no problems 
with the Adana Christian community although there 
is an ongoing investigation into a recent attack 
on a church.  In response to the discussion on 
the 2005 Multifiber Agreement expiration, Durak 
noted that a QIZ including textiles would be 
beneficial to the area.  Ambassador also made a 
courtesy call to Sabanci Mosque and received 
mission briefs at Incirlik Air Base, including 
Iraq support missions.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
 
2.  (SBU) 10th Tanker Base Commander Brigadier 
General Levent Turkmen met the Ambassador and his 
party at the Incirlik Air Base flight line on 
February 10.  Embassy Ankara sent a diplomatic 
note to the TGS requesting meetings with Turkmen 
and 6th Corps Commander Lt General Ayhan Tas but 
the meetings were not approved.  Ambassador 
departed the flight line with 39th Air Base Group 
Commander Col William MacLure for a mission 
briefing. 
 
 
3.  (SBU) Ambassador met with incumbent Adana 
Mayor Aytac Durak later on February 10 to discuss 
the current political and economic scene 
conditions in Adana.  Durak opened by noting area 
interest in the ongoing UN talks in New York 
regarding Cyprus.  When the Ambassador stressed 
that the US strongly supports a Cyprus solution 
before the Greek Cypriot EU accession in May, 
Durak remarked that it was unfortunate that past 
Cyprus policy had been not been more favorable to 
the Turkish side.  The Mayor noted the importance 
of a stable Iraq since it was Turkey\'s southern 
neighbor and that the southeast Turkish region 
was watching developments there closely. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The Mayor is currently up for 
reelection in a very active campaign, but has yet 
to declare his political party affiliation (see 
REFTELs).  Durak remained confident that he would 
win in any case, but he preferred to belong to 
\"the strongest party possible\" (Comment: Mayor\'s 
advisors assure consulate personnel that Durak 
will run as an AK Party candidate.  AK Party 
remains silent on Durak\'s candidacy. End 
comment).  The Mayor expressed concern that once 
re-elected he would continue to experience 
difficulty working with the sub-municipalities 
(Yuregir and Seyhan) on the City Council.  Durak 
went on to explain that, if he belonged to the 
strongest party, he could direct Seyhan and 
Yuregir more effectively.  He gave the example of 
gecekondus he had observed near the Consulate 
(new Consulate now is located in Yuregir 
municipality).  When visiting the Consulate, 
Durak told PO that he would like to do something 
about the illegal structures, but since it was 
Yuregir, he could not control the problem 
(Comment: Consulate has only requested road, 
security, and sewage system improvements;  it has 
not asked that Durak or his Yuregir counterpart 
address the nearby gecekondu.  End comment). 
 
 
5.  (SBU) When the Ambassador asked Durak what he 
considered Adana\'s most significant problem, 
Durak responded that it was internal migration. 
The rich people moved to Istanbul and the poor 
people continue to immigrate from southeastern 
Turkey to Adana, according to the Mayor.  Durak 
noted that this was producing a strain on 
services in the area because, despite the 
predominately agricultural nature of the area 
economy, many of the internal migrants still were 
unemployed and too illiterate to find other than 
agricultural jobs. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) In response to the Ambassador\'s 
discussion of area plans regarding the January 
2005 expiration of the Multifiber Agreement, 
Durak and his advisors offered that a QIZ 
including textiles in Yumurtalik would be 
beneficial to the area.  Only one of the Mayor\'s 
advisors (an experienced businessman who handles 
Durak\'s press affairs) responded with an 
understanding of the need for Adana textile 
manufacturers to move up the value chain.  The 
advisor noted that there was a need to 
manufacture higher quality higher value-added 
apparel because in the production of bulk cloth 
and low quality apparel few countries could 
compete with China. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) When the Ambassador asked the Mayor 
about the situation in Adana for religious 
minorities, the Mayor responded that there was a 
very small community in Adana.  Most of the 
Christians are in Mersin or Iskendurun, he said. 
Durak did not mention any problems (Note: 
Recently there was a molotov cocktail thrown at 
an Adana church, causing only superficial damage 
to the faade, which is still under 
investigation. Durak did not appear to be aware 
of the incident.  End note).

TAGS: ECON, ADANA 
SUBJECT:  SE TURKEY\'S INITIAL REACTIONS TO 
NEW ECONOMIC INCENTIVES\' LAW 
 
 
l. (SBU) President Ahmet Necdet Sezer  approved 
an \"economic incentives\" law 
on January 29, 2004, which grants tax and 
insurance privileges, as well as energy support 
and free land, to regional investor in an effort 
to increase employment opportunities in eastern 
and southeastern Turkey. 
 
 
2. (SBU) According to a statement released by the 
Presidential Press Office, the law 
has been printed in the Official Registry as of 
February 6, 2004. The Law grants these privileges 
to all cities with less than $1,500 per capita 
annual income as of 2001. The free land provision 
includes all cities with less than $1,500 per 
capita income and special economic development 
areas. Thirty-six cities are going to benefit 
from this law. Incentives in these cities include 
provisions that  new employees and workers 
employed since October 2003 will  pay only 20 
percent of their required taxes.  The Treasury 
will pay the insurance premiums of all new 
employees. For other regions,  the Treasury will 
pay 80 percent of the insurance costs. 
 
 
3.(SBU) Firms which employ at least 10 people in 
these 36 cities will be allocated free Treasury 
or state lands. In order to receive the free 
land, the firm has to employ the agreed number of 
employees for five years.Energy support for 
investors will be provided until 2008.  The 
Treasury will pay 20 percent of the electricity 
costs of firms which employ at least 10 people 
and are in the mining production, greenhouse, 
animal, tourism, education or health sectors. 
Every additional employee above ten will increase 
the rate paid in the electrical subsidy by half a 
point. Public sector enterprises will benefit 
from energy support, but not insurance subsidies. 
Firms operating in free-trade areas will also 
receive tax and insurance incentives. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.(SBU)  Of 36 affected cities, 14 are in the 
Adana Consular District:  Malatya, Diyarbakir, 
Osmaniye, Batman, Sanliurfa, Mardin, Adiyaman, 
Van, Bingol, Mus, Siirt, Bitlis, Hakkari and 
Sirnak. Conspicuous by its absence is the 
southeast province of Tunceli which Consulate 
Adana initially estimated would meet the low per 
capita income threshold for this initiative. 
However,  upon consultation with Tunceli Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry General Secretary, Adana 
Consulate found out that reason why Tunceli was 
excluded from this list  because its per capita 
annual income was $1,584. 
 
 
5.(SBU)  Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
officials in southeast Turkey found 
the recently passed Economic Incentive Bill 
positive but inadequate. They said the 
majority of the western entrepreneurs who would 
like to benefit from these incentives 
would not go to their cities, but rather to 
Duzce, which also receive regional subsidies, 
because of its proximity to their existing 
investment in Istanbul. If there had been a 100 
percent investment and tax exemption in the 
region, then the businessmen said that they might 
attract either foreign direct investment  or 
shifting domestic investment to the southeast 
Turkey region. They also said that the Incentive 
bill would have been more useful if it had 
offered some concessions on provincial and 
sectoral bases. Generally, they expect some small 
scale investments from  businessmen already 
active in the southeast region. 
 
 
6.(SBU) One notable new domestic investment 
possibility emerged in Sanliurfa province, 
Mr. Ismail Demirkol, Sanliurfa Chamber of the 
Commerce and Industry, President said that, after 
endorsment of the bill, he was called by 
unspecified businessmen in the Istanbul garment 
sector  who said that they would like to do some 
research on starting new garment factories in 
Sanliurfa. Mr. Demirkol believes such factories 
would contribute to mitigating the significant 
unemployment problem in the region. 
 
 
COMMENT: The IMF sought to eliminate these 
investment incentives as part of the 
broader tax reform effort, but accepted a 
compromise incentive package in the face of the 
Prime Minister\'s insistence.  There is 
considerable skepticism among Fund and World Bank 
staff that these incentives will result in 
significant new investments in the poorer 
parts of Turkey, but senior government officials 
in Ankara are convinced they are essential to the 
region\'s development.

Adana. Vice American Consul Deborah Hart, Adana Governor Kemal 
Onal, Adana Mayor Aytac Durak, and the Cukurova University 
Rector inaugurated the exhibition together. The photographs will 
be displayed in Ankara afterwards. 
 
 
CUMHURIYET: In Mardin, Dargecit (township) Mayor Suleyman Anik, 
elected from Democratic Force\'s Union under SHP, was 
apprehended, together with his wife at their house for alleged 
membership to an outlawed organization. One unlicensed weapon 
and prohibited publications were found in Anik\'s house. Anik\'s 
wife was released after the interrogation, but Anik was put in 
Midyat prison for \"membership in the organization.\" The Mardin 
Governorate announced that Anik\'s relationship with 
PKK/KONGRA-GEL had been discovered in the documents seized 
during the Mardin Provincial Jandarma Command\'s operations in 
rural Dargecit. The announcement stated that Anik had served as 
mayor in Dargecit some time ago, and that he was arrested on 
September 23, 1991, for his relationship with PKK and that he 
was released subsequently on October 24, 1991. Anik then sought 
asylum in Sweden in 1992. He was stripped of Turkish citizenship 
in 2001, but, with a (later) Cabinet decision, he regained his 
Turkish citizenship in 2002. Anik has dual citizenship.

ADANA ATM BOMBING 
 
 
1.  (SBU)   According to the TNP, there was an explosion at the 
ATM machine for the Pamuk Bank located in north Adana in the 
vicinity of Turgut Ozal Boulevard, 100 meters from post\'s three 
officer residences, on April 21.  An unidentified person used a 
plastic water bottle to contain an explosive material, probably 
fuel, to create an improvised explosive device (IED).  A lit 
cigarette was left in the IED to ignite the flammable material 
and it was then left in the ATM booth.  A journalist went into 
the ATM booth to use it, noticed the device and ran out.  It 
exploded shortly thereafter, destroying the ATM booth.  There 
were no reported injuries. No one has claimed responsibility for 
the bombing. Police hypothesize, based on proximity to a May 1

IED (reports varied) attacks in southeast Turkey in late 
March/early April similar to those in the March 8 Gercus, Mardin 
province attack..  We heard from a credible Mardin province 
contact of a remotely detonated IED/mine attack on Jandarma 
vehicle patrols near Seyhahmet kalesi in south Mardin about 3 
weeks ago. Similarly, a different credible contact reported 
hearing of a similar attack in Siirt province, near Eruh 
township, in the last 2-3 weeks. When traveling last week in 
south Batman province, near Gercus, officers observed  Jandarma 
patrolling using heavy 6-wheeled APC\'s with all personnel but 
the driver sitting on top of the APC in improvised sandbagged 
positions with machine guns ready. This deployment suggested 
that the Jandarma continue to take such a mine-like attack 
threat seriously.

SUBJECT: SE TURKEY ECONOMY LINKED TO TEXTILE CHANGES, IRAQ 
 
1.(SBU-BUS SENS)   Summary:  Southeast Turkey\'s economy 
continues to be slow and characterized by underemployment.  A 
few stronger regional companies, such as SANKO GROUP and several 
Adana/Mersin construction companies, have repositioned 
themselves to do business in Iraq or make new investment to 
adapt to international competition. The container/bulk port in 
Mersin and fuels terminal in Iskenderun are healthy, in part 
because of Iraq-related business, as is the parastatal steel 
smelting plant, Is-Demir, in Iskendrun., which is processing 
large amounts of scrap steel from Iraq.  They are, however, 
exceptions to the rule in an economy still largely linked to 
textiles and agriculture. End Summary. 
 
 
Where SANKO GROUP is headed on Textiles 
 
 
2. (SBU BUS) The SANKO GROUP announced on March 20 that it will 
invest USD 75 million in Adiyaman province under the new 
incentive law to build three new factories to expand its yarn 
and ready-wear capacity in textiles.  According to Abdulkadir 
Konukoglu, the first factory will be ready next year and will 
employ 1,500 people, with two more factories coming by 2007. 
The last two factories\' employment potential is unknown. 
 
 
SANKO Getting Leaner in Process 
 
 
3. (SBU SUS SENS)  Konukoglu in another discussion told PO that 
Sanko had reached full capacity at its existing Gaziantep site 
and needed to expand elsewhere to maintain its competitive 
position.  He saw the Adiyaman investment as important to 
raising SANKO\'s manufacturig productivity as the expiration of 
the Multi-Fiber Agreement approaches in 2005.  While the 
Adiyaman investment will introduce 150,000 yarn spindles to 
SANKO\'s industrial base, SANKO will gradually retire a similar 
number of older spindles from its older plant in Gaziantep, 
shedding approximately 800 jobs by 2007 in the process.  By 
2007, SANKO will therefore have retained its existing 500,000 
spindle manufacturing base, but created growth room (in 
Adiyaman) and increased labor productivity. 
 
 
SANKO Sees Textile Future For Itself 
 
 
4.(SBU BUS SENS)  Konukoglu said competition with Chinese 
textiles after 2005 will be challenging, but he thought that 
SANKO still had lower shipping cost, indigenous cotton supply 
and superior European client relationship advantages to balance 
out lower Chinese cost bases.  He said that SANKO also has 
agents in China looking for clients and joint venture 
opportunities there.  SANKO intended to keep moving up the 
product value chain to retain its competitiveness, he said, 
mentioning how Chinese products would not be in direct 
competition with SANKO products for at least several years. By 
then, he anticipated that Chinese WTO compliance especially 
unfair labor practices; economic shocks; textile market shifts; 
and greater Chinese financing costs once state banks became 
insolvent would create a more transparent and more level playing 
field for Turkish-Chinese textile competition, especially in 
Europe, but even so for some North American markets.  He 
anticipated that SANKO, with its large established European and 
North American customer base (LEVI\'s, e.g.), flexible product 
lines attuned to client needs and deep pockets could make it 
through the difficult transition years of 2005-2008, but he 
doubted many other Turkish companies would be able to do 
likewise. 
 
 
Meanwhile SANKO joining up with China on other businesses 
 
 
5.(SBU SUS SENS)  He added that SANKO, already a distributor of 
Chinese brand HAIER appliances and electronics, was expanding 
its distribution channels for the brand.  He said that he had 
been impressed with the brand\'s product quality for several 
years, but now saw that they were bringing \"new technology, 
really good stuff\" to the market that would challenge Turkish 
local appliance producers, Japanese brand license products and 
European perennials.  \"They have turned a corner at HAIER and we 
want to expand our business with them,\" Konukoglu said. 
 
 
Turkish Construction doing business in Iraq~ 
 
 
6.(SBU BUS SENS) On the margins of a recent Iraq reconstruction 
conference, we discussed ongoing business with several 
Adana-based construction firms.  They noted that the 
construction business was still in a downturn in southeast 
Turkey, but that they had tried to make up for te slow economy 
here with construction jobs for the U.S. in Iraq.  One 
construction company, Kulak construction, has completed about 
USD 15 million in projects in Iraq and projects that it could 
deliver almost USD 40 million in construction contracts by the 
end of 2004.  Its work is primarily centered at the Balad CAMP 
ANACONDA area near Baghdad.  Another company, ER-KA Limited, 
said that it had done several million dollars of construction 
for the U.S. in Kirkuk and now was regularly supplying several 
hundred thousand dollar apiece supply contracts to U.S. military 
consumers in Iraq for telecommunications, vehicle fleet 
maintenance and logistics. 
 
 
But still wary about diving in with two feet 
 
 
7.(SBU BUS SENS)  Most southeast Turkish business contacts said 
that they were interested in pursuing further subcontract work 
in Iraq, but were still very concerned about security and asset 
protection. They said that the security instability made 
projects risky for their employees, hard to deliver according to 
contract timelines and quality levels and posed sometimes 
unacceptable risks to their assets, for which insurance was 
largely unavailable.  They also said that the widespread 
requirements for bid bonds at project levels of USD 5 million 
and above was discouraging, since Turkish banks were hesitant to 
participate in that market and they rarely held sufficient 
capital to finance such requirements internally. 
 
 
Iskenderun Busy with Fuel and Steel 
 
 
8.(SBU BUS SENS) The Iskenderun area in Hatay province is also 
faring well because of investment by Tosyal steel to expand its 
roll steel capacity and the increase in scrap steel processing 
largely from Iraq at nearby parastatal steel smelting plant, 
Is-Demir.  The fuels terminal in Iskenderun is also handling 
much of the transloading for humanitarian and increasingly some 
key U.S. force operational fuels bound for Iraq.  Some local 
contacts note that employment is increasing by at least several 
hundred jobs in Iskenderun because of the steel sector 
expansion, but note that most money from fuel purchases \"only 
goes to Istanbul where the companies operating the Iskenderun 
terminals have their headquarters.\" The fuel terminal operation 
at Iskenderun does seem to be enjoying higher productivity 
because of Iraq-related business.

(SBU) Southeastern Turkey has seen an increase in violent 
clashes since the beginning of May. Both local and international 
community contacts residing in, or operating in, Van and Sirnak 
provinces told AMCONSUL ADANA that Jandarma in Van, Hakkari, 
Siirt and Sirnak provinces are in a defensive posture following 
a string of recent probable PKK/KONGRA GEL attacks, 
predominantly with remote-detonated land mine attacks or 
improvised explosive devices (IED) (REF A).  They also note that 
locally assigned Interior Ministry officials in those provinces 
have become very gloomy and detached from contact with local 
community representatives, as well as very suspicious of any NGO 
or internationally linked development activity.  One contact 
noted that many friends of his in Sirnak and Siirt province 
villages now fear the return of nineties-era violence in 
southeastern Turkey.  They also note tensions between the Sirnak 
governate and the province\'s Jandarma leadership as the former 
tries to reduce the scope and mission of the provincial village 
guard system. 
 
 
2. (SBU)  One contact reported stumbling into freshly-dug, 
presumably PKK/KONGRA GEL, underground bunkers and hideouts in 
the last few weeks in southern Van province, in the vicinity of 
Baskale sub-provincial region, in areas where Jandarma 
reportedly does not choose to patrol because of reported 
concerns about ambushes.  A different contact reports multiple 
stories from villagers in mountainous Hakkari and Sirnak 
provinces (on the border with Iraq) of regular weekly PKK/KONGRA 
GEL transiting groups and logistic shipments.  \"They keep moving 
people from Iraq across the border into new mountain hideouts 
people up there say,\" noted the contact. Another contact reports 
strong \"informal discouragement\" by Jandarma of UNHCR proposals 
to perform monitoring missions in more remote areas of Sirnak, 
Siirt and Hakkari provinces because of strong security concerns. 
 
 
 
 
3. (SBU)  There was a June 3 attack in a rural Hakkari district 
on a Jandarma sub-station which a local contact reported 
destroyed a Jandarma armored personnel carrier and injured 
several Jandarma members.  It did not, however, result in the 12 
casualties claimed by a Kurdish cause-sympathetic Internet 
outlet.  Similar attacks reportedly occurred also on June 3 in 
Tunceli and Diyarbakir provinces.  AMCON ADANA cannot confirm 
the details of these two attacks or any casualty figures. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Several UNHCR contacts also reiterated that they were 
concerned about potential organized violence directed at their 
southeastern Turkey offices and/or personnel since a recent 
Iraqi-origin fatwa reportedly specifically encouraged 
UN-oriented violence in the region.  They considered those 
likely to respond to such a fatwa to lie outside KONGRA GEL 
membership, but wondered whether a splinter PKK/KONGRA GEL group 
might still be motivated to target the UN due to the fatwa\'s 
encouragement, a regional alliance with an Iraqi group, or 
fundamentalist sympathy. (Comment: PKK/KONGRA GEL is a leftist 
organization, so fundamentalist sympathy is unlikely; a desire 
for allies, however, may be more realistic.  End Comment.) 
 
 
5.(SBU) Most of the recent attacks have been in rural or village 
areas, although the attack narrowly averted on May 28 in Adana 
occurred downtown in a large population center.  It was the 
first such attack in Adana since an October 15, 2003 alleged 
PKK/KONGRA GEL-linked attack on a Jandarma minibus in the 
Kurkculer suburb of Adana (REF B). 
 
 
6. (SBU)  Local contacts report that PKK/KONGRA GEL is targeting 
\"traditional targets\" in its latest wave of attacks, such as 
Jandarma patrols and isolated police stations.  The averted 
Adana attack is an exception to this pattern.  It seems too soon 
to determine whether it marks a shift in PKK/KONGRA GEL 
strategy.  (Comment: Reported PKK/KONGRA GEL arrests in Istanbul 
may lend some additional credence to the argument that the group 
is changing its tactics.  End Comment.) 
 
 
7. (SBU)  There also are two recent reports of civilians killed 
or seriously injured by stepping on landmines or encountering 
unexploded ordnance in parts of regions associated with recent 
KONGRA GEL activity. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Violent attacks by PKK/KONGRA GEL, if they 
continue or accelerate, are likely to result in tighter security 
control in the southeast which could well check progress on 
implementation of the new EU accession reform laws.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: AHMET GUVENER: PROTESTANT CHURCH LEADER ACQUITTED, BUT LATER 
ZONING REVERSAL CLOUDS ISSUE 
 
REF: ANKARA 001717 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:   A Diyarbakir court acquitted Protestant 
church leader Ahmet Guvener on May 12 based on the latest 
constitutional amendments accepted by the Turkish Parliament. 
Guvener faced charges of operating a church in a building 
authorized to be constructed solely as a house, not as a place 
of worship.  Local authorities subsequently denied the church\'s 
zoning application, leaving its legal status in doubt.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GOT INSIGHTS 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) On May 11, consulate personnel met with an official 
from the Diyarbakir Governorate to discuss Diyarbakir Protestant 
Church leader Ahmet Guvener\'s upcoming court hearing.  The 
Diyarbakir 3rd Lower Court charged Guvener with operating a 
church in a building authorized to be constructed solely as a 
house, not as a place of worship.  Previously, on April 2, 2003, 
the Diyarbakir 2nd Felony Court acquitted Guvener of similar 
charges. 
 
3.   (SBU)  The Diyarbakir Governorate official expressed doubts 
about Guvener\'s sincerity.  The official noted that in 
1991,Guvener, a Turkomen Alevi, converted to Christianity.  In 
spite of the doubts, the Governorate official stated that there 
had been no action taken to close the Diyarbakir Protestant 
Church.  Considering the importance of EU harmonization laws and 
Turkey\'s image as a country of religious freedom, the 
Governorate chose to be tolerant and wait for the outcome of the 
court hearing, the official noted. 
 
4.  (SBU)  On May 11, consulate personnel met again with Ahmet 
Guvener to discuss the court hearing.  Guvener stated that he 
applied for building permission in 2001 for a house because at 
that time there was no provision in the zoning law for a place 
of worship other than a mosque.  Subsequently, in December 2003, 
the law changed to allow for zoning for a \"ibadethane\" or place 
of worship (REFTEL).   Guvener explained that he wanted to 
reapply, but that the new law required a 2,500 square meter area 
for a place of worship and he did not believe that the church 
would be able to meet this requirement.  The church leader added 
that, up until the passage of the December 2003 law, the 
Diyarbakir Protestant Church had been compliant in every way 
possible.  Guvener asserted that there were no known complaints 
from residents or businesses in the church neighborhood and that 
the congregation enjoyed a positive relationship with the local 
neighborhood. 
 
COURT CASE -  CRIMINAL ACQUITTAL 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  On May 12, consulate personnel attended Guvener\'s 
court hearing at the Diyarbakir 3rd Lower Court.  Foreign 
spectators crowded the small courtroom, including members of the 
South African Church Union, the Compass Direct Middle East 
Bureau Chief (a Christian press organization), a German resident 
of Turkish descent who is a  member of the congregation, and the 
American citizen Diyarbakir Protestant Church pastor.  Guvener\'s 
lawyer showed up ten minutes late for the 0900 scheduled court 
hearing, accompanied by a representative from a Dutch human 
rights organization.  The hearing commenced about 0920 after a 
further delay while the Compass Direct Bureau Chief sought, and 
was granted, permission to take photographs. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Diyarbakir 3rd Lower Court acquitted Guvener 
based on the latest Constitutional amendments accepted by the 
Turkish Parliament.  Article 90 of the Turkish Constitution 
accepts the superiority of the international law over the 
domestic law.  The Public Prosecutor cited article 9 of the 
European Human Rights Accord, which provides that individuals 
have the right to practice their religion individually or 
collectively, openly, by teaching, practicing, meditating, or 
persuading others in the direction of their religion.  The 
Public Prosecutor found this international law to take 
precedence over the domestic law under which Guvener had been 
charged, and therefore said Guvener\'s actions no longer 
constituted a crime. 
 
ZONING OBSTACLES RE-APPEAR 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (SBU)  Subsequently, on May 17, Guvener\'s church was notified 
that its December 23, 2003 request for rezoning as a place of 
worship had been denied by a Diyarbakir committee which protects 
cultural and historic sites because of the need for places of 
worship to be at least 2, 500 square meters in size.  (Note: 
Guvener\'s church is located opposite an historical Syriac 
Christian church\'s entrance, which is itself hidden by a large 
perimeter wall.  From the street it is not apparent that a 
Syriac Christan site is located there.  Nevertheless, the 
committee has at times maintained that they are trying to 
protect the \"integrity\" of that Syriac site by scrutinizing the 
zoning of surrounding buildings.  End Note.) 
 
8. (SBU)  COMMENT:  The Diyarbakir Governorate official was very 
forthcoming about Guvener\'s case when consulate personnel met 
with him.  The official discussed the details quite openly and 
demonstrated a clear understanding that the outcome of the 
hearing would be seen by observers in both the EU and the US as 
an indication of the state of religious tolerance in southeast 
Turkey. 
 
8.  (SBU) The atmosphere in the Diyarbakir 3rd Lower Court was 
more like a press event than a court hearing, and the presiding 
judge and prosecutor demonstrated unusual tolerance.  The judge 
waited patiently despite the late arrival of Guvener\'s defense 
attorney.  Neither the prosecutor nor the judge placed any 
restriction on the Compass Direct Bureau Chief who wandered 
freely around the courtroom taking photographs throughout the 
entire hearing.  GoT officials in Diyarbakir initially seemed to 
have grasped the international significance of this hearing, 
however their subsequent zoning denial based on a law which 
would also exclude use of the bulk of the province\'s existing 
mosques as places of worship, were it to be uniformly applied, 
leaves the church\'s status once again unclear.  This subsequent 
zoning decision also draws into question GoT commitment to 
implementation of the EU reform package law meant to clear the 
way for free and open worship by all faiths in Turkey.  END 
COMMENT.

REF: A. ANKARA 2884

1. (SBU) Southeastern Turkey has seen an increase in violent 
clashes since the beginning of May. Both local and international 
community contacts residing in, or operating in, Van and Sirnak 
provinces told AMCONSUL ADANA that Jandarma in Van, Hakkari, 
Siirt and Sirnak provinces are in a defensive posture following 
a string of recent probable PKK/KONGRA GEL attacks, 
predominantly with remote-detonated land mine attacks or 
improvised explosive devices (IED) (REF A).  They also note that 
locally assigned Interior Ministry officials in those provinces 
have become very gloomy and detached from contact with local 
community representatives, as well as very suspicious of any NGO 
or internationally linked development activity.  One contact 
noted that many friends of his in Sirnak and Siirt province 
villages now fear the return of nineties-era violence in 
southeastern Turkey.  They also note tensions between the Sirnak 
governate and the province\'s Jandarma leadership as the former 
tries to reduce the scope and mission of the provincial village 
guard system. 
 
2. (SBU)  One contact reported stumbling into freshly-dug, 
presumably PKK/KONGRA GEL, underground bunkers and hideouts in 
the last few weeks in southern Van province, in the vicinity of 
Baskale sub-provincial region, in areas where Jandarma 
reportedly does not choose to patrol because of reported 
concerns about ambushes.  A different contact reports multiple 
stories from villagers in mountainous Hakkari and Sirnak 
provinces (on the border with Iraq) of regular weekly PKK/KONGRA 
GEL transiting groups and logistic shipments.  \"They keep moving 
people from Iraq across the border into new mountain hideouts 
people up there say,\" noted the contact. Another contact reports 
strong \"informal discouragement\" by Jandarma of UNHCR proposals 
to perform monitoring missions in more remote areas of Sirnak, 
Siirt and Hakkari provinces because of strong security concerns. 
 
 
3. (SBU)  There was a June 3 attack in a rural Hakkari district 
on a Jandarma sub-station which a local contact reported 
destroyed a Jandarma armored personnel carrier and injured 
several Jandarma members.  It did not, however, result in the 12 
casualties claimed by a Kurdish cause-sympathetic Internet 
outlet.  Similar attacks reportedly occurred also on June 3 in 
Tunceli and Diyarbakir provinces.  AMCON ADANA cannot confirm 
the details of these two attacks or any casualty figures. 
 
4. (SBU) Several UNHCR contacts also reiterated that they were 
concerned about potential organized violence directed at their 
southeastern Turkey offices and/or personnel since a recent 
Iraqi-origin fatwa reportedly specifically encouraged 
UN-oriented violence in the region.  They considered those 
likely to respond to such a fatwa to lie outside KONGRA GEL 
membership, but wondered whether a splinter PKK/KONGRA GEL group 
might still be motivated to target the UN due to the fatwa\'s 
encouragement, a regional alliance with an Iraqi group, or 
fundamentalist sympathy. (Comment: PKK/KONGRA GEL is a leftist 
organization, so fundamentalist sympathy is unlikely; a desire 
for allies, however, may be more realistic.  End Comment.) 
 
5.(SBU) Most of the recent attacks have been in rural or village 
areas, although the attack narrowly averted on May 28 in Adana 
occurred downtown in a large population center.  It was the 
first such attack in Adana since an October 15, 2003 alleged 
PKK/KONGRA GEL-linked attack on a Jandarma minibus in the 
Kurkculer suburb of Adana (REF B). 
 
6. (SBU)  Local contacts report that PKK/KONGRA GEL is targeting 
\"traditional targets\" in its latest wave of attacks, such as 
Jandarma patrols and isolated police stations.  The averted 
Adana attack is an exception to this pattern.  It seems too soon 
to determine whether it marks a shift in PKK/KONGRA GEL 
strategy.  (Comment: Reported PKK/KONGRA GEL arrests in Istanbul 
may lend some additional credence to the argument that the group 
is changing its tactics.  End Comment.) 
 
7. (SBU)  There also are two recent reports of civilians killed 
or seriously injured by stepping on landmines or encountering 
unexploded ordnance in parts of regions associated with recent 
KONGRA GEL activity. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Violent attacks by PKK/KONGRA GEL, if they 
continue or accelerate, are likely to result in tighter security 
control in the southeast which could well check progress on 
 
ADANA 00000067  002 OF 002 
 
 
implementation of the new EU accession reform laws.  End Comment. 
 
9. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

REF: REFTEL: ADANA 0067 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Four recently released former DEP deputies, 
including Leyla Zana, kicked off a five-day tour of southeast 
Turkey on June 12 with a Diyarbakir rally attended by tens of 
thousands of enthusiastic supporters.  The four deputies called 
for a six-month extension of PKK/Kongra Gel\'s recently 
discontinued ceasefire and urged Turkish authorities to \"regain 
the militants in the hills and prisons.\"  Diyarbakir DEHAP mayor 
Osman Baydemir called for a general amnesty for PKK/Kongra Gel 
and an immediate ceasefire when welcoming the group.  Meanwhile, 
PKK/Kongra Gel continued its accelerated terror expanding 
infiltration into urban areas in two provinces while continuing 
to provoke violence in rural areas.  End Summary. 
 
Released former deputies go on eastern Turkey tour 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU)  Four recently released former DEP deputies - Leyla 
Zana, Orhan Dogan, Hatip Dicle and Selim Sadak - kicked off a 
five-day tour of southeast Turkey on June 12 with a rally in 
Diyarbakir attended by approximately 20,000 to 30,000.  The four 
deputies called for both a six-month extension of the PKK/Kongra 
Gel recently discontinued ceasefire and Turkish authorities\' 
efforts to \"regain the militants in the hills and prisons.\" 
Diyarbakir DEHAP mayor Osman Baydemir called for a general 
amnesty for PKK/Kongra Gel members and appealed for an immediate 
ceasefire and \"peace throughout the region.\" The four continued 
their tour to large and small cities from Mardin to Van. DEHAP 
(DEP successor party once removed) Chairman Tuncer Bakirhan 
accompanied the group on their regional tour.   Diyarbakir Mayor 
Baydemir later in the week called for a fresh regional approach 
from  the AK Party government , which he claimed had left the 
\"Kurdish question\" on a back burner since AKP\'s election. 
 
 
Meanwhile PKK/Kongra Gel extends attacks into urban areas 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.(SBU)  There was a June 12 terror attack on a sub-governor\'s 
residence in Gercus, Batman province, which probably killed one 
TNP member and likely two alleged PKK attackers, while wounding 
several others.  Then, on June 13, two probable PKK/Kongra Gel 
attackers, reportedly using hand grenades (Comment: local 
contacts reported that press reports of use of \"rockets\" was 
inaccurate. End Comment.), attempted to attack a Jandarma social 
club.  Both attackers reportedly were killed in the ensuing 
clash.  Also, on June 13, probable PKK/Kongra Gel reportedly 
used a command-detonated landmine (comment: it may have been an 
improvised explosive device (IED), too, given credible reports 
of police seizures of C-4 caches in this area recently. End 
Comment.) 
 
4.(SBU) While, until late May, most of the recent violence had 
been in rural or village areas, there is now a clear shift in 
tactics to include targets in urban areas.  A first such urban 
attack was narrowly averted on May 28 in Adana\'s downtown city 
center.  Since then the Gercus and Bingol events confirm the new 
trend, as does the TNP police arrest of eleven additional 
alleged PKK members in Adana on June 14 armed with ten kilos of 
C-4 explosive, whom the TNP says were planning a terrorist 
activity against the Adana Justice Ministry building. 
 
5.(SBU)  Rural violence also continues.  There was an attack in 
Adiyaman June 9, which probably left several security forces 
dead and more wounded, and a probable PKK/Kongra Gel raid on a 
small Jandarma station in one of Bingol province\'s outlying 
district.  Additionally, there were recent attacks in Tunceli 
and Sirnak province between Jandarma and probable PKK/Kongra Gel 
terrorists.  The two most recent events, both in Hatay province, 
one June 14 in Dortyol and, again on June 16 in Hassa, show how 
probable PKK/Kongra Gel militants are trying to destabilize a 
wide swathe of southeast Turkey. 
 
How this is playing in region 
----------------------------- 
 
6.(SBU)  Local contacts in southeastern Turkey told political 
LES this week that they are relieved by the release of the four 
former deputies, whom they considered to have been imprisoned 
unjustly.  They said that the Kurdish community in the region is 
energized by the group of four\'s presence among them in open 
gatherings and expressed hope that the group can form the 
nucleus of a movement to change a dynamic which they otherwise 
fear could be headed toward renewed region-wide violence. 
Contacts also express disappointment in the face of continuing 
PKK/Kongra Gel attacks in the region.  Following the recent 
attacks, Batman local community leaders, including the province 
DEHAP chairman, expressed their condolences to State security 
officials, while some local residents visited the Gercus 
sub-governors residence and victims\' families in Batman to 
express their condolences personally. Batman merchants staged a 
silent protest against the recent violence in Batman through 
shop closings.  Tunceli mayors called for an end to violence and 
expressed hope for regional reconciliation. Regional business 
leaders express concern that the region\'s economy, already very 
weak, will deteriorate further and one Diyarbakir business 
contact reported already hearing of the postponement of a 
long-hoped-for agro-industry investment in the province, as well 
as a hospital construction plan\'s postponement.  Baydemir held a 
business council on June 16 to assess publicly the most recent 
business trends in Diyarbakir and elsewhere in southeast Turkey. 
 
 
7.(SBU) Comment: The mood in the Kurdish community has been 
buoyed by the former deputies\' release and spontaneous 
celebrations have occurred in many major southeastern Turkish 
cities throughout the past week.  The former deputies, as well 
as Baydemir, seem interested in playing an intermediary role in 
the southeast region posting negotiations with Terrorists which 
seek to raise the profile of \"the Kurdish question\" on the 
national agenda.  DEHAP, smarting from losses in spring 
municipal elections, also is eager to try to show leadership to 
its discouraged Kurdish regional political base.  In discussions 
in recent months with consulate officials, GOT representatives 
in the region have dismissed prospects for another round of the 
\"return to home law\" which was relatively fruitless in late 
2003, let alone the general amnesty advocated directly by 
Baydemir and at least indirectly by the former deputies. 
Bakirhan\'s descriptions this week in press interviews of DEHAP 
as \"equidistant\" between the Turkish state and PKK/Kongra Gel 
has also angered officials in Ankara because it did not condemn 
the PKK/Kongra Gel\'s use of terror.  PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan and 
Turkish General Staff Chief General Hilmi Ozkok have been quick 
to express this anger publicly this week. 
 
8. (SBU) (Comment, cont\'d) For now, GOT forces have been 
proportional in their responses to the PKK/Kongra Gel attacks. 
This relative restraint generally has been positively noted by 
the regional Kurdish grass roots leadership.  If PKK/Kongra 
Gel\'s current strategy is to provoke the State into 
disproportionate crackdowns in order to rally its support base 
and active cadres, there could be further intensification of 
terrorism in the region. This deterioration in the security

Turkish-Iranian border illegally, for smuggling purposes, in 
Gelenler village of Baskale, Van province, was killed by Iranian 
soldiers. 
 
9.      Turkiye: Explosives were thrown at a bar in Mazgirt 
township of Tunceli last night. No casualties have been 
reported. During the investigation at the scene, the police

Villagers Communist Army) was written. 
 
10.     Radikal: 2000 villagers from Ordekli village in Hakkari 
province had been compelled to evacuate their village ten years 
ago due to violence in the region. Recently, the Hakkari 
Governorate permitted some of the villagers to return to 
Ordekli, 40 kilometers away from Hakkari. The villagers found 
their houses in a devastated state, and 30 families who returned 
have been living in tents without any potable water, 
electricity, or schools. The state provided only $200 worth 
construction material to each family for building their houses. 
The villagers are trying to survive with the money they make 
from cutting grass for livestock. 
 
11.     Ulkede Gundem: Village guards in  Diyarbakir province 
claim that the Dover Jandarma Station Commader in Dicle, 
Diyarbakir, has been arbitrarily deducting approximately $7 from 
the salaries of 223 village guards. One of the guards, Abdulaziz 
Bildirici, filed charges with the Dicle Public Prosecutor 
against the Jandarma Commander after refusing to pay the 
deduction and subsequently being \"insulted.\" 
 
12.     Ulkede Ozgur Gundem: GOT forces arrested seven persons in 
Cizre, Sirnak province, on July 18. Three of the arrestees are

seizing 21 books and magazines as illegal publications. 
14.     Ulkede Ozgur Gundem: The Bingol Public Prosecutor filed 
charges against the Bingol Human Rights Association Chapter 
President, Ridvan Kizgin, for a statement he made during the 
HRA\'s convention on October 25, 2003 (at that meeting, he said: 
\"Bingol is kept under unique status. Special administrators and 
security officers are assigned to Bingol.\" )   The HRA 
Provincial Secretary, Habibe Feray Salman, is also accused of 
insulting government officials.  The first hearing for both is 
scheduled for September 9, 2004.

This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for August 16, 
2004. Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
CUMHURIYET, ZAMAN, EVRENSEL, TURKIYE, BOLGE: A report by the 
Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crimes Department of National 
Police General Directorate revealed that arms smuggling, which 
had declined after 2000, has increased anew due to Coalition 
Forces\' invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the vacuum of authority in 
Northern Iraq. According to the report, 2,993 persons involved 
in arms smuggling were arrested, and 2,795 pistols and 319 
long-barreled weapons were seized in the past five years. 
CUMHURIYET, YENI SAFAK, MILLI GAZETE: Labor Party Chairman Dogu 
Perincek claimed that the \"Religions and Cultures Park Project\" 
to be implemented in Sanliurfa aimed at the \"Judaization\" of the 
region. Perincek said Israel has agreed to pay $20 million to 
the project provided a synagogue was included in it. The Current 
Justice and Development Party Mayor of Sanliurfa is also 
supporting the project. Perincek added that the project would 
become the site of Jewish and Christian missionaries\' 
activities. Perincek said \"This project forms the cultural leg 
of the United States\' Broader Middle East Initiative. The US 
wants to make the Kurdish populated-Urfa and Kurds its 
collaborators.\" 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: 101 students, 62 male and 39 female, 
enrolled at the Diyarbakir Private Kurdish Language School in 
one day prior to its official opening on August 22. The courses 
will start on September 1, World Peace Day. 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM, EVRENSEL: In Cizre, Sirnak province, Ferhat 
Erincik (10), and Magdur Erincik (9) were killed when they 
played with what was allegedly a military rocket shell they 
found in the Konak Quarter of the town yesterday. 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM, EVRENSEL: PKK guerillas attacked the 
Basakci Jandarma Station in Tunceli on August 15, wounding one 
soldier. A sound bomb placed in the Business Center owned by the 
Tunceli Municipality caused material damages. No casualties have 
been reported. Police detonated a suspicious parcel placed at 
Mameki Bridge, right at the entrance of Tunceli. 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: The Van Migrant Association, VMA, formed a 
\"Legal Commission\" to assist individuals who would apply for 
benefits from the recently passed \"Compensation of Losses 
Stemming from Anti-terror Struggle\" law. VMA demanded that the 
maximum amount of indemnity determined by law be raised from 12 
billion Turkish Liras (approximately $8,300) to 50 billion 
Turkish Liras (approximately $33,500) per case. 384 persons have 
applied to VMA\'s Legal Commission, and VMA officials attributed 
the high number of applicants to the fact that some lawyers were 
demanding up to 25 % of the indemnities for legal services they 
would provide. A similar commission has been set up at Mardin\'s 
Human Rights Association, as well. 
EVRENSEL: The Diyarbakir Human Rights Association\'s President, 
Attorney Selahattin Demirtas, announced that 30-40 houses in 
Germav village of Beytussebab, Sirnak province, were evacuated 
for security reasons on orders from the Regiment Commander. The 
Beytussebab Mayor Faik Dursun confirmed the eviction and added 
that the evacuees were living in tents and plastic shelters 
under very tough conditions.

SUBJECT: SE TURKEY GREETS CHARGE WITH A MIXED REVIEW ON REFORMS 
 
1.  (U) Charge visited Adana and Gaziantep July 29-30 to hear 
from members of the business and non-governmental community 
about developments in the region.  Their views varied widely 
from cautious optimism about democratic reforms to despair at 
the maintenance of the status quo. 
 
Wrongful imprisonment results in compensation... 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2.  (SBU) At a private dinner with human rights activists, an 
Adana-based lawyer shared a story that illustrated the \"two 
steps forward, one step back\" view that most interlocutors 
seemed to share.  (Note:  Presidents of both the Human Rights 
Association and the Human Rights Foundation of Adana declined on 
principle to hold any representational events with the Consulate 
during Charge\'s visit, citing Abu Gharib and America\'s 
\"complicity in inciting violence\" in the Middle East.  End 
note.)   She reported that one of her clients had been jailed 
for close to ten years on charges of supporting terrorists 
before he was eventually acquitted and released.  She applied 
for compensation for his wrongful imprisonment and he was 
awarded some 40 billion Turkish lira (about USD27,000). 
 
...But the law does not always prevail 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) She said that although she had requested more than 
five times that amount for her client, the award of any 
compensation is positive news.  On the other hand, according to 
our contact, the law clearly states that lawyers representing 
such clients are to receive a payment of ten percent of the 
award (on top of the award).  When she approached the judge to 
discuss the procedure for her payment, he told her that he had 
decided the extra ten percent would not be paid since private 
lawyers, in his view, did not need to receive such high fees, 
and that the law (which she physically placed before him) would 
not impact his decision. 
 
4.  (SBU) One Adana NGO leader insisted that despite recent 
amendments to the laws, nothing had changed in the daily life of 
Turkey\'s Kurdish population and moreover, he charged that 
security forces were reacting to violence disproportionately. 
In Mus, for example, he alleged that security forces tortured 
HPG (People\'s Defense Force) terror group members captured in 
June, and mutilated the corpse of another alleged terrorist, 
cutting off his ears after his death.  This individual himself 
had been the target of numerous indictments and expressed his 
anger and despair, with not a word of praise for the EU 
harmonization process.  His voice was unique among interlocutors 
in its bitterness.  Most of the others acknowledged a mixed, but 
generally more positive, atmosphere of gradual progress that had 
been created by recent reforms.  He also alleged that police, 
who now were being more closely scrutinized on pre-trial 
detention conduct and lawyer access, were resorting to beatings 
and pressure on citizens without arrests, or conducting 
\"extra-judicial killings.\"  He cited the police\'s killing of an 
alleged PKK assailant in Adana on May 28 as an example.  TNP in 
that case claim the terrorist was armed and about to shoot when 
they fired on him.  He died of these wounds in the hospital, 
later on May 29. 
 
5.  (SBU) Most human rights activists joined the Adana NGO 
activists in asserting that there would be political instability 
in south-east Turkey \"until the Kurdish question was dealt 
with.\"  They expressed skepticism that the AK Party attached a 
high priority to addressing their regional agenda, as well. 
Some agreed with the notion that Kurdish issues were part of a 
broader group of democratization issues which EU accession was 
putting on Turkey\'s national agenda, such as religious freedom 
for non-Muslims (Christians, Alevis) and women\'s rights.  Others 
asserted that Turkey\'s major political focus in the run-up to EU 
accession decisions in December was \"solving the Kurdish 
question.\" 
 
AK Women:  Our rights are supported 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) In a separate meeting, a diverse group of Gaziantep 
AKP Women\'s Branch activists greeted the Charge with enthusiasm 
and positive news about the role of women in their party. 
Interlocutors included young and middle-aged, veiled and 
unveiled women, and most were involved in positions of 
responsibility ranging from Social Welfare director to Legal 
Affairs advisor.  \"Europeans perceive women in the southeast of 
Turkey to be treated poorly,\" said one, \"but in our homes and 
party, women\'s rights are supported.\" 
 
7.  (SBU) When queried about the weak number of women candidates 
in March local elections, they claimed that it was not party 
policy to keep women out.  Relations among genders within the 
party \"are like men in cars who like to cut women off - normal 
competition,\" said one.  They claimed that most women didn\'t 
have enough experience, and didn\'t want more responsibility 
anyway.  They pointed out that women in Gaziantep have been very 
successful in business, even if they had yet to take off in 
politics (they also highlighted that Gaziantep\'s AKP 
parliamentarian Fatma Sahin was a positive and encouraging 
example for women.) 
 
8.  (SBU) Despite claiming to have insufficient experience, the 
women shared that they played an \"important\" role in the local 
election campaign.  Most went door-to-door, handed out pamphlets 
and got to places that \"men couldn\'t go,\" they said.  One had 
been in politics for twelve years, but insisted she didn\'t want 
to become a candidate (Note: This same activist refrained from 
shaking Charge\'s hand upon his departure.  End note.)  The 
meeting had gone on some 30 minutes when the party\'s local 
Deputy Director (a man) invited himself in and proceeded to 
dominate the meeting, querying the Charge on U.S. policy in 
Iraq.  One of the younger women seemed almost embarrassed by his 
performance; others appeared unphased.  Whether it was his rank 
in the party or his gender, his presence changed the tenor of 
the discussion which he then unabashedly dominated. 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  Charge\'s series of meetings in Adana and 
Gaziantep, which also included outreach to journalists and 
entrepreneurs, provided Consulate Adana\'s contacts what appeared 
to be much appreciated access to a senior Embassy official. 
Participants seemingly relished the opportunity to tell their 
stories to a visitor from Ankara.  The sum total of the tales 
recounted provided some room for encouragement about 
democratization and the human rights situation in the south of 
Turkey, but highlighted the considerable room for improvement 
that still exits.

SUBJECT: DIYARBAKIR\'S DEHAP MAYOR BURNS BRIDGES WITH CONDOLENCE VISIT 
TO PKK MILITANT\'S FAMILY 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  After a nine-day security operation and 
killing of two alleged PKK/Kongra-Gel members reportedly 
involved in a deadly July 28 attack on a Diyarbakir police 
station, greater Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir (DEHAP) paid a 
condolence visit to the family of one of the alleged PKK 
members.  The Diyarbakir Governor\'s Office subsequently 
requested an investigation of Baydemir and four local mayors for 
that visit, citing among other things the Mayor\'s improper use 
of an official vehicle.  In August 11 meetings, DPO relayed to 
Baydemir strong U.S. disapproval of his action, and extended 
condolences on the death of the security guard in the July 28 
attack to Diyarbakir\'s Deputy Governor and Security Director. 
Several human rights contacts in Diyarbakir privately called 
Baydemir\'s condolence visit a mistake, and despite their 
optimism about human rights developments in recent years, all 
are concerned about backsliding on the GOT\'s implementation of 
human rights reforms in the region in the wake of the PKK\'s June 
2004 abandonment of its ceasefire and the tension it has created 
between the people and security forces in the region.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) On July 28, a PKK/Kongra-Gel attack against a police 
station in the Mardinkapi neighborhood of Diyarbakir resulted in 
the death of one security guard and the wounding of two other 
security officers.  The Diyarbakir security directorate 
subsequently launched a nine-day operation to apprehend PKK 
militants who had fled the scene and taken refuge in a wooded 
area just outside the city known as Hevsel Gardens.  During the 
operation, citizens living within the area of the dragnet were 
reportedly blocked from leaving, and non-security personnel were 
prevented from entering the area.  According to Turkish 
officials, the operation netted two PKK militants and three 
individuals charged with abetting the PKK. 
 
The Official View of Events in Mardinkapi 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Diyarbakir Deputy Governor told DPO on August 12 that 
the July 28 attack had been perpetrated against a police station 
some 300-400 meters away from a music festival that had been 
organized that evening.  He claimed that the grenades launched 
at the police had come out of the festival.  He confirmed that 
one security officer was killed in the attack and that at least 
three others were wounded (Note:  In addition to two security 
officers, the wounded included the Deputy Mayor of Sur 
Municipality.  End note.)  While outlining the operation on a 
map, he explained to DPO that forces had surrounded a wooded 
area, used thermal cameras in their search for the perpetrators 
of the attack, and arrested two persons the morning following 
the attack.  The brother of one of the militants was also 
arrested and provided information; two others were arrested for 
providing shelter for the militants.  Despite these five 
arrests, two militants involved in the attack had escaped, he 
said, and for nine days the government called for their 
surrender.  A group of forces organized to comb the area came 
upon them and engaged them in a firefight; the two armed PKK 
members were killed, according to the Deputy Governor, and their 
fingerprints supposedly confirmed involvement in the attack on 
the police station.  (Note: there was no additional information 
provided on how this confirmation was made.  End note.) 
 
4.  (U) On August 9, Turkish dailies reported that Diyarbakir 
Mayor Osman Baydemir (DEHAP) along with mayors of four smaller 
townships had paid a condolence visit to the family of one of 
the PKK members who had fled the attack scene and been killed in 
the operation.  The Diyarbakir Governor\'s Office responded to 
the visit of Baydemir and the other mayors by requesting an 
investigation of the five DEHAP politicians for their action, 
citing among other things their improper use of official 
vehicles for the visit.  The Interior Ministry has also been 
called upon to investigate the case. 
 
The Mayor Makes His Case 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  During a trip that had been scheduled before news of 
Baydemir\'s visit to the PKK member\'s family had surfaced, DPO 
met with the mayor on August 11 to inform him of our strong 
disapproval of his action, and to reiterate that the U.S. 
considers the PKK a terrorist organization and opposes any 
action that appears to support the PKK, especially this case 
where a security officer was killed. 
 
6.  (SBU) Baydemir told DPO that he learned about the Mardinkapi 
incident while participating on a television program.  He 
stressed that under normal circumstances he would have been 
attending the festival that had been organized that evening for 
local singers and that it was only the previous TV engagement 
that prevented him from going.  This is significant, he said, 
because five or six minutes before the explosion at the police 
station cars carrying other local mayors had passed by it. 
There was a lot of activity on the road in the vicinity of the 
police checkpoint that evening, and he questioned \"who was 
really targeted in that attack.\" 
 
7.  (SBU)  After receiving news of the attack, Baydemir claims 
he went to the hospital and visited the wounded security 
officials, expressing his concern.  He stayed for approximately 
one hour, he said, along with other government officials.  He 
claims the family of the guard was there, and he told them he 
shared in their suffering.  He also visited the municipal 
official who had been wounded.  As he exited the hospital, he 
told DPO, members of the press were present and he told them 
while he didn\'t have all the information about the incident, he 
was against all attacks and did not want blood to be shed. 
(Note:  Press accounts have contradicted his account of the 
guard\'s family members being present.  End note.) 
 
8.  (SBU)  Baydemir together with several other local officials 
had plans to travel the following day (July 29) to Tunceli for a 
cultural festival.  The night of July 28 he asked government 
officials if he should stay out at the hospital and in 
Diyarbakir out of courtesy, and they responded that there was no 
need to stay.  He went to Tunceli as planned the following day 
and upon his return two days later he found \"great tension,\" 
especially at the area of the operation.  Baydemir stated that 
he received numerous complaints from citizens inside the area 
affected by the operation about such things as food shortages, 
health problems, and the effect the operation was having upon 
children.  He met with the Diyarbakir Governor in an 
unsuccessful attempt to gain access for himself and NGO 
representatives to the scene of the operation.  \"Normally I 
should be getting information about such operations from the 
Security Directorate,\" he said, underlining that they were 
requesting access to a civilian area.  After being denied access 
by security officials, he claims he spoke with the Minister of 
the Interior, who had been supportive. 
 
9.  (SBU)  After the operation was concluded and news of the 
\"extrajudicial killing\" got out, he said, Baydemir expressed his 
condolences in a visit to the PKK member\'s family and shared 
their grief, asking that this be the final victim.  \"It\'s our 
tradition,\" he said; \"If you don\'t do such a thing you\'ll be 
ashamed.  Crime is an individual thing; it does not belong to 
the family.\"  Baydemir ended his lengthy defense by underlining 
his view that the violence must stop unconditionally.  \"I could 
have been killed that night,\" he pleaded, \"how could you think I 
support that?\"  He stressed that it is difficult to work on the 
underlying problems of poverty and unemployment in a poor 
security environment.  Turkey has shown its preference for the 
EU, he said, and substantial development is taking place in 
democracy. 
 
11.  (SBU)  DPO relayed to Baydemir that:  the U.S. government 
considers the PKK a terrorist organization and PKK members 
terrorists; the EU has also listed the PKK as a terrorist 
organization; and that terror is not a legitimate way to work 
for political, social, economic or cultural rights.  DPO 
informed Baydemir that we oppose any action that even appears to 
support the PKK, especially in the killing of a security 
officer.  Regardless of his intentions, his visit gave that 
appearance, DPO continued, adding that such actions foster 
anger, suspicion and tension, not reconciliation.  Baydemir 
maintained until the end of the meeting that he was \"at peace 
with his conscience.\" 
 
Security Director:  \"All Diyarbakir NGOs tied to PKK\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
----------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) Hours after meeting Mayor Baydemir, DPO called on 
Diyarbakir Security Director Orhan Okur and presented a wreath 
and condolences on the loss of a member of the security 
personnel in the July 28 attack.  DPO reiterated the USG 
position that the PKK is a terrorist organization and told Okur 
of the call on Baydemir, adding that the visit had been used to 
convey a message of strong disapproval for Baydemir\'s action. 
 
13.  (SBU)  Rather than dwelling on the Mardinkapi incident and 
the Mayor\'s controversial visit, Okur - using European Court of 
Human Rights publications and internet postings by human rights 
groups as visual aids - proceeded to lecture DPO about the 
misinformation campaign being waged by NGOs against the 
government.  \"We know Article 17 very well,\" he said, \"It 
prohibits us from violating and limiting rights - don\'t worry 
about our taking care of human rights.\"  But all NGOs in town 
have ties with the PKK, he argued, and he produced two examples 
where NGO reports alleging misdeeds by security forces were 
eventually proved wrong.  Such reports help the PKK and their 
recruitment efforts he said, and are not results of a lack of 
professionalism, but the product of ill-intentioned individuals. 
 
 
14.  (SBU)  Comment:  With this visit, Baydemir overstepped the 
parameters of GOT tolerance for pro-Kurdish activities in the 
Southeast, which have expanded in the past two years.  Even 
contacts at both Diyarbakir\'s activist pro-Kurdish Bar 
Association and in local private business agreed, and said they 
had told the Mayor as much.  Baydemir\'s actions have dimmed any 
potentially positive effect that he might have been able to have 
as a bridge between the Kurdish community and government 
officials, especially given attitudes such as that displayed by 
Security Director Okur and shared by many other officials. 
 
15.   (SBU)  Comment, cont\'d:  Regardless of whether or not the 
charges against him move forward, the press seems intent on 
keeping this issue alive and Baydemir has given them ample fuel 
for the fire. August 16 media reports point to a June 2004 
incident in which Baydemir allegedly dispatched a municipal 
ambulance to retrieve the corpse of a PKK militant after his May 
28 shooting and subsequent death in Adana, bringing the body 
back to Diyarbakir for the burial ceremony.  Such acts, even 
without the use of official vehicles, at best show poor judgment 
and at worst provide comfort and support to a terrorist 
organization.  Contacts ranging from leftist Kurdish human 
rights activists to wealthy local businessmen agreed that the 
past 5 years had felt like \"detente\" and that the human rights 
situation had improved in very important ways (septel).  All are 
now concerned about backsliding on the GOT\'s implementation of 
human rights reforms in the region in the wake of the PKK\'s 
abandonment of its five-year ceasefire and increasing tension 
between the public and security forces about how security forces 
are responding.  In this context Baydemir\'s apparent indulgence 
of the PKK/Kongra-Gel is all the more ill-conceived and 
potentially inflammatory.  Baydemir\'s actions are also a 
discouraging reminder that DEHAP and other regional political 
leaders in the Southeast have not yet found the will to break 
with the PKK.

called for \"real language reform and cultural rights,\" with

in Turkey for their community is little improved. Low scale 
reportedly PKK/KONGRA GEL terror attacks continue across 
southeast Turkey.  Attacks in late July and early August have 
been concentrated in Tunceli, Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin 
provinces, still featuring regular use of land mines or 
improvised explosive devices (IED\'s) (ref. A.)  Reports of

Syriac Christians cite obstacles to village resettlement in 
Sirnak 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------- 
 
2.(SBU) On August 4, PO visited the disputed former Syriac 
community Sari (sometimes called Sarekoye) village in western 
Sirnak province. The Sirnak governor ordered it vacated as of 
late July. It was inhabited by about 150-200 Kurdish villagers, 
almost all of whom were related to the approximately 20 village 
guards working in the village, which sits on a 
locally-significant military location along a major E-W road. 
Villagers expressed a desire to \"co-exist\" with Syriac 
Christians who wish to return and claimed that they had resided 
in the village prior to the 1994 departure of the Syriac 
community.  They showed that they had padlocked the Syriac 
Christian church in the village to prevent damage or looting in 
the Syriac community\'s absence.  Nevertheless, they said that 
since the Sirnak governor\'s departure order, only five of the 
village\'s 30 families had decided to leave and that the other 25 
families were staying, saying that the \"government has not shown 
us where we would go and how we would rebuild elsewhere.\" 
 
3.(SBU)  In later August 4 discussions with senior Syriac 
Christian religious figures, PO was told that the Kurdish 
villager claims to the village were \"all lies.  They were moved 
to Sari in the mid-1990\'s by the Army,\" one contact stressed. 
\"They lived almost 30 kilometers away when our community left. 
The village guards make all their money there illegally 
harvesting wood, tapping the (BOTAS) northern Iraq pipeline, 
which passes nearby, and illegally renting pasture land to 
nomads,\" he said. (Note: AMCON ADANA cannot confirm the ground 
trace of the pipeline with the level of precision confirming 
such a claim would require.  End Note.)  Asked whether they 
thought that the potential Syriac community returnees would 
\"co-exist\" with the existing villagers, the contacts stressed 
that such an option was out of the question, claiming \"Sari is 
ours, always was ours and we want it all back.\"  They did note, 
however, that the broader Syriac Christian community in Mardin 
and Sirnak provinces is comprised of about half exclusively 
Syriac villages and half mixed villages of Kurds, Turks, Arabs, 
Yazidis and Syriac Christians.  (Note: one Syriac community 
contact suggested that Sari also might be a village where one of 
the Syriac Bishop\'s lay staff lived in the past. End Note.) 
 
4.(SBU)  Asked about a Syriac diaspora letter to the diplomatic 
community in which there is mention of Syriac willingness to pay 
75,000 euro to the GOT to ensure the village is vacated, the 
senior Syriac Christian contacts replied that there was genuine, 
albeit reluctant, willingness to meet the Sirnak governor\'s 
proposal, but the governor himself had advised the Syriac 
community not to deposit the funds to date because the villagers 
refused to depart. (Note: the funds would have been deposited in 
a GOT account to support village services devoted to relocating 
the existing village population, according to the Syriac 
contacts.  End Note.)  The senior Syriac Christian contacts 
summed up by saying that the village\'s problems stemmed from a 
combination of village guards who enjoyed the local hegemonic 
position they garnered by occupying the high ground around the 
village and the complicity of local Jandarma, whom they alleged 
had been shielding the villagers from GOT pressure to vacate and 
sharing in the village guards\' revenue-raising endeavors. 
(Note:  The local Jandarma commander reportedly rotated to a new 
assignment in late July and his successor only arrived a week 
ago.  There may be a connection to the timing of the recent 
Syriac diaspora circular on Sari.  Perhaps the Syriac community 
has calculated that this is an opportune time to increase 
pressure on the GOT. End Note.) 
 
Syriac diaspora \"stunned\" by killing in Mardin province 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.(SBU)  Senior Syriac Christian contacts also said that their 
community\'s slow, but steady return to Mardin province in the 
last year has been stunted by the July 15 killing of a Syriac 
Christian head man or muhtar in a village near Dargecit in 
Mardin.  The muhtar was the sole remaining Syriac in the village 
and had been protecting diaspora land rights in the area.  He 
was popular with local Kurds who had elected him to his 
position, despite his de facto minority position in the local 
community.  The contacts claimed that a loyalist Kurdish leader 
in the area who had eloped almost 25 years earlier with a Syriac 
bride and who had tried to use that relationship to gain 
ownership of her diaspora familiy\'s land had persuaded two 
recently-returned young Syriac males to kill the muhtar (through 
an unclear method).  The two subsequently had been arrested and 
convicted for the killing and the local Kurdish leader was 
pressing his land claim again. 
 
6.(SBU)  The senior Syriac Christian contacts then said that the 
effect of the killing on the Syriac diaspora had been 
\"chilling,\" that the community in western Europe had written to 
senior GOT leaders and that \"virtually no one in the community\" 
was considering return to Mardin or Sirnak \"in the present 
circumstances.\" 
 
Lack of Syriac language rights also fuels skepticism 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.(SBU)  Senior Syriac Christian contacts also pointed to the 
lack of an ability to teach Aramaic to their community\'s 
children or see its inclusion or Syriac cultural content in 
public school curriculums in the region as evidence of a lack of 
\"real\" GOT commitment to reform.  \"Nothing has really changed,\" 
the contact said, \"(the GOT) is just scribbling any words on 
paper that they think the EU wants to hear right now.\"  Asked 
whether they had initiated proposals for such native language 
curriculum to the GOT, the contacts said that a small Syriac 
group in Istanbul was trying to develop such a curriculum, but 
the program had just started in the last two months. 
 
DEHAP mayors in Mardin, Sirnak share skepticism 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.(SBU) In August 3-4 meetings with PO, newly-elected DEHAP 
mayors in Mardin and Sirnak provinces, where the party garnered 
the majority of local municipalities, expressed deep skepticism 
that reform implementation would be forthcoming from the GOT. 
When asked for good news, mayors cited reduced reports of 
alleged torture in the last year, attributing this change to 
broader public awareness of the right to an attorney upon 
detention and reduced pre-trial detention times.  However, they 
were quick to continue (in the words of one mayor whose tone was 
echoed by others in different meetings) that \"until the 
government recognizes there is a Kurdish question in Turkey, 
there will never be stability in the (southeast) region.\" 
Mayors pointed to a deep and widespread Kurdish community desire 
to see Kurdish language radio and television broadcast freedoms 
in private and public outlets as a bedrock community milestone 
for reform.  Instead, they said the GOT-trumpeted brief public 
broadcasts of fifteen minutes in Kurdish on state-run television 
are a mere \"token gesture,\" completely undermining any Kurdish 
community confidence in \"real and lasting reform.\" 
 
GOT attitudes are not changing either 
------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU)  One mayor, saying that even more important than \"paper 
change,\" was change in the attitudes of appointed GOT officials, 
described a phenomenon reported more broadly in the region: GOT 
unwillingness to include elected mayors in the governing process 
of their communities.  He said that, since his Spring 2004 
election, only the local sub-provincial Security Director, in a 
brief office call, had acknowledged his election to office.  He 
had been excluded from municipal meetings, not invited to any 
Government officials\' offices and not informed of any decisions 
on municipal matters, which government officials were deciding 
for themselves.  His DEHAP colleagues echoed this same exclusion 
from exercising their office since their respective elections. 
In another example of GOT attitudes limited only to one 
municipality, a mayor showed PO how the local sub-governor had 
delivered to the mayor his new municipal identification card 
with the sub-governor\'s name written in large script across the 
mayor\'s photo.  \"This is how they want to tell me who is in 
charge,\" the mayor said. 
Finally, a Sirnak province DEHAP mayor described his recent 
transit of Diyarbakir two weeks earlier, returning from a 
Tunceli cultural festival, which he said \"was broken up by 
police.\"  He said, when near the Mardin gate of Diyarbakir, a 
\"helicopter was circling over the neighborhood shooting into 
houses.\"  When he said he stopped to ask what was happening, 
police told him the neighborhood was closed and that security 
officials recently had been killed in the area, pressing him to 
continue onward in his travel, which he did.  (Note: this 
account generally tracks with credible reports of the first few 
days of a GOT counter-terrorist operation in that part of 
Diyarbakir city.  GOT helicopter use cannot be corroborated. 
The GOT, however, does have several transport/utility 
helicopters based in Diyarbakir.  End Note.)  He said that the 
experience left him \"feeling discouraged about where the region 
was headed.\" 
 
Another DEHAP mayor arrested after his election 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
10. (SBU)  A Mardin province DEHAP mayor described how he had 
returned from almost a decade of residence in an EU country in 
early Spring 2004 to run for mayor in his home community.  He 
said that, upon his return, no action was taken against him, 
despite his earlier arrest and alleged torture when mayor in the 
same town during the Evren coup-era.  Nevertheless, he said that 
he was arrested by \"the Army and Jandarma\" the night after being 
elected on charges of being a PKK member, which he denied.  He 
said that he was treated humanely when in detention, allowed 
access to an attorney, but questioned \"over and over again by 
Army sergeants with photos of me talking to PKK members in 
Iran.\"  He said that prosecutors and judges whom he saw during 
his few days of detention said to him that his arrest would not 
\"hold up in court,\" but that GOT security forces were 
\"determined to press their case against him.\"  He said that he 
was released after several days and is still now facing an 
ongoing trial.  He told PO that he was not a PKK/KONGRA GEL 
member, but had a close family member in PKK/KONGRA GEL.  He 
said he had flown to Iran from the EU nation to try 
unsuccessfully to persuade him to leave the organization. 
 
11.(SBU)  Asked how things had changed since his return from the 
EU nation, he said that there were fewer reports of torture, of 
which he was pleased, but that the GOT was \"as determined as 
before\" to exclude anything Kurdish from public life.  He said 
that he wanted to see his grandchildren taught Kurdish in 
school, watch a Kurdish-language television show not broadcast 
from Iraq or western Europe (Note: samples of which he switched 
on his television in his office to demonstrate.  End Note.), be 
able to speak Kurdish in public political rallies and meetings, 
and gather at a Kurdish cultural festival without fear of police 
or Jandarma arresting and beating people.  He said that \"those 
days are not here yet.\"  He specifically noted that he wants 
nothing to do with separatism, actively speaks against notions 
of a greater Kurdistan and \"just wants to be a Kurdish citizen 
of the Turkish republic.\"  He also said that there was no 
economy in eastern Mardin, which discouraged him.  He was trying 
to focus on building roads and a children\'s park in his town, as 
well as encouraging grape cultivation for a new Syriac 
community-financed wine production center elsewhere in Mardin. 
 
12.(SBU)  The Mardin province DEHAP mayor echoed Syriac concerns 
about the negative role he sees the continuing village guard 
system playing in village resettlement and regional 
reconciliation.  He said that the village guards were behind a 
July 2004 attack in his town, even though the GOT attributed the 
attack to PKK/KONGRA GEL.  \"It would be the most well-aimed PKK 
attack ever, (Note: from a GOT perspective. End Note.)\" he said, 
\"were the Government to be right.  It shot up the parts of the 
police station where no one was, shooting along the roofline in 
an almost perfect straight line and not knocking out a single 
window or injuring a single person.  All it did was make the 300 
nearby people feel insecure and allow the Government the 
opportunity to assert the continued need for security and 
\'stability measures\' here.  The real winners are the village 
guards.  Without instability, they have no reason to exist.\" 
13.(SBU) No contacts reported increases in the size of the 
village guard forces in their respective communities. Nor did 
they report any new recruitment of village guards.  Some Syriac 
contacts reported community fear that returning diaspora members 
might be pressed into the village guard as a quid pro quo for 
allowing village resettlement, but no one reported that this had 
actually happened.  One contact explained that most returnees 
now are age fifty or older, independent-minded, 
European-educated and wary of GOT authority, and that they 
therefore may not be attractive candidates for the village 
guard\'s cadre in GOT security force opinion. 
 
GOT resigned, hopeful dam project will help 
------------------------------------------- 
 
14.(SBU)  Several sub-governors viewed the region in a more 
detached, almost resigned fashion.  Reflecting on recent 
violence, one Mardin sub-governor said \"that is what happens 
here in summer, but PKK needs to recognize that it has been 
passed up by history and it is out of step with the world order 
since September 11.  It is outmoded and does not know its place. 
 If it keeps using violence, it will be destroyed and people 
will reject it,\" he said.  Another Sirnak sub-governor said that 
\"as long as there is a place (in Iraq) for PKK, they will keep 
attacking us.  We know that.  We will have to deal with them to 
prevent problems (in Iraq) from crossing into Turkey to disturb 
our citizens.  Fighting terrorism is a necessity.  We must be 
strong against it wherever it is.  You cannot deal with it in 
another way,\" he said. 
 
15.(SBU)  Several GOT officials said that they saw the need for 
an expanded economy to \"focus the population\'s energy away from 
violence.\"  Only one had detailed ideas of how that might 
manifest itself - in eastern Mardin province.  That sub-governor 
spoke of the challenges of dry land agriculture, the recent 
importing of pistachios trees to northeast Mardin from Gaziantep 
province, a search for heartier grape varieties for possible use 
in winemaking (Note: he had just transferred in to Mardin 
province from a wine area in the Izmir region.  End Note.), and 
the expected boon to regional employment that will come in 2005 
when the Iliusu dam project starts.  He said that the Iliusu dam 
would be the next extension of the Southern Anatolia Project 
(\"GAP\" in Turkish) and that it would employ 3,000 \"skilled 
workers and two to three times that many unskilled and day 
laborers.\"  \"It will transform this region, bringing water, 
electricity and work,\" he predicted. (Note: The proposed Iliusu 
dam project is highly controversial since it would flood 
historically unique Hasankeyf in Batman province, a site with 
many layers of civilization on the Tigris river, and would 
displace tens of thousands of people.  End Note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
16.(SBU) Comment:  DEHAP Kurds and Syriac Christians are some of 
the GOT\'s staunchest critics.  Contacts from these groups in 
Mardin and Sirnak generally were downbeat about GOT efforts to 
\"deal with the Kurdish agenda\" or embrace religious freedom. 
They were skeptical of GOT sincerity at implementing recently 
enacted reforms.  Syriac Christian contacts, however, gave both 
the Mardin and Sirnak governates \"good marks\" for doing what 
they could to foster Syriac diaspora return to the two provinces 
from western Europe.  They cast most of their criticism at the 
village guard system and its military administration apparatus. 
While the assertions of neither DEHAP contacts nor GOT officials 
about who is behind which recent attack can be accepted without 
due diligence, the observation that forces other than the 
PKK/KONGRA GEL might be behind some of the recent more limited 
scale regional violence bears consideration.  Still, it is not 
credible that village guards would be behind many of the terror 
attacks killing and injuring GOT security forces with land 
mines, IED\'s, or larger-scale force deployments.  End Comment.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
SABAH: A written announcement by the American Embassy in Ankara 
expressed that Turkey did not have a better friend than the 
United States in its twenty years of anti-PKK struggle. The 
announcement said any support to the terrorist organization by 
the Unites States was out of question. The announcement read 
\"With various intelligence, diplomatic and financial measures we 
are engaged in an active effort to limit PKK\'s activities.\" In 
response to interpretations that the visit of U.S. Vice Consul 
Alicia Allison\'s to Diyarbakir Mayor was evidence of support to 
PKK, the announcement said \"There can not be such a thing so far 
from the truth. American officials\' visits to elected political 
representatives are among their ordinary diplomatic activities. 
In addition, Allison told her interlocutors to take a clear 
stance against PKK terrorism, and to avoid undertaking actions 
which could be perceived as supportive of PKK.\" 
RADIKAL, MILLI GAZETE, TERCUMAN, VAKIT: In Hakkari province, a 
remote-controlled mine planted on the road between Yuksekova and

six-person committee was detained by police. The crowd that 
gathered in front of the DEHAP office prior to delivering the 
petitions carried a banner reading \"South, West, East: APO is

province, to attend the opening ceremony of a monument-like tomb 
for high-ranking PKK militant Engin Sincer, who had been killed 
last year in the Kandil Mountains, Northern Iraq, as a result of 
an internal dispute. The Jandarma did not allow DEHAP supporters 
to go to Seyrantepe village, where the monument has been 
erected, on the grounds that all kinds of meetings in 
Kahramanmaras, Turkoglu, and Pazarcik, between August 17-18, had 
been banned. DEHAP supporters, who formed a ten kilometer long 
queue of vehicles, closed the Gaziantep-Narli highway to traffic

announced that they were going to have a burial commemoration 
according to the traditions of the Alevi sect, and that they did 
not have any political objectives. 
MILLIYET: The inspectors from the Interior Ministry did not find 
the Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir, who visited the family of a 
PKK/Kongra Gel militant to express his condolences, guilty. 
Inspectors determined that Mayor Baydemir\'s visit to the family 
in an official vehicle was not contrary to the law. 
CUMHURIYET: In Van province, the Anti-smuggling and Organized

Findik district of Guclukonak, Sirnak province, yesterday. 
Jandarma took the dead bodies to Guclukonak to identify them. 
ZAMAN, ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: 600 people evicted from their houses 
in Ilicak (Germav) village of Beytussebab, Sirnak province, have 
been living in tents under very tough conditions for about a 
month now. The villagers told the visiting Diyarbakir HRA 
Committee that in one case 21 persons were living in one tent. 
Soldiers from the Beytussebab Jandarma Command reportedly told 
villagers that they should move, for security reasons, to the 
right bank of the Ilicak Creek that runs through the village, 
but the villagers unanimously told the HRA Committee that the 
GOT forces evicted them from their houses for having assisted 
and harbored the PKK. They said that PKK militants had not 
visited their village for over a year, but that villagers had 
provided food to the militants in the past out of fear. Some 
women in the tents complained that their children were suffering 
from skin diseases. The Beytussebab Sub-governor Cihan Demirhan 
told the HRA Committee that the villagers had not been forcibly 
evicted, and that they could return to their houses if they 
wanted. 
MILLIYET, HURRIYET: Hasan Tabak, 23, who had managed to escape 
from the highly-secure Kurkculer F-type prison in Adana on May 
7, 2004, was rearrested in Adana. Tabak is being charged with 
attempted murder, and with being a member of a criminal 
organization. Tabak was also involved in a fight after he had 
escaped from the prison. 
VAKIT: Based on a tip, the Jandarma team from Hilvan, Sanliurfa 
province, seized 3.4 kilos of hashish and 2,279 roots of hemp in 
a field in Bahcecik village that belonged to Resat Y., who was 
later imprisoned. 
MILLIYET, HURRIYET: President Bush\'s National Security Advisor 
Condaleeza Rice stated that the United States was doing what it 
could, with non-military methods, to weaken the PKK and make it 
less active. During a speech Rice delivered at a Washington 
think-tank in Washington, in response to a question about 
combating the PKK, she said \"In order to confront the threat 
imposed on Turkey by this irregular force, which we have 
declared as a terrorist organization, we are discussing with 
Turkish authorities about what can be done on both sides of the 
border.\" 
EVRENSEL: In Adana, some NGOs and political parties condemned 
the U.S. attacks in Najaf, Iraq. The demonstrators, who gathered 
in the Inonu Park, carried placards stating \"Do Not Go to Iraq, 
Do Not Shed Brothers Blood,\" and shouted anti-American slogans. 
The Adana HRA Secretary, Ethem Acikalin, claimed that the United 
States is attempting to activate its Broader Middle East Project 
by invading Najaf. 
MILLIYET, ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: With initiative from the 
government, the Radio and Television High Commission (RTUK) 
prepared a new regulation opening the path for broadcasting in 
languages other than Turkish on TRT and other national TV 
channels. Given the demand from the Southeast for broadcasting 
in Kurdish, and taking into account the sensitivity in the 
Southeast into account, RTUK requested opinions from some 
government agencies, including Interior Ministry and National 
Intelligence Organization (MIT), about whether or not 
broadcasting in Kurdish in Diyarbakir is permissible. The 
Diyarbakir Governorate, inresponse to an Interior Ministry 
inquiry said that the most widely spoken Kurdish dialect in 
Diyarbakir was the Kirmanci dialect. RTUK informed the 
Diyarbakir Soz and Gun TV stations and the Cagri-TV in Batman, 
which had applied for permission for broadcasting in Kurdish 
some time ago, to submit their applications. Military circles 
are not sympathetic to broadcasting in Kurdish before a detailed 
study has been made in the region. 
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
YENI SAFAK: In Viransehir, Sanliurfa province, the Chamber of 
Agriculture Vice President Hammut Babac said that the yield in 
cotton was going to be lower than last year\'s production due to 
the problems they experienced in electricity and irrigation. He 
said that they produced 140,000 tons of cotton from 280,000 
acres in 2003 and that they were expecting the yield from the 
same area to be between 80-90,000 tons in 2004.

been buried, were discovered in Tatvan, Bitlis province. Sculls, 
\"Mekap\"-brand shoes used by PKK militants, and military uniforms 
were found in the graves dating from 1994. 13 PKK militants were 
found in a grave in the Kender Mountains, and 19 others in a 
grave in the Bindaki Mountains. Three villagers anonymously said 
the militants buried in the Kender Mountains were arrested by

their backs. 
 
ZAMAN, SAABH, CUMHURIYET, MILLIYET, HURRIYET, TERCUMAN, RADIKAL, 
EVRENSEL, ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Approximately 400 villagers from 
the Sinan village of Bismil township, Diyarbakir province, 
undertook a demonstration against the landlord \"agha,\" who they 
claimed had taken their land by fraud. Currently the villagers 
are working as share-croppers for the Istanbul resident agha, 
Cengiz Sinanli, who said his family inherited approximately 
13,750 acres in Sinan village about 100 years ago. Sinanli said 
he was charging villagers a nominal fee for cultivating the 
land. Villagers, who were displaying Turkish flags, carried 
banners stating \"We do not want the agha system\" and \"The land 
belongs to us, and will belong to us.\"  The Jandarma watched the 
demonstrators from distance without intervening. 
 
CUMHURIYET: The Kurdish Language School in Diyarbakir was opened 
yesterday. The Diyarbakir National Education Directorate (DNED) 
warned the school authorities that its sign resembled PKK-Kongra 
Gel\'s colors. In addition to the school\'s sign, which was 
written with yellow letters on a black background, a yellow, 
green, and red-colored sign was also hung in the building. The 
DNED officials warned the school administration that the second 
sign they had hung was in opposition to the regulations, but the 
school administration responded that they had put it up for 
advertisement purposes, and would not take it down because it 
was not against any laws. The Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir, 
the Batman Mayor Huseyin Kalkan, and various other mayors 
attended the opening ceremony. 
 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: In Cizre, Sirnak province, a group of 300

resources to the Turkish Government. 
 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: In Adana, Meral Turkmen, a former employee 
of the Akdeniz Kultur Merkezi, claimed that she was kidnapped by 
four unidentified persons on August 14. She said that four

folded her hands and eyes and taped her mouth. She claimed that 
the kidnappers constantly told her that her father was a 
terrorist, and that he was recruiting for the PKK. She said that 
they forced her to accept becoming an informer for them because 
they said she was familiar with all the Kurdish institutions. 
 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: In Batman, five persons who were detained 
on August 20 while driving from Diyarbakir to Batman, were 
imprisoned on the charges of \"recruiting for the organization, 
and undertaking actions on behalf of the organization.\" [Note: 
the \"organization\" was not specified in the article.  End note.]

1.(SBU-BUS SENS)   Summary:  In meetings with PO in the last 
month, local businessman have been cautiously noting signs of a 
bottom in the regional economy and expressing guarded positive 
macro outlooks about a gradual return to growth in the region 
over the next 3-4 years.  They also spoke of the need for 
consolidation in the textile sector, but noted the weakness of 
such a tradition in Turkey\'s business culture.  Large food 
producers and commodities business people noted a \"down year\" in 
the making and commented on international contributors to their 
business models.  End Summary. 
 
Cotton brokers in Adana are \"miserable\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU BUS)  Recently a prominent Turkish cotton broker, 
headquartered in Adana, spoke to PO about the \"woes\" in the 
cotton brokering business this season.  \"There are just a few of 
us in Turkey,\" he said,\" but we are miserable.\"  He attributed 
current challenges to a \"slowdown in China in the last three 
months and a bumper crop in cotton coming in this year.\"  He 
said that the \"Chinese demand (for imported cotton) has really 
dropped.  They obviously decided to cool things down and their 
demand for (imported) cotton this quarter is really low now 
compared to (this time) last year.\"  He said that Turkish cotton 
producers have expanded their cultivation areas this year and 
more farmers opted to expand their cotton planting after last 
year\'s elevated prices.  All told, he summarized that reduced 
Chinese demand for cotton and an increased anticipated worldwide 
cotton supply this year was squeezing cotton brokers\' margins 
and knocking 20-30 percent off last year\'s gross revenues. 
 
3.(SBU)  The broker, who sells about 200,000 bales of U.S. 
(Texas, Carolinas and Memphis) cotton annually to open-ended 
spinning Turkish mill clients to account for almost half his 
annual sales, made an appeal for the U.S. to continue GSM 
financing.  He claimed that many of his larger deals are 
dependent on GSM financing and that it is not a \"distorting 
effect on commodity trade, like quotas.\"  He said that, other 
than U.S. cotton for which he foresaw continued strong Turkish 
demand, his other cotton sources are Israel, Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan and west Africa. 
 
Consolidation, but survival in Turkish textiles predicted 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
---------- 
 
4. (SBU SUS SENS) Several textile business people and observers 
asked about regional prospects with the multi-fiber agreement\'s 
(MFA) expiration approaching were not optimistic in the 
short-term, but offered guardedly positive long-term views. 
Most saw that the MFA\'s expiration would mean more competition 
than many older, traditional and poorly-managed mills could 
handle.  They were particularly worried about short-run effects 
in the Cukurova area, near Adana, where they predicted many 
failures and much unemployment on the horizon. While they noted 
some short-term respite from a recent drop in cotton prices, 
they observed that very strong Chinese competition had reduced 
margins tremendously and that their targeted foreign sales 
denominated in dollars had declining value.  They also pointed 
out slowly growing Turkish labor costs relative to South, 
Southeast and Central Asian textile producers as well as rising 
energy costs.  One contact, who manages and partly owns a 
synthetic fiber\'s textile plant in Tarsus, said that \"a few of 
the healthier Cukurova companies want to compete fairly like the 
big players, but are being undercut by failing mills who are 
null-invoicing, paying only day rates for labor and otherwise 
dumping products on the market.\" They said that the financially 
strong textile industries in Gaziantep (SANKO) , Kahraman Maras 
(KIPAS) , Istanbul and Bursa, who have invested - or publicly 
committed to - almost 900 million dollars in new plant this 
year, would weather the new competitive trends, albeit with 
lesser margins and lower returns on equity.  Nevertheless, since 
most are almost entirely privately held, this factor would not 
be that significant.  \"Textiles are a way of life for the big 
players,\" one observer noted. 
 
5. (SBU BUS SENS)  \"Logically, there would be consolidation in 
textiles,\" one businessman said,\" but that is harder in this 
\'patron\' business culture, where companies are privately-held 
and your factory is the core of your social identity.  Our 
lawyers are also just getting to understand this business tool,\" 
one American-educated businessman said.  Still some small mills 
in Kahraman Maras and one or two near Adana have closed or been 
sold out, if they were new enough, by the big players in 
Kahraman Maras.  \"Others will try to move offshore, such as a 
few have done in Turkmenistan and Bulgaria,\" another businessman 
added,  \"Still this is risky since doing business in 
Turkmenistan is unpredictable and Bulgaria\'s low wage rates 
could rise with EU accession.\" 
 
6.(SBU BUS SENS)  Most experienced textile business people cited 
Turkish textile producers\' domestic sources of cotton, proximity 
to EU and European markets, earlier entry into \"branded 
products,\" gradually increasing targeting of higher value-added 
products, well-establish client ties, textile innovation and 
proven quality, and deeper sources of non-public financing as 
the keys to the industry\'s predicted survival in the next 3-5 
years.  \"It does not mean that we  will avoid turmoil, just that 
we will survive,\" one cotton broker concluded. 
 
Which way will Sabanci Group textiles go? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7.(SBU BUS SENS)  In the Cukurova textile community, many eyes 
are on the Sabanci Group\'s  BOSSA mills, which local contacts 
say is really the only financially strong player left in and 
around Adana.  BOSSA representatives and other Sabanci Group 
representatives have said that the company is less and less 
enchanted with the low-margin textile industry from which the 
company first grew, but it is unclear whether the company is 
prepared to sever its ties to the industry altogether.  It has 
been consolidating its large BOSSA plant area into a condensed 
footprint, selling off excess real estate in the process, and 
retiring some older workers early, in both blue and white collar 
positions.  Some observers wonder whether the company, under new 
strategic leadership and seeing impending strong competition in 
the sector may be tempted to sell its holdings to a strong 
textile-focused group, such as SANKO or KIPAS. 
 
Regional businessman sees slow recovery nationwide, SE trailing 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
---------------------- 
 
8.(SBU BUS SENS)  Polled about future economic prospects, area 
business people cautiously are noting signs of a bottom in the 
regional economy and expressing guarded optimism about a gradual 
return to growth over the next 3-4 years.  \"Right now no one is 
building plant, except the few in the textile business building 
in Adiyaman (province) because of the new regional incentives. 
There is too much excess capacity already, but they are laying 
off fewer workers month-on-month,\" one business contact who 
travels nationwide regularly said.  \"Southeast Turkey still has 
the furthest to go in the recovery, but area productivity is 
starting to rise in some sectors.  Without more worker skills 
entering the labor force, however, the area\'s low-skill 
industries are seeing less of this productivity gain just as 
they face rising competition,\" one contact said, pointing toward 
textile, forestry and furniture sectors, strong in southeast 
Turkey, as economic \"soft spots.\" 
 
Farmers, Food producers see mixed results, want end to subsidies 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------------------------ 
 
9.(SBU SUS SENS)  Several Cukurova region big agricultural 
producers complained of \"excess competition from foreign 
vegetables and wheat with which we cannot compete, especially 
with rising fuel prices.\"  They lamented the influx of 
\"artificially cheap\" southeast EU vegetables and some 
international grains and strongly criticized international food 
subsidy programs.  The EU and (the U.S.)  have to stop this. 
You are flooding the markets with subsidized food products and 
drowning us out in Turkey, Pakistan and Africa,\" one 
U.S.-educated Turkish farmer said. These contacts cited the 
biggest foreign competition in grains, especially corn and 
wheat; onions and potatoes; and some green vegetables, such as 
broccoli, singling out Greece, Italy and Spain as their market 
interlopers. (Note: Turkey places an 80 percent import duty on 
corn and does not meet its domestic demand for corn.  End Note.) 
 
10.(SBU BUS SENS)  Nevertheless, some niche food product players 
saw the market somewhat differently.  The representative of an 
Adana-based aquaculture farm selling assorted seafood into the 
EU markets was optimistic about future growth and noted 
expanding demand for her company\'s products, such as crayfish, 
frog legs, shrimp, crab and snails.  Another fruit producer said 
that his products, greenhouse grown from California strawberry 
stock imported annually, was doing well provided he could 
protect its brand name from \"falsely advertising competitors in 
more profitable \'truck markets,\' like Istanbul, Izmir and 
Ankara.\"  He also noted that, because he did not trust the GOT 
to enforce food patents and trademarks, he had hedged his 
business by investing in ice cream production as well, because 
with a growing population, a significant portion of which was 
young, there was always dependable growth in the sweets food 
sector. 
 
11.(SBU)  In yet another perspective on the food products market 
in southeast Turkey, Turkish truck drivers frequently delivering 
goods to/from Iraq freely talk of loading their truck cabs and 
luggage in Iraq with tea, coffee, sugar, cocoa, flour, rice and 
candy to re-sell in Turkey where it brings two to three times 
its Iraqi cost.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  Lawyers and human rights activists told DPO 
in August 11-13 meetings in Diyarbakir, Tunceli, Bingol, Elazig 
and Malatya that recent reforms have resulted in progress in 
human rights practices in southeast Turkey, especially in the 
areas of detention and pre-trial procedures, access to lawyers 
(for all but terror-related suspects, they say), and even to a 
limited extent, in the area of freedom of speech and 
association. Contacts welcomed recent progress on Kurdish 
language instruction and broadcasting but were skeptical that 
actions taken to date come anywhere close to satisfying demands 
for increased cultural rights for Turkey\'s Kurdish population. 
Most observers qualify these relatively positive assessments of 
the human rights situation by adding that the PKK/Kongra-Gel\'s 
June 2004 abandonment of its ceasefire has increased tension in 
the region, and that the human rights situation could be in for 
a change.  End Summary.

Bingol, Elazig and Malatya that the past five years had brought 
limited, but still important progress in human rights practices 
in the Southeast of Turkey.  A Tunceli lawyer went so far as to 
state that \"torture and mistreatment are at their lowest levels 
in the history of Turkey.\"  Others were less ebullient (\"the 
general trend is weak, but it is one of improvement\") and all 
stressed the inconsistency in application of improved practices. 
 Nevertheless, a consensus existed among contacts that Turkey 
has been \"on the right path.\" 
 
3. (SBU)  Positive developments most often cited by rights 
activists are improved detention and pre-trial procedures, 
enhanced access to lawyers (for all but terror-related 
suspects), slightly greater freedom of speech and association, 
and the extension of the statute of limitations for officials 
involved in torture.  NGOs were not alone in praising recent 
reforms; Diyarbakir\'s acting public prosecutor said that the 
clearer language and decreased ambiguity of new laws was a 
welcome result of the EU harmonization process.  [Note:  He, as 
well as his counterpart in Elazig, confessed that it is 
challenging to keep up with the pace of change.  Both said they 
use the Turkish Parliament\'s internet site as their primary 
method of keeping up to date with changes to the law.  End note.] 
 
Improved Public Education About Rights 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU)  NGOs and lawyers gave police higher marks than the 
Jandarma in the area of human rights, claiming they were more 
\"sensitive to the democratization issue.\"  The demand side of 
the human rights equation is improving as well, according to 
contacts, as the public becomes more educated (and emboldened by 
the EU process) about civil liberties.  In the first six months 
of 2004, requests for the Diyarbakir Bar\'s services surpassed 
the entire number of requests in 2002-03.  Lawyers attribute 
this to a recent Bar education campaign.  During a nine-day 
security operation in Diyarbakir (reftel), for example, police 
confronted protestors objecting to the operation on several 
occasions.  According to one lawyer, \"We saw a greater awareness 
of rights both on part of public and the police.\"  A police 
official reportedly asked one protestor a loaded question (\"How 
long have you been supporting the PKK?\"), and the individual 
responded that he wanted to use his right to remain silent.  \"In 
the past they might have broken your hand for an answer like 
that,\" said the Bar lawyers, noting that in this case the 
individual did not suffer any ill effects from his response. 
 
Uncommon Dialogue 
----------------- 
 
5. (SBU)  The Elazig Human Rights Association (HRA) branch 
office also reports some small victories along the same lines, 
from standing down a police request to get names of individuals 
who were attending a local funeral, to getting a response (but 
no information) to their \"FOIA-like\" request to the Governor for 
information about a specific case.  The most surprising news 
from Elazig, given the views of many state officials about human 
rights organizations, was about the dialogue that apparently 
exists between the HRA and the government.  The Elazig Governor 
paid a courtesy call to the HRA office recently, according to 
the group\'s president, and moreover, tried to coax the HRA 
representative to attend meetings sponsored by the Interior 
Ministry\'s local human rights representative.  The Governor 
reportedly told the HRA representative that he understood why 
HRA did not want to attend, but he stressed that since the other 
NGO\'s in attendance were \"more statist than the state,\" the HRA 
could contribute a different voice to the dialogue. 
 
Broadcasting and instruction OK, but \"we\'re not impressed\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU)  Contacts did not have much praise for the recent 
establishment of private Kurdish language instruction schools 
and the broadcast of Kurdish language segments on state 
television. While all interlocutors welcomed these first steps 
toward meeting cultural rights, they consider them to be window 
dressing, and inadequate in addressing the demand.  One 
Diyarbakir businessman acknowledged, however, that these two 
developments have an important psychological impact:  \"If you 
would have told me ten years ago that there would be 
Kurdish-language broadcasts on our television, I would have 
looked at you like you were from the moon,\" he said. 
 
7. (SBU)  Nevertheless, the substance of the changes leaves a 
great deal to be desired, according to activists.  Kurdish 
broadcasts play for 30 minutes per week, they say, on a weekday 
morning when very few can see it.  As for instruction, many 
complain that for-fee courses are not helpful, especially for 
those with limited means; what the Kurdish community is seeking 
are elective courses in schools and universities, they say.  In 
addition, in Diyarbakir one must be 16 in order to enroll in 
courses, whereas most people would like to see younger children 
learning and carrying on the language.  Teachers, even the wife 
of one contact whose Sorbonne degree is in \"Kurdology\", must 
undergo a certification process by Turkish authorities which 
observers found distasteful. 
 
Still no shortage of violations 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU)  While the overall situation had improved in recent 
years, there are still numerous complaints of human rights 
violations.  The Bingol HRA leader has had 67 charges filed 
against him for what he considers \"thought crimes,\" for example, 
and the Diyarbakir HRA leader 58.  In connection with a May Day 
demonstration in Diyarbakir, HRA claims that 168 union 
supporters who had wanted to participate in a press release were 
taken to the Security Directorate, detained for 10 hours in an 
indoor gym, and then released without having been asked one 
question.  More recently, during Tunceli\'s July 31 Culture and 
Nature Festival, police responded with what some observers 
considered \"excessive force\" to a group from the Inmates Family 
Association (families of suspected PKK militants), who wanted to 
carry out a previously unauthorized demonstration during the 
festival.  Tunceli\'s DEHAP Mayor reported being pushed and 
insulted by Tunceli\'s Security Director in the scuffle, an 
account corroborated by a member of Tunceli\'s Bar Association. 
(Note:  The Mayor of Tunceli is a woman who appears to be in her 
thirties, weighing no more than 120 pounds.  End note.) 
Twenty-six individuals were detained for resisting arrest and 
carrying out an illegal demonstration.  All but two were later 
released. 
 
9. (SBU)  Comment:  Even the most skeptical observers give 
Turkey relatively good marks in improving the human rights 
environment in southeast Turkey during the past five years. 
Even where implementation is incomplete or inconsistent, just 
having new laws on the books is an advance, according to many 
lawyers, as they give a concrete basis for accountability. 
Human rights workers claim that the EU harmonization process had 
been \"comforting people psychologically in their daily life.\" 
That sense of comfort, however, is in danger of being eroded by 
the PKK\'s June 2004 abandonment of its ceasefire, according to 
most observers (septel).

1. (SBU)  Summary:  Representatives of non-governmental 
organizations in southeastern Turkey recently told DPO that the 
region\'s human rights situation has been steadily improving over 
the past five years.  Human rights workers\' anxiety is 
increasing, however, with every new clash between PKK/Kongra-Gel 
terrorists and government security forces.  While contacts are 
not ready to say that the government\'s \"old measures\" for 
combating the PKK are coming back, even the most optimistic 
observers fear that in the coming months, the public will be 
caught in the middle of overzealous security forces and a terror 
group that has proved its ruthlessness.  Many interlocutors 
claim that public support for the PKK terrorists is low, even 
among rank and file members of the pro-Kurdish DEHAP party, but 
that despite anti-violence dialogue within the Kurdish 
community, fear of PKK reprisals prevents public criticism for 
now.  Meanwhile, a government official in Diyarbakir stated that 
he understood undertaking anti-PKK actions in Iraq would put the 
U.S. in a difficult spot, but it is \"impossible to explain that 
to a large segment of the population,\" he said.  End Summary. 
 
PKK iolenc Ceaes Anxiety 
------------------------- 
 
2 (SU  \"A month ago,\" said one iyabair umn Rghs 
Association (HRA) member, \"I would have stressed he positive 
more than the negative in discussingreforms and 
implementation.\"  But with the PKK/Kngra-Gel\'s abandonment of 
its ceasefire, contactsin southeast Turkey assert, anyone who 
takes a sand against anything now will now be labeled PKK, nd 
the security forces will use the attacks as apretext to crack 
down.  While not ready to say yt that all the \"old measures\" 
are coming back, clarly anxiety is rising among generally 
hopeful oservers in southeast Turkey.  Diyarbakir lawyers 
stated tat t 
 man pobem they are currently sein reates 
to access to lawyers for suspected PK emers  henfailis 
of terror-related suspets reuest asitane,the Bar responds 
by approchig the Securiy Diretor.  They report being 
outinely told that the suspect in question has notrequested a 
lawyer, but officials produce no siged document to that effect 
from the suspect.  Latr, in court, claim the Bar members, 
suspects indcate that they had wanted a lawyer. 
 
No One Wats the Violence to Return 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU)  \"This violence is affeting us all now,\" said one 
Diyarbakir lawyer, as ttacks are no longer limited to rural 
areas.  Hehad recently planned a trip to Tunceli to get away 
but cancelled it after hearing there was a secuity operation 
being conducted in the area.  \"I ws thinking of my kids,\" he 
said, and he didn\'t want them to be exposed to checkpoints. 
Contacts insist that no one wants the violence back.  Villagers 
are put in the worst no-win situation, contacts say:  first they 
will be extorted by the PKK and if they refuse, they\'ll be 
beaten; then the army will accuse them of aiding and abetting 
the terrorists, they say. 
 
4. (SBU)  A private businessman agreed that sympathy for the PKK 
among the population had decreased.  He recently had visited a 
previously pro-PKK village to pay his respects to the family of 
an elderly person who had passed away.  During the visit, he 
tentatively brought up his anger about the PKK\'s abandonment of 
its ceasefire, expecting an argument.  The villagers agreed 
openly, he said, and were more vigorous in their disapproval 
than he was.  Dialogue about the need to speak out against 
violence is happening, even among DEHAP members, according to 
contacts, but people feel it is too dangerous to go public. A 
member of the Tunceli Bar said that \"even sympathizers in 
circles close to the organization [PKK] say this is not to their 
benefit and will damage them.\"  He claims that rank and file 
members of human rights NGOs and DEHAP, for example, are 
moderate even if their leaders appear \"rigid.\"  It is impossible 
to show a reaction to the violence, though, as the PKK would 
show its \"counter-reaction,\" he said. 
 
5. (SBU)  One Tunceli businessman opined that the politicians 
(referring to DEHAP) had to move first on publicly denouncing 
violence.  Another in Diyarbakir apparently agreed, saying that 
he had visited Diyarbakir\'s Mayor Baydemir recently to express 
his disapproval of the mayor\'s recent condolence visit to the 
family of a suspected PKK militant.  Businessmen in Diyarbakir 
had been putting together an anti-violence statement recently, 
he added, but scrapped it when the Governor called them in and 
asked them to do it.  In the wake of that request they decided 
timing wasn\'t right and the statement would not be perceived as 
authentic. 
 
Deputy Governor:  Attacks not \"serious\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU)  Unlike NGO contacts, the Deputy Governor of Diyarbakir 
was skeptical that the renewed violence would have any impact. 
The situation is different now, he said.  Five hundred militants 
at a time could enter previously, and the PKK used to receive 
more support from Europe and the drug trade.  Today, he said, 
the U.S. is in Iraq and understands security differently, and 
overall support for the PKK is down (Note:  He did not provide 
detailed information to back up that assertion.  End note). 
Only small groups are coming in and staging ambushes and 
harassment attacks to cause problems, he said.  Before, the PKK 
killed \"50 people at a time,\" he said, adding that the current 
activity did not represent \"serious\" attacks. 
Timing of Ceasefire Abandonment \"Very Strange\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (SBU)  With the slow but steady progress acknowledged by so 
many human rights activists in the Southeast, and demands for 
additional progress flowing reasonably well through democratic 
dialogue and courtrooms, why the PKK would decide to abandon its 
ceasefire at this time baffled all interlocutors.  The timing is 
\"very strange and meaningless,\" they said, unless there is truth 
to conspiracy theories about forces from both sides conspiring 
to spoil Turkey\'s chances for EU accession.  This argument 
posits that in addition to dampening the EU\'s enthusiasm for 
giving a date, a return to chaos and violence in the region 
materially benefits no small number of people.  As a brief 
example, one contact said, certain individuals gain from having 
jandarma checkpoints in place:  if you have a restaurant or even 
sell gum by a checkpoint, it adds up to income.  This is just 
one small example, he said, compared to the organized crime 
activity that can flourish when freedom of movement is 
restricted for security reasons.  The violence of past years had 
largely ended because the PKK had given up terrorism, claimed 
one lawyer.  He added that when Abdullah Ocalan said to resume 
the \"war\", it was resumed, and he wondered whether or not Ocalan 
could get messages out of prison if they were not \"approved\" by 
the state.  \"I\'m not a conspiracy type, but this is too 
strange,\" he said. 
 
Impact on Public Opinion about the U.S. 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU)  According to non-governmental contacts, the recent 
increase in violence in the region is not having an effect on 
public opinion about the U.S. in southeast Turkey.  \"Any 
thinking person knows that this violence does not benefit the 
United States,\" said one Diyarbakir lawyer.  He claimed that 
Abdullah Ocalan and the Turkish media are trying to foment the 
idea that the U.S. supports the recent up-tick in violence. 
Another human rights activists averred that most in Turkey\'s 
Kurdish community understand that the \"Kurdish issue\" can\'t be 
solved the same way in Turkey as it may be in Iraq.  \"In Turkey 
this must be solved in framework of democracy, and we expect you 
to push Turkey in this direction,\" he said. 
 
9. (SBU)  The Deputy Governor of Diyarbakir had a slightly 
different take.  He diplomatically recalled that there has been 
great support in Turkey for the United States since 1945, and 
that our support especially vis-a-vis the Soviet Union pre-1980 
was especially appreciated.  However four to five thousand PKK 
militants are nested in Iraq, he said, and they\'ll take actions 
according to U.S. posture.  There are U.S. armed forces 100 
kilometers from Turkey\'s border, he continued, and though Turkey 
sees the resistance U.S. troops are facing, and understands that 
anti-PKK operations would put the U.S. in a difficult position, 
\"it is impossible to explain that to a large segment of the 
population, so the PKK must be taken under control.\" 
 
10. (SBU)  Comment:  Some of the reforms enacted during the EU 
harmonization process in Turkey have taken hold, and will be 
difficult to turn back under any circumstances.  Others, 
however, are more fragile and will be tested as the GOT 
implements its response to violent attacks by PKK terrorists. 
The Diyarbakir Bar\'s assertion that some terror suspects are 
being denied immediate access to a lawyer, for example, are 
worrying.  Human rights activists are watching security forces\' 
response to PKK violence carefully, and will vociferously 
denounce actions perceived as disproportionate to the threat. 
It is, however, uncertain that southeast Turkey\'s Kurdish 
population would overcome the traditional barriers to public 
voicing of criticisms of PKK terror.

SUBJECT: PRIVATE KURDISH LANGUAGE SCHOOLS FIGHT RED TAPE 
 
REF: ANKARA 1532 
 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  Five private Kurdish language instruction 
schools (Van, Batman, Sanliurfa, Diyarbakir and Adana) are open 
for business and have registered hundreds of new students for 
the fall, after completing lengthy application procedures and 
meeting strict building code requirements to which few other 
private learning institutions are held.  The schools continue to 
face administrative challenges, including a recent Ministry of 
Education decision prohibiting the use of textbooks and 
dictionaries that instructors had been employing for several 
months.  Despite Turkey\'s progress in implementing important 
language rights reform measures, activists in Turkey\'s southeast 
continue to advocate for free elective Kurdish courses in public 
institutions, arguing that \"Turkey can\'t solve its language 
problem with a few schools.\"  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Since the passage of reform laws in 2002 which allowed 
private courses in Kurdish and other non-Turkish languages \"used 
by Turkish citizens in their daily lives,\" five private Kurdish 
language instruction schools have opened their doors and at 
least two others may follow suit later this month.  From 
September 1 through 3, poloff visited schools in Batman, 
Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir to discuss with instructors and 
administrators their experiences with the approval process and 
opening of the schools.  (Note:  In addition to schools in these 
three cities, a course has been operating in Van, and an 
approved school in Adana will begin classes on September 20. 
Press reports indicate that schools have been approved or will 
soon be approved in Istanbul and Kiziltepe, District of Mardin 
Province, as well.  End note.) 
 
Twenty days vs. Two Years 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Officials at the school in Sanliurfa said they opened 
in March 2004, after an application process lasting more than 
two years.  (Note:  They claimed their formal application was 
made in December 2001, which would have preceded the passage of 
implementing regulations for legislation allowing Kurdish 
instruction.  End note.)  In Batman, the school opened its doors 
in April 2004, twelve months after beginning the application 
process.  School administrators held an opening celebration in 
Diyarbakir in August 2004, after sixteen months of seeking 
approval.  In contrast, said a teacher in Batman, a nearby 
driving school with the same status under the Ministry of 
Education completed the process in just twenty days.  \"There is 
a reason for this,\" he said.  \"It is natural that there is 
awkwardness as this is the first time.  Ministry officials were 
afraid, and we all paid the price,\" he added.  The Batman school 
reportedly had visits from at least ten different government 
agencies, ranging from municipal health and fire officials to 
Public Prosecutor officials checking inventories, before being 
given the green light. 
 
Every centimeter counts 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Administrators from all three schools report being 
subjected to building code requirements during the approval 
process to which few other institutions are held.  In 
Diyarbakir, for example, three proposed classrooms were deemed 
unfit for use because only 15 percent of the classroom area was 
covered by windows as opposed to 20 percent.  The result is that 
the school will use nine rather than 12 of its rooms for 
instruction.  (Note:  This was reportedly due to students\' need 
to be exposed to sunlight for health reasons; at the same time 
schools are authorized to give night classes.  End note.)  In 
Batman, a doorframe was determined to be five centimeters too 
narrow and had to be widened, with an extension added to the 
door so it would close properly.  One observer pointed out that 
the Sanliurfa school is just about the only building in town 
with a fire escape, and it is only a two-story building. 
Throughout the application process, the school buildings had to 
be open and accessible to inspectors.  Since most are housed in 
rented properties, this resulted in significant costs before any 
income was gained through student fees.  Private individuals 
reportedly covered these and other start-up costs for the 
schools. 
 
What is advanced ability? 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Each of the schools was required to submit the names 
of at least one third of its teachers at the time of 
application.  In most cases, this amounted to just one name. 
The Batman school currently has three teachers (two permanent at 
30 hour per week, and one contract at eight hours per week) and 
Sanliurfa has two teachers.  The Diyarbakir school has been 
authorized to employ four teachers, but has not completed its 
hiring process yet.  An official at the Sanliurfa school 
characterized the process of getting teachers certified as 
problematic.  He said that the prerequisites set by the Ministry 
for potential teachers were:  graduation from a teacher training 
program, two years experience, and \"advanced ability.\"   As for 
advanced ability, though, he said the Ministry did not issue 
clear standards.  Contacts in Diyarbakir agreed, saying \"we just 
had to certify we could teach Kurdish.\"  If the Ministry is 
requiring certifications regarding ability, they argue, there 
should be a specific university faculty created, as well as 
texts, to prepare and test such ability. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Ministry did not approve several candidates put 
forward for contract positions by the school in Sanliurfa, 
because the individuals reportedly worked too many hours in 
other teaching jobs.  The principal in Diyarbakir claimed that 
their school\'s first nominee for Director was a thirty-year 
teaching veteran, but he was not approved because he had been 
demoted once in his career.  (Note:  Despite these complaints 
about getting teachers approved, it is interesting that our 
contact in Batman was approved despite the fact that, as he told 
us, he had given six unauthorized classes in the past and had 
been \"exiled to Yozgat\" at one point in his career.  End note.) 
 
Facts and figures 
----------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  At all three locations, one course of study consists 
of 180 hours of classroom instruction and costs 100 million 
Turkish Lira (TL).  While only one level of course curriculum 
has been authorized by the Ministry of Education, in practice 
each of the schools appears to be performing informal testing of 
registrants to determine students\' level of ability and grouping 
them in classes accordingly.  Class hours vary from school to 
school, but each has weekend and evening classes in addition to 
hours during the week.  To date classes have been in Kurmanji, 
which is the most widely spoken form of Kurdish in Turkey. 
 
8.  (SBU)  In Diyarbakir there are currently 207 students 
enrolled for the school\'s first term, set to begin September 14. 
 According to the school\'s officials, potential students must 
have completed at least four years of elementary school, 
regardless of their age.  They said they had received some 40 to 
50 individuals when registration opened who had wanted to apply 
since they had \"waited a lifetime to learn their language in 
school,\" but they were turned away because they had not studied 
a sufficient amount of time in Turkish public schools.  In 
contrast to earlier reports that students had to be at least 16 
years old, Diyarbakir school contacts said that with parental 
permission, and fulfilling other requirements regarding public 
schooling, students as young as 11 could register. 
 
9.  (SBU)  In Sanliurfa, the school started out last spring with 
33 students.  Contacts at the school claim they purposely 
limited the number for their first term as they worked out how 
the school would function.  During their summer term they had 58 
students in two classes, with an average age somewhere between 
30 and 35.  Of these, 12 students were under the age of 16.  The 
capacity of the Sanliurfa school is 80 students.  In Batman, 79 
students attended classes during the school\'s first term. 
Forty-two of the students were university graduates, 20 were 
high school graduates and 17 had finished just elementary 
school.  Twenty-six of those students were women, and the large 
majority of students were adults.  For the summer course in 
Batman, 60 students registered, but only 50 or so attended. 
 
The next important battle:  Textbooks 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) During their first two terms, the schools in 
Sanliurfa and Batman had been using a variety of texts and 
materials in support of their instruction.  The Sanliurfa school 
reportedly submitted a list of these texts for approval to the 
Ministry as early as January 2004.  In July, however, the 
Ministry of Education issued a notice that six or seven of the 
texts, in their current forms, were \"not appropriate as 
education tools.\"  (Note:  The Diyarbakir school had not 
received this official notification as of September 3, but 
expected it would receive the same news soon.  End note.)  The 
Ministry report states that the texts contain \"ideological 
aspects per the attached report,\" and are therefore not suitable 
in the classroom.  Neither the Batman nor the Sanliurfa schools, 
however, report having received the \"attached report\" referred 
to in the Ministry notice. 
 
11.  (SBU) In one dictionary, for example, there is reference to 
\"Kurdistan\" and the \"Kurdish people,\" explained contacts in 
Sanliurfa.  In another instance, a text states that \"[Kurdish] 
people have been subject to assimilation and therefore an 
overwhelming majority has forgotten the language.\"  In its 
notice prohibiting the texts, the Ministry of Education has not 
suggested others that would be suitable, though it does allow 
that the texts can be used if the offending passages are 
removed.  However this becomes a copyright issue, argue school 
officials.  They cannot simply remove pages of books that were 
published by other companies. 
 
12.  (SBU) Administrators of the schools are communicating among 
themselves and with the Istanbul Cultural Institute, the 
publisher of at least one of the books in question, about next 
steps regarding the texts.  The principal of the Diyarbakir 
school stated that he also found the texts inadequate, but for 
pedagogical reasons (i.e. he did not find the \"offensive\" 
passages to be derogatory to the state).   His school has formed 
an experts committee (comprising two Turkish language teachers, 
two English teachers, and two other classroom teachers) to 
discuss the problem of texts, in general.   In the meantime, 
until new materials are developed, it is unclear how and if the 
Ministry will enforce its prohibition of the existing texts.  An 
official in Batman implied that he will keep using them: \"We 
think they\'ll change their mentality,\" he said; \"they have to.\" 
 
Bring the Inspectors, Not Police 
-------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) In addition to the flap over course materials, the 
Diyarbakir school is also facing problems due to two signs they 
have hung at the school for what they claim are \"promotional\" 
purposes.  Government officials have charged that two signs at 
the school must be removed because their colors are those of the 
flag used by the PKK/Kongra Gel terrorist group.  According to 
school officials, some 25 policemen came to the school on August 
20 and stayed for three to four hours, insisting that the signs 
be removed.  The school\'s administration held its ground, 
stating that the people \"liked those colors,\" and that if there 
were a problem, they expected that the Ministry of Education 
would send inspectors to give official notice of the need to 
remove the signs.  The signs were still present as of September 
3. 
 
14.  (SBU) Comment:  Each of the schools is housed in attractive 
facilities, none more impressive than the brightly painted seven 
story building in Diyarbakir, which also houses the Kurdish Pen 
organization and the Kurdish Institute.  Busts and official 
portraits of Ataturk look out over Kurdish language wall 
decorations, and vocabulary flash cards mark doors, chairs and 
windows in Turkish and Kurdish.  Clearly change has come to the 
Southeast.  Nevertheless, the red tape facing administrators of 
these private Kurdish language instruction centers is ponderous, 
arbitrary, and deliberate.  School officials also argue that the 
\"hassles\" and occasional police presence deter students from 
registering, claiming that students will be labeled as 
separatists.  (Note:  Government officials assert that the 
numbers of students to date simply indicate low interest.  End 
note.) 
 
15.  (SBU) Comment, cont\'d:  Moreover, school officials were 
bothered by inquiries focusing on facts and figures, arguing 
that discussing details about the schools doesn\'t get at the 
real issue.  \"Turkey can\'t solve its language problem with a few 
schools,\" they say.  They argue that Kurds in Turkey pay taxes, 
send their sons to the army, and fulfill other requirements of 
good citizenry.  In return, they assert, the state offers no 
resources to fund this \"inadequate\" answer to demands for 
language rights.  While the pioneers in Kurdish language 
instruction in Turkey are busy opening private schools for the 
moment, their struggle for free elective Kurdish courses in 
public institutions in Turkey will continue.

SUBJECT: LOCAL TV STATIONS APPLY TO BROADCAST IN KURDISH 
 
REF: A. A)  ANKARA 3236 
     B. B)  ADANA 00119 
 
 
1.  (U) Summary: At least four local television stations - three 
in Diyarbakir and one in Batman - have applied to Turkey\'s Radio 
and Television Board (RTUK) for the right to broadcast 
Kurdish-language programs.  RTUK has acknowledged the 
applications and claims it is reviewing them in consultation 
with other government entities.  A Gun TV representative stated 
that if approved, the broadcasts would be two times per week for 
45 minutes each.  Concurrent to this review process, a September 
1 RTUK press release announced that Gun TV would be shut down 
for one month some time in September due to a December 2003 
broadcast that was \"against the values of Ataturk, against the 
unity of the state, and against the nation\'s existence and 
independence.\"  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) At least four local television stations have applied to 
Turkey\'s Radio and Television Board (RTUK) for the right to 
broadcast Kurdish-language news and cultural programs.  A reform 
package passed in 2002 initially paved the way for such 
applications, allowing for broadcasting in \"languages and 
dialects traditionally used in daily life by Turkish citizens.\" 
Nearly two years after the reforms were passed, the state-run 
national TRT channel initiated programming in Kurdish and other 
minority languages (Ref A).  Now local channels are waiting to 
see if they will be authorized to do the same. 
 
3.  (SBU) Three of the local station applicants, Gun TV, ART, 
and Soz TV, are located in Diyarbakir.  The fourth, Cagri TV, 
opened in Batman in 1994 and is that city\'s only local 
television station.  Gun TV\'s General Manager told poloff on 
September 3 that his station had originally applied in March 
2004 for permission to air Kurdish-language broadcasts, and when 
they did not receive any reply, they applied again.  After the 
second application, RTUK told them it was \"being considered.\" 
Cagri TV applied in June after Kurdish language broadcasts 
started on TRT.  ART applied on August 23. 
 
RTUK:  Can we check your references? 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Cagri staff said they had heard a \"positive signal\" 
from RTUK in August, but had not received anything in writing. 
They were optimistic.  As of early September, however, the Gun 
TV representative had not received any communication from RTUK 
beyond acknowledgement that their applications were being 
reviewed.  In fact staff at Cagri TV and Gun TV seemed to be 
learning more about the status of their applications through the 
press than through official channels.  On August 20, for 
example, Milliyet reported that RTUK had solicited the views of 
MIT (Turkey\'s intelligence service) and the Interior Ministry 
about the applications.  The Interior Ministry, via the relevant 
Governor\'s offices, reportedly confirmed that the language and 
dialects mentioned in the applications were spoken in their 
respective provinces.  [Note:  This confirmation likely fulfills 
a formality required by the official application process.  End 
Note.]  A Gun TV representative told poloff that if the 
station\'s application were approved, he believed it would be for 
two 45-minute Kurdish-language programs per week. 
 
Mixed Messages 
-------------- 
 
5.  (U) While the staff of Gun TV was encouraged that their 
application was being considered, they had just received notice 
a day before our September 3 meeting that they would soon be 
shut down for a month by RTUK for a live broadcast they aired 
previously.  In a September 1 RTUK press release, the Board gave 
notice that Gun TV would be shut down for a month (dates 
unspecified) for a broadcast that was \"against the values of 
Ataturk, against the unity of the state, and against the 
nation\'s existence.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) The Gun General Director explained that the station 
had broadcast live coverage of a symposium on local 
administration, human rights and the media.  Symposium 
organizers had received the appropriate permission for the event 
from the Governor, and local government officials as well as at 
least one telephone participant based in Europe debated the 
issues in a panel format.  One of the participants gave a 
presentation in Kurdish with simultaneous translation into 
Turkish.  According to our contact, others on the panel who 
spoke in Turkish had more critical things to say about the 
government than did the Kurdish speaker, but he believes the 
combination of the language and the content led to the shutdown 
notice.  They expect the one-month penalty to start some time in 
September.  In response to this penalty, Gun\'s representative 
said, other media sources had announced Gun was being 
temporarily shut down for \"broadcasting separatist material.\" 
\"You would expect other journalists in Turkey to support us,\" he 
said, but the attitudes of some other media outlets made Gun 
staffers feel very \"lonely.\" 
7.  (SBU) Comment:  The Turkish authorities are dragging their 
feet on these applications.  If any of the applications are 
approved, it will mark another step forward in implementation of 
Turkey\'s reform process.  It took two years from the passage of 
reforms for Kurdish language broadcasts on TRT to begin, and an 
equal amount of time, if not more, for the approval process 
allowing Kurdish language instruction centers to open (Ref B). 
There is a certain irony to Gun TV\'s application being reviewed 
in one RTUK hand, while the other orders a one-month shutdown. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: JANDARMA EVICTS VILLAGE GUARDS FROM SYRIAC VILLAGE OF 
SARIKOY 
 
REF: ADANA 00105 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  A Syriac Orthodox Church representative told 
poloff that on September 12, security forces evicted the Kurdish 
village guards that had been living in the village of Sarikoy in 
Sirnak Province (reftel).  Members of the Syriac community who 
had resided in Sarikoy prior to 1994, and who had recently 
returned from Europe in order to resettle in there, will consult 
with Sirnak government officials on security and other matters 
before returning to the now emptied village.  The Sirnak 
Governor\'s interest in this case, and ultimately strong action 
by his office in concert with security forces, represents the 
most affirmative official government response in favor of the 
Syriac community in the Southeast to date.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) In reftel, post reported on Sarikoy, a village in 
Sirnak province that had been inhabited by members of the Syriac 
Christian community until 1994, when they left, fleeing violence 
in the region.  Twenty Kurdish village guards assigned to work 
in the region subsequently inhabited the village, along with 
family members.  When Syriac community members returned from 
Europe this year to find their resettlement in Sarikoy blocked 
by the presence of the village guards, they addressed their 
claims to the Governor of Sirnak.  Five representatives of the 
community have been staying at the Syriac Orthodox Church\'s 
Dayrul Umur Monastary in Midyat while pursuing what observers 
had initially hoped would be an amicable agreement allowing them 
to return to their village. 
 
3.  (SBU) In a September 1 meeting at the monastery, 
representatives of the Church told poloff that the Sirnak 
Governor had that very day cut electricity services to Sarikoy 
in an effort to dissuade the village\'s current occupants from 
staying there.  Church representatives also told us that in the 
week leading up to this development, they had received a visit 
from an Anatolian Agency wire service reporter who had visited 
the Governor\'s office a short time earlier.  The reporter said 
that the Governor\'s desk had been covered with documents related 
to Sarikoy and that the Governor spoke of the importance he 
placed on resolving the case. 
 
4.  (SBU)  In a September 16 phone conversation, a Syriac church 
official based at the Monastery in Midyat confirmed press 
reports that the Jandarma had \"evacuated\" the village guards 
from the village on September 12, thus paving the way for the 
Syriac community\'s return.  The Jandarma were very clever, he 
said, in the way they launched their \"operation.\"  He stated 
that approximately three weeks earlier, the Jandarma had given 
notice to Sarikoy\'s current residents of its intent to evict 
them, including the date the eviction would be carried out. 
When the Jandarma discovered that the guards had gathered media 
representatives to observe the process, they abandoned the date, 
and planned the September 12 operation.  According to our 
contact in Midyat, the Jandarma called the guards from Sarikoy 
to the Jandarma post around 8:30 pm on September 12, informed 
them that Jandarma officers were needed at an operation 
elsewhere in the region, and asked the guards to occupy the post 
while they were gone.  When the guards were inside the post, 
Jandarma allegedly disarmed them, and prevented their return to 
Sarikoy.  The Jandarma were reportedly planning to empty Sarikoy 
houses of the guards\' possessions September 18-19. 
 
5.  (SBU)  For the moment the representatives of the Syriac 
community have stayed put at the Monastery, as they are 
concerned about security in the village.  They will communicate 
with the Governor and Deputy Governor of Sirnak as they 
contemplate their return. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Comment:  Sarikoy is not the only place where the 
presence of Kurdish village guards has proved an obstacle to 
returns for displaced persons.  Lawyers at the Diyarbakir Bar 
Association told poloff they had been following this case, and 
like the Syriac community members, were somewhat surprised about 
the attention it was receiving from government officials.  Other 
village returns (to majority Kurdish villages, for example) will 
be considerably more politically charged, and we should not 
expect the Jandarma action in Sarikoy to be a precedent.  It is 
noteworthy, however, as the village return issue comes under 
increasing scrutiny by the European Union.  End comment.

SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ROUND-UP:  SE TURKEY 
 
1.  (U) Summary: Members of the Protestant, Catholic and Muslim 
communities in various cities in southeast Turkey report that 
they are able to worship freely, but that the state continues to 
restrict some aspects of their religious life.  A Diyarbakir 
pastor\'s acquittal last May on charges of worshiping in an 
\"illegal church\" did not address the church\'s equally pressing 
problem, a lack of legal status.  Religious groups attempting to 
gain legal status or regain lost properties continue to face 
incommodious bureaucratic processes.  In Adana, a representative 
of that city\'s Jewish community, however, says that community\'s 
biggest problem is its dwindling size in the region due to 
emigration and self-selection, not \"government problems.\"  End 
Summary. 
 
Protestants in Diyarbakir:  no legal status 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The pastor of a Protestant church in Diyarbakir told 
poloff in a September 3 meeting that his congregation of 
approximately 60 members was able to worship freely, and was not 
currently experiencing any harassment.  At a May 2004 hearing, 
he said, he had been acquitted of charges that he was operating 
a church in an unauthorized building.  In handing down that 
decision, the judge cited a 1996 European Human Rights Court 
precedent stating that sentencing someone for using a house as a 
place of worship without government permission is a violation of 
Article 9 of the European Human Rights Accord.  (Note:  In an 
August meeting with poloff, a public prosecutor in Diyarbakir 
asserted that the decision is an example of progress in the area 
of religious freedom.) 
 
3.  (SBU) While the pastor welcomed the May decision that 
allowed him to keep using the property for religious instruction 
and worship, he is not completely satisfied as he and his 
worshipers still do not have any legal status as a church.  They 
cannot legally hire any employee (such as a pastor) nor provide 
benefits, for example.  Moreover, they cannot own the property 
in the church\'s name.  The building they are using as a church 
also serves as the pastor\'s home.  If he should die, he asks, 
how could he make sure it stays in the hands of his 
congregation?   The church does not receive state assistance for 
electricity and water, as some other faith groups with legal 
status do, nor does it have any space specifically allocated for 
use as a cemetery for the community, he said. 
 
4.  (SBU) According to this pastor, groups wishing to form new 
foundations must have at least one trillion TL (approximately 
USD 665,000) before applying.  (Note: Post has not yet been able 
to confirm this independently.  End Note.)  Only one Protestant 
foundation, he said, the Istanbul-based Bostanci Vakfi, was 
formed prior to the establishment of that requirement.   The 
pastor said that there are approximately 70 churches dealing 
with the same lack of legal status issue, and that 
representatives of Protestant churches have formed a legal 
commission that has been meeting in Izmir on and off for two 
months to determine how to move forward.  At this time they are 
considering their best option to be forming an association 
(dernek).  It would be based in Ankara; there would be a number 
of board members there and the churches would function like a 
federation.  He will keep us posted as they move forward in this 
process. 
 
Catholic community in Mersin 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) A Catholic priest in Mersin who has been in Turkey for 
41 years (about 35 of them in Mersin) said that the church was 
trying to form a foundation in order to be able to get title and 
compensation for lost lands.  He said that the church, which is 
located adjacent to the Mersin Security Director\'s office and 
municipality building, had lost its property (including its 
cemetery) over the last few decades as Mersin grew, because its 
properties were untitled by government decision and located in 
growing urban areas.  The property in Catholic Church use now 
was limited to the church itself, an adjacent house and an 
adjacent additional building.  He said that the church had been 
allowed land in a municipal cemetery when its dedicated cemetery 
was lost and that it is \"protected and respected\" by 
authorities. 
 
6.  (SBU) He was not optimistic that the foundation would make 
much headway and said that \"the Turks do not have a concept of 
reciprocity or give-and-take,\" stressing that he did not mean 
that pejoratively, just that it was not their custom.  Without 
explicit, detailed agreements to restore individual laws, he 
doubted that many religious institutions, regardless of faith, 
would make progress because of institutional resistance and 
Diyanet suspicion. 
 
7.  (SBU) He noted that the congregation was about 600-strong, 
healthy, had had about 60 converts in recent years and is 
largely self-supporting.  He said that security officials were 
allowing Christians in Mersin to have their religion revised on 
their identity cards as \"Christian\" vice the automatic \"Muslim\" 
entry recorded at hospitals, once church baptismal records 
confirmed the Christian\'s petition for revision.  He said that 
is also occurring elsewhere in the Catholic community in Adana 
(where it is quite small), Iskenderun (the Bishop of Anatolia \'s 
seat - others being Bishops of Istanbul and Izmir) and Antakya. 
 
8.  (SBU) The church had had little trouble receiving money from 
abroad, he said, adding that its difficulties were in sending 
funds out, and that the Papal Nuncio in Ankara had assisted them 
on the occasions when this had occurred.  He said these 
financial issues were not major concerns; rather, his problems 
lay in having to rely only on Catholic printed material 
published in Istanbul, since law prevented it from entering from 
outside Turkey, and gaining long-term residency and/or 
citizenship for clergy working in Turkey.  Twice, he said, his 
requests for citizenship had been rejected despite being in 
Turkey 41 years and he had only in 2003 received his first 
5-year residency visa, having until then always received visas 
in one or two-year increments. 
 
Freedom to veil 
--------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) A senior Adana AK party leader asserted to PO in an 
August meeting that \"tolerance and freedom\" are much of what AK 
is about. \"It is so important for us,\" he claimed.  \"There is a 
large Sunni faithful population that feels controlled and 
observed and limited by the State and this is part of what is 
attractive about the possibility of freedom in the EU process,\" 
he explained.  \"Educating our women is important to us, but they 
want, and we want for them, the freedom to study while wearing 
turbans and receiving a modern education,\" he averred, adding, 
\"That is why the Prime Minister\'s children are in the U.S., as 
are so many other AK Party members\' female children.  You care 
about what they are learning, not what they wear.  That is also 
what we want.\"  [Comment:  Secular Turks disagree with this view 
that the turban-style headscarf is purely a religious symbol; 
secular Turks say Islamists use the headscarf as a political 
symbol.  End comment.] 
 
Adana\'s Jewish Community 
------------------------ 
 
10.  (SBU) A prominent Adana Jewish leader told PO in August 
that the community\'s synagogue is safe and afforded protection 
by the government.  Istanbul congregations had urged the 
community to take more physical security since last year, but 
the group in Adana felt that the suggested costly physical 
barriers would raise their profile and draw more attention than 
their defensive contribution might merit.  He said that the 
synagogue had yet to receive free electricity, but also had not 
tried to do so.  It was not an issue to him.  He said that the 
small Jewish community here was concerned about the recent 
criticism of Israel by PM Erdogan and hoped that it would be an 
\"isolated incident.\" 
 
11.  (SBU) He said the biggest issue was the dwindling of the 
small Cukurova Jewish community as youth emigrate to Istanbul or 
abroad.  He mentioned that his nephews and nieces are in 
Belgium, his son in graduate school in Chicago and his is 
daughter married and in Istanbul.  He said that Jewish faith is 
\"drying up\" in Anatolia and predicted it will not last another 
generation, but attributed this to \"self-selection, not 
government problems.\"  He noted that rabbis infrequently come 
down to Adana from Istanbul or abroad and welcomed any American 
Jewish interaction from the small numbers stationed at Incirlik. 
 
12.  (SBU) Comment:  There is broad room for improvement on 
implementation of religious freedom reforms in Turkey.  With the 
bureaucratic obstacles that are placed in the way of some faith 
groups attempting to obtain legal status, the Turkish state and 
government send a negative message and create de facto 
restrictions on religious freedom.  And despite the acquittal of 
Diyarbakir\'s Protestant pastor, that a case was opened against 
him to begin with - for holding an unauthorized gathering in an 
\"illegal\" church - is an affront to religious freedom.  Finally, 
as for societal attitudes, the AKP party official\'s mention, in 
one breath, of tolerance and the \"large Sunni faithful\" should 
be considered side by side with the less than tolerant views of 
many in the Sunni community toward Alevis, Shia and other 
religions.  End comment.

American Consulate and other banks have been increased. 
 
6.      ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Twenty-five Human Shield Initiative 
(HSI) members from Istanbul set off for the Cirav Mountain in 
Siirt, along with 14 Siirt HSI members. HSI aims to bring the 
military operations and clashes in the region to an end. An HSI 
spokesman, Yakup Kadri Karaboga, said the group\'s demands were 
clear: a bilateral truce, a general political amnesty, removal 
of impediments to freedom of expression, compensation of war 
victims, returns to evacuated villages, an end to military 
operations and an end to solitary confinement for Abdullah 
Ocalan. 
 
7.      ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Soldiers evacuated Kocanis village, 
previously the only village in the Bercalan Pasture of Hakkari 
province that had not been evacuated. GOT forces dropped 
chemical material from helicopters and evacuated many villagers

filed petitions asking the Mersin Municipality to close down the 
installations for operating without a license (including TUTA, 
OPET, ATAS, Petrol Ofisi, GS Petroleum, and Shell Gaz 
companies), and for \"being detrimental to environment and 
society.\" The residents are getting ready to press charges 
against those companies at the European Human Rights Court for 
\"violating the right to life.\" 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
11.     MILLIYET: Thirteen sheep and four calves died from 
foot-and-mouth disease in Ulubatli and Mutlu quarters of Adana. 
No animal transportation was allowed in the area, which was put 
under quarantine right after the incident. The area was

killing five DHKP-C militants, including two females. One 
Jandarma sergeant was also killed in the ensuing clashes. 
 
3.      EVRENSEL: In Hakkari, a mine exploded yesterday at a 
location between Yenimahalle and Bercelan Pasture where it is 
alleged that the security forces have thrown chemical material 
from helicopters on the forests in the region. A cow was killed

wearing headscarves to enter the campus, but the decision was 
later changed. Female students said they had come to school for 
education, but some teachers did not allow students wearing

SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PASSES COMPENSATION LAW FOR EVACUATED VILLAGERS; 
NO IMPLEMENTATION YET 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary: Turkey\'s new law on compensation for 
citizens who have incurred damages due to terrorism and the 
fight against terrorism since 1987 calls for formation of 
province-level commissions to determine compensation. 
Implementing regulations for the law have not been announced, 
nor have any provincial commissions yet been formed.  However, 
claimants are already flocking to human rights organizations 
with outlines of their claims.  Information about how the 
government will fund implementation of this law, and, indeed, 
about what its total cost might be, is not readily available. 
Given these large question marks hanging over implementation, 
the law\'s eventual impact on village returns is hard to foresee. 
 However, the law\'s language reflecting partial acceptance of 
State responsibility for the village evacuations of the 1990s is 
a welcome development to some human rights activists in the 
southeast.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Human rights contacts in Turkey\'s southeast have been 
following with great interest developments related to Law 5233 
on the Compensation of Losses Stemming from Terror and the Fight 
Against Terror, passed on July 27, 2004.  This law addresses the 
conditions under which citizens who incurred damages due to 
terrorism and the fight against terrorism will be compensated by 
the state. Early drafts of this law specified that it would 
cover losses incurred during the period July 19, 1987 through 
November 30, 2002 (i.e. during the state of emergency in the 
southeast).  In its final version, however, the law is 
open-ended.  It states that claimants for losses incurred since 
July 19, 1987 must apply within one year of the law\'s passage, 
and that those who incur losses from terrorism and 
anti-terrorism efforts from this day forward must apply for 
compensation within sixty days of the loss. 
 
3.  (U) The law calls for the formation of province-level 
commissions to evaluate claims and determine the level of 
compensation to be offered.  Each commission will be chaired by 
a Deputy Governor and will comprise representatives from the 
Finance, Public Works and Resettlement, Agriculture and Village 
Affairs, Health, Industry and Trade Ministries.  Damages 
previously compensated through court cases, insurance, or other 
sources will not be considered under this law.  In addition, 
losses stemming from voluntary migration for other than 
security-related reasons will not be considered.  The law 
specifies a formula for calculating compensation of injury, 
disability and death. (Note:  Lawyers in two different cities 
offered the same estimate of the payment for the death of a 
family member, for example:  12.5 billion TL per person killed, 
or approximately USD 8400.  Post cannot confirm this 
calculation.  End note.)  As for property losses, the law refers 
to value estimation principles outlined in the Nationalization 
Law 2942. 
 
Diyarbakir Bar Input on Drafting 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Diyarbakir Bar Association representatives told poloff 
they had been able to give input as this law was being drafted, 
and they pointed to two specific improvements that resulted from 
their intervention.  The Bar suggested to drafters that they use 
language referring to compensation for any result of terrorism, 
not just to damage resulting from terrorists.  The law\'s 
resulting reference to damage from anti-terrorism measures, they 
claim, implies some degree of responsibility-taking by the state 
for the social upheaval in the region during the 1990s.  (Note: 
In the past, activists claim, in order to get any kind of 
similar compensation when filing with the courts or provincial 
government, petitioners had to attest that their losses were due 
to PKK terrorist actions.  End note.)  In addition, initial 
drafts of the law said that those who had left their villages 
out of \"negligence\" would not be able to apply; thanks to Bar 
efforts, they say, the final version stated instead that those 
who \"voluntarily left for reasons other than security\" would not 
be compensated. 
 
5.  (SBU) Bar members in Diyarbakir who have kept the issue of 
returns high on their agenda, and who advocated successfully 
that a recent visit by EU Commissioner Verheugen include a visit 
to an evacuated village, see this law as a potentially important 
development.  They told poloff they thought a Bar representative 
would be appointed to participate on each provincial commission. 
 In late August, Diyarbakir contacts told poloff that 
implementing regulations were expected o/a September 15.  On 
October 4, however, they stated that the regulations had not yet 
been developed, nor had any provincial commissions as specified 
in the law been formed. 
 
\"Most Important Damage Won\'t Be Compensated\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) A number of rights activists in the region agreed that 
the law\'s wording implied the state was taking some degree of 
responsibility for damages during the 1990s, but they were quick 
to point out the law\'s weaknesses, as well.  The Bingol HRA 
leader reported that he had lobbied for changes to the draft 
law, but that his suggestions were not considered.  He said that 
material damage was the focus of the law, but that psychological 
damage was more important and more urgently required attention 
in Bingol, where the evacuations of the previous decade had 
affected 211 settlements with 2,920 families for a total of 
17,113 residents.  He had suggested the law offer a variety of 
psycho-social services to those who had suffered damages. 
Moreover, he added, there were 15 years of lost income to take 
into account when talking compensation.  In addition to the 
houses these people lost, he argued, entire village 
infrastructures were lost, including schools, mosques, 
infirmaries, livestock pens, silos and sheds.  Some people can 
go back to harvest now, he said, but there is no way to live in 
some of those places.  \"They should have consulted with us 
more,\" he said, \"We could have contributed to people seeing 
return as a more attractive option.\"  He argued that the 
government should be offering to build new structures to 
encourage return instead of paying out compensation. 
 
They Want to Tell Their Stories 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) After the law\'s passage, and in the absence of 
implementing regulations and a clear application process, many 
would-be applicants are working through the non-governmental 
Human Rights Association (HRA), and in some cases, local Bar 
Associations, as they prepare their claims for eventual 
submissions the Commissions.  As of early September, HRA-Siirt 
had received applications from residents of 50 villages, and 
HRA-Mardin says it has received some 1500 requests for 
assistance in preparing claims.  The HRA has prepared a 
questionnaire that branches are administering to all those who 
approach the organization for assistance in applying for 
compensation.  An HRA-Mardin branch representative said the 
organization hopes the surveys will be able to reach close to 80 
percent of all those who had been evacuated from their villages, 
and collect more comprehensive information than ever before 
about the experiences of families who fled from the violence. 
\"They don\'t just want money,\" said one human rights activist, 
\"They want to tell their story.\"  So far, said our Mardin 
contact, only about 5 percent of those filling out the survey 
indicated that the PKK was responsible for their dislocation; 
the rest, he said, were evacuated by the government. 
 
But where will the money come from? 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) One thing that may be slowing down the implementation of 
this law is the fact that no one can explain exactly where the 
money will come from to fund it.  One Diyarbakir contact said 
that his impression is that the government is hoping to mostly 
provide in-kind compensation, such as materials for housing, but 
that past EU and World Bank projects offering iron, cement and 
sand as incentives to return were not found to be attractive. 
Some lawyers speculate that ultimately funding of the law\'s 
implementation will have to come from major external 
contributions, perhaps from the European Union. 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  One human rights activist in Diyarbakir 
asserts that at least 75 percent of the estimated 3688 villages 
evacuated during the violence of the 1990s are still empty.  The 
Compensation Law is not likely to lead to a rush back to 
villages any time soon, especially given the renewed violence in 
the region between security forces and PKK terrorists. 
Nevertheless, contacts in the southeast have been talking about 
this legislation for two months, and are waiting to see if 
something will come of it.  Some see it as significant simply 
because the government, in the way the law is written, seems to 
be acknowledging some degree of responsibility for the 
evacuations of the 1990s.  Others see value in the fact that 
these internally displaced persons will be able to \"tell their 
stories\" through the claims process, thus painting a more clear, 
collective picture of what happened in the region during those 
turbulent times.  In the absence of funding and implementing 
regulations, however, the law\'s potential impact is difficult to 
envision.  EU interest in the issue of village returns may 
eventually provide an impetus for the government to get down to 
the details on implementation of this law.  End comment.

caught red-handed while trying to sell the material to police 
and was imprisoned. 
 
3.  ZAMAN: Former CHP Hakkari Lawmaker Mikail Ilcin said around 
40-50 million Kurds lived in the world, and asked if the world 
would come to an end if the Kurds who having been struggling for 
seventy years in Iraq founded a state. Ilcin defined himself as 
a Turkish/Kurdish nationalist of Turkey. Ilcin said a Kurdish 
state, which would hoist its flag in Northern Iraq, would not 
undermine Turkey. 
 
4.  MILLIYET: Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul expressed 
his concern about the PKK/Kongra-Gel organization\'s presence in 
Iraq to the new Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey, Cemil Umran. 
Ambassador Umran responded that because Iraq had not fully

Iraqi administration to address its neighbor\'s security 
expectations. 
 
5.  CUMHURIYET: In order to abolish the \"Temporary Village Guard 
System,\" the Interior Ministry has been working on a draft law, 
which will affect 58,400 guards currently on the payroll and 
26,967 voluntary ones. According to the draft law, the village 
guards aged 45 with 10 years of active service will be entitled 
to retirement, an annuity, and health coverage.  Village guards 
aged 45 but with less than 10 years of service will be 
compensated by severance pay. Village guards have been accused 
of assisting and harboring PKK elements, arms smuggling, drug 
trafficking, abducting girls and rape, and are seen as the 
biggest impediment to return to evacuated villages. 
 
6.  CUMHURIYET: Hakkari Governor Erdogan Gurbuz announced that

10. EVRENSEL/ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: NGOs and political parties in 
Tunceli asked GOT officials to stop military operations that are 
causing fires in the forests in Tunceli. They demanded the 
government undertake steps to resolve the Kurdish issue. 
EMEP-Tunceli Provincial Chairman Huseyin Tunc said that military 
operations covered the entire region, and the resulting 
violation of the \"right to life\" could result in a new wave of 
migration.  Tunceli Bar Association President Huseyin Aygun 
stated that forests in the region were being burnt under the 
pretext of combating terrorism, and that people were prevented 
from extinguishing the forest fires.  Attorney Aygun said the 
perpetrators of the fires should be held accountable. Eighteen 
young Human Shield Initiative (HSI) members from Sanliurfa set 
off for Tunceli in an effort to halt operations there and to 
establish a bilateral truce. In Sanliurfa, around 200 persons

MILLIYET/SABAH/RADIKAL/TURKIYE/EVRENSEL/TERCU MAN/YENI SAFAK: 
Former DEP Deputy Leyla Zana, during her visit to Brussels as 
the guest of the European Parliament (EP), objected to the 
European Commission\'s Report calling the Kurds a minority.  Zana 
said, \"Kurds are not a minority but a member of the majority. 
This definition has hurt us a lot.\" Zana said Kurdish and 
Turkish people needed a new constitution, which would consider 
them as equal people. Zana added that the armed persons in the 
mountains should be reintegrated into society, and that 
applications such as the Compensation Law hurt the honor of the 
Kurdish people. She added that the EU was a bridge between Turks 
and Kurds, and that Turkey should be accepted as a member of the 
European Union.

SUBJECT: MINORITY LABEL GRATES ON SOUTHEAST TURKEY 
 
REF: ADANA 133 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  Kurdish and Alevi community contacts grated 
at both recent EU and Turkish-government linked reports 
characterizing their respective communities as \"minorities\" in 
discussions last week with PO.  The Malatya Security Director\'s 
recent warning to local media appears aimed at Sunni religious 
radicalism, not use of Kurdish language.  Finally, contacts in 
Malatya, Tunceli and Diyarbakir also expressed frustration with 
the government\'s slow start in processing of the new 
compensation law (law 5233), criticizing new requirements for 
documentation of past losses which set such a high documentation 
threshold as to cause contacts to question the sincerity of the 
government\'s offer to compensate regional residents for their 
losses in the past almost twenty years of regional civil strife. 
 They also noted that the values put on loss restitution by the 
new law were only fractions of those used in parallel European 
Court of Human Rights claims.  They nevertheless welcomed the 
government offer, in principle, along with the recent 
regulations softening the sentences of already convicted PKK and 
other terrorist-linked prisoners as \"contributing somewhat\" to 
early momentum toward potential future regional reconciliation. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  In October 24-28 meetings with PO, southeastern 
Turkish Alevi community contacts repeatedly cited their 
pre-Seljuk era penetration of eastern Anatolia over a thousand 
years ago and claim to almost one-third of Turkey\'s estimated 72 
million population as proof that \"Alevi\'s are no minority.\" 
(Comment: Judging the exact scope of Turkey\'s Alevi population 
is difficult, but estimates generally range from 15-20 percent 
of Turkey\'s population.  End Comment.)  Grating at both how the 
EU October 6 report and a recent Turkish government report 
labeled them as \"minorities,\" Alevi community leaders either 
called for the outright dissolution of the Sunni-dominated 
Government Religious Affairs Ministry or its reform to include 
considerable funding for non-Sunni Moslem and other faiths, 
expressly including Jewish and Christian faith support among 
their demands, too. 
 
3. (SBU)  Most Alevi lay leaders and several prominent regional 
dedes, an Alevi religious and community leader, specifically 
called for: 1) government funding of cemevi\'s, or religious 
worship sites; 2) government funding of, or free provision of, 
utilities, as their Sunni counterparts now enjoy; 3) training 
seminaries for dedes; and 4) government transportation 
assistance to help transport their congregations to cemevi\'s, 
which by Alevi tradition and practice are more widely scattered 
than Sunni mosques, which are found in most neighborhoods.  A 
minority of Alevi contacts and dedes also called for re-writing 
of the official Islamic history textbook used in all Turkish 
middle schools and elimination of the religion declaration on 
Turkish national identity cards.  One Alevi leader, who is also 
a dede, said that the ideal situation would be for the Religious 
Affairs Ministry to \"be abolished entirely, getting government 
out of religion entirely in Turkey, but that is not reality now. 
 Without the Religious Affairs ministry among the radical 
Sunni\'s out there today, we would have ten times more (Turkish) 
Hizbullahs than we worry about now already.  It just won\'t work 
not to have a Religious Affairs ministry now.  We just want our 
fair share.\" 
 
4. (SBU)  While repeatedly criticizing Prime Minister Reccep 
Tayyip Erdogan\'s public characterization of Alevi practices as 
\"cultural, and not (those) of a religion,\" some Alevi\'s balanced 
their strong criticism of the AK party\'s perceived Sunni 
discrimination toward them with observations of how local 
government ministry representatives were more sympathetic to 
their situation, even citing one pair of successive governors in 
one southeast province who had funneled almost 2 billion Turkish 
lira worth of construction materials over several years for 
construction of the only modern cemevi in the almost exclusively 
Alevi province of Tunceli. 
 
Malatya media warning seemingly not about Kurdish tongue, but 
religion 
 
5. (SBU) An early October warning to Malatya\'s media by the 
provincial security director turned out not to concern use of 
Kurdish in local television and radio, but rather to reflect 
perceived government concerns about Sunni religious radicalism. 
Several contacts mentioned that government security officials 
largely had ignored recent occasional usage of Kurdish by local 
radio broadcasters, but explained that the recent Security 
Director\'s warning to media not to use non-Turkish language in 
broadcast media seemed to follow directly on the use of a small 
Malatya radio station by a \"Kurdish radical Sunni group which 
advocated introduction of sharia (Islamic law) in Turkey, 
forcibly if necessary.\"  \"The timing seems like it was the 
Kurdish Islamic\'s Party\'s broadcast which was the problem, not 
the Kurdish itself which was the problem,\" one prominent media 
contact offered. 
 
Kurdish contacts express disdain at minority label 
 
6. (SBU)  \"There are twenty-five million of us. How can we be a 
minority?\" questioned a Kurdish contact in Diyarbakir. \"We want 
to be treated with the respect we deserve, by the government and 
the EU.\"  Pressed about the specific form in which such respect 
would need to materialize to be satisfactory, the contact 
replied.\" The freedom to use our language in broadcast, not a 
few token government broadcasts a week about subjects of their 
choosing.  We want something like Roja and (comment: largely 
pro-PKK. End Comment.) Medya TV (Note: two popular Kurdish 
language broadcasts followed in Turkey which broadcast via 
satellite from outside the region. End Note.) in Turkey.  We 
want our children to learn about Kurdish history in school, at 
least as an (elective) and to learn Kurdish language the same 
way.   Turkish children should also be able to learn about these 
things if they want, too, in an environment free of fear and 
repression.\"  These comments were echoed by many Kurdish 
contacts, some of whom are sending their children to the new 
Kurdish language schools in Diyarbakir or elsewhere to learn how 
to read Kurdish.  However, our contacts also noted that many 
were not sending their children due to fear, lack of funding for 
private schooling or concern that government minders would note 
their childrens\' attendance and exact later (comment: 
unspecified, but widely believed and cited. End Comment.) 
retribution for the perceived act of defiance. 
 
7. (SBU)  Some Kurdish print media, however, is not awaiting the 
outcome of the give and take on radio and television broadcast 
issues.  PO visited a small Zaza (the Kurdish dialect common 
among Anatolian Alevis) publishing house in Tunceli, which 
started a partial Zaza weekly newspaper, Munzur Haber, with 
accompanying website (), several 
months ago. It covers Tunceli provincial news in Turkish, Zaza 
and Kurdish (Kermanji - the dominant Kurdish dialect in Turkey 
and northwestern Iraq).  While it has little or no advertising 
base, private sources are supporting its circulation of about 
2-3,000 readers for now.  In Diyarbakir, there is no Kurdish 
language paper, but a national pro-Kurdish paper printed in 
Istanbul is widely sold and circulated there. 
 
Government contacts see another side of the coin 
 
8. (SBU)  Government contacts, including several prominent 
governors in the region, noted that they heard regional concerns 
about how the \"minority\" label was playing poorly in the region 
and recognized that the GOT and the EU were going to have to 
\"come to a meeting of the minds about what that word may mean 
now, something different from in the Lausanne treaty.  The 
future will be different in how these groups are approached, but 
what that is we do not know yet.\" Nonetheless none of the 
regional governors knew how or when such a new understanding 
would be reached, frequently citing a continuing \"lack of trust 
in each other and confidence about a shared sense of where we 
want to go\" among EU and Turkish interlocutors on Turkey\' 
soon-anticipated EU accession process. 
 
9. (SBU) On language issues, one governor pointed out the 
multiple new (private) Kurdish language institutes in the 
region, but observed that their attendance is low.  He 
attributed this phenomenon to a greater Kurdish youth desire to 
learn English or an EU-language than Kurdish.  \"One generation 
clings to this desire to learn Kurdish and some of their 
children do, too, without really knowing what they would do with 
it,\" he contended, \"but in our schools, Turkish and Kurdish 
children demand to learn English, not Kurdish or something else. 
 The new generation does not always seem to want what their 
fathers say they want.\"  Another governor followed this line in 
explaining that private media broadcasting using Kurdish \" is 
not blossoming because there is not an advertising base to 
support it. The government is not the problem now.  There is a 
law saying that (the Kurdish community in Turkey) can do this, 
but they cannot because there is not enough advertising money 
for it.  That is why the government official channel stepped in 
SUBJECT: MINORITY LABEL GRATES ON SOUTHEAST TURKE 
with official broadcasters to provide some Krdish broadcasting. 
 Without it, there would be one to show the law was real now,\" 
he explained. 
 
Important common denominatrs favring ialogu and stability 
 
10. (SU)  Wth theexcepton of one prominent Kurdish contact 
who conceded his views reflect a minority of current Kurdish 
thinking, both Alevi and Kurdish contacts stated that their 
desires for broader respect and cultural recognition were being 
expressed within the broader framework of acceptance of a 
Turkish \"super-identity,\" a further acceptance of Turkish as the 
official language in Turkey and no desire to challenge Turkey\'s 
territorial integrity.  The single notable exception called for 
Kurds in Turkey to receive \"millet\" status, harking back to an 
Ottoman administrative structure which, if translated into 
modern terms, likely would allow Kurds a right of 
self-determination and a co-equal claim to foundation of the 
Turkish republic.  He said it would mean Kurdish and Turkish 
would be Turkey\'s official language as well, and that Kurds in 
southeast Turkey  \"largely would rule themselves like our 
brothers in Kurdistan in Iraq do now.\" 
 
Compensation law off to a slow and contentious start 
 
11. (SBU) Contacts in Malatya, Tunceli and Diyarbakir, 
especially among the bar associations and attorney groups, also 
expressed frustration with the government\'s slow start in 
processing of the new compensation law (law 5233), criticizing 
new requirements for documentation of past losses which set such 
a high documentation threshold as to cause contacts to question 
the sincerity of the government\'s offer to compensate regional 
residents for their losses in the past almost twenty years of 
regional civil strife. They also noted that the values put on 
loss restitution by the new law were only fractions of those 
used in parallel European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) claims. 
Citing a recent similar ECHR case, a Tunceli bar association 
representative said comparable compensation cases in Strasbourg 
would yield six to eight times the value of the GOT offers, but 
conceded that ECHR were taking three to five years to conclude. 
The GOT cases should finish sooner, he predicted, \"so many of 
those seeking claims may opt to take that route.  They have no 
funds now and the government offer is probably just what they 
will have to settle for.\" 
 
12. (SBU)  One set of contacts in Tunceli illustrated their 
concerns by explaining how rare documentation of civil strife 
was in the 1980 and 1990\'s era civil strife.  \"Much of the time, 
the whole government effort was to deny it was happening at all. 
 Who would have given some villager a document about the army or 
village guard destruction of his home like they now want for 
these claim?\" one car association president rhetorically asked. 
In another case shown to PO which was rare to date because some 
documentation from the earlier era existed, an attorney produced 
a recently-filed claim wherein a villager whose property was 
burned and allegedly looted in 1994 received government village 
affairs documentation of his loss at a somewhat later time, 
which he said his client estimated to be twice or more the 
government stated value, but which had been refuted by the 
current Jandarma when recently filed.  He showed PO a recent 
letter, under a governor\'s office forwarding letter, to the 
claims commission in which the current Jandarma claimed there 
had been no such alleged destruction and advocated outright 
dismissal of the entire claim.  \"This commission is just 
starting, so we will see,\" the bar association vice president 
offered,\" but if this is what the compensation commission is 
going to be about it will not achieve any reconciliation or help 
the region get past the problems it now sees.\" 
 
13. (SBU)  Contacts nevertheless welcomed the government offer, 
in principle, along with the recent regulations softening the 
sentences of already convicted PKK and other terrorist-linked 
prisoners as \"contributing somewhat\" to early momentum toward 
regional reconciliation.  Still, they said that GOT deeds would 
have to speak to convince skeptical regional audiences. \"People 
see these documentation requirements (in the compensation law) 
as just a way to water down something that the government did 
just because the foreigners were leaning on them.  It is up to 
the government now to prove it really wants to see 
reconciliation,\" another bar association president concluded. 
 
Law not seen as boon to village return, village guard issue an 
obstacle 
 
14.  (SBU)  Neither government nor Kurdish community contacts 
saw implementation of the compensation law spurring significant 
village return.  Government officials in Tunceli and Diyarbakir 
noted that their provinces have developed electrical, road and 
water infrastructure to about half a dozen larger villages each, 
but did not anticipate large scale villager return despite the 
expected influx of capital stemming from compensation law 
claims.  They explained that internally displaced persons 
already had created lives and ties elsewhere.  Community 
contacts echoed this reasoning, but noted that the additional 
impediment, about which the government was perceived to be doing 
almost nothing, was the continuing existence of large local 
guard forces in most southeast rural areas.   \"Even with a 
little new money, who would want to uproot themselves and their 
children to go back to face armed, probably hostile local 
villagers who would feel threatened by your return ?\" one bar 
association contact asked rhetorically. 
 
15. (SBU)  Several governors commented on the village guard 
program, when asked, noted that it had its problems and was not 
seen as a lasting element in southeast Turkish society, but 
repeatedly offered that little could be done in practice about 
the institution of arming pro-government villagers until \"the 
terrorists come done from the mountains and finish terrorizing 
our villagers.\"  One governor projected that, should Turkish 
accession to the EU occur and develop an irreversible momentum, 
a fairly rapid disarming of local guards in tandem with a 
five-year gradual phase out of local guard salaries might be \"a 
risk that the government could afford in a broader regional 
stabilization initiative.\"  He cautioned that this was 
unofficial thinking, but a reasonable possible future option. 
One government contact also touched on the related issue of the 
considerable role that meager village guard salaries play in 
southeast Turkey\'s almost subsistence level non-urban economy, 
but had few concrete ideas about what alternative revenues might 
replace that regional income component should the village guards 
be dissolved.   He only made a passing reference to perhaps 
\"something coming from EU regional development funds,\" but 
cautioned that those funds usually are devoted to infrastructure 
projects and that unclear change in EU common agricultural 
policy (CAP) funding made its applicability toward the village 
guard issue unclear. 
 
16. (SBU)  Comment:  Discussions with contacts in the region 
clearly yielded deep psychological scars and sensitivities 
stemming from their collective perceptions of  how their ethnic 
and religious communities have been marginalized by decades of 
government policy.  The use of the term \"minority\" by the EU and 
the recent government-sponsored human rights board brought to 
the surface deeply felt and frequently bitter emotions.  This 
may point the way toward an eventual reconciliation process both 
in southeast Turkey and elsewhere in the nation, but, for now, 
the path ahead for that progress in developing a more durable 
civil society seems long and likely full of many fits and 
starts.  End Comment.

MP\'s, including recent Andrei Sakharov award winner Leyla Zana. 
Additionally, every Kurdish community contact whom PO 
encountered last week dismissed the recent announcement by 
Turkish tribal leader Dervis Akgul of a new party in Turkey 
aligned with Marsoud Barzani and his Iraqi Kurdish Democratic 
Party as \"insignificant and politically unviable.\" End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Various Pro- Kurdish Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP) 
contacts in differing levels of detail signaled strongly to PO 
in late October visits to Diyarbakir and elsewhere in southeast 
Turkey that DEHAP core political leaders over the next three to 
six weeks will declare their support for the new Democratic 
Societal Movement (Demokratik Toplum Hareketi) political 
initiative declared recently by the four Kurdish former MP\'s, 
including recent Andrei Sakharov award winner Leyla Zana. 
Contacts say that the determination to take this 
\"transformational step\" has emerged independent of pending court 
cases which may result in orders to close DEHAP. 
 
3. (SBU) They see the movement being buoyed by these 
declarations of prominent support leading to a platform debate, 
legal formation of a new nationwide, leftist party and 
leadership decisions by February to early March 2005.  They say 
that DEHAP party resources will support this new party\'s 
development and anticipate DEHAP rank-and-file \"will follow 
where we lead,\" one prominent DEHAP provincial party leader 
said.  Their goal is to establish a major leftist party with 
nationwide reach by early 2005 \"which can keep the Kurdish issue 
on the national agenda as well as unify some (Comment: largely 
unspecified. End comment) leftist national social issues.\"  One 
contact did speculate that the new political party also would 
focus on better health and education services for Turkey\'s poor, 
but clearly cautioned that no one can accurately prejudge the 
outcome of anticipated province level party caucuses on the new 
party\'s platform. 
 
4. (SBU) Few DEHAP contacts would offer their thoughts on who 
might eventually lead the new party, but several repeated Zana\'s 
press comments that she would demur from doing so.  Several 
contacts, including one close to recently-elected and popular 
Diyarbakir mayor Osman Baydemir, noted that Baydemir planned a 
high profile endorsement announcement soon after his return from 
an ongoing trip to EU countries to lobby on behalf of Turkey\'s 
EU accession candidacy. 
 
5. (SBU) Several DEHAP contacts projected fragmentation within 
the leftist nationalist DSP and CHP party ranks over the coming 
year or two, and anticipate receiving blocs of voters from those 
parties to bolster their ranks.  \"(Current CHP party leader) 
Deniz Baykal already sees this threat and that is why he is 
trying to undermine the new movement before it even starts in 
press comments now,\" one Diyarbakir mayor\'s office and DEHAP 
official commented.  They also pointed to a DEHAP victory in 
Tunceli, a former CHP bastion where Alevi\'s shifted votes to 
DEHAP in last March\'s municipal elections, as a harbinger of 
future voting trends.  Asked about DEHAP losses of former 
prominent municipal posts in Van and Siirt, and elsewhere in the 
southeast at sub-province levels during the past election, one 
DEHAP strategist conceded that the vote showed the party that it 
could not be complacent about its regional support.  However, he 
then offered that overall DEHAP votes changed little and 
repeated the other contact\'s optimism about the \"breakthrough 
with the Kurdish Alevi bloc in Tunceli.\" 
 
6. (SBU) Additionally, every Kurdish community contact whom PO 
encountered last week dismissed the recent announcement by 
Turkish tribal leader Dervis Akgul of a new Iraqi Kurdish 
Democratic Party-aligned and Barzani-linked party as 
\"insignificant and politically unviable.\"  One DEHAP province 
level leader pointed out that this tribal connection yielded 
only several thousand voters in recent municipal polling and 
said that the tribal leader may even be pushing further on the 
issue than Barzani himself would wish. 
 
7. (SBU) In general, one contact with over a decade of DEHAP and 
its predecessor party organizational experience, pointed that 
small parties in southeast Turkey fare poorly.  For example, he 
noted how an independent Kurdish candidate, Melik Firat, had run 
for parliament in the most recent national elections, spending 
much money and time in a developed electoral campaign and still 
received only three to five thousand votes. 
 
 8. (SBU) Comment: DEHAP has been preceded in recent years by 
similar leftist, pro-Kurdish parties, such as HEP, DEP and 
HADEP.  Like DEHAP, each of these has been limited in scope and 
ambition by its single region and single issue appeal.  Reaching 
beyond this regional focus and successfully embracing leftists 
on a national scale is ambitious and would be a new Turkish 
political development.  Nevertheless, it is also a very tall 
order for DEHAP.  It will take more outreach and political 
organizational skills than DEHAP or its predecessors has 
demonstrated to date to develop this nascent movement into a 
nationally viable party, but the possibility of this development 
has energized DEHAP party faithful in southeast Turkey for now. 
 We will follow these reports to see whether DEHAP leadership 
support declarations occur and party caucuses are widespread. 
End Comment.

1.(SBU)  Summary: The situation for the Christian community in 
southeast Turkey remains mixed.  Christian contacts in 
Diyarbakir, Hatay, Mersin and Adana report a generally positive 
to neutral atmosphere in relations with local officials, but a 
continuing atmosphere of official suspicion and occasional acts 
of violence perpetrated by individual police members.  Recent 
events in Gaziantep (refnotice and septel) indicate continuing 
harassment of Christians in that city.  End Summary. 
 
Improving zoning for Diyarbakir Church ? 
 
2.(SBU) During a late October visit with PO, Pastor Ahmet 
Guvener of the protestant-affiliated Diyarbakir Church  said 
that he expected that the church would soon have its zoning 
obstacles lifted.  He said that he had heard this news from 
\"authoritative Turkish ministry sources in Ankara in the last 
few days,\" but still lacked any documents to substantiate the 
promise.  He was encouraged by the news, as was an American 
religious worker who assists him. As of November 22, Guvener 
remained optimistic about a permanet onig hane based on 
both verbal assuranes andinermedate zoning decisions offered 
by lower level government review committees in early November, 
but said that \"really permanent changes now would not be final 
until January 2005.\" 
 
3.(SBU)  Should the zoning ordinance obstacles be lifted, they 
anticipated remodeling their sanctuary\'s interior to reflect a 
more traditional worship area by removing artificially placed 
partitions earlier built to comply with Diyarbakir city zoning 
board direction. They also hoped to buy a small lot nearby the 
church to build a children\'s park for community children.  They 
said that doing so would entail being allowed to receive foreign 
donations to fund the purchase.  They said that city municipal 
leaders, in contrast to earlier national government resistance, 
had offered them support-in-kind for the park\'s construction 
once the church could acquire the property. 
 
Adana Christians still surviving, but not thriving 
 
4.(SBU)  The Adana-based Cukurova Christan Council\'s leader, who 
represents a collection of several hundred evangelical 
protestant Christians, said that the region\'s \"new Christian\" 
community generally was prospering, but still encountered 
official suspicion and formal questioning short of outright 
harassment and occasional individual police violence.  He noted 
that there is no actual church building in the Cukurova area, 
but that gatherings of Christians in homes in number up to 30-40 
each were known to authorities and had not experienced any 
systematic resistance or zoning challenges in Adana or Tarsus. 
Efforts to build a church in Mersin have been blocked thus far 
by zoning challenges, he said, but the effort to gain official 
zoning approval was ongoing.  He noted that the community just 
started a FM radio Christian broadcast reaching Adana, Mersin 
and Tarsus and that Adana police had summoned him last week to 
their offices to question him about its funding and the \"role of 
foreigners in supporting it.  He said that he told that it was 
partly dependent on foreign funding, had material from Hope 
Broadcasting and a Republic of Korea programming source and had 
both Turkish and foreign funding.  He said that he did not feel 
harassed and that the police did not threaten him or the radio 
broadcast. 
 
5.(SBU)  He also reported that \"recently\" an Adana policeman 
allegedly had broken the nose of a parishioner selling copies of 
the New Testament on an Adana street, at a small council-linked 
kiosk.  He said that the parishioner had gone to a state 
hospital for treatment and received appropriate medical 
attention, but been denied when he asked for a medical report to 
document his wounds.  (Comment: Without more details, which the 
contact declined to offer, we cannot confirm this report.  End 
Comment.)  Overall, he characterized the atmosphere in the 
Cukurova region (Adana, Tarsus and Mersin) as \"free of 
harassment and generally improving over the last year.\" 
Nevertheless he said that most officials that occasionally 
question him or parishioners are suspicious of: 1) why Muslims 
would convert to Christianity; 2) whether their work has foreign 
ties, which he explained was perceived as explicitly negative; 
and 3) from whence their funding stemmed. 
 
6. (SBU)  A leading Adana protestant church was informed by 
local Turkish National Police (TNP) on November 21  that 
unspecified threats against the Christian community in Adana had 
been received  by authorities.  The TNP urged church leaders to 
be cautious during the upcoming Christian holiday period. 
Christian community leaders expressed reassurance that the TNP 
constructively had reached out to them and reflected positively 
that TNP had offered additional protection for their church\'s 
neighborhood during December 2003. 
 
Hatay - continuing good story 
 
7. (SBU)   In recent PO meetings with Catholic and Eastern 
Orthodox leaders in the ethnically mixed Hatay province, no 
major religious freedom issues arose.  Catholic and Eastern 
Orthodox leaders, as well as even Arab ethnic Alawi 
representatives, offered positive comments about their 
relationship to the local government, including praising a 
regular governor-led interfaith council which met several times 
annually.  Both the Hatay governor and the Catholic priest in 
Antakya (modern site of ancient Antioch and seat of the province 
government) talked of a Vatican-supported project to develop a 
new museum for the city\'s world-famous mosaic collection which 
also could house a pilgrimage hostel for Christian visitors to 
the nearby St. Peter\'s Grotto.  Eastern  Orthodox leaders in 
nearby Iskenderun reflected to the PO that they enjoyed a 
positive relationship with government authorities, although they 
had concerns about \"surprisingly liberal zoning decisions\" which 
recently allowed a  non-historic multi-floor parking garage to 
be erected next door to their main church in the region. 
Nevertheless, they said that literature, funding and training 
travel for their clergy (who generally study in Lebanon) was not 
an issue.  They, like Jewish community leaders elsewhere in 
southeast Turkey, lamented that their community\'s chief 
challenge was economic because of high local unemployment and 
the flight of their youth to Istanbul, western Europe and the 
U.S. 
 
Mersin - zoning barriers, encroachment, but stable community 
 
8.(SBU)  Contacts with Mersin Catholic leaders reflect no 
significant changes since ref. B reporting.  The protestant 
evangelical community there continues to face zoning challenges 
to its effort to establish a church, which were it allowed, 
would be situated in the historical quarter of the city nearby 
existing Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.  Many Christian 
community leaders reflect that considerable stress has been 
placed on the historically Christian religious district of the 
city by its location in what has become the upscale center of 
the city, leading to encroachment on lands caused by first 
unregulated urbanization and later very conservative zoning 
backlashes which affect the wider district in an effort to 
regulate sprawling growth in the area.  For now, the protestant 
evangelical community continues to meet in personal homes and is 
several hundred strong, although dispersed among several 
different districts of the city.  Overall the Christian 
community in Mersin is quite wealthy and well-placed in 
influential city circles.  It is stable in size, although there 
does seem to be a trend of conversion from the Eastern Orthodox 
to the Catholic church.  Security authorities, when confirmed by 
baptismal records, have allowed identity cards\' reference to 
religion to state \"Christian.\" 
 
9.(SBU)  Comment:  The situation for the Christian community in 
southeast Turkey is mixed.  Recently two different Christian 
contacts independently interpreted regional events by noting 
that Turkish officials reluctantly are tolerating Christian 
activities \"where foreigners are shining a light, but that 
nothing has changed in the government framework to allow 
isolated breakthroughs in tolerance to be applied elsewhere.\" 
Historic Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian communities, 
especially in Mersin and Hatay, have struck modus vivendi and 
seem under little or no pressure, but that pattern has yet to 
emerge for protestant evangelical communities, which seem to 
encounter varying levels of official and communal suspicion and 
resistance.  End Comment.

1.  Adana greatly appreciates the support from EB for two 
projects during 2004.  Thanks to BFIF funding post was also able 
to send the American Corner/Gaziantep Director to Ankara for 
consulations with FCS staff from May 26-29, 2004.  (Note:  The 
American Corner is housed in the Gaziantep Chamber of Industry 
and is a partner in promoting understanding and cooperation 
between the U.S. and Turkey.  End note.)  The trip resulted in 
an improvement in the commercial information provided to the 
business community in the area covered by Consulate Adana.   The 
American Corner director met with several FCS staff members 
regarding all FCS activities; in addition she was trained on 
internet sector and firm research, briefed on \"doing business in 
Iraq\" themes, provided with numerous books and website resources 
for the Gaziantep center, and provided information about FAS/ag 
finance.  In the months after her training she fielded numerous 
inquiries including, to name just a few, requests for commercial 
and trade links to U.S. companies searching for lists of carpet 
and fabric producers, paint and chemical companies and 
industrial kitchen equipment providers.

attended by all of the major U.S. companies doing business in 
Turkey, the small and medium U.S. firms doing business or 
looking to expand here, and their Turkish counterparts.  BFIF 
support to this non-FSC post allowed us to continue to showcase 
SE Turkey as a potential new market for American goods and 
services and to reach out in ways that would not be possible 
without this funding.  Financial accounting for the projects is

This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for November 30, 
2004.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
ZAMAN/YENI SAFAK/CUMHURIYET/EVRENSEL: The Turkish Parliament\'s 
Human Rights Commission, comprising ruling and opposition MPs, 
went to Kiziltepe, Mardin yesterday to investigate the shooting 
of a father and his 12-year-old son in Kiziltepe, Mardin.  The 
commission went to Mardin yesterday to investigate the incident. 
 The Governorship of Mardin declared that the incident, which 
took place last week, was a result of a clash with the 
\'terrorists\'.  However, the Human Rights Association (HRA) 
declared that the incident was an \'extrajudicial killing\'. The 
HRA report said that Ahmet Kaymaz was a truck driver and his 
son, Ugur Kaymaz, was a student at Dicle Primary School. The 
report claimed that the father and son were shot from a close 
distance by security forces, which, according to the report, 
proved that they were killed \'deliberately or by mistake\' 
(allegedly). The commission members said that they will 
investigate the matter in a detailed manner before preparing a 
report. Cumhuriyet reports that Republican People\'s Party (CHP) 
decided to send a separate committee to Mardin. 
 
GUNDEM: \"Perpetrators still holding their offices, 
protesters in jail.\"  Police officers and the Governor of Mardin 
who claimed that Ahmet Kaymaz and his son were \'terrorists\' are 
still holding their offices.  However, protesters of the killing 
(allegedly), Adil Basaran, Azad Karahan and Ismail Asi were put 
in jail when they \'showed resistance to police 
officers\'(allegedly). 
 
GUNDEM: A 19-year-old shepherd, Fevzi Can, (allegedly) was 
shot dead by Jandarma forces in the township of Orencik in 
Semdinli, Hakkari.  The relatives of Can, who came to take the 
dead body, were forced to sign an official document stating that 
he was \"a terrorist killed because he did not obey the warning 
to stop.\" It is anticipated that the European Parliament will 
express sharp warnings to Turkey regarding the event.  Gundem 
says this event validates political observers who had forecasted 
that opponents of EU accession may \"start killing people\" before 
the upcoming EU decision about Turkey in December. 
 
GUNDEM: In Batman, the \"Peace Keepers\" group from the Batman 
Democracy Platform wanted to plant seedlings at the peak of Mawa 
Mountain as a symbol of peace and in memory of soldiers and 
guerillas who have died in the region\'s conflicts. However, 
soldiers prohibited the group from climbing the mountain. 
 
GUNDEM: \'Penalizing people that paste or hang posters on the 
walls is an irrational act!\' reports Gundem. Engin Kirmizigul 
and some other students have been charged with hanging posters 
on the walls of Hacettepe Medical School cafeteria and could 
face up to 12 years of imprisonment.  The posters were saying 
\'No to War. War is Murder\' and \'Get your Identity Card to Access 
Free Medical Service\'.  They have protested the charges brought 
against them. 
 
GUNDEM: The Yezid\'is returning to their village in Feqira, 
Batman, after 15 years of conflict in the region, are being 
oppressed.  Peasants and some fanatic people in the neighboring 
townships are continuously threatening the four Yezidi families, 
whose members are mainly elderly persons, says the Federation of 
Yezidi Associations. 
 
GUNDEM: Former U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith, who has also 
served as an advisor to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
evaluated the current status of the \"South Kurdistan\" (Note: 
This is the formulation used in Gundem newspaper, referring to 
N. Iraq.  End note.) After stating that the Kurds in northern 
Iraq have existed as if in a self-ruling country since 1991, 
Galbraith added that the Kurds no longer want to be governed 
from Baghdad, reports Gundem. 
 
YENI SAFAK:     Approximately 1000 people participated in a \"Panel 
for Humanity\" organized by Ozgur-Der/Tatvan Branch. The main 
subject matter of the panel was \'Humanity Exposed to the Threat 
of America\' and the panel drew great public attention in Tatvan. 
 
MILLIYET:       Joost Lagendijk, the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary 
Committee\'s Co-Chair, said that it is high time Turkey solved 
the Kurdish issue through the means of establishing dialogue and 
implementing sound policies. It is claimed that Lagendijk 
invited Turkey to start negotiations with KONGRA GEL, which, 
actually is listed by the EU among its (designated) terrorist 
organizations. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
11.HURRIYET: Exports from the GAP provinces to free trade zones 
within Turkey has increased by 80% in the first 10 months of 
2004 as compared to the same time period last year. According to 
the data provided by Southeastern Anatolia Exporters\' Union, 
from January - October 2004, exports from the provinces in the 
region to free trade areas was USD 41.2 million.

SUBJECT: MERSIN PORT FACING NEED FOR CHANGE 
 
1.(SBU)   Summary:  AMCON ADANA PO visited Mersin on November 
24, visiting the state-run Mersin Port , nearby free zone and 
its private port and the Chamber of Marine.  The port, while 
quite profitable for the GOT, sees capacity constraints in the 
near future and badly needs modernization.  The Free Zone is 
also full and mulling how to react to continuing local demand 
for access to its tax-free status even in the face of 
potentially losing that tax concession should Turkey start EU 
accession talks.  The Chamber of Marine is busy planning to 
start a new shipyard and drydock business in western Mersin 
province, but faces local zoning hurdles at the moment.  They 
project high demand for their planned maintenance and repair 
services as well as for their subsequent shipbuilding capacity 
as Istanbul\'s comparable services reportedly have been 
saturated. End Summary. 
 
2.(SBU)  AMCON ADANA PO visited Mersin on November 24, visiting 
the state-run Mersin Port.  According to the Port director and 
the Chamber of Marine, the Port, run by the State Board for 
Ports and Railroads, netted almost USD 50 million for the GOT in 
2003 and is projected to have similar results this year. 
Nevertheless, the absence of any reinvestment in the extremely 
busy port, whose container capacity, pier access, and available 
draft is unique in the northeastern Mediterranean was striking. 
The port was brimming with containers, but the Port Authority 
requirement that the Marine Agencies fully employ its 
inefficient state-employed longshoremen on all cargo handling 
before their own private teams\' use has resulted in combinations 
of private and State longshoremen services for almost each ship 
who invariably work at different speeds and with different 
levels of capacity and skill.  Some Marine agents have even gone 
so far as to pay the Port Authority for its longshoremen and 
still do all unloading with its private workforce just to 
streamline cargo handling. 
 
3.(SBU)  Cargo handling equipment is also lagging demand even 
though the Port Authority is investing in this area to try to 
match demand.  Currently there are two GOT-owned standard cargo 
container handling gantries and one mobile, privately-owned 
similar gantry operated privately on a Port Authority 
concession.  The Port Authority currently is assembling two 
post-PANAMAX cargo container handling gantries of Irish 
manufacture with a projected completion date of February 2005. 
Shipping agents welcome the new capacity cranes\' acquisition, 
but note that they occasionally are turning away standard size 
business because of under- capacity in that category and nagging 
concerns about the maintenance on the two GOT-owned gantries, in 
effect limiting their cargo handling capacity. 
 
4.(SBU) Additionally, all containers in the almost full 
container yard are tracked by hand.  Asked about a GPS- 
transponder system\'s future viability and the sort automated 
tracking which is common in many world container shipyards, the 
Port Director said that the Port Authority was working on 
automating its billing department, but that any other investment 
was not covered in the State budget.  The Port Director 
mentioned as well that he had discussed port automation with 
Hamburg Port Authority representatives in the recent past, but 
nothing came of the discussion.  There also is no insurance or 
cargo-handling liability system to cover damages to cargo while 
in on/off-loading status.  Both the Chamber of Marine and nearby 
small private Free Zone Port authority found these shortcomings 
striking and at odds with standard commercial practice.  The 
only manner to seek redress for damage in cargo handling now is 
to sue the GOT, which Marine Agents claim that they do 
regularly, but say that eventual damages paid only reflect a 
portion of prevailing commercial liability rates and come 
usually only after very lengthy delays and litigation fees. 
 
Import/ Export Commodities? 
 
5.(SBU) According to the Chamber of Marine monthly reports, 
chief Mersin Port exports (in declining quantities) are cement, 
general cargo, petroleum products, marble and other minerals, 
legumes, foodstuffs,  assorted chemicals, sodium carbonate, 
textiles and glass.  Seasonally, cereals are also a major 
export.  The port primarily imports petroleum products, 
chemicals, general cargo, foodstuffs and frozen meat, textiles 
and cotton.  Seasonally it also imports cereals.  Petroleum and 
chemicals account for two-thirds of import trade.  Export trade 
is far more diverse.   In the last 19 months petroleum trade, 
although still mainly for domestic consumption, has been 
augmented by humanitarian petroleum deliveries bound for Iraq, 
which arrive in Turkey both at Mersin and nearby Iskenderun 
ports. 
 
Privatizing the Port? 
 
6.(SBU)   In discussions with Chamber of Marine, local shipping 
agents and the Free Zone Director, it became clear that there is 
local interest in buying the port which has sufficient capital, 
but these potential private operators have been frustrated by 
shifting GOT terms of reference for privatization offers  in the 
last two years and what they consider to be excessively lofty 
GOT estimates of the port\'s current privatized value.  A Chamber 
of Marine contact said that a group of local shipping agents 
last year had offered the only bid in response to a 
privatization tender, but had heard informally that it was only 
65% of what the GOT expected and the tender had been cancelled. 
A senior Mersin Free Zone authority observed that the GOT 
apparently views the profitable port as a major revenue source 
for the maintenance and operation of its money-losing southern 
Antalya-Adana-Gaziantep-Ankara \"Tee\" line and that the State 
Board for Ports and Railroads calculated its estimated 
privatization value for the port more in terms of the capital 
needed to return the railroad network to a neutral budget impact 
than on the port\'s actual value.  He also said that almost 
monopoly position of the port in the northeastern Mediterranean 
basin retarded competition and distorted the influence of 
competitive enterprise factors in management decisions. 
 
Port\'s projected future? 
 
7.(SBU) Shipping agents and the Port Authority report 15% annual 
increases in demand for port services in the last three years 
and say that the rising demand is linked to increasing domestic 
consumption and saturation of ports in Istanbul and Izmir.  They 
note that were regional Turkish trade, such as with Iraq for 
whom they see Mersin as the natural \"northern port,\" to increase 
the port could not meet that demand.  The Chamber of Marine 
reports that in late 2003/early 2004 the Spanish Government\'s 
Development Board produced a 3-5 year, approximately USD 500 
million port expansion feasibility proposal, but that it remains 
without financing or GOT endorsement.  One local contact said 
that the \"GOT is waiting for EU (regional development) funds to 
be the answer to this issue.\"  Another contact noted that a 
Brazilian consortium had expressed interest in the port 
expansion project as well, but that financing was just as 
unclear for that proposal. 
 
8.(SBU)  PO also toured the newly-expanded and renovated NATO 
pier within the Mersin Port, which is projected to be completed 
in January 2005.  It abuts the joint Turkish Navy/Coast Guard 
yard and partially separates the Port of Mersin from the small 
Mersin Free Zone port.  It has a pier, container handling yard, 
fuel handling capacity and capability to host a standard 
container size gantry.  It was unclear whether a dedicated 
standard container gantry would handle NATO-related cargo or the 
port\'s privately-leased mobile gantry would do so.  Shipping 
agents and the Chamber of Marine said that informal suggestions 
that the Port of Mersin expand into the Turkish Navy/Coast Guard 
yard, which they contend could be relocated to an under-utilized 
existing port in Tasucu, in western Mersin province, \"have gone 
no where.  The Navy is not interested in moving.\" 
 
New private shipyard in Tasucu in works 
 
9.(SBU)  Meanwhile, a group of investors drawn from the  Chamber 
of Marine under the AKTER consortium umbrella is busy planning 
to start a new shipyard and drydock business in Tasucu in 
western Mersin province, within an existing breakwater and 
alongside the site of an existing NATO pier and small fishing 
port.  The group says that it has raised the required USD 14-16 
million in capital, but it currently facing \"local zoning 
problems\" delaying the start of the first phase of construction, 
which would put in operation two medium-size drydocks and a 
graving dock for repair and maintenance work.  They are very 
confident both about the demand for the repair and maintenance 
services that they plan to offer and the second phase shipyard 
for \"regional cargo and freighters\" that they also plan to 
offer.  They report that there is so much regional demand for 
new cargo hulls that Istanbul-based companies already have 
contacted them with offers of USD 1-2 million each for the 
shipyard\'s accelerated construction if they can have guaranteed 
priority places in the yard\'s future construction schedule.  The 
consortium projects that the dry docks and shipyard eventually 
would employ 350 directly and would spark creation of three to 
five thousand additional, indirect jobs related to port services 
work. 
 
Mersin Free Zone is at capacity and pondering future in EU 
10.(SBU)  The Free Zone is also full and mulling how to react to 
continuing local demand for access to its tax-free status even 
in the face of potentially losing that tax concession should 
Turkey start EU accession talks.  They say that only Shannon 
Airport and the Madiera Islands will continue to enjoy some sort 
of declining tax-free status within the EU framework and efforts 
to get the GOT to include such a construction for Turkish free 
zones has borne little fruit to date.  Their main exports are 
finished clothing for EU markets, regional banking transactions 
for most of Turkey\'s major bank outlets, and food products, such 
as fruit and frozen foods, including U.S. poultry and Latin 
American bananas for Middle East markets, including Iraq.  They 
also export Turkish citrus to the EU market.  The Free Zone 
boasts the only pier-side cold storage, at 6,500 square meters, 
in the Eastern Mediterranean basin.  Its operator hopes to 
expand that facility another 1,000 square feet in 2005. 
 
11.(SBU) Comment:  There seems real potential for the Mersin 
port, if privatized, to be a much more efficient and very 
profitable enterprise.  If the port is to continue to meet 
rising commercial demand, let alone provide a viable outlet for 
increase transshipment to Iraq, major infrastructure investment 
will be required soon.  GOT financing seems unlikely at this 
juncture.  Perhaps TDA would be interested in examining the 
potential project more closely.  PO was left with the impression 
that the AKTER group might welcome a foreign partner with 
port/shipyard operation expertise to help round out its 
consortium.  This may involve a several million dollar capital 
investment as well by the potential foreign partner.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: SOUTHERN TURKISH BUSINESSES WORKING IN IRAQ SUFFERING 
 
REF: ANKARA 6848 
 
 
1.(SBU)  A southern Turkey regional Turkish-American Business 
Association (TABA) president and an active Turkish contractor in 
Iraq spoke with AMCON ADANA PO on 12/10 to express his concerns 
over the consequences of the ongoing trucker strike against SOMO 
and some DESC contracts.  (Note: the strike was reported in the 
southern Turkey edition of the HURRIYET mass daily on 12/10. End 
Note.)  He said that the reports of the strike were already 
driving up transportation rates for Turkish contractors working 
in Iraq up to 15% in the last two days.  He said that this 
compounded already soaring construction material costs in Iraq 
itself, especially for ready-mix concrete, gravel and steel, 
whose prices had increased 45-60%, indeed to the point where he 
said they were best described as \"war profiteering.\"  \"They say 
it is a surcharge for security and almost raise the price by 
fifty percent on everything, regardless of what our supply 
contracts say.  They just reply \'take it or leave it\' when we 
point out our contracts and there is no judge there to help you 
and only pressure from U.S. contractors to deliver on time on 
the other end.  Something has to give,\" he said. 
 
2.(SBU)  He also pointed to shortages of gravel and other bulk 
construction materials in northern Iraq, dismissing as 
\"ridiculous\" some of the proposed solutions offered by U.S. 
contracting authorities, such as trucking in sand and gravel 
from Silopi in southeast Turkey, circulating in the 
Anaconda/Balad base camps. 
 
3.(SBU)  He reiterated that security concerns among his 
professional staff and workers about conditions in Iraq were 
taking a toll, both driving up his labor rates beyond the 
premises of his original contract bids and \"drying up the pool 
of skilled construction labor.\"  PO explained that the security 
situation in northern Iraq had been a major discussion topic in 
the recent trilateral Ankara meeting between Turkish, Iraqi and 
U.S.  security officials, where there was serious and earnest 
consideration of new measures.  The contact said that he had 
seen the press reporting, and appreciated the high level 
attention, but stated that \"the reality of better security would 
be the only thing that changes these market problems.  If this 
continues people from Turkey are not going to remain willing to 
go to Iraq\" to help with reconstruction.  He said many 
contractors that he knew were already losing money because of 
shifting business conditions and would not opt to bid again on 
future business in the region because of security concerns for 
their staff and capital. 
 
4.(SBU)  Finally, he reiterated that several Adana or Cukurova 
region-based contractors working with American firm KBR in 
northern Iraq continued to face serious payment shortfalls and 
erratic payment schedules, but had been unsuccessful in gaining 
payment schedule relief on their own inter-related loans to 
Turkish banks.   He added that \"the few (Turkish) banks who used 
to be  willing to lend for Iraq business are not willing to do 
new loan business and are just pressing (clients) to pay off 
existing loans. This is driving all but the biggest Turkish 
companies out of Iraq business because there is no working 
capital available in the loan market.\"   He said that his 
Iraq-related banking was with AK Bank. 
 
5.(SBU)  On a related note (reftel), he discounted the 
likelihood of regional boycotts against U.S. goods in 
southeastern Turkey, observing that \"too many people in 
southeastern Turkey one way or another have an economic link to 
the U.S. now\" or interest in those calling for a boycott to pay 
any attention to the recent strike call. 
 
6.(SBU)  The TABA president also noted a 12/9 Cukurova region 
local press report that over 3,000 workers had left work on or 
around the Incirlik air base (note: where 39th Air Base Wing is 
hosted by the Turkish Air Force 10th Tanker Wing. End Note.) to 
work in Iraq.  He said that the reports was \"very exaggerated,\" 
however he stated that many small Adana merchants with 
enterprises linked to the Incirlik presence either had explored 
doing business with a U.S. entity in Iraq or were conducting a 
parallel business to their Incirlik enterprise somewhere in 
Iraq.  He estimated the total number of those Turkish business 
people to be \"several hundred, not several thousand\" and 
described their success rate at establishing new businesses in 
Iraq as \"hit and miss.\"  He said that these small business 
people also did not have the capital or skilled labor base to 
weather the stresses on commerce currently posed by regional 
insecurity.

SUBJECT: SHARP DROP IN SE TURKISH EXPORTS TO SYRIA SEEN 
 
 
1.(SBU)   Summary:  Per local trade data, SE Turkey\'s border 
trade with Syria is down sharply this year to date, coming in 
around USD 72 million in value.  Last year\'s estimated figure 
ran at USD 95 million, but reflected likely one-time increases 
in probable Iraq-related trade which business contacts do not 
expect, at least immediately, to be recurring.  From the 
southeast Turkey business community\'s perspective, Turkish 
exports to Syria have yet to match the promise raised with the 
past year\'s celebrated exchanges of trade delegations. End 
Summary. 
 
SE Turkey overall export pattern to Syria 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.(SBU)  According to discussion with chambers of commerce or 
industry and contacts in the four provinces which trade most 
with Syria - Gaziantep, Adana, Kilis, and Hatay - annual border 
area trade with Syria is likely to be about USD 68 million in 
value in 2004.  These four provinces route their exports through 
the two vehicle/passenger border crossings at Reyhanli in Hatay 
and along Kilis\' border, near the chief Syrian cross-border 
trading center of Aleppo.  Another province, Mardin, which does 
some minor trade with Syria through the Nusaybin passenger/rail 
gate, anticipates exporting another USD 4 million in goods this 
year, as it did last year. 
 
Gaziantep\'s recent trade history with Syria 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3.(SBU) There is a rise in border trade  between Gaziantep, a 
major SE Turkey industrial city, and Syria, most of which 
reportedly is accounted for by direct business ties with its 
sister border city of Aleppo,  per local Gaziantep business 
contacts.

Hatay trade to Syria fluctuating 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.(SBU)  The Antakya Chamber of Commerce, largest in Hatay 
province, said that it had about USD 8 million in exports to 
Syria in 2003 and predicts that it will record similar levels 
this year.  Nearby Kilis province said that its 2003 figure was 
USD 2 million and it expects about the same level this year. 
Hatay and Kilis primarily export detergent or detergent 
chemicals, agricultural machinery or machine parts to Syria with 
an additional smaller trade in nuts, processed food and kitchen 
wares between Antakya and Syria as well.  The Antakya and 
Iskenderun trade is through the Reyhanli border crossing. 
 
~as Iskenderun sees sharp downturn in 2004 exports to Syria 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------------------ 
 
7.(SBU) The Iskenderun Chamber of Commerce, which last year 
reported approximately USD 30 million in Syrian exports, is only 
reporting estimates of USD 7 million for 2004.  The differences 
lies in perceived one-time exports of used and new cars to Syria 
in 2003, many of which are estimated to have been bound for Iraq 
from European sources after off-loading at the Iskenderun port 
last year.  (Comment:  This matches reports last year from 
Turkish businessmen working in western and central Iraq of 
considerable flows of European-origin used cars crossing into 
Iraq from Syria.  End Comment.)  The similar year-on-year 
exports from Iskenderun are steel (note: Iskenderun is a Turkish 
steel center.  End Note.); used cars and car parts, such as 
filters; marble and packaging materials. 
 
Adana has steady trade in a wide range of goods 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
8.(SBU) The Adana Chamber of Commerce reports steady export 
levels to Syria this year, basically matching 2003\'s USD 20 
million.  The Adana region exported a wide array of goods to 
Syria:  plastics; basic chemicals; food and edible oils; 
electronic equipment; alcohol; soft drinks; tobacco; cement; and 
optical and medical equipment.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
CUMHURIYET/MILLIYET/OZGUR GUNDEM/EVRENSEL: Demonstrators in 
cities around Turkey, including Adana and Van, are protesting 
the closure order against Egitim-Sen, brought against the Union 
because its official rules and regulations mentioned \"the right 
to be educated in one\'s mother tongue.\"  Milliyet reports that 
nearly 200 people participated in the demonstration in Adana. 
Police (reportedly) used gas bombs on the group that gathered in 
Kadikoy, Istanbul and detained 50 people.  Mustafa Avci, the 
secretary general of the Confederation of Public Employees Union 
 
SIPDIS 
(KESK), and the secretary general of the Union of Joint 
Transportation (BTS) Hasan Soysal were (allegedly) among those 
detained in Istanbul. 
 
EVRENSEL/RADIKAL:       Recently, media, newspapers and television, 
without searching for the root causes of the problems, are 
accusing the families of children in Diyarbakir of neglect and 
complicity when kids are forced into crime.  But Nezihe C., the 
mother of one of the children that was saved from kidnappers at 
Haydarpasa Train Station two days ago, responded to the 
allegations:  \"No mother would allow that no matter how hungry 
her family is.\"  Radikal reports that these children are the 
kids of families who were forced to migrate from small towns to 
big cities.  They are very vulnerable and are deceived with 
false promises of prosperity.  They learn to make their ends 
meet through illegal means due to the economic hardships their 
families suffer. 
 
SABAH: According to (French) Liberation newspaper, the Atomic 
Scientists organization issued a report stating that there are 
480 atom bombs in Europe, ninety of which are located in 
Incirlik. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        At least ten students at Dicle 
University have initiated an indefinite hunger strike to protest 
the University Presidency\'s questioning of 82 students for their 
having participated in various activities, including protests 
against the Higher Education Authority (YOK). 
 
EVRENSEL:       The students of Yuzuncu Yil University in Van 
protested against the killing of Ugur and Ahmet Kaymaz by the 
security forces. 
 
SABAH/EVRENSEL/OZGUR GUNDEM: Regarding the killing of shepherd 
Fevzi Can in Semdinli, Hakkari, 110 attorneys from the 
Diyarbakir and Batman Bar Associations appealed to the Semdinli 
Public Prosecutor that all the security forces involved in this 
incident should be suspended from duty, and a neutral and 
independent litigation process should be initiated against 
people associated with the crime directly, through their 
deliberate acts, as well as against those involved indirectly by 
negligence. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: Members of the Kurdish Women Initiative, who 
started a journey from Hakkari, arrived at Batman and 
Diyarbakir. The group aims to list the demands of the women in 
the region and tell these demands to the Turkish Parliament and 
EU authorities. 
 
RADIKAL:        U.S. military members that went to Iraq from 
Incirlik airbase are recruiting labor from the Incirlik area. 
The U.S. has been in Incirlik since 1950 and many U.S. military 
members know local Turkish people whom they trust.  Also, many 
of the locals have good English language skills.  For these 
reasons, locals from Incirlik are selected by the military for 
employment in Iraq.  Currently, the number of locals that has 
gone to Iraq is (allegedly) nearly 3,000. 
 
 OZGUR GUNDEM:  The drivers of tankers that carry fuel oil to 
Iraq indicate that they are experiencing harsh conditions, 
including death for some drivers, while at the same time they 
are transporting fuel oil with (allegedly) a loss of 805 million 
Turkish Lira in every trip to Iraq. Consequently, drivers 
decided to offload their vehicles while their company attempts 
to make better payment arrangements. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM/EVRENSEL:  Tunceli Labor and Democracy Platform

teachers Hasan Hayri Kilic and Aziz Avin from office for having 
attended a press announcement called \"Call for Peace\" on

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
SABAH:  Members of the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish 
Parliament, Huseyin Guler (Republican People\'s Party) and Mehmet 
Nezir Nasiroglu (Justice and Development Party), have completed 
their report about the recent Kiziltepe incident (see November 
30 press summary). Tomorrow, Mehmet Elkatmis, the head of the 
Human Rights commission, will make public the 12-page report. 
The report states that at the time of the incident Ahmet Kaymaz 
and his son were dressed casually (slippers, no outerwear that a 
person wears when leaving the house) and there were no signs of 
clashes. The report says that it is not likely that a father 
would draw his son to such a dangerous situation. The report 
concluded that Ahmet Kaymaz and his son are innocent and the 
perpetrators should be penalized. 
 
CUMHURIYET/OZGUR GUNDEM: The police detained 300 villagers in 
Bismil, Diyarbakir who were protesting against a rural landlord 
family called Sinanli. The villagers claim that the landlord had 
unlawfully seized land which belonged to them.  They clashed 
with Jandarma as they protested and prevented the tilling by 
other villagers of the land.  Many people were (allegedly) 
wounded during the clash.  Most of the 300 villagers were 
released the same day, however 122 of them were kept at the 
police station overnight.  The Jandarma raided the village 
yesterday morning and detained another 27 people. During a 
briefing on \"Stock-breeding and Agriculture,\" three 
representatives of the group approached the Minister of 
Agriculture, who told them he plans to send aides to address 
their problems. 
 
CUMHURIYET:  An earthquake station having satellite technology, 
the second of its kind in Turkey, has been introduced into

township in Sanliurfa. 
 
RADIKAL:        The mayor of Diyarbakir and a delegation of 
businessmen are going to visit 4 EU countries and seek support 
before the upcoming EU decision about Turkey in 17 December.

announcement, stated that during operational activities carried 
out by security forces in Derik, Mazidagi, Kiziltepe and city 
center of Mardin, 15 shelters used by members of the terrorist 
organization were uncovered.  In the shelters they discovered 
ammunition, one Kalashnikov, 11 bullet shells, three binoculars, 
13 hand grenades, 300 meters of electricity cable, 65 batteries, 
and 25 kilos of ammonium nitrate. 
 
BOLGE:  During police operations in Mersin, eight persons who 
are members of the Fundamental Human Rights and Liberties 
Association were detained and brought into court for allegedly 
being members of the DHKP-C. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   750 \"human shields,\" comprising 
representatives of Diyarbakir & Izmir NGOs and villagers from 
Bergama, organized a convoy to Dicle, Diyarbakir Province, 
aiming to stop security operations taking place there. Jandarma 
stopped the group en route.  The group then held a 3-kilometer 
demonstration called \"A Walk for Peace.\"  Oktay Konyar, the 
spokesman of the Human Shield Initiative and Bergama Peasants, 
said, \"On the eve of the December 17 decision, 750 people are 
trying to bring two parties together to negotiate for peace.\"

1.      BOLGE:  The gross income of the GAP region, which was 10.5 
billion dollars in 1998, is expected to reach up to 24 billion 
dollars in 2010.  Mehmet Acikgoz, the Deputy Director of GAP\'s 
Regional Development Administration Office, said that per capita

This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for December 8, 
2004.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
ZAMAN/TURKIYE:  Five children that had been (allegedly) 
kidnapped in Diyarbakir and forced to commit crimes such as 
pickpocketing and robbery, were rescued during a police 
operation yesterday at Haydarpasa Train Station in Istanbul. The 
police detained one person accused of bringing the children from 
Diyarbakir to Istanbul to join an intercity crime network. 
(Note: Turkiye newspaper reports the number of children 
kidnapped as 6. End note.) 
 
CUMHURIYET/YENI SAFAK:  Ibrahim Parlak, who had been sentenced 
on charges of shooting two Turkish soldiers at the 
Turkish-Syrian border (note:  in a 1988 incident) and who is 
(allegedly) tied to the terrorist organization PKK, now faces 
deportation from the U.S.  He was found to have provided false 
answers on his U.S. green card application. 
 
YENI SAFAK:  Prof. Ibrahim Kaboglu, head of the Advisory Board 
of Human Rights, called upon Alevis to put pressure on the state 
authorities regarding the building of mosques in Alevi villages. 
Kaboglu (reportedly) said, \"If mosques are being built in Alevi 
towns, you should press for your rights and try to exert 
influence even by taking the matter to European Court of Human 
Rights.\"  Kaboglu further stated (reportedly) that Alevis are 
scarcely mentioned in the EU Progress Report, however since the 
Kurds are the \'weak spot\' of the EU, the EU always attaches 
priority to Kurdish issues and undermines people of other ethnic 
origins in Anatolia. 
 
RADIKAL/CUMHURIYET/YENI SAFAK/SABAH:  At the request of the 
Department of Justice, the Board of Ministers of the Netherlands 
government decided to add PKK to its official list of terrorist 
organizations. The Dutch Cabinet agreed to outlaw and seize the 
assets of all terrorist organizations listed by the European 
Union. The banned organizations will not be allowed to operate 
under different names. 
 
RADIKAL/CUMHURIYET/OZGUR GUNDEM/SABAH : Upon the demand of the 
Prosecutor Pinar Akkoc Haktanir, the Kiziltepe Court of Peace 
decided to classify the investigation into the deaths of Ahmet 
and Ugur Kaymaz as secret, in order to maintain a \"fair and 
objective judicial proceeding and investigation.\"  Pursuant to 
the decision, the request of the lawyer for the Kaymaz family, 
Huseyin Cangir, to examine the case file was also rejected. 
Huseyin Cangir stated his wish that every phase of the judicial 
process be open to public. According to Sabah newspaper, 
contrary to the claims of security forces, the MPs of the 
Justice and Welfare Party stated that \"there were no evidence of 
clashes.\"  Sabah reported that MPs said the people of the region 
were pleased with the Prime Minister\'s comment that \"a 
12-year-old child cannot be called a terrorist.\" 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:    Tunceli Bar Association attorneys held a 
demonstration to protest violations of law in the region. Bulent 
Tas, head of the Tunceli Bar Association, said, \"especially in 
Tunceli, the recent resuming of methods used in 1994 worries us 
greatly.\"  Many members of NGOs supported the demonstration as 
well. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Hakkari FM is on the air again. The one-month 
penalty imposed by the Turkish Higher Board of Radio and 
Television temporarily banning the broadcast of Hakkari FM has 
expired. The ban was imposed upon the grounds that \"the 
broadcast of the radio was promoting separatism.\" 
 
CUMHURIYET:  Prof. Ahmet Ercan, the Head of the Geophysics Board 
in Turkey, said fuel leaking from the fuel storage facilities 
into the soil is poisoning the people in Batman.  Ercan carried 
out research in Batman, where (allegedly) an underground methane 
gas accumulation led to a blast on May 3 which killed 3 people 
and wounded 25.  He said that in the course of 35 years, 64,000 
tons of fuel leaked from the fuel storage facilities as well as 
from TUPRAS (Turkish Petroleum Refineries Corporation), causing 
diseases related to increased levels of water, air and soil 
contamination. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Van\'s Jandarma Command detected one Syrian, 
seven Lebanese, and 19 Afghan nationals as they were trying to 
cross the border illegally from Gulderen and Uzunyol townships 
in Van. 
 
SABAH:  In the 1990s, the population of Diyarbakir (reportedly) 
increased from 300,000 to 1,000,000.  Thousands of children that 
have nothing else in which to engage are drawn to committing 
crimes. Sometimes these children are kidnapped and placed into 
crime networks; this situation therefore affects other cities as 
well.  The families of some of the children recently kidnapped 
in Diyarbakir and forced to commit crimes were (allegedly) paid 
money in exchange for \"allowing\" their children to be taken to 
Istanbul.  Regarding the problem of children committing crimes 
in cities, Efkan Ala, the Governor of Diyarbakir, says it\'s 
because of deprivation and poverty, and welcomed every effort 
and suggestion about how to deal with the issue.  Ala stated, 
\"Diyarbakir\'s problem is not solely the problem of Southeast 
Turkey. This problem should be of interest to everybody in the 
country.\"

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
VAKIT / CUMHURIYET / TERCUMAN / SABAH:  Scarcity of prey in 
the mountains for wolves, due to sharply decreasing temperatures 
and heavy snowfall, causes the wolves to approach villages of 
Yuksekova, Hakkari, and attack people. Fifteen villagers have 
been wounded by wolves. A sample taken from one of the wolves 
shot dead is being sent to Ankara for examination regarding 
rabies. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   With the participation of 2000 people, NGOs in 
Kiziltepe made a press announcement in Mardin. The NGOs demanded 
that Minister of Education Huseyin Celik pay more attention and 
get more involved with the Ugur Kaymaz incident, and that the 
Turkish Association of Drivers be more involved in the case of 
Ahmet Kaymaz.  Resat Kaymaz, who is the brother of Ahmet Kaymaz, 
denied the allegations of Mardin Deputy Security Director, (who 
is) saying that the weapons found beside the bodies had been 
used in a raid on a police station. Resat Kaymaz stated that 
Ahmet Kaymaz was in Iraq on the date of the raid on that police 
station. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:    Mehmet Elkatmis, the President of the TBMM 
Human Rights Commission, showed \"incompetence\" when he received 
the application of families whose relatives, Serdar Tanis and 
Ebubekir Deniz (HADEP Silopi district officials), have 
(allegedly) not been seen after being in Jandarama detention 
(note: in 2001. end note). Mehmet Elkatmis stated that the 
judicial proceedings about the incident are still continuing and 
they cannot interfere while the process is ongoing. Elkatmis 
sent an application form of European Court of Human Rights to 
the family though the family had already applied to the Court. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Twnety village guards from Beytussebap, Sirnak 
were removed from office without explanation. The guards were 
not paid their last month of salary. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      EVRENSEL / CUMHURIYET / MILLIYET / BOLGE / TURKIYE: The 
workers of a factory of CUKOBIRLIK (Cooperative Organisation for 
Agricultural Product Sales in Cukurova), as well as several 
producer members of the same organization, protested against the 
management of CUKOBIRLIK for shutting down a factory and firing 
4000 workers in Adana. The protestors claimed that a big, 
full-fledged, beneficial factory that has the potential to 
operate with 100% capacity and employ 5000 workers was shut down 
simply due to ineffective and unsuccessful management. The 
workers carried banners reading \"AKP Government, take your hands 
off CUKOBIRLIK,\" and they demanded that the factory be reopened. 
 
 
2.      VAKIT / HURRIYET / EKSPRES / MILLI GAZETE / YENI SAFAK: 
Citrus fruit producers gathered to pray for clients to buy their 
produce. This protest was to criticize the government for not 
supporting the purchase of citrus fruit at a price that would 
help the producers cover their costs. The producers said that 
the harvest of citrus fruit increased by 30% as compared to the 
previous year\'s harvest. If this amount of production is not 
going to be exported, it is impossible to consume it in internal 
markets. 
 
3.      EKSPRES / MILLI GAZETE / BOLGE: Exports are increasing 
thanks to the visit that the Adana Chamber of Commerce paid to 
Greece last year with a delegation of 90 industrialists. A 
furniture company signed an investment and cooperation agreement 
worth $500,000 this year with a Greek firm.  The president of 
the Adana Chamber of Industry stated that the second rapidly 
developing sector in Adana, after the textile industry, is the 
furniture-manufacturing sector.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
EVRENSEL:       A case has been opened against five students of 
Dicle University\'s Faculty of Education in Siirt. The students 
were wearing badges reading \"No to Prosecutions 
(Investigations),\" in protest of the charges brought against 30 
students who (allegedly) demonstrated against YOK (Higher 
Education Board) policies on November 6. 
 
CUMHURIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:   Ozdemir Ozok, head of 
the Turkish Bar Association, called for a fair judicial process 
to reveal the truth about the killing of Ahmet Kaymaz and his 
son. Ozok added that the Union of Turkish Bar Associations would 
assign someone to observe the process until its conclusion. 
Ozkok\'s written announcement stated that his organization 
generated its own report about the Kiziltepe incident, by means 
of interviews with authorities, residents, and the victims\' 
family, but that the case file\'s being classified as secret 
hindered the report. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Diyarbakir Prosecutor Erkan Ozcan voiced his 
opinion on the lawsuit brought against 72 security officers who 
(allegedly) killed 10 prisoners and wounded 23 prisoners at the 
Diyarbakir jail.  (Note:  the trial of these officers has been 
ongoing for 8 years, and the case has since been taken to the 
European Court of Human Rights.  End note.)  The prosecutor 
(reportedly) asked that the charges against some of the officers 
be dropped due to statute of limitations, and that the sentences 
of some of the officers be decreased to four years on the 
grounds that the officers were performing their duties, and 
acting in self-defense. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Members of DEHAP\'s Youth Branches initiated 
a campaign with the title \"Yes to differences, No to 
separatism.\"  In support of the campaign, members have collected 
thousands of petitions from Diyarbakir, the Aegean Region, 
Mardin and Mersin since December 6, which they will send to the 
Turkish Parliament today.  Erkan Tas, the spokesperson of DEHAP 
Youth Branches, said his group is asking that the 3rd, 42nd, and 
66th articles of the Constitution be amended.  (Note:  the third 
article states that the language of the Turkish state is 
Turkish; the 42nd addresses education issues, and the 66th state 
that \"everyone bound to the Turkish state through the bond of 
citizenship is a Turk.\"  End note). 
 
YENI SAFAK: Bingol Municipality\'s Press and Public Relations 
Directorate established a special desk to foster better 
communication between citizens and the Municipality. Through the 
so-called \"White Desk,\" the Municipality aims to provide better 
service to the people of Bingol. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      EVRENSEL:  Negotiations between the Gaziantep Municipality 
and the 1200 workers of GASKI (Gaziantep Waterworks and Sewage 
System) are ongoing, and the parties have agreed on 17 of 83 
items in a draft agreement.  The union is seeking a 50 percent 
gross increase in pay for 2005. 
 
2.      TERCUMAN / HURRIYET / YENI SAFAK / RADIKAL / OZGUR GUNDEM: 
 Northern and eastern regions of Turkey are under heavy 
snowfall. The weather conditions make life difficult, rendering 
transportation impossible and causing water and electricity 
infrastructure to fail.  Due to unexpected and early snowfall in 
Haskoy, Mus, farmers are trying to plant wheat in negative 25 
degree Celsius on fields that are covered with snow. 
 
3.      EVRENSEL:               Nearly 300 producers of citrus fruit 
demonstrated in Samandag, Antakya province, to protest the 
prices the government is offering for their produce.  The 
producers criticized the government\'s economic policies, 
claiming the economy is managed through World Bank, IMF and WTO 
directives. 
 
4.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   Sanliurfa\'s Directorate of Environment 
and Forestry is launching one of Turkey\'s biggest forestation 
projects in Halfeti, where four types of trees will be planted 
on an area covering 82 hectares. 
 
5.      CUMHURIYET:     Cultivation of fields in the Cukurova region 
is declining. Today, fewer fields are being planted and finding 
workers to work the existing cotton fields is sometimes 
difficult.  Ali Ergezer, the head of the Chamber of Agriculture 
in Tarsus, expressed dissatisfaction with the prices for cotton 
offered by the state, especially compared to the relatively 
higher prices offered in other countries. (Note:  In this highly 
protected economy growers are as attuned to state monopoly 
prices as to any market index prices.  End note).

CUMHURIYET / MILLIYET / ZAMAN / HURRIYET: Having discovered that 
one of the wolves that attacked and bit 15 people in Yuksekova, 
Hakkari, had rabies virus, all the people exposed were 
vaccinated against rabies. However, the vaccination has not been 
effective against severe bites on the head, which are very close

OZGUR GUNDEM:   Attorney Zulfu Dundar is still not acquitted 
in the second hearing of the lawsuit that was brought against 
him on the grounds that he exploited his capacity as an 
attorney. Attorney Zulfu Dundar brought a charge against police 
who allegedly degraded and paraded two children about the town 
after putting feces on their faces. The children were detained 
on April 23rd, 2003, as a result of allegedly making some

30 prisoners.  (Note:  The operation was initiated by security 
forces which occupied prisons in response to hunger strikes 
security forces claimed were enforced against prisoners\' wills 
by radical organizations.  End note.)  This incident was

REF: BAGHDAD 2282 
 
 
1.(SBU) This cable is not for internet distribution and contains 
commercially sensitive information.  Embassy Baghdad pass REO 
Mosul. 
 
2.(SBU)  Summary:  The Turkish transport union wildcat strike 
against Iraqi SOMO, which started on Dec. 6, continues.  This 
strike is also affecting two of the three categories of fuel 
that Turkish companies can ship to Iraq for MNF-I sustainment. 
The most important sustainment fuel, JP-8, continues to flow, 
but at lower rates than desired.  Separate discussions with 
Turkish supply companies and transport unions on December 23 
indicate that this strike turns on desired wage increases by the 
driver transport unions, who seem to indicate a wish that any 
trucker carrying a load to Iraq receive the same wage per metric 
ton delivered.  Turkish petroleum supply companies say that 
their infrequent contacts with SOMO indicate SOMO is unwilling 
to raise its rates to them and only urges them to deliver their 
contracted loads because of \"shortages in Iraq and higher 
seasonal consumption.\"  These companies also report total SOMO 
arrears to them in the range of $75-100 million for periods 
ranging from the last 15 to 80 days, although they say that SOMO 
payment practices have been improving almost across the board in 
the last 30 days.  Facing this perceived squeeze on what they 
claim are their already slim profit margins, the Turkish 
petroleum supply companies servicing SOMO intend to wait out the 
strike by insisting that the drivers accept current wage scales, 
hoping that drivers soon will feel the pinch of a lack of cash 
flow. End Summary. 
 
SOMO strike continues, now affecting sustainment, too 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------------- 
 
2.(SBU)  AMCON Adana and MJLC contacted several of the larger 
Turkish petroleum supply companies contracted to SOMO and/or 
DESC on December 23 to determine the status of their 
deliberations on the ongoing trucker strike against SOMO.   MJLC 
reported that the strike is also affecting two of the three 
categories of fuel (MOGAS and diesel) that Turkish companies can 
ship to Iraq for MNF-I sustainment.  Efforts to ship these two 
categories of fuels in the last eight days have resulted in no 
successful cross-border delivery, with 27 tankers currently in 
limbo in southeast Turkey near the Habur border gate, allegedly 
prevented from proceeding to the border crossing by drivers\' 
union threats against their families.  An effort by MJLC to 
secure Jandarma\'s involvement in this problem was frustrated by 
the threatened drivers\' unwillingness to make a statement to the 
Jandarma and subsequent explanation to their aprent company that 
they did not consider the Jandarma able to protect them or their 
families from the alleged threats.  However, the most important 
sustainment fuel, JP-8, continues to flow, but at lower rates 
than desired (average 45 versus 60 desired loads daily).  The 
largest Turkish oil supply company for sustainment, Petrol 
Ofisi, is seeking to decouple sustainment fuels from the 
pressures of the SOMO strike through a side deal and to test 
that arrangement with a second 75-tanker delivery  of MOGAS and 
diesel starting on December 24, but declined to predict to AMCON 
ADANA whether their gambit would bear fruit. 
 
Strikers want 100% increase 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.(SBU)  The Turkish petroleum supply companies independently 
commented that the drivers\' unions with which they 
intermittently are discussing the strike have demanded an almost 
100 percent increase in wages per metric ton delivered.  A 
December 23 AMCON ADANA discussion with a local Turkish truckers 
union representative confirmed that this is what driver supply 
companies desire, even though some Trucker union association 
group \"elders\" have recommended a lower starting bid and 
readiness to negotiate to a lower point.  The trucker union 
representative said that the truckers recall that they were paid 
higher rates last year for similar loads when contracted by the 
U.S. for humanitarian deliveries through KBR and at least want a 
return to those wage levels.  They also claim that drivers 
represent that their costs per delivery exceed the SOMO contract 
wage rates.  (Note: an important cost element here about which 
they claim irritation is over a hundred dollars per load in 
Peshmerga collected fees and additional alleged Peshmerga 
solicitation of bribes in return for Peshmerga under-reporting 
of load under-delivery at the northern Iraqi oil depots.  End 
Note.) 
 
Turkish oil supply companies: SOMO not budging, so neither will 
we 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.(SBU) The Turkish petroleum supply companies say that their 
contacts with SOMO have been limited recently, but even these 
limited contacts (a few e-mails and phone calls, they say) 
indicate SOMO is unwilling to raise its rates to them.  In fact 
the largest of the contractors, OPET, said it even received a 
draft 2005 contract from SOMO recently insisting that wages 
would be unchanged.  Both large Turkish petroleum supply 
companies that AMCON Adana contacted independently said that 
SOMO has limited its replies to their strike reports to \"urging 
us to deliver their contracted loads because of shortages in 
Iraq and higher seasonal consumption.  They just tell us to do 
the best we can and avoid any discussion of how we might rework 
our contract with them to meet some of the strikers\' demands.\" 
 
5.(SBU)   These companies also report SOMO arrears to them in 
the range of $75-100 million for periods ranging from the last 
15 to 80 days, although they say that SOMO payment practices 
have been improving almost across the board in the last 30 days. 
 They say that in the last several months SOMO has shifted to 
paying its contract through wire transfer, but that their levels 
of accounts receivable are still \"uncomfortably high\" for some 
of the larger suppliers and this risk, in part along with the 
one-sided strike dialogue, is undermining their confidence in 
developing a joint strike reaction position with SOMO. 
 
We will wait the drivers out, oil suppliers say 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
 
6.(SBU)  Facing this perceived squeeze on what they claim are 
their already slim profit margins, the Turkish oil supply 
companies servicing SOMO intend to wait out the strike by 
insisting that the drivers accept current wage scales, hoping 
that drivers soon will feel the pinch of a lack of cash flow. 
This determined stance is strengthened by their perception of 
driver disorganization.  They point out that the drivers\' union 
is fragmented among almost 50 local representatives, some of 
whom bicker publicly in front of the petroleum supply company 
representatives on the few occasions they have met.  (Comment: 
AMCON Adana and MJLC witnessed such driver disorganization in a 
chance encounter in Iskenderun last week, at which different 
local agha\'s acting as union representatives argued in front of 
Petrol Ofisi representatives and us about whose drivers were 
losing more and therefore in more relative distress caused by 
SOMO\'s alleged low wages.  End Comment.) 
 
Why are there different driver wage scales? 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
7.(SBU)  Turkish supply companies indicate that wage 
differentials for different Iraq contracts do exist, but for 
what they consider sound market reasons.   They say that MNF-I 
sustainment loads receive the highest per load wages because the 
U.S. government, through DESC, will payer higher rates than 
SOMO.  Additionally, the sustainment drivers face higher risks 
of being attacked and can make fewer round trips per month 
because of their more distant destinations in Iraq and security 
constraints on their travel.  In short, SOMO drivers on average 
can make 3 round trips to Iraq monthly while their sustainment 
counterparts can only make 1-2, depending on convoy availability 
within Iraq and threat posture. 
 
What do drivers and oil supply companies say will happen? 
--------------------------------------------- --------------

8.(SBU)  Drivers\' union representatives, per discussions with 
AMCON ADANA, MJLC, DESC or the oil supply companies, seem to 
believe they have leverage over their Iraqi purchaser and 
profess that they will wait until higher wages are offered. 
They also claim that their individual drivers are leaving 
vehicles either in northern Iraq, if awaiting return clearance 
at the border, or in southeastern Turkey depots, and heading 
home to southeastern Turkey villages for New Year\'s 
celebrations.  (Note: we would welcome any reporting on whether 
this is occurring in northern Iraq and will seek confirmation in 
southeast Turkey.  End Note).  On the other hand, Turkish oil 
supply companies feel that the individual drivers soon will 
exhaust any on-hand cash to which they have access and have to 
return to work at no increase in wage levels.  In the meantime, 
dialogue between the oil supply companies and different layers 
of drivers\' representatives is reported as sporadic, fragmented 
and inconclusive by both sides. 
 
9.(SBU)  Comment:  This situation seems to be stuck in a 
stalemate among Turkish parties.  Absent a new catalyst in the 
supply company-driver dynamic, near-term progress seems 
unlikely.  It also seems prudent to bear in mind that, should a 
SOMO strike resolution materialize, there still will be a 
delivery bottleneck at the Habur gate if it maintains its 
current customs inspection process.  Additionally, should SOMO 
drivers receive higher wages, there is the possibility of a 
synergistic negative effect on the sustainment Turkish driver 
pool based on para. 7 observations.  End Comment.

This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for December 27, 
2004.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
 POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
ZAMAN / YENI SAFAK / RADIKAL / HURRIYET / SABAH: A group with 
1000 members, comprising of Turkish soldiers and NGOs, 
commemorated the 90th anniversary of a tragic event of 1914 when 
90,000 Turkish soldiers died due to freezing weather conditions, 
as they were fighting the Battle of Sarikamis against Russia at 
Sarikamis, Kars. The group  Allahuekber Mountains to visit the 
scene of the battle. 
 
CUMHURIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM:      2000 people demonstrated against 
the killing of Ugur Kaymaz in Kiziltepe, Mardin and people 
carried slippers in their hands in symbolic of the slippers that 
Ugur Kaymaz and Ahmet Kaymaz were wearing when they were killed. 
The protesters demanded that Abdulkadir Aksu, Minister of 
Internal Affairs, resign from his office. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   \'The Turkish troops that were tied to Bolu 
Commando Brigade -known as Brigade of Horror among people- 
(allegedly) carried out a massacre and extra judicial killings 
that killed 7 civilians in Yolcati township of Lice, Diyarbakir 
in May 15, 1994\' said Suleyman Yildirim, a witness of the 
alleged massacre, in a statement given to Lice Prosecutor. 
Yildirim survived because he was separated from those killed, 
because the soldiers (allegedly) ordered the killing of people 
less than 65 years of age. In February 17, 2004, the European 
Court of Human Rights penalized Turkey to pay 71,530 euros to 
compensate for the material and immaterial losses of the 
victims. 
MILLIYET:       Kabatas High School and Kabatas Education Foundation 
has renovated a village school in Omerli, Mardin, which was 
demolished by PKK. The foundation has also donated educational 
tools to the school and provided for the material and goods that 
the students are in need of personally. Contemporary school 
standards have now been attained by the efforts undertaken. 
 
YENI SAFAK:     The existence of a high-voltage transmission line on 
two electric towers in a primary school named Sanliurfa Kanuni 
Sultan Suleyman Primary School at Sanliurfa poses great threat 
to the lives of 5300 students being educated there. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   On the birthday of Jesus, December 25, 
Suryanis held a meeting called \'Dialogue and Tolerance Between 
Religons\' in Diyarbakir. Christians and Muslims together

religious ceremonies, people prayed for accession of Turkey to 
the EU. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   7 people set up a \'Peace Tent\' on September 1 
World Peace Day in Semdinli, Hakkari. Three months later, 
Semdinli Prosecutor decided to conduct an investigation against 
the \'Peace Tent\' activists because of the speeches and slogans 
uttered during the event. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Due to insufficient electricity infrastructure, 
people in Diyarbakir are seriously suffering from power failure 
and and low voltage problems. Tarik Ozden, Chairperson of 
Diyarbakir Branch of the Chamber of Electrical Engineers, says, 
because TEDAS (Turkish Electricity Joint Stock Company) is 
neglecting the renewal of electricity infrastructure and scarce 
budget is allocated for the projects, and since people are using 
electricity for heating their houses, Diyarbakir is experiencing 
such electricity problems. 
 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   According to the report of the Turkish 
Agriculturalists Association, despite the fact that East 
Anatolia has been a center for cattle breeding because of the 
favorable ecological conditions of the region, implementation of 
wrong state policies has seriously hampered the development of 
cattle breeding since 1980. 
 
2.      TURKIYE:        Hilmi Guler, Minister of Energy and Natural 
Resources, said that six billion dollars have been spent for the 
dams in the scope of GAP project until today. GAP project 
comprises of Firat and Dicle basins. On Firat basin, a total of 
fourteen dams, eleven of which are hydroelectric power plants, 
will generate 2098 GWh energy annually. A total of eight 
hydroelectric power plants on Dicle basin however will generate 
7247 GWh energy annually. 
 
3.      BOLGE:   According to the joint press announcement of 
Nejat Kocer, Executive Board President of the Gaziantep Chamber 
of Industry, and Mehmet Aslan, Executive Board President of the 
Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce, their visit with President 
Erdogan to Syria and interviews made with Syrian government will 
bring beneficial outcomes for the economy of Gaziantep and the 
decisions made there will render Gaziantep a center for trade. 
 
4.      BOLGE / VAKIT:  Because of the high amount of harvests, 
the prices of vegetables and fruits have decreased on the 
markets in Adana. 
 
5.      YENI SAFAK:     A 400 kV power plant that costs ten trillion 
TL (7,2 million US dollars) is installed to provide for the 
energy needs of the region between Batman, Mardin and Kiziltepe.

2.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   Experts say special medication for the 
treatment of rabies for the patients with severe bites on their 
heads is not available in Turkey and will be brought from Iran. 
Six-year-old Burhan Ates is allegedly still waiting for the 
arrival of the medication. According to Sevket Can, Director of 
the Environmental Research Center at Yuzuncu Yil University, it 
is abnormal for wolves to approach human settlements and attack 
people. Ozgur Gundem claims that 40 villages were evacuated 
between 1990-1996 in Yuksekova and Semdinli area. Since then, 
the instances of wolves approaching settlements have increased. 
 
3.      MILLIYET / ZAMAN / HURRIYET / MILLI GAZETE / VAKIT / 
ZAMAN:  Burhan Ates, who was attacked by wolves in 
Yuksekova, Hakkari, received special medication against rabies. 
Rustem Zeydan, Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health, 
brought over 8 bottles of medication to health officials. Zeydan 
said that the news about lack of medication in Turkey is false. 
 
4.      TURKIYE /MILLIYET / ZAMAN / HURRIYET / MILLI GAZETE / 
VAKIT / ZAMAN:  Yesterday evening 7 wolves were seen on the 
campus of Sivas Cumhuriyet University in Sivas. One of the 
wolves was killed by a Kangal dog, which was released in the 
campus to guard against wolves. (Note. The Kangal dog is a 
famous breed from the Kangal District of Turkey and is generally 
used for shepherding flocks. End Note.) 
 
5.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   Abdurrezzak Gok cannot get an identity 
card because he is recorded as being dead in the records of the 
state. As a result of a conflict in Siirt on September 21, 1989, 
nine guerillas died. After that incident, the police in Siirt 
forced the father of Gok to sign a statement saying that his son 
died during the conflict. Gok was recorded as dead in the state 
records then. One month after the conflict, Gok was (allegedly) 
taken into custody, tried at Diyarbakir State Security Court, 
and sentenced to life in prison for being a member of and 
participating in the activities of the PKK. After serving 15 
years of that sentence, Gok was released on October 14, 2004. 
However, he is not able to get an identity card since the state 
records say that he died on September 21, 1989. 
 
6.      MILLIYET:       Alicia Allison, Vice Consul at the U.S. 
Consulate in Adana, visited Gundogdu Private School and wished a 
happy new year to the students. The kids sang songs together 
with Ms. Allison. Then, Ms. Allison read an English story and 
she gave some candycanes to the children. 
 
7.      YENI SAFAK:     The air pollution in Diyarbakir is at levels 
beyond acceptable limits and the current situation has very 
serious and hazardous health consequences. Diyarbakir ranks 
first in Turkey with its high air pollution levels. 
 
8.      YENI SAFAK:     Villages that were without water in Gaziantep 
were provided water as a result of the efforts undertaken by the 
Provincial Directorate of Village Services in Gaziantep. Six 
litres of potable water per second is obtained from the artesian 
wells that were dug and this water is transferred via a 24 km 
water pipeline that extends to 3 villages. 
 
9.      OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        Diyarbakir Municipality 
inspected the standard of coal in various places and seized 8 
tons of sub-standard coal at the end of the inspections. 
 
10.     EVRENSEL:       The case of the (alleged) extra judicial 
killing of Siar Perincek in Adana by the anti-terror branch in 
May 28, 2004, has been postponed to February 8, 2005 despite the 
intervening attorneys pointing out that there are (allegedly) 
efforts to conceal the evidences. 
 
 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      BOLGE / EKSPRES / HURRIYET / TURKIYE / MILLIYET: The Adana 
Provincial Directorate of Agriculture delivered olive seedlings 
to people. Cahit Kirac, Adana Governor, pointed out there is an 
increase on the world`s production and consumption of olive and 
olive oil. Therefore, olive production should be increased in 
Cukurova. 
 
2.      EKSPRES:        Despite the ongoing war in Iraq, the 
businessmen of Turkey are not afraid to conduct business with 
Iraq. The exports volume to Iraq has increased substantially. 
Due to the lack of sound banking services in the region, money 
is transferred via bags and suitcases. 
 
3.      HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    Abdulkadir Konukoglu, President of 
the Assembly of the Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce, Nejat Kocer, 
Executive Board President of the Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce 
and Mehmet Aslan, President of the Gaziantep Chamber of 
Industry, as well as some businessmen will accompany President 
Erdogan on his visit to Syria. 
 
4.      HURRIYET / TURKIYE / SABAH (GUNEY): Abdelkbir Zahoud, 
Morroco\'s Minister of Water and Irrigation, is visiting Turkey 
to make observations of the GAP region. The visit of the 
Minister and his delegation started at Gaziantep. 
 
5.      MILLI GAZETE:   The volume of trade in free trade zones 
all over Turkey has increased by 37% in the last 11 months (as 
compared to the previous year) and reached 19.8 billion of 
dollars.

SUBJECT: TURKISH TRUCKER STRIKE AGAINST SOMO CRUMBLES 
 
REF: ADANA 171; ANKARA 7119; BAGHDAD 282 
 
 
1.(SBU)  As of late 12/24, the wildcat Turkish trucker strike 
against SOMO started to crumble and, by mid-day 12/26, almost 
all Turkish oil supply companies started fueling transport 
vehicles to resume shipments to SOMO.  U.S. military sources 
report that, as of early 12/27, 112 SOMO-related vehicles are in 
northern Iraq awaiting southbound convoying.  Turkish oil sector 
contractors predict that that number will rise rapidly and 
request \"every U.S. effort to open the Habur gate to its maximum 
capacity both southbound and northbound to get fuel flowing 
again at required levels.\"  The strike was \"solved\" through a 
variety of mixed wage concessions and perceived driver need for 
renewed cash flow.  End Summary. 
 
2.(SBU)  According to Turkish oil industry contacts, the wildcat 
Turkish strucker strike, begun on December 6, against SOMO 
started to crumble late on 12/24.  Reportedly one to two small 
Turkish SOMO consortium players, comprising approximately five 
to ten percent of daily SOMO contracting, and reportedly 
including Kizil, paid \"very significant wage increases\" to 
truckers and started filling tankers as early as late 12/24. 
Several other suppliers over the weekend agreed to \"small wage 
increases\" (note: industry contacts would not give exact 
figures, but several speculated that \"the others\" paid 
approximately 5-15 percent increases.  End Note.)  Large 
players, such as OPET, reportedly the biggest Turkish SOMO 
consortium supplier, and Petrol Ofisi,  perhaps third or fourth 
largest supplier, according to their own accounts \"broke the 
strike\" and paid no wage increases, but started recovering 
sub-contracted trucking groups for fueling throughout the course 
of the weekend.  (Comment: confirmation or contrasting 
information from SOMO as to its Turkish oil supplier consortium 
composition and accounts of the strike\'s breakdown are welcome; 
we are assembling  these accounts from a variety of fragmented 
sources whose accounts are difficult to verify on an individual 
basis.  End Comment.) 
 
3.(SBU)  U.S. military logistic contacts in northern Iraq report 
receiving up to 112 tanker trucks related to SOMO as of late 
12/26 and having them ready on 12/27 for southbound convoys. 
This number  consists of  67 Benzene, 27 Diesel, 18 Kerosene and 
no LPG tankers. According to U.S. military sources, this is 
about 24 percent of the daily SOMO requirement. The daily SOMO 
requirement is 160 benzene trucks, 180 diesel, 37 kerosene, and 
70 LPG tankers.  On a related note, regarding U.S. military 
sustainment fuel shipments, which had been affected by a 
sympathy strike/slowdown, there were 180 JP8 and 17 MOGAS 
tankers ready for southbound convoys as of early 12/27.  Petrol 
Ofisi, the main Turkish sustainment fuel contractor, said it was 
resuming its regular MOGAS and diesel filling levels 
\"immediately\" now that it drivers presumedly would not be 
harassed near the Habur gate by wildcat SOMO strikers. 
 
4.(SBU)  OPET and Petrol Ofisi senior level contacts stressed 
the need \"for the U.S. government to make every effort to open 
the Habur gate to its maximum capacity both southbound and 
northbound to get fuel flowing again at required levels.\" OPET 
said that it would fuel tankers \"above the daily load 
requirement to start making up for missed shipments.\"  (Comment: 
AMCON ADANA underscores the need for the Habur gate to be open 
both southbound and northbound above the currently informally 
agreed 1500 transits per day north and south-bound - i.e., total 
3,000 daily transits.  Limited Turkish trucker supply dictates 
that, even over a short timeframe, recovering and refueling 
Turkish trucks after successful return through the Habur gate is 
as important as getting them initially through the Habur gate to 
Iraqi download points.  Backups northbound caused by both 
lengthy Turkish customs searches for contraband and Iraqi 
inconsistently-timed northbound \"pushes\" will need immediate 
additional coordination and perhaps will require different 
resource allocations, even if short-term, to be successful.  For 
example, more Turkish Jandarma to conduct inbound customs 
screening would be helpful in reducing the already 50-plus 
kilometer northbound backlog of Turkish trucks.  Tackling this 
complex task will require joint efforts by both the GoT and IIG. 
 End Comment.) 
 
5.(SBU)  Comment:  For now, the strike seems to be over, but its 
\"resolution\" was not comprehensive and reportedly is based on 
varying wage concessions by different Turkish oil supplier 
companies with their trucking sub-contractors.  This could 
result in further problems once news of varying wage concessions 
becomes more widespread.  The Turkish oil supply companies also 
still may seek increased 2005 contracts with SOMO.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: NEW TURKISH-SYRIAN TRADE DEAL SIGN OF BETTER THINGS TO 
COME? 
 
REF: ADANA 160 
 
1.(SBU)   Summary:  Per local trade contacts,  one of whom 
accompanied PM Erdogan on his recent trip to Syria, SE Turkey\'s 
border trade with Syria is not expected to change  significantly 
in the near-to-medium term, despite more optimistic public 
statements made to announce a new Turkish-Syrian free trade 
agreement.  Local business people reiterated that Turkish 
exports to Syria have yet to match the promise raised with the 
past year\'s celebrated exchanges of trade delegations. End 
Summary. 
 
Turkey-Syria overall trade patterns unlikely to change 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------- 
 
2.(SBU)  According to discussions with business chambers  and 
contacts in three (Adana, Gaziantep and Hatay) of the four 
provinces which trade most with Syria - Kilis being the fourth - 
annual border area trade with Syria is likely to end up at about 
USD 68 million in value in 2004.  (reftel). 
 
Optimistic talk, but limited real expectations 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
3.(SBU)  Although there was much fanfare and optimistic talk 
accompanying Erdogan\'s visit to Syria, business contacts predict 
little will change until Syria\'s economy can produce more 
disposable income and a financial system with which they can 
have confidence dealing.  Until then, they predicted 
continuation of trade largely characterized by Turkish exports 
of: 1)food and processed food products; 2) textiles and yarns; 
3) steel and building materials; 4) light machinery parts;  and 
5) light agricultural machinery.  Turkish imports from Syria, 
they predict, will remain quite limited and focused on local 
border area commodity consumables. 
 
4.(SBU)  One business contact whose chamber members accompanied 
Erdogan noted an increased Syrian demand for electronics and 
electrical machinery, but predicted little impact on 
Turkish-Syrian trade because Turkey does not produce much of the 
desired electronics at Syrian-desired commodity price levels and 
\"the Syrians don\'t have the money to pay for them anyway.\" 
 
5.(SBU)  Another local contact, who is a regional level edible 
oils manufacturer whose brands sold well in Syrian before the 
Syrian introduction of tariffs to protect its nascent domestic 
edible oils industry, hopes the free trade agreement will allow 
his brands to compete more successfully in the Syrian market. 
He also hopes to be able to ship his products to Middle Eastern 
markets at lower cost via Syria under the new trade regime. 
 
Non-trade benefits for a SE Turkey city? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
6.(SBU)  Reportedly, the long-rumored discussion of a Syrian 
consulate in southern Turkey was finalized during PM Edogan\'s 
visit, with the Syrian consulate in Gaziantep set to open at an 
undisclosed time in 2005. 
 
7.(SBU)  Some local business contacts passed on that several SE 
Turkish trade delegation members also remarked wryly upon return 
from Damascus and Aleppo that the Gaziantep trade delegation 
also had used its time during the Syrian visit to persuade 
Erdogan to raise income thresholds for participation in Turkey\'s 
domestic regional industrial incentive program to include 
Gaziantep.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
MILLIYET / SABAH / OZGUR GUNDEM:        120 villagers had to migrate 
from their towns due to the alleged oppressive attitude of Zeki 
Mujde, the Agha of eight villages in Ercis, Van, (Note. Agha is 
a rural landlord in Southeastern Turkey. End Note.) To 
investigate the issue, the Ercis Prosecutor launched a judicial 
process. It is claimed that the Agha (allegedly) forced the 
villagers to migrate from the town because the villagers voted 
for another candidate in the local elections on March 28, 2004 
(that designates the administrative authority of a village.) 
Niyazi Tanilir, the Governor of Van, called the villagers back 
to their towns and said that Zeki Mujde will cover all the costs 
of the villagers if they return 
 
MILLI GAZETE / TERCUMAN / CUMHURIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM / MILLIYET / 
ZAMAN / YENI SAFAK / EVRENSEL:  The legal proceedings have 
been started against villagers who threw stones and eggs to U.S. 
experts that came to take the Tomahawk cruise missiles that 
crashed in the field of a small village of Sanliurfa on March 
2003. End Note.). The litigation is brought against 13 villagers 
on the grounds that they damaged public property and they could 
face up to 3 years of imprisonment. (Note. Villagers broke 
several windows of the four vehicles carrying the experts. End 
Note.) Mustafa Karakus, the administrative authority of the 
village, said, \"How come a public lawsuit can be brought against 
us! It is us that should bring a lawsuit against the U.S.A that 
dropped cruise missiles on our land. If that missile hit us 
instead of the empty land, the whole village would be gone 
forever. We will decide at the end of this legal proceeding 
whether to bring a lawsuit against the U.S.A or not.\" 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        Ten years ago, the response of 
Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Assembly to an 
application of one of the relatives of seven people that 
disappeared in Mirik in the province of Tunceli was that seven 
villagers might have been brought away by the illegal 
organization (note: official reference to PKK/Kongra Gel. End 
note.) since the seven people had not been involved in the 
conflicts between eighteen terrorists and the security forces, 
during the military operation conducted on September 21-2, 1994. 
The Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Assembly further 
stated that the district, where it was known that 8 people 
lived, was found empty during the operation, but for the sheep 
grazing on the empty land. 
 
CUMHURIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM:      The Human Rights Association 
demanded that the people accountable for the mass graves in 
Kulp, Diyarbakir, where the dead bodies of 11 villagers were 
found, be found and an investigation be brought against the Bolu 
Commando Brigade that conducted the operations in the region 
then.(Note. allegedly in 1994.  End Note.).  It is (allegedly) 
found out that Bolu Commando Brigade is also accountable for the 
killing of 14 people during operations conducted at Zengok and 
Altinova townships in Mus province and the disappearance of 2 
people in Lice, Diyarbakir. 
 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      BOLGE / TURKIYE / EKSPRES / VAKIT / MILLI GAZETE: As 
compared to the figures of the previous year, the exports from 
Turkey to the Middle East countries are breaking the records and 
the volume of exports has increased by 40.9 percent. Mehmet 
Hadra, President of the Turkish-Arab Businessmen Association, 
said that it is pleasing that Arab businessmen prefer to import 
from Turkey in the first place. Hadra pointed out that the 
efforts of the Government (of Turkey) played a substantial role 
in establishing the amicable trade relationships with Syria, 
especially on the issue of a free trade zone agreement. 
 
 
2.      EKSPRES / BOLGE:        Fethi Coskuntuncel, President of the 
Adana Chamber of Commerce claimed that expanding the scope of 
incentive with the introduction of the new Incentive Law would 
negatively affect Adana\'s economy. Whereas the current incentive 
law allowed the granting of subsidy to cities whose per capita 
income is less than 1500 USD, the new law also grants subsidy to 
cities whose per capita income is 2000 USD. According to 
Coskuntuncel, if the new Law takes effect, Adana will fall 
behind in the competition with the markets of Hatay, 
Kahramanmaras, and Gaziantep, the cities that will also be 
eligible for the incentive. 
 
3.      HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    The businessmen who accompanied 
President Erdogan on his visit to Syria brought back three 
beneficial outcomes for the economy of Gaziantep. The first one 
is the Free Trade Zone Agreement signed by the both countries. 
The second one is that Syria is going to open a Consulate in 
Gaziantep in the first quarter of 2005. Lastly, Gaziantep will 
be included within the scope of the Incentive Law. 
4.      HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    Sunay Demircan, General 
Coordinator of the EU Program in Turkey for Promoting 
Non-Governmental Organizations, held a seminar called \"EU 
Projects: A General Overview and Basic Principles\". The seminar

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
MILLIYET / RADIKAL / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / SABAH:   The Mardin 
Kiziltepe Prosecutor finally prepared the long-awaited statement 
of charges against the four (Turkish National Police) special 
operations team members who are allegedly connected to the 
killing of Ugur and Ahmet Kaymaz. The prosecutor brought a 
lawsuit at the Criminal Court of Law on the grounds that four 
police officers \"transgressed the rules of necessary 
self-defence and caused the incidence of the two killings whose 
actual perpetrator cannot be traced or discovered\". The police 
officers may face up to 12 years of imprisonment according to 
Radikal.(Note: Ozgur Gundem and Evrensel report the term as 6 
years. Sabah and Milliyet says that three of the four police 
officers may face up to 12 years and the other officer may face 
up to 6 years. End Note.) According to the statement, the 
information gained and the statement of a witness said that 
Ahmet Kaymaz\'s house would be used by PKK, which was in the eve 
of organizing an activity against the security forces at a 
nearby police station. On the day of the incident, Ahmet Kaymaz 
went out of the house with his son, only to distract the police 
watching the house and allow Nusret Bali to run away through the 
backdoor. The statement further says that Ugur and Ahmet Kaymaz 
started the conflict and the Kalachnikov gun found beside Ugur 
Kaymaz\'s body fired 8 bullets and the gun found beside Ahmet 
Kaymaz fired 5 bullets. This statement contradicts with the 
report of the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Parliament 
reading that there were no traces of armed conflict in the 
scene. The statement demanded that a charge be brought against 
Makbule Kaymaz, the wife of Ahmet Kaymaz, for \'being a member 
and a leader of the terrorist organisation\'. If the Criminal 
Court accepts this appeal, Makbule Kaymaz may face up to 24 
years of imprisonment. 
 
EVRENSEL / CUMHURIYET:  The headmen of Hozat, Tunceli, 
complained that they were threatened and insulted by Colonel 
Namik Dursun, the Tunceli Jandarma Regiment Commander. A

stated that if the headmen did not divulge (unspecified) 
information until January 1st, the (Jandarma) Commander would 
allegedly going to give much trouble to villages and/or its 
headmen. Human Rights Association states that people are being

Yalcin who was (allegedly) deliberately executed (note: it says 
by rifle. End Note.) along with his two friends by the Bolu 
Commando Brigade on November 7, 1993. He saved his life because 
he pretended to have died after being thrown into the river with 
his two dead friends. Four bullets wounded him. According to 
Yalcin\'s narration, after his recuperation, he was forced to 
change his statement, which had brought a charge against the 
execution\'s perpetrator. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        Bulent Tas, President of the 
Tunceli Bar Associaton filed a complaint with the Tunceli 
Prosecutor about the Bolu Commando Brigade. Bulent Tas stated

Mirik (Tunceli province), a total of sixteen people disappeared 
in 1994 in Tunceli. Bulent Tas said that the allegations against 
Bolu Commando Brigade must be investigated. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The incidences of people disappearing after 
being taken into custody date back to 1980s and increase in 
intensity during the period from 1993 to 1994. After the mass 
grave in Kulp, Diyarbakir had been discovered, people started to 
apply to the Human Rights Association, and, currently, there are 
applications for 843 people who disappeared during that period 
of time.

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The first hearing for the charges concerning 
Ugur and Ahmet Kaymaz\'s killing will be held on February 12. The 
statement of charges against the four (Turkish National Police) 
special operations team members reads, \"special operations team 
members transgressed the rules of necessary self-defence and 
caused the two killings whose actual perpetrator cannot be 
traced or discovered.\" DEHAP and Free Party members protested 
the statement in Malatya and demanded that the perpetrators be 
arrested. The court rejected the appeal of Kaymaz Family for the 
accused special operations team members to remain under arrest 
while on trial. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Four people, including the DEHAP District 
Chairperson, Cafer Simsek, are (allegedly) taken into custody by 
the Mersin Security Directorate as a result of raids that (TNP) 
Anti-Terror Branch carried out at houses and shops in Mersin. 
 
 
EVRENSEL:       Sinan Yerlikaya, a CHP (Republican People\'s Party) 
MP from Tunceli, claimed that Unal Erkan, Governor of the State 
of Emergency Region in 1994, (allegedly) discouraged the Human 
Rights Commission of the Turkish Parliament which wanted to 
investigate the disappearance of 13 villagers (allegedly) in 
security forces custody during the September 17, 1994 operations 
carried out in Tunceli\'s Mirik, on the grounds that the 
operations are continuing and the region is not safe. According 
to Yerlikaya, although delegations from Germany, the democratic 
mass organizations and he himself visited the scene then, the 
Human Rights Commission did not pay a visit to Mirik district. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Political parties and mass organizations in Tunceli 
demanded that a commission be set up to investigate people who 
disappeared in Mirik, Tunceli. Huseyin Tunc, the Provincial 
Chairperson of EMEP (The Labour Party), said that many 
mysterious killings were committed and many people were exposed 
to physical and psychological tortures during 1990s. Huseyin 
Tunc says, \"This situation has not changed much today. Very 
recently, a member of the army threatened and insulted the 
headmen of (several) villages and accused villagers of being 
accomplices to the illegal activities committed in the region.\" 
Tunc demanded that people not be oppressed and frightened, and 
that these oppressive attitudes be abandoned. 
 
CUMHURIYET:     Because Syria does not open its borders to trucks 
carrying goods to Americans in Iraq and since the tanker drivers 
carrying fuel oil had been on a strike due to low transportation 
prices for twenty days, twenty thousand trucks are waiting in 70 
kilometer-long queues at Habur border gate. Despite the fact 
that the strike has ended recently, the congestion created by 
the number of trucks has not been diminished yet. 
 
ZAMAN:     Rauf Denktas, President of the Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus is going to pay a visit to Adana tomorrow at

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.      MILLIYET / EKSPRES / BOLGE / TURKIYE:    Umit Ozgumus, 
President of the Adana Chamber of Industry, is going to meet 
President Erdogan for the second time on January 5, and will 
mainly discuss the new Incentive Law. Umit Ozgumus, who is 
selected as the representative of the East Mediterranean region 
that is comprised of Adana, Mersin, Hatay and Kahramanmaras and 
Osmaniye provinces, will speak with the PM about the problems of 
the region on behalf of the provinces at the \"TOBB (Turkish 
Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges) Regional and 
Sector-Based Consultation\" meeting. 
 
2.      BOLGE / TURKIYE:        Aytac Durak, the Mayor of Adana, 
criticized the way the government handles the distribution of 
the incentives. Durak said that it is a mistake to allocate the 
incentives by simply assessing dollar based per capita income of 
the provinces since there are multiple factors that determine 
the per capita income. It should be noted that the income is 
distributed unevenly within Adana province because of the fact 
that a significant amount of the population constantly arrives 
in the city due to terror-related and/or economic difficulties. 
 
 
3.      EKSPRES / BOLGE / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / MILLIYET: 
A group of angry Mersin farmers stopped the engines of their 
trucks and chained the trucks\' steering wheels to protest GoT 
agricultural policies of the government in Mersin. Due to the 
ineffective policies of the government, the farmers say that 
they are not able to sell their products and are deeply 
discouraged about further producing vegetables and fruits. 
 
4.      ZAMAN:  The amount of citrus fruit harvested in Adana 
has increased by a hundred percent as compared to the previous 
year; however, the incentives for exporting the citrus fruit are 
very low. Because of the current laws on the fruit-and-vegetable 
market, the prices in domestic markets are not falling as well. 
Producers are desperately seeking ways to sell their produce. 
 
5.      BOLGE:  It is estimated that the total area of the 
fields devoted to cotton planting will decrease next season 
because of the frustration that cotton farmers are experiencing 
with the low level of the incentive premiums and the low prices 
in the world markets.

OZGUR GUNDEM:   The people (of Turkey) paid the price of human 
rights violations that General Yavuz Erturk (allegedly) 
committed during the operations he carried out in the 
(southeastern) region, with a compensation payment of 2.5 
trillion Turkish liras (1.8 million USD) to the European Court 
of Human Rights (ECHR). ECHR criticized Turkey for not having

in Bingol throughout the year, allegedly, nine people died, 
eleven people were wounded and two people were killed. Mines and 
explosives wounded six people, the deaths and suicides of 
thirteen people raised suspicions and forty-three people were 
taken into custody. Out of forty-three, eight people were 
arrested and twenty-nine people were allegedly exposed to 
torture, threats and bad treatment. Two villages and five houses 
in the city centers were allegedly raided and subjected to 
warrantless searches. Lastly, one person has applied to the 
Human Rights Association with an allegation of rape. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   120 people, who ran away from their villages 
in Ercis, Van, due to the alleged oppressive attitude of the 
Agha, have now been subject to another internal displacement 
within their own country, according to Ozgur Gundem. These 
\"refugees\" in their own land are not welcomed in the township 
they arrived at, which is Demirkoy, Kirklareli. They were 
escorted last night by the police and taken away from Demirkoy 
to a refugee guesthouse in Kirklareli. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The villagers in Yedisu township of Bingol 
prevented nine village guards from fishing in a river on 
December 12 because the guards were fishing with hand grenades. 
The villagers are now allegedly exposed to threats from the 
village guards. Hence, the villagers applied to the Human Rights 
Association for any possible offences the guards may subject 
them to in the future. 
 
CUMHURIYET:     Because of the improper fishing practices and the 
ignorant attitudes of fishermen in the Mediterranean Sea, the 
forty thousand ton fish harvest from the 1990s have declined 
dramatically to ten thousand tons. \"The fishing seasons are very 
long, the fishermen are using improper methods, such as 
poisonous baits and explosives\", said Bedii Cicik, a member of 
the faculty of Mersin University Faculty of Fisheries. 
 
RADIKAL / TERCUMAN / CUMHURIYET:        Nineteen students from the 
Kargili hamlet of the Ortac village of Yuksekova in Hakkari 
province are walking ten kilometers from their home to school 
every day. Armed guards escort them against the wild animals. 
The students demand that a transportation system be established 
to ease their travel to school.

1.      ZAMAN / CUMHURIYET / SABAH (GUNEY):             PM Erdogan was 
not able to resist the demands of MPs on the Incentive Law. 
Erdogan announced that the scope of the Incentive Law will be 
expanded and thirteen more cities will be included in the new 
system. PM Erdogan further added that MPs should make no further 
demands about the Law. On the other hand, Sabah (Guney) reports 
that the AKP Gaziantep Provincial Chairperson said that 
Gaziantep should be included in the incentive package of the GoT 
and that they will strive to include Gaziantep within the scope 
of the Incentive Law. Gaziantep and five other cities were very 
recently removed from the incentive list of the government. 
 
2.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   The Van Commercial Commodity Exchange 
Office and the Training Center for Service-Sector Occupations 
announced that courses on silver manufacturing will be offered 
under the EU funded \"Active Workforce Project\". The courses aim 
to train unemployed youth, former prisoners, physically 
handicapped people and the unskilled labor force in order to 
assist them in finding occupational opportunities in silver 
manufacturing. 
 
3.      BOLGE / TURKIYE:        According to Umit Ozgumus, the Presiden 
 
of the Adana Chamber of Industry, the Incentive Law will bring 
no beneficial outcomes for the economy of the country. Ozgumus 
said that the Law paves the way for providing unfair competitive 
advantage to one city over another, and may cause a the loss of 
a great deal of business in the latter. Ozgumus proposes that 
the government annuls the Incentive Law, and launch a new 
incentive system that soundly assesses the export potential of 
cities and gives priority to the ones, which can substitute 
imports and draw foreign exchange to the country. 
 
4.      SABAH / ZAMAN / MILLI GAZETE / CUMHURIYET / TURKIYE:    The 
Government (of Turkey) is trying to please the farmers. Sami 
Guclu, the Minister of Agriculture, announced that the GoT is 
going to improve the agricultural incentives comprehensively. 
According to the new enhancements, high premium subsidies for 
cattle breeding will be provided and the farmers that utilize 
more agricultural technologies will be receive more subsidies. 
The GoT (of Turkey) will announce the whole package of 
agricultural incentives -including tax reductions and payment 
installments on many items, such as fuel oil, fertilizers, 
cotton premium prices and electricity debts, etc.- on January 
10.

A stormy debate has been going on in many cities (of Turkey),
