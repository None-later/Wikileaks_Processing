TAGS:  PTER, PHUM, GE, TU 
SUBJECT:  HAS THE FRG CHANGED ITS VIEW OF THE PKK? 
 
REF:  ANKARA 11311 
 
1.  WE SUSPECT THAT WHAT THE \"TERCUMAN\" COLUMNIST IS 
REFERRING TO IN CLAIMING THAT THE GERMANS VIEW THE PKK AS 
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (REFTEL) IS THE ASSERTION IN THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S MOST RECENT INTERNAL SECURITY REPORT 
(VERFASSUNGSSCHUTZBERICHT), COVERING DEVELOPMENTS IN 1987, 
THAT \"IN TURKEY THE PKK OPERATES IN AN OPENLY TERRORISTIC 
MANNER.\"  THIS ASSERTION DID NOT APPEAR IN THE PREVIOUS 
YEAR\'S REPORT.  OUR CONTACTS IN THE INTERIOR MINISTRY HAVE 
CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION IN THEIR MINDS BUT 
THAT THE PKK USES TERRORIST TACTICS AND HAS PERPETRATED 
TERRORIST ACTS. 
 
2.  WHETHER THE PKK OR PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PKK 
HAVE ENGAGED IN WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS TERRORIST ACTS 
ON GERMAN SOIL IS AN ISSUE THAT IS PRESENTLY BEFORE THE 
COURTS.  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF VIOLENT CRIMES (INCLUDING 
MURDER AND ARSON) APPARENTLY PERPETRATED BY PKK MEMBERS IN 
GERMANY, AND SEARCHES OF SEVERAL APARTMENTS BELONGING TO 
PKK MEMBERS, THE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR INITIATED AN 
INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION HAD BEEN FORMED IN THE FRG ON THE PERIPHERY 
OF THE PKK, THE NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF KURDISTAN 
(ERNK) AND THE PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY OF KURDISTAN 
(ARGK).  (NOTE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS NOT DESIGNED TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER THE PKK IN GERMANY IS AS SUCH A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.)  AT THE SAME TIME, SOME TWENTY 
PKK MEMBERS ARE DUE TO COME TO TRIAL THIS FALL ON CHARGES 
OF MURDER, ARSON, OCCUPATION ACTIONS AND THE LIKE.  THE 
GERMAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THEY HAVE A STRONG CASE AGAINST 
A NUMBER OF THESE INDIVIDUALS; BUT THAT IT WOULD BE MORE 
DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT THE PKK ITSELF (IN THE FRG) IS A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
 
3.  WE ARE FOR THE MOMENT UNABLE TO GET A DEFINITIVE 
OPINION ON WHETHER THE FACT THAT THE GERMAN INTERNAL 
SECURITY AUTHORITIES CONSIDER THE PKK (IN TURKEY) TO BE A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION RENDERS ITS MEMBERS INELIGIBLE FOR 
POLITICAL ASYLUM IN THE FRG.
