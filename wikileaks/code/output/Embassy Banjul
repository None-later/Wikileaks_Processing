SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  LT JAMMEH, THE PRC, AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT MET 
THE PEOPLE OF BANJUL AT A MASS RALLY JULY 13, 1994. 
LT JAMMEH AND OTHER SPEAKERS FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR 
CHANGE, THE IMPORTANCE OF ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION, AND 
THE NEED FOR NATIONAL UNITY.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED THAT 
THE PRC WOULD REMAIN IN POWER AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE 
OF THE GAMBIA WISHED.  A RETURN TO DEMOCRACY WAS NOT 
DISCUSSED.  LT JAMMEH\'S REMARKS INDICATE A LACK OF 
ENTHUSIASM FOR WESTERN DEMOCRACY AND AN IMMEDIATE 
CONCERN FOR ELIMINATING CORRUPTION.  END SUMMARY. 
---------------------------- 
THE PRC MEETS THE BANJULIANS 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL (PRC) 
CALLED A RALLY AT MCCARTHY SQUARE TO MEET THE PEOPLE 
OF THE CITY OF BANJUL SATURDAY AUGUST 13, 1994.  ALL 
FIVE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE PRC ATTENDED, AS WELL AS 
THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (CABINET) AND THE 
NEWLY-APPOINTED MAYOR OF BANJUL, MAJOR ANTOUMAN 
SAHO.  THE RALLY WAS RESCHEDULED FROM THE RAINED-OUT 
EVENT CALLED FOR MONDAY AUGUST 8, 1994.  GRIOTS 
(TRADITIONAL PRAISE-SINGERS) AND FOLKLORIC PERFORMING 
GROUPS WERE SPECIFICALLY INVITED TO THIS EVENT. 
 
4.  ALTHOUGH CALLED FOR 3 PM, MINISTERS WERE NOT 
SEATED UNTIL NEARLY 4:30 PM.  A LIGHT RAIN FELL FOR 
MOST OF THE RALLY, BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO DIMINISH 
ATTENDANCE OR THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE CROWD.  THE RALLY 
ENDED NEAR DUSK, AT APPROXIMATELY 6:45 PM. 
 
------------------------------ 
WE\'RE HERE AND WE\'RE IN CHARGE 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  LT JAMMEH AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PRC (LTS 
SABALLY, SINGHATEH, HAIDARA, AND TOURAY) ARRIVED ON 
FOOT FROM STATE HOUSE (ABOUT 100 YDS), BUT WERE 
PRECEDED BY TWO MOTORCYCLE ESCORTS AND TWO TRUCKLOADS 
OF BODYGUARDS ARMED WITH MACHINE GUNS AND RPG-7S. 
UPON ENTRY INTO MCCARTHY SQUARE, THE PRC MEMBERS 
JOINED HANDS WITH THEIR ARMS UPRAISED AND CIRCLED THE 
SQUARE, ACCEPTING CHEERS AND HANDSHAKES AS THEY 
PASSED.  THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY NEARLY 40 GUARDS 
ARMED WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  SECURITY AT THE AUGUST 
13 RALLY WAS MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE CANCELLED AUGUST 8 
EVENT, WITH TWICE AS MANY SOLDIERS AND MUCH HEAVIER 
WEAPONRY PRESENT. 
 
6.  UPON TAKING SEATS, THE DAIS WAS APPROACHED BY 
ALHAJI CONATEH, THE GAMBIA\'S MOST PROMINENT GRIOT AND 
BALAFON PLAYER (AND A FREQUENT VISITOR AT STATE HOUSE 
BEFORE PRESIDENT JAWARA\'S OVERTHROW).  ON BEHALF OF 
ALL THE GRIOTS OF THE GAMBIA, ALHAJI CONATEH THANKED 
THE PRC FOR THEIR NEW GOVERNMENT AND NOTED THAT THIS 
WAS THE FIRST OCCASION AT WHICH ALL THE GAMBIA\'S 
GRIOTS HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED TO GREET THE HEAD OF 
STATE.  ALHAJI CONATEH SPOKE IN ENGLISH, WHICH HE 
FOLLOWED BY REMARKS IN WOLLOF.  A HALF-DOZEN OTHER 
GRIOTS ALSO OFFERED SPEECHES IN WOLLOF ONLY, WHICH IN 
GENERAL ADVISED LT JAMMEH THAT A TRADITIONAL CHIEF 
MUST BE JUST AND IMPARTIAL, AND NOT SWAYED BY TIES OF 
FRIENDSHIP, TRIBE OR FAMILY. 
 
----------------------------------- 
WE LIKE OLD-FASHIONED ENTERTAINMENT 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  THE GRIOT\'S SPEECHES WERE FOLLOWED BY A MIXED 
GROUP OF KORA AND BALAFON PLAYERS AND SINGERS, WHO 
PLAYED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  FOLKLORIC ENSEMBLES THEN 
PERFORMED IN SEQUENCE, BEGINNING WITH A JOLA TROUP 
WHO EXECUTED VERY ACROBATIC DANCES AND SLASHED AT 
THEMSELVES WITH SWORDS AND KNIVES, UNDERSCORING THEIR 
INVULNERABILITY TO SUCH WEAPONS.  AFTER THE JOLA 
TROUP, FIVE OTHER FULA AND WOLLOF DANCERS PER 
FORMED. 
 
---------------------------- 
WE\'VE GOT TO WORK HARD . . . 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  AFTER DANCES AND PERFORMANCES WERE FINISHED,  THE 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (CABINET) AND THE NEW MAYOR OF 
BANJUL WERE INTRODUCED.  MAJ SAHO\'S SPEECH POINTED 
OUT THAT JULY 22 WOULD BE REMEMBERED AS A DAY OF 
PROGRESS OF THE GAMBIA.  HE STATED THAT HIS GOALS 
WERE TO MAKE BANJUL A QUOTE WORLD CLASS CITY UNQUOTE 
IN WHICH THE SECURITY OF BANJULIANS WOULD REMAIN HIS 
PRIMARY CONCERN.   MINISTERS MADE SHORT SPEECHES 
FOCUSED ON QUOTE THE CHANGE (OF GOVERNMENT) UNQUOTE 
AND THE NEED FOR ALL GAMBIANS TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO 
ABANDON THE BAD HABITS OF THE OLD REGIME.  NEITHER 
INTERIOR MINISTER LT HAIDARA NOR FINANCE MINISTER 
DABO SPOKE ON THIS OCCASION. 
 
-------------------- 
STICK TOGETHER . . . 
-------------------- 
 
9.  LT JAMMEH RECEIVED A THUNDEROUS CHEER WHEN HE 
ROSE TO SPEAK.  HE BEGAN BY ASKING THE CROWD IF THEY 
WANTED JAWARA BACK.  THE CROWD ROARED BACK THAT IT 
DID NOT.  HE ASKED THE QUESTION A SECOND TIME, WITH 
THE SAME ANSWER.  LT JAMMEH THEN POINTED OUT THAT 
JAWARA HAD QUOTE LED BY DIVIDE AND RULE UNQUOTE, AND 
THAT EVERYONE HAD SEEN THE RESULTS OF DIVIDE AND RULE 
IN RWANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA.  DIVIDE AND RULE HAD BEEN 
THE MECHANISM OF COLONIALISM IN AFRICA. 
 
10.  LT JAMMEH INSISTED THAT TRIBE HAD HELD SWAY OVER 
BROTHERHOOD (AMONG CO-NATIONALS) UNDER JAWARA, AND 
THAT EVERYONE COULD SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS 
POLICY IN RWANDA.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED THAT THE PRC 
WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE GAMBIA. 
 
----------------------- 
AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE 
----------------------- 
 
11.  THE PRC CHAIRMAN THEN MOVED TO THE ISSUE OF 
DEMOCRACY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT DEMOCRACY HAD ITS 
ROOTS IN GREECE AND ROME, AND HAD BEEN THE POLITICAL 
SYSTEM OF AFRICA\'S COLONIAL MASTERS.  HE REMINDED THE 
CROWD THAT GAMBIANS HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA OF 
DEMOCRACY, AND ASKED IF GAMBIANS WANTED THE TYPE OF 
DEMOCRACY THAT PURCHASED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
WHILE GAMBIANS WERE POOR. 
 
------------------------------- 
WE\'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS . . . 
------------------------------- 
 
12.  LT JAMMEH PROMISED BANJULIANS THAT THE PRC WOULD 
ASSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE.  HE ASSURED HIS AUDIENCE 
THAT WHEN THEIR WORK IS DONE THE GNA WOULD GO BACK TO 
BARRACKS. 
 
13.  MOVING TO THE QUESTION OF DETAINEES, ESPECIALLY 
FORMER POLICE AND ARMY OFFICERS (NOTABLY CPTS CHAM 
AND SARR, FORMER SPOKESMAN LT KONTEH, AND FORMER 
INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE PA SALLAH JAGNE, AS WELL 
AS AN ESTIMATED THIRTY OTHERS), LT JAMMEH WARNED THAT 
QUOTE THERE ARE ENEMIES OF THE GAMBIA INSIDE AND 
OUTSIDE UNQUOTE, AND THAT OUR (GAMBIANS\') DUTY WAS TO 
UNITE FOR THE GAMBIA. 
 
------------------- 
AS LONG AS YOU WANT 
------------------- 
 
14.  LT JAMMEH INTERJECTED THAT WE (THE PRC) ARE HERE 
(IN POWER) TO RECOVER QUOTE EVERY BUTUT (THE SMALLEST 
UNIT OF THE GAMBIAN CURRENCY) PLUNDERED FROM THE 
GAMBIAN PEOPLE UNQUOTE, AND THAT WE (THE PRC) ARE 
HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF GAMBIANS ARE 
SERVED.  HE THEN ASSURED THE CROWD THAT THE PRC WOULD 
REMAIN IN POWER AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA 
SO WISHED. 
 
15.  LT JAMMEH CLOSED HIS REMARKS BY PROMISING THAT 
THE PRC WAS FOR AFRICA AND AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT.  HE 
REMINDED HIS LISTENERS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE 
SECURITY FORCES IN DETENTION WANTED LOOTING AND 
VIOLENCE, AND THAT THE PRC WOULD NEVER ALLOW SUCH A 
SITUATION IN THE GAMBIA.  QUOTE NOW, NO ONE IS AT 
RISK OF LOSING EVEN A DOG OR A CHICKEN UNQUOTE. 
 
16.  LT JAMMEH\'S FINAL COMMENT WAS THAT THE PRC 
WANTED A GAMBIA FREE OF PPP CORRUPTION.  WITH A FINAL 
QUOTE LONG LIVE GAMBIAN UNITY, LONG LIVE AFRICAN 
UNITY UNQUOTE, PRC MEMBERS LEFT THE DAIS AND WALKED 
BACK TO STATE HOUSE, FOLLOWED BY LARGE NUMBERS OF 
CHEERING YOUTH. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
17.  DESPITE ITS RAMBLING, OFF-THE-CUFF DELIVERY, LT 
JAMMEH\'S ADDRESS WAS HIS FIRST MAJOR DEPARTURE FROM 
HIS OFT-DELIVERED EARLIER SET SPEECH ON THE NEED FOR 
THE GNA TO ACT OWING TO OFFICIAL  CORRUPTION AND THE 
PERVERSION OF DEMOCRACY UNDER JAWARA.  THIS RALLY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE APPROPRIATE OCCASION TO ANNOUNCE 
THE PRC\'S PROGRAM FOR RETURNING DEMOCRACY TO THE 
GAMBIA, HAD THE PRC WISHED TO DO SO.  THE 
ANTI-WESTERN AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC TONE OF LT JAMMEH\'S 
REMARKS, HIS FOCUS ON THE PRC\'S MISSION TO FIND AND 
PUNISH CORRUPTION, AND HIS REFUSAL TO BEND ON THE 
ISSUE OF DETENTION OF FORMER ARMY AND POLICE (INCL. 
TACTICAL SUPPORT GROUP) PERSONNEL, ALL INDICATE THAT 
LT JAMMEH\'S AND THE PRC\'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON 
AN EARLY RETURN TO BARRACKS OR A QUICK RETURN TO 
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN THE GAMBIA. 
 
18.  THIS RALLY WAS NOTABLY DIRECTED TOWARD 
TRADITIONAL AND LOCAL LEGITIMIZATION OF AUTHORITY, IN 
CONTRAST TO AN EARLIER RALLY HELD A WEEK EARLIER AT 
THE NATIONAL STADIUM IN FAJARA.  PART OF THE RALLY\'S 
MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE THAT TRADITIONAL AFRICAN 
STANDARDS -- RATHER THAN INTERNATIONAL AND WESTERN 
ONES -- WILL BE THE TESTS BY WHICH THE PRC WILL 
MEASURE THEMSELVES AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. 
 
19.  LT JAMMEH IS MERCURIAL, AND OFTEN SEEMS TO SPEAK 
WITHOUT REFLECTION.  HIS PAST MISSTATEMENTS APPEAR 
THOUGHTLESS RATHER THAN DELIBERATELY FALSE, AS IN 
REGARD TO EARLIER PRC DISSIMULATION ON THE DETAINEE 
QUESTION.  HE COULD EASILY CHANGE HIS MIND AND CALL 
ELECTIONS QUICKLY.  NONETHELESS, THE POPULIST 
RHETORIC OF THIS RALLY AND HIS IMPLICIT ASSERTION 
THAT THE PRC CAN INTUIT THE WILL OF THE GAMBIAN 
PEOPLE WITHOUT MEDIATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS DO 
NOT BODE WELL FOR THE GAMBIA\'S POLITICAL EVOLUTION 
UNDER PRC TUTELAGE. 
 
20.  LT JAMMEH APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING INTO AN 
EFFECTIVE DEMOGOGUE.  ALTHOUGH STILL SOMEWHAT STIFF 
AND AWKWARD, AT THIS RALLY HE ORCHESTRATED THE 
CROWD\'S RESPONSES VERY WELL.  LT JAMMEH HAS ALREADY 
LEARNED TO MOBILIZE HIS PERSONAL POPULARITY AND 
PUBLIC ADMIRATION FOR HIS AUDACITY AND SENSE OF 
COMMAND INTO AN EASY JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUED 
POWER.  END COMMENT.  REGARDS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH REMAINS UNMOVED BY SENEGALESE AND 
WESTERN DONOR CONCERNS FOR RETURN TO DEMOCRACY AND 
ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE GAMBIA.  HIS 
INTRANSIGENCE HAS BEEN BUOYED BY HIS PERCEPTION THAT 
WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY 
WITHDRAWAL OF BILATERAL AND EU ASSISTANCE.  STRONG 
SUPPORTERS OF A QUICK RETURN TO DEMOCRACY IN THE 
CABINET HAVE NOT BEEN HEARD, AND THE STRONGEST 
ADVOCATE FOR DEMOCRACY, FINANCE MINISTER DABO, MAY 
NOW BE VULNERABLE.  THE PRC ITSELF IS LOSING 
COHERENCE AND BECOMING DISTANT FROM ITS SOLDIERS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
JAMMEH: A TIMETABLE WHEN AND HOW WE WANT IT 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  AMBASSADOR WINTER, SENEGALESE HIGH COMMISSIONER 
MOCTAR KEBBE, BANJUL EU DELEGATE ROBERT COLLINGWOOD, 
AND ACTING BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER RICHARD AUSTEN 
MET AT SHC\'S RESIDENCE OCTOBER 6, 1994, FOR THE 
WEEKLY MEETING OF THE TROIKA-PLUS -- ENVOYS OF THE 
U.S., SENEGAL, AND UK PLUS THE EU DELEGATE.  THE MOOD 
WAS SOMBER AND RESIGNED BUT CORDIAL. 
 
4.  SHC KEBBE OPENED DISCUSSION BY REPORTING HIS 
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN JAMMEH MONDAY OCTOBER 3, 1994. 
SHC DELIVERED A DEMARCHE FROM SENEGALESE PRESIDENT 
DIOUF UNDERSCORING THAT SENEGAL CONSIDERED THE GAMBIA 
A PRIORITY.  TO THAT END, PRESIDENT DIOUF HAD 
DIRECTED THAT SENEGAL\'S DELEGATES TO MINISTERIAL- 
LEVEL WORKING GROUPS FOCUSING ON SENEGAL-GAMBIA 
COMMERCE, TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AND IMMIGRATION 
EXPEDITE THEIR NEGOTIATIONS.  GIVEN THE PRIORITY OF 
THE GAMBIA FOR SENEGAL, PRESIDENT DIOUF WAS COMPELLED 
TO EXPRESS THREE URGENT CONCERNS: 
 
-       THE PRC\'S DETERIORATING PERFORMANCE REGARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS; 
 
-       THE NEED FOR QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT OF A 
TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO DEMOCRACY; AND 
 
-       THE NEED FOR THE GAMBIA TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH AID DONORS. 
 
5.  SHC REPORTED THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD ONLY 
RESPONDED TO THE ISSUE OF A TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO 
DEMOCRACY.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD RETORTED THAT NO ONE 
WOULD IMPOSE A TIMETABLE ON THE GAMBIA, AND THAT THE 
PRC\'S ANTI-CORRUPTION  PROGRAM WOULD TAKE TIME TO 
ACCOMPLISH.  WHEN SHC ASKED IF THE TIMETABLE WOULD 
FOLLOW PRESIDENT DIOUF\'S RECOMMENDATION OF A MAXIMUM 
OF FIFTEEN MONTHS TO ELECTIONS, CHAIRMAN JAMMEH AGAIN 
ANSWERED THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO RECOVER THE MONEY 
STOLEN UNDER THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
JAMMEH THINKS THE WORLD BANK DOESN\'T CARE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH INDICATED TO SHC THAT WORLD BANK 
COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT OFFICER LUCY KEOUGH HAD INFORMED 
HIM THAT THE WORLD BANK WOULD NOT BASE ITS DECISION 
TO MAINTAIN ASSISTANCE TO THE GAMBIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
ISSUES OR THE TIMETABLE, BUT WAS INSTEAD PRIMARILY 
CONCERNED WITH THE GAMBIA\'S WILL TO HONOR ITS 
COMMITMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK AND ITS ABILITY TO 
MANAGE WORLD BANK PROGRAMS PROPERLY.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH 
TOOK THESE STATEMENTS AS EVIDENCE THAT WORLD BANK 
ASSISTANCE WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON PRC ACTION TO 
EXPEDITE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TIMETABLE OR TO ADDRESS 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
DABO -- AND MAYBE OTHER MINISTERS -- ARE IN TROUBLE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD ALSO OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE 
SABOTEURS AMONG HIS TEAM (PRESUMABLY THE CABINET) WHO 
WANTED THE GNA TO RETURN TO BARRACKS QUICKLY.  HE 
AGAIN AFFIRMED THAT THE PRC HAD NOT TAKEN POWER TO 
RETURN THE GAMBIA\'S GOVERNMENT TO A (CORRUPT) 
 
8.  SHC WAS CONCERNED THAT FINANCE MINISTER DABO WAS 
AMONG THE QUOTE SABOTEURS UNQUOTE MENTIONED BY 
CHAIRMAN JAMMEH, IN PART BECAUSE FINMIN DABO HAS 
CONSISTENTLY INFORMED THE PRC THAT PROGRESS TOWARD 
RETURN TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE WERE 
ESSENTIAL TO PRESERVE WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE. SHC 
BELIEVES THAT FINMIN DABO IS IN DANGER AS A RESULT. 
 
--------------------- 
JAMMEH DOESN\'T GET IT 
--------------------- 
 
9.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
WERE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, WHICH 
WAS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WORLD BANK 
ASSISTANCE.  AMBASSADOR ALSO OBSERVED THAT CHAIRMAN 
JAMMEH HAD NOT GIVEN MS KEOUGH MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO 
SPEAK, AND THAT THE REST OF HER MESSAGE -- THAT GOOD 
GOVERNANCE ALSO MEANT OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
THE RULE OF LAW -- WAS NOT HEARD.  WHILE THE WORLD 
BANK DID NOT ADDRESS POLITICAL ISSUES DIRECTLY, OTHER 
DONORS -- THE U.S., THE EU, THE UK, AND GERMANY -- 
DID.  WITHDRAWAL OF THESE DONORS WOULD MAKE WORLD 
BANK PROGRAMS UNMANAGEABLE.  MS KEOUGH HAD MADE THE 
POINT THAT THE WORLD BANK WOULD BE FORCED TO WITHDRAW 
IF OTHER MAJOR DONORS DID SO.  EU DELEGATE 
COLLINGWOOD CONCURRED THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH DID NOT 
UNDERSTAND HOW THE WORLD BANK WORKED. 
 
---------------------------- 
THE USAID MISSION IS AT RISK 
---------------------------- 
 
10.  AMBASSADOR BRIEFED THE GROUP ON HIS AND USAID 
REPRESENTATIVE DEPP\'S MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN JAMMEH 
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1994, REPORTING CHAIRMAN 
JAMMEH\'S INTRANSIGENCE REGARDING THE TIMETABLE AND 
HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO FOCUS ON MEANS TO CONTINUE U.S. 
ASSISTANCE TO THE GAMBIA.  AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT 
THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH SEEMED OBSESSED BY FORMER 
PRESIDENT JAWARA.  EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD OBSERVED 
THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S WAS NOW FOCUSED ON JAWARA TO 
THE EXCLUSION OF INTEREST IN OTHER MAJOR PLAYERS IN 
THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE PRC 
HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO LIVE UP TO ITS OWN 
COMMITMENTS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH, 
THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD 
GOVERNANCE.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE PRC HAD FAILED 
TO OBSERVE ITS OWN ANNOUNCED 45-DAY DEADLINE FOR 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TIMETABLE.  AMBASSADOR OBSERVED 
THAT IT WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY KEEPING THE 
BANJUL USAID MISSION OPEN, AND THAT CLOSING THE USAID 
MISSION MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE 
URGENCY OF USG CONCERNS TO THE PRC. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
THE UK AND EU ARE READY TO CUT AID . . . 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11.  ABHC AUSTEN REPORTED THAT, IN VIEW OF THE 
DELAYED TIMETABLE AND THE CONTINUING ISSUE OF 
DETAINEES,  THE EU WAS PREPARING AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT 
IT INTENDED TO SUSPEND BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS ASSISTANCE 
(NOW APPROX. USDOLS 4 MN/YR) AND WOULD CONSIDER 
SUSPENDING OTHER ASSISTANCE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
PROTECTED PROGRAMS WOULD BE THOSE IN HEALTH AND 
EDUCATION, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SMALL PROGRAMS.  ABHC 
AUSTEN EMPHASIZED THAT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS STILL 
BEING REVIEWED, AND ITS FINAL CONTENT REMAINED TO BE 
SEEN.  EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD CONFIRMED THIS 
ACTION.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT UK MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
WAS SURE TO BE SUSPENDED. 
 
------------------- 
. . . LIBYANS OR NO 
------------------- 
 
12.  ABHC AUSTEN FURTHER REMARKED THAT THE UK 
REMAINED CONCERNED THAT CUTTING OFF ASSISTANCE TO THE 
GAMBIA WOULD DRIVE THE PRC TOWARD UNSAVORY DONORS. 
EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD ANSWERED THAT NONE OF THE 
OBVIOUS DONORS OF CONCERN (SUDAN, IRAN, IRAQ, OR 
LIBYQOMMIT TO THE GAMBIA.  AMBASSADOR CONCURRED, BUT 
OBSERVED THAT RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTS OF ASSISTANCE 
MIGHT BE ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE GAMBIA. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SHC KEBBE WILL TRY AGAIN WITH WADDA 
----------------------------------- 
 
13.  SHC REPORTED THAT HE WOULD SEE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
MOUSTAPHA WADDA LATER THE SAME DAY (OCTOBER 6, 1994), 
AND HE WOULD TRY TO IMPRESS UPON MR. WADDA THE 
LINKAGE BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN AID AND THAT OF 
THE WORLD BANK.  AMBASSADOR ASKED SHC TO QUERY MR. 
WADDA REGARDING THE PRC\'S MOST RECENT ROUND OF 
ARBITRARY FIRINGS AND RETIREMENTS AMONG THE GAMBIA\'S 
SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT MR. 
WADDA HAD HEADED THE GAMBIA\'S PUBLIC SERVICE 
COMMISSION, WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH ASSURING 
PROPER PERSONNEL PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED IN THE 
GAMBIA\'S CIVIL SERVICE.  AMBASSADOR ALSO ASKED SHC\'S 
OPINION OF MINISTER OF JUSTICE M\'BAI\'S RESPONSE TO 
THE PRC\'S REFUSAL TO RELEASE A TIMETABLE.  SHC 
ANSWERED THAT MR. M\'BAI WAS UNLIKELY TO RESIGN. 
 
------------------------------- 
THE PRC IS DIVIDED AND ISOLATED 
------------------------------- 
 
14.  SHC NOTED THAT MINISTER OF DEFENCE SINGHATEH HAD 
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PRC DECISION-MAKING, AND WAS NO 
LONGER AN IMPORTANT VOICE WITHIN THE PRC.  SHC 
EXPLAINED THAT MINDEF SINGHATEH HAD LONG BEEN 
INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH JAWARA\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL 
JANHA, AND THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY ARRANGED FOR 
JANHA\'S WIFE AND FAMILY -- AS WELL AS HIS HOUSEHOLD 
GOODS -- TO BE MOVED TO SENEGAL AFTER THE COUP.  HE 
WAS ALSO THE BEST EDUCATED AND MOST INTELLIGENT 
MEMBER OF THE PRC, WHICH DID NOT ENDEAR HIM TO HIS 
COLLEAGUES.  MINDEF SINGHATEH HAD CONSISTENTLY LOST 
INFLUENCE SINCE THE COUP.  SHC ALSO REPORTED THAT THE 
REMAINING PRC MEMBERS -- CHAIRMAN JAMMEH, 
VICE-CHAIRMAN SABALLY, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR 
HAIDARA -- WERE CONSTANTLY IN CONFLICT WITH ONE 
ANOTHER. 
 
15.  SHC OBSERVED FURTHER THAT THE PRC WAS LOSING 
TOUCH WITH THE GAMBIA NATIONAL ARMY.  HE POINTED OUT 
THAT IN NO OTHER COUP IN AFRICA HAD THE LEADERS MOVED 
INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE (IN CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S 
CASE) OR LUXURIOUS PRIVATE HOMES (AS WITH THE OTHER 
PRC MEMBERS).  IN ALL OTHER CASES, COUP LEADERS HAD 
REMAINED IN BARRACKS WITH THEIR SOLDIERS.  PRC 
MEMBERS WERE LIVING WELL, BUT THEIR SOLDIERS WERE NOT. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S BRUSQUE REFUSAL TO DISCUSS THE 
TIMETABLE ISSUE IN THE FACE OF PRESIDENT DIOUF\'S 
FORCEFUL VIEWS INDICATE THAT NO CONCERNED PARTY 
OUTSIDE THE GAMBIA HAS THE PRC\'S EARS.  CHAIRMAN 
JAMMEH\'S EAGERNESS TO BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD BANK 
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE GAMBIA\'S REFUSAL TO MOVE 
TOWARD DEMOCRACY OR ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
UNDERSCORES HIS BELIEF THAT WITHDRAWAL OF THE 
GAMBIA\'S TRADITIONAL DONORS DOES NOT MATTER. 
 
17.  SHC KEBBE IS ALIVE TO SHIFTING POLITICAL 
CURRENTS IN THE GAMBIA AND HIS ANALYSES ARE INFORMED 
BY LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.  HIS WORRY 
REGARDING RISKS TO WHICH FINMIN DABO IS NOW EXPOSED 
SUGGEST THAT THE PRC\'S PURGES ARE LIKELY TO EXTEND TO 
ITS OWN CABINET FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
DETENTIONS OF CPTS SARR AND CHAM IN THE WEEK 
FOLLOWING THE COUP. 
 
18.  SHC\'S BELIEF THAT PRC MEMBERS WHO REMAIN 
POWERFUL ARE BICKERING AND SELF-ABSORBED MAY 
PREFIGURE A DANGEROUS PERIOD OF PALACE INTRIGUE IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE.  REGARDS.

1.  (U) THIS CABLE TRANSMITS CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S SPEECH 
TO THE GAMBIAN PEOPLE ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDATION OF 
THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE FOR A TWO YEAR 
TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC RULE.  HIGHLIGHTS 
OF THE SPEECH INCLUDE: 
 
--  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH REJECTED THE SUGGESTION FOR AN 
INTERIM GOVERNMENT.  QUOTE THERE ALREADY EXISTS AN 
INTERIM GOVERNMENT WITH A LARGE CIVILIAN MAJORITY OF 
TWO TO ONE, AND THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR 
FORMING A NEW ONE.  END QUOTE. 
 
--  THE NCC RECOMMENDED THAT A REFERENDUM NOT BE HELD 
TO RATIFY THE NEW CONSTITUTION.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAS 
DECIDED TO RETAIN THE REFERENDUM. 
 
--  THE CHAIRMAN CRITICIZED THE DONORS FOR APPLYING 
QUOTE LIMITED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GAMBIA 
UNQUOTE AND APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
TO QUOTE RESUME THEIR NORMAL POSITIVE ROLE AS 
DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS UNQUOTE. 
 
2.  (U) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
FELLOW GAMBIANS ! 
ON THE 27TH OF JANUARY I FORMALLY RECEIVED THE REPORT OF 
THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE. I DESCRIBED THE 
EVENT AS ANOTHER MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING 
COUNCIL\'S PROGRAM AND TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO CIVILIAN 
RULE. TWO FURTHER STEPS OF EVEN GREATER SIGNIFICANCE 
HAVE SINCE BEEN TAKEN. BOTH THE COUNCIL AND THE CABINET 
HAVE NOW CONSIDERED THE REPORT. 
 
ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAUNCHING OF THE PROGRAM AND 
TIMETABLE ON THE 24TH OF OCTOBER, 1994, I PROMISED THAT 
THEY WERE SUBJECT TO YOUR VIEWS. A FEW OF YOU EXPRESSED 
YOUR VIEWS IN THE PAPERS AND IN OTHER WAYS. BUT THE 
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF YOU DID NOT PUBLICLY EXPRESS 
YOUR VIEWS. 
 
ON THE 13TH OF DECEMBER, 1994, THE NOW FAMILIAR NATIONAL 
CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE WAS COMMISSIONED TO SOUND YOUR 
OPINION, NATIONWIDE. I HAVE EXPRESSED MY THANKS AND 
APPRECIATION, AND THOSE OF COUNCIL, FOR YOUR WILLING AND 
PATRIOTIC PARTICIPATION IN THE IMPORTANT CONSULTATIONS 
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE. I SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
TO THANK YOU ONCE MORE. 
 
IN FAIRNESS TO BOTH YOU, THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA, AND 
TO THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL, THE 
NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED THE 
ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME YOU ACCORDED TO THE BLOODLESS 
MILITARY TAKEOVER, AND YOUR HAPPINESS THAT THREE DECADES 
OF SELF-PERPETUATING RULE BY ONE POLITICAL PARTY WAS 
OVERTURNED. THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT YOU ACCORDED 
LEGITIMACY AND EVEN BLESSINGS TO THE COUP. 
 
THE COMMITTEE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO PROTECT YOU, 
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION, AGAINST THE EXPLOITATION AND 
MANIPULATION YOU SUFFERED DURING THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. 
THE NEED FOR CIVIC EDUCATION PROVIDED FOR IN COUNCIL\'S 
PROGRAM IS ENDORSED IN THE REPORT, AND SO ARE THE 
PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AND ELECTORAL REVIEWS. THE 
COMMITTEE WAS ALSO IN ACCORD WITH THE PROPOSED REVIEW OF 
CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES AND THE VOTERS REGISTRATION 
SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION IS STRONGLY ENDORSED IN THE REPORT 
AS LONG OVERDUE. 
 
THE REPORT ALSO REFLECTS THE EMPHASIS YOU PLACE ON THE 
NEED TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE FIVE COMMISSIONS OF 
INQUIRY INTO PUBLIC OFFICERS\' ASSETS, GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS, PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, LAND ADMINISTRATION, 
AND DONATED CRUDE AND REFINED OIL. MANY SPEAKERS AT THE 
COMMITTEE\'S VILLAGE MEETINGS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN 
EXTREMELY PASSIONATE, AND OTHERS VIVIDLY AGITATED, WHEN 
ECHOING THE COUNCIL\'S DEMAND THAT EVERY BUTUT STOLEN 
FROM GOVERNMENT BE RECOVERED. 
 
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, YOU HELD DIVERGENT VIEWS AS 
FAR AS THE DURATION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD WAS 
CONCERNED. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT, 
AND I WILL COME BACK TO IT LATER IN THIS BROADCAST. 
IN THE MEANTIME, I NOW TURN TO WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAD TO 
SAY ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. THE REPORT RIGHTLY 
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS HAD 
APPLIED LIMITED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GAMBIA IN 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE MILITARY TAKEOVER. THEY HAD 
ALSO, FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FOUR YEAR 
TIMETABLE, APPLIED FURTHER SANCTIONS IN THE FORM OF A 
TRAVEL ADVICE AGAINST VACATION IN THE GAMBIA, RESULTING 
IN MASSIVE REDUNDANCIES IN THE TOURIST SECTOR, AND 
CONSIDERABLE LOSS OF REVENUE OTHERWISE DUE TO THE 
GOVERNMENT. THIS RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF VIRTUALLY 
ALL THE HOTELS, THEREBY CAUSING CONSIDERABLE HARDSHIP 
FOR MANY OF YOU. IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT REGRET THAT 
WHILE THE INTRICATE AND TIME CONSUMING ARRANGEMENTS WERE 
BEING MADE TO SET UP THE COMMISSIONS, PREPARE THE 
TRANSITION PROGRAM AND TIMETABLE, AND CARRY OUT THE 
NATIONAL CONSULTATIONS, OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS 
UNILATERALLY DECIDED THAT THE PROPOSED FOUR YEAR 
TRANSITION PERIOD WAS TOO LONG, AND IMPOSED THE SAID 
SANCTIONS WHICH CAUSED SO MUCH HARDSHIP. THE COMMITTEE 
CANNOT BE BLAMED FOR CONCLUDING THAT THIS UNDESERVED 
PUNITIVE MEASURE IS MERELY BECAUSE THE GAMBIA IS DEVOID 
OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. 
 
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE TOURIST INDUSTRY, CONSIDERABLE 
EFFORT WAS MADE BY THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND 
TOURISM TO ATTRACT TOURISTS FROM OTHER EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES. INTERESTED TOUR OPERATORS VISITED THE GAMBIA, 
AND EXPRESSED THEIR INTENTION TO BRING IN TOURISTS NEXT 
SEASON. IN THE MEANTIME, A SMALL NUMBER OF TOURISTS 
CONTINUED TO COME FROM THE TRADITIONAL CATCHMENT AREA, 
MAINLY IN BRITAIN, THANKS TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND 
COOPERATION OF THE TOUR OPERATORS THE GAMBIA EXPERIENCE, 
WHO DECLINED TO JOIN THE APPARENT BOYCOTT. THIS 
ENCOURAGING GESTURE, AT THE TIME OF THE CRITICAL AND 
UNEXPECTED ECONOMIC SITUATION DESCRIBED EARLIER, WAS, 
AND STILL IS, DEEPLY APPRECIATED. 
 
WHILE DETERMINED EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE TO PROTECT THE 
TOURIST INDUSTRY, THE VARIOUS TRANSITION ACTIVITIES I 
HAVE JUST REFERRED TO WERE GOING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE 
OUTCOME OF THIS TWO PRONG APPROACH HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL 
ONE. IN ADDITION TO THE PROSPECT OF ADDITIONAL TOUR 
OPERATORS, AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE SWEDISH TRAVEL 
ADVICE, THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED 
ITS WORK AND SUBMITTED ITS REPORT. 
 
MANY OF THE COMMITTEE\'S RECOMMENDATIONS TALLY WITH THE 
PROVISIONS AND ACTIVITIES IN COUNCIL\'S PROGRAM AND 
TIMETABLE. THE MAIN EXCEPTIONS ARE THE AREA OF FORMING 
AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT AND THE ADVICE TO HOLD NO 
REFERENDUM. 
 
THERE ALREADY EXISTS AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WITH A LARGE 
CIVILIAN MAJORITY OF TWO TO ONE, AND THERE IS NO LOGICAL 
REASON FOR FORMING A NEW ONE. 
 
AS FOR THE HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM A NUMBER OF CLAUSES 
IN THE GAMBIAN CONSTITUTION, STILL IN FORCE, CALL FOR A 
REFERENDUM BEFORE MAJOR AMENDMENTS ARE MADE. THE 
INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION WOULD THEREFORE MAKE 
A REFERENDUM EVEN MORE DESIRABLE. FURTHERMORE, NO 
CONSTITUTION OF THIS COUNTRY WAS EVER PUT TO YOU THE 
PEOPLE FOR ADOPTION. THE NEW CONSTITUTION SHOULD 
THEREFORE BE VOTED UPON IN A REFERENDUM. 
 
THE MAIN ISSUE ON WHICH THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE 
COMMITTEE WAS CREATED TO ADVISE WAS THE DURATION OF THE 
TRANSITION PERIOD- IN THIS REGARD THE COMMITTEE 
RECOMMENDED A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS WITH EFFECT FROM THE 
22ND OF JULY, 1994. I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU, THAT 
HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE COMMITTEE\'S OBSERVATIONS 
AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE 
PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES, AND, IN PARTICULAR, YOUR BEST 
INTERESTS, COUNCIL AND THE CABINET HAVE ACCEPTED THIS 
RECOMMENDATION. 
 
 
FELLOW GAMBIANS! 
WITH THE ISSUE OF THE TIMETABLE FINALLY BEHIND US, WE 
SHOULD NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION, WHOLLY, TO NATIONAL 
UNITY, AND TO THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF DEVELOPING THE 
MOTHERLAND. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT 
PROJECTS IN OUR PROGRAM. THE MOST URGENT ONES INCLUDE 
THE AUGMENTATION OF THE GENERATING CAPACITY OF KOTU 
POWER STATION. THERE ARE ALSO A FEW ROAD AND SCHOOL 
BUILDING PROJECTS. SOMETHING SHOULD ALSO BE DONE FOR THE 
EASANT FARMERS AND THE YOUTHS. THE TRANSITION 
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE COMMISSIONS, THE VARIOUS REVIEWS, 
REGISTRATION OF VOTERS, AND GENERAL AND PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS ARE ALSO THERE. 
 
I APPEAL TO ALL OF YOU TO PLAY YOUR PART IN THE NATIONAL 
EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. 
 
I ALSO APPEAL AGAIN TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AS I 
DID AT OUR NEW YEAR MEETING, TO RESUME THEIR NORMAL, 
POSITIVE ROLE AS DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. THERE IS A LOT OF 
WORK TO BE DONE DURING THE SHORT TRANSITION PERIOD, AND 
THE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT 
PARTNERS WOULD FACILITATE AND ENHANCE RAPID PROGRESS. 
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 
 
GOD BLESS YOU ! 
LONG LIVE THE SECOND REPUBLIC ! 
 
 
3.  (C)  COMMENT:  AT A RECEPTION ON FEBRUARY 4 
AMBASSADOR SAW JUSTICE MINISTER MBYE, SECRETARY 
GENERAL WADDA, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NCC PETERS.  IN 
SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, ALL WERE VERY EUPHORIC OF 
CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE NCC\'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE.  AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT IT WAS PREFERABLE 
THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAD ACCEPTED RATHER THAN REJECTED 
THE NCC RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT POLITELY AND FIRMLY TOLD 
THEM THAT TWO YEARS WAS TOO LONG AND THAT A 
DEMOCRATIC REFERENDUM ON THE LENGTH OF THE TIMETABLE 
HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE.  THEY SEEMED SURPRISED AT THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE.  THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN.  AS WE WILL REPORT BY SEPTEL, THE EU AND UK 
REPRESENTATIVES WERE ALSO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TWO 
YEAR TIMETABLE.

SUBJECT:  TEXT OF SPEECH GIVEN BY AMBASSADOR SCOTT UPON 
PRESENTATION OF HIS CREDENTIALS AND THE RESPONSE BY 
CHAIRMAN JAMMEH 
 
REF:  BANJUL 467 
 
1.  FOLLOWING ARE THE REMARKS MADE BY AMBASSADOR GERALD 
W. SCOTT UPON PRESENTATION OF HIS CREDENTIALS ON 
FEBRUARY 16. 
 
QUOTE:  MR. CHAIRMAN:  I HAVE THE HONOR TO PRESENT TO 
YOUR EXCELLENCY AS CHIEF OF STATE THE LETTER OF RECALL 
OF MY PREDECESSOR AND WITH IT THE LETTER FROM MY 
PRESIDENT ACCREDITING ME TO YOU AND TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE GAMBIA AS HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE. 
 
I AM GREATLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I WISH 
TO ASSURE YOUR EXCELLENCY OF MY PERSONAL DESIRE TO 
PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE TIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS. 
 
IN EXERCISING THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HOPE TO ACQUIRE A 
WIDE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE GAMBIA AND TO 
COME TO KNOW ITS PEOPLE -- WHOSE MARKED VIRTUE AND 
FRIENDLY CHARACTER HAVE BEEN ATTESTED BY ALL TO WHOM I 
HAVE SPOKEN.  BUT IT WILL BE MY SPECIAL DESIRE, 
EXCELLENCY, TO FOSTER CLEAR AND HELPFUL COMMUNICATION 
BETWEEN MY GOVERNMENT AND YOURS.  IN DOING SO, IT WILL 
BE MY ENDEAVOR TO CONVEY MY GOVERNMENT\'S VIEWS WITH 
ACCURACY AND TO REPORT FAITHFULLY THE VIEWS OF YOUR 
EXCELLENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GAMBIA. 
 
IN SPITE OF THE BEST INTENTIONS OF MEN OF GOOD WILL, WE 
LIVE IN A TROUBLED WORLD. THE REGION OF WEST AFRICA HAS 
NOT ESCAPED THE FLAIL OF CIVIL WAR.  IT IS WITH A 
SPECIAL FEELING OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEREFORE, THAT I 
ARRIVE TO REPRESENT MY GOVERNMENT BEFORE YOU, THE LEADER 
OF A NATION AT PEACE WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND A NATION 
WHICH CAN ACT TO PROMOTE PEACE, STABILITY AND 
RECONCILIATION IN THE REGION.  I WISH ESPECIALLY TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRIVILEGE OF ASSISTING AT A KEY MOMENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAMBIA AS GAMBIANS PROCEED IN THE 
NEXT FEW MONTHS UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP TO ESTABLISH A NEW 
CONSTITUTION AND A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY.  IT IS THE 
EARNEST HOPE OF MY GOVERNMENT THAT THIS TRANSITION WILL 
LEAD TO AN ERA OF PEACE, PROSPERITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL 
THE CITIZENS OF THE GAMBIA. 
 
MR. CHAIRMAN, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GAMBIA AND THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, EACH IN ITS 
OWN WAY, SEEK THE GOOD OF ITS OWN PEOPLE AND OF THE 
LARGER WORLD.  OUR COUNTRIES HAVE MANY GOALS IN COMMON 
AND MANY AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN BE OF MUTUAL SUPPORT.  IT 
IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DISAGREE UPON OCCASION, BUT I 
PLEDGE TO WEIGH CAREFULLY AND FULLY ANY VIEWS YOUR 
EXCELLENCY OR YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S MINISTERS MAY OFFER. 
AND SHOULD THERE BE A DIVERGENCE OF VIEW, IT WILL BE MY 
ENDEAVOR TO ASSURE THAT THESE ARE COUCHED IN THE TERMS 
OF RESPECT AND MODERATION THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO 
EXCHANGES BETWEEN TWO NATIONS OF SUCH LONG-STANDING 
FRIENDSHIP. 
 
MR. CHAIRMAN, WE ARE FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN AN ERA IN 
WHICH THE FOSTERING OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT, 
THE NURTURING OF RESPONSIBLE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, 
AND THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARE GOALS 
UNIVERSALLY PROCLAIMED.  THE GAMBIA AND THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA BOTH WORK TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES. 
AS WE DO SO, I BEG YOU TO COUNT ON THE SYMPATHY AND 
COOPERATION OF MY GOVERNMENT.  AND I PARTICULARLY ASK 
THAT YOU COUNT ON ME AND MY EMBASSY TO ASSIST IN 
WHATEVER WAY IS APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT PROGRESS TOWARDS 
THE MANY GOALS COMMON TO US BOTH.  END QUOTE. 
 
2.  RESPONSE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AFPRC AND HEAD OF 
STATE, CAPTAIN YAHYA A.J.J. JAMMEH: 
 
QUOTE:  MR. AMBASSADOR, IN ACCEPTING YOUR LETTERS OF 
CREDENCE, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR 
APPOINTMENT AS AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I ALSO 
ACCEPT THE LETTERS OF RECALL OF YOUR PREDECESSOR. 
I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED TO 
PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE TIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.  THE GAMBIA AND 
THE UNITED STATES HAVE TRADITIONALLY ENJOYED DECADES OF 
FRUITFUL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONS.  IT IS OUR 
SINCERE HOPE THAT SUCH COOPERATION WILL REMAIN THE BASIS 
FOR STILL CLOSER TIES AND INTERACTIONS IN AS MANY AREAS 
AS POSSIBLE. 
 
MR. AMBASSADOR, I WELCOME YOUR INTENTION TO FOSTER 
UNBIASED AND HELPFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE GAMBIA.  MAINTAINING OBJECTIVE LINES OF 
COMMUNICATION IS AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE IN THE 
CORDIAL AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE MULTIFACETED 
RELATIONS BETWEEN ANY TWO COUNTRIES.  ON THE CONTRARY, 
BIASED AND SENSATIONAL REPORTING DELIBERATELY AIMED AT 
DESTABILISATION, CREATES SUSPICION WHICH IN TURN 
ADVERSELY AFFECTS BILATERAL RELATIONS.  I THEREFORE 
WELCOME YOUR SCOPE AND BREADTH OF VISION.  THERE MAY AT 
TIMES BE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS ON 
CERTAIN MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST, BUT WE SHOULD 
HEARTILY AGREE TO DISAGREE WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE. 
OUR PERSPECTIVES AND SOCIAL ONTOLOGY MAY BE DIFFERENT, 
BUT WE HAVE A COMMONALITY OF INTENT TO DO WHAT IS BEST 
FOR OUR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES. 
 
AS TWO SOVEREIGN NATIONS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CATER 
FOR EACH OTHER\'S NUANCES; EACH OTHER\'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT 
AS A STATE MUST BE RESPECTED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE 
PECULIARITIES OF OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC HISTORY AND THE 
PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE MUST HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT 
FOR EACH OTHER\'S SOVEREIGNTY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SIZE 
AND ECONOMIC POWER OF THE COUNTRY CONCERNED.  WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT IS THE PEOPLE OF CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY WHO 
HAVE THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE.  THE GAMBIA IS 
NO EXCEPTION. 
 
MR. AMBASSADOR, YOU ASSUME YOUR DUTIES AT A TIME WHEN 
THE GAMBIA IS GOING THROUGH THE MOST CRUCIAL TURNING- 
POINT IN ITS HISTORY SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  THOMAS 
JEFFERSON, ONE OF THE PIONEERING SPIRITS WHO GAVE BIRTH 
TO SOME OF THE GREATEST IDEALS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, 
WAS EMPHATIC THAT A GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT 
REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS PEOPLE DESERVES TO BE THROWN OUT. 
WE DID JUST THAT. 
 
SINCE WE TOOK OVER THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT ON JULY 22ND 
1994, THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL HAS 
BEEN DILIGENTLY IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAMME OF 
RECTIFICATION AND A TIMETABLE FOR A TRANSITION TO 
DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL RULE BY JULY 1996.  WE HAVE 
NOT MET ALL THE SCHEDULED DEADLINES ON TIME BUT ALL THE 
NECESSARY EFFORT IS BEING MADE WITH CONSIDERABLE 
SUCCESS.  MOST OF OUR PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL 
BE COMPLETED WELL BEFORE THE ELECTIONS; AND ON THE 
GOVERNANCE TIMETABLE MOST OF THE MAJOR STEPS TOWARDS THE 
ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. 
 
ACCORDINGLY, ONCE AGAIN, WE URGE ALL FRIENDLY COUNTRIES 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CHERISH THE IDEALS OF TRUE 
DEMOCRACY TO ASSIST THE GAMBIA IN WHICHEVER WAY THEY CAN 
IN THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL RULE 
BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE. 
 
IN CONCLUSION, LET ME AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR 
ASSIGNMENT WELCOME YOU ONCE AGAIN TO THE GAMBIA AND 
REASSURE YOU OF MY FULL SUPPORT AND THAT OF THE ENTIRE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF THE GAMBIA IN THE 
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF YOUR IMPORTANT MISSION. 
 
I SINCERELY HOPE THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GAMBIA AND 
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE IMPROVED UPON DURING YOUR TERM 
OF OFFICE.  I THANK YOU.  UNQUOTE.

TAGS: PGOV, GA 
SUBJECT: CHAIRMAN JAMMEH RETIRES FROM THE ARMY - 
         AS A COLONEL 
 
REF: BANJUL 2197 
 
1- SUMMARY: ON 6 SEPTEMBER A FEW DAYS AFTER BEING 
PROMOTED FROM CAPTAIN TO COLONEL, CHAIRMAN YAHYA JAMMEH 
RETIRED FROM THE GAMBIAN ARMY, THUS MAKING HIMSELF 
LEGALLY ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE 26 
SEPTEMBER ELECTION. THE ELABORATE RETIREMENT CEREMONY 
WAS ACTUALLY A POLITICAL EVENT MADE PALATABLE BY A 
PATINA OF MILITARY POMP. END SUMMARY 
 
2. IN A CEREMONY AT 22 JULY SQUARE IN DOWNTOWN BANJUL, 
RECENTLY PROMOTED (EFFECTIVE DATE 28 AUGUST) COLONEL 
YAHYA JAMMEH RETIRED, WITH SUITABLE POMP AND 
CIRCUMSTANCE, FROM THE GAMBIAN ARMY.  THE CEREMONY WAS 
A COMBINATION OF BRITISH MILITARY TRADITION AND AFRICAN 
SPICE.  OFFICIALLY TERMED A PARADE, THE BACKDROP WAS 
PROVIDED BY A SHARP-LOOKING UNIT OF ABOUT 250 FATIGUE- 
CLAD SOLDIERS AND A 30-PIECE ARMY BAND.  THE TROOPS 
MARCHED WELL, AND THEIR OFFICERS AND NCO SHOUTED 
COMMANDS IN THE BEST BRITISH ARMY SQUARE BASHING 
MANNER. 
 
3. JAMMEH, AS IS HIS WONT, ARRIVED ABOUT ONE HOUR LATE 
IN THE USUAL MULTI-VEHICLE CONVOY FROM HIS COMPOUND 
DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE SQUARE.   EVEN THOUGH HE HAD 
NOT YET OFFICIALLY RETIRED, HE APPEARED IN HIS 
ELECTIONEERING ENSEMBLE (A GREEN BRIMLESS AFRICAN HAT 
SET UPON AN ORANGE BURNOOSE-LIKE AFFAIR AND A LIGHT 
BLUE BOU BOU, WITH A TRADITIONAL DESERT WARRIOR\'S SWORD 
HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND) RATHER THAN THE FULL COLONEL\'S 
UNIFORM ONE WOULD EXPECT FOR A RETIREMENT CEREMONY. 
THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES READ A SHORT, BUT EXHAUSTIVE 
LIST OF THE COLONEL\'S MILITARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, 
INCLUDING HIS MILITARY POLICE OFFICER COURSE AT FORT 
MCCLELLAN, ALABAMA (WHICH HE COMPLETED AS A FIRST 
LIEUTENANT IN EARLY 1994, JUST BEFORE HIS METEORIC RISE 
THROUGH THE RANKS BEGAN). 
 
4. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT SPEECH BY THE CHAIRMAN 
IN WHICH HE STATED THAT WHILE HE WOULD ALWAYS BE A 
SOLDIER AT HEART, HE WAS GIVING IN TO THE WISHES OF THE 
PEOPLE AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  THIS MENTION OF HIS 
CANDIDACY BROUGHT SUSTAINED CHEERING FROM HIS MANY 
SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE 
PEOPLE LOOKED TO THE MILITARY AND POLICE TO MAINTAIN 
THE PEACE DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  HE FINISHED BY 
ASSURING THE TROOPS  \"THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DONE TO 
IMPROVE YOUR CONDITIONS.\" 
 
5. HE THEN INSPECTED THE TROOPS WHILE WHAT WAS 
DESCRIBED AS A 21-GUN SALUTE BY THE MC WAS FIRED IN THE 
BACKGROUND.  THE SALUTE SEEMED TO RUN CLOSER TO ABOUT 
13 GUNS, AND THE GUNS THEMSELVES WERE NOT ACTUALLY 
GUNS, BUT SOMETHING CLOSER TO FIRECRACKERS, WHICH THREE 
SOLDIERS AT A FAR COSNER OF THE SQUARE LIT AND TOSSED 
ABOUT 15 FEET, WHERE THEY EXPLODED WITH FLASHES, BANGS 
AND SMOKE.  UPON HIS RETURN TO THE VIEWING STAND, THE 
TROOPS MARCHED OFF THE FIELD WITH THE BAND PLAYING AULD 
LANG SANG, FOUR BAGPIPERS PLAYED A MEDLEY, AND THEN A 
GROUP OF ABOUT 60 SOLDIERS RETURNED TO THE FIELD FOR A 
MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION. 
 
6. THIS LAST WAS CHOREOGRAPHED BY ONE OF A TRIO OF 
NORTH KOREAN MILITARY MEN LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND OF 
THE CEREMONY.  STANDING ON A CHAIR AND GIVING A SERIES 
OF HAND SIGNALS, THE COMRADE HAD HIS CHARGES CHOPPING, 
KICKING, FENDING OFF AND GENERALLY FIGHTING, IF NOT AS 
WELL VAN DAMME, AT LEAST AS WELL AS A GRADUATING CLASS 
AT ANY NORTHERN VIRGINIA JHOON RHEE KARATE DOJO.  THE 
CROWD LOVED IT.  THE FINALE, A BRICK BREAKING 
DEMONSTRATI0N, REALLY BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR FEET. 
 
7. COMMENT. THERE WERE PROBABLY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IN THE SQUARE AND ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND LOOKING ON 
THROUGH THE BARRED PERIMETER FENCE.  MOST OF BANJUL, 
HOWEVER, APPEARED NOT TO CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAD TO BE 
THE BIGGEST EVENT IN TOWN ON THAT DAY.  THE STREETS 
WERE FULL OF PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR NORMAL BUSINESS 
WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SQUARE, 
GIVING THE NOISY GOINGS ON A SECOND GLANCE.  WHETHER 
THEY WERE JUST TOO BUSY OR REALLY NOT ALL THAT FOND OF 
JAMMEH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.  END COMMENT

1. CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DOUGLAS ROHN FOR REASONS 
1.5B&D. 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY: CHAIRMAN YAHYA JAMMEH WON THE 26 
SEPTEMBER GAMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITH A 56 
PERCENT MAJORITY.  PRIMARY CHALLENGER OUSAINOU DARBOE 
RECEIVED 36 PERCENT, AND TWO MINOR CANDIDATES SPLIT 
THE DIFFERENCE.  THE ELECTION PROCESS AS PLANNED AND 
MANAGED BY THE PIEC WAS PEACEFUL, CALM, AND 
EFFICIENT, A FACT WHICH PLEASES MANY GAMBIANS.  THE 
PRE-ELECTION PERIOD WAS MARKED BY A POLICY OF 
INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT BY GOTG SECURITY FORCES 
THAT PROBABLY INFLUENCED THE VOTE.  THE GOTG BELIEVES 
THAT IT HAS MET THE WEST\'S REQUIREMENT FOR AN 
ELECTION, AND WILL TAKE A VERY SOUR VIEW OF ANY 
CRITICISM OF THE JUST CONCLUDED ELECTORAL PROCESS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C)  THE ELECTORAL PROCESS:  AS DESCRIBED IN REF 
B, ELECTION DAY IN THE GAMBIA WAS QUIET, CALM, AND 
PEACEFUL.  ACCORDING TO ANDREW LADLEY, A NEW ZEALAND 
LAW PROFESSOR WORKING WITH THE PROVISIONAL 
INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (PIEC), ASIDE FROM A 
FEW INCIDENTS, THE MOST SERIOUS OF WHICH WAS THE 
MOSQUE AFFAIR NOTED IN REF B, THE ELECTION WAS A 
MODEL OF EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY. IN HIS VIEW, 
THAT FACT ALONE HAS ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF DEMOCRACY 
HERE. HE WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESS OF 
THE ONE-DAY PRE-ELECTION COOLING OFF PERIOD. 
 
4.  (C)  VOTING PATTERNS:  THE CHAIRMAN WON WITH A 56 
PERCENT MAJORITY.  HE DID WELL IN MOST PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY.  JAMMEH PAINTED DARBOE AS THE MANDINKA 
CANDIDATE (DARBOE AND FORMER PRESIDENT JAWARA ARE 
MANDINKA, AS ARE ABOUT 45 PERCENT OF GAMBIANS). 
JAMMEH, WHO HAD BASED MUCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY 
ON CONDEMNING AND OVERCOMING MANDINKA TRIBALISM AND, 
INDEED, TRIBALISM IN GENERAL, DID WELL AMONGST THE 
MANDINKA, WINNING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN 
HEAVILY MANDINKA AREAS. HE CAPTURED MORE THAN 75 
PERCENT IN AREAS DOMINATED BY HIS NATIVE JOLA TRIBE. 
 
5.  (C)  THE PIEC:  THE COMMISSION ADMINISTERED THE 
ELECTION WELL.  EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS WERE IN PLACE TO 
ENSURE THE FAIRNESS OF THE VOTE AND THE COUNT.  ON 
THE TECHNICAL SIDE, THE PIEC DESERVES KUDOS.  WHEN 
CALLED UPON TO CONTROL VARIOUS GOTG ABUSES, HOWEVER, 
THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER.  THEY DID 
PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT MEDIA\'S OBVIOUS SUPPORT FOR 
JAMMEH (REF E), AND THEY TALKED TO THE ARMY, POLICE, 
AND NIA ABOUT DEMONSTRATIONS OF SUPPORT FOR JAMMEH. 
WHEN THE OPPOSITION CONTINUED TO BE BANNED FROM THE 
MEDIA AND AS THE SECURITY FORCES CONTINUED TO SHOW 
OBVIOUS SUPPORT FOR JAMMEH, NO FURTHER ACTION WAS 
TAKEN.  AS VICE-CHAIRMAN BISHOP JOHNSON SAID AT THE 
21 SEPTEMBER, PRESS CONFERENCE, \"WE SHOWED THE YELLOW 
CARD, BUT NOT THE RED.\"  HE EXPRESSED HIS FEAR THAT 
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE GOTG, \"WOULD RESULT IN 
CHAOS.\" 
 
6.  (C)  INTIMIDATION AS A POLICY - WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
NUMEROUS GAMBIAN CONTACTS AND WITH ZOE TEMBO, THE 
ZAMBIAN DIRECTOR OF THE AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEMOCRACY 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS STUDIES, WHO COORDINATED THE 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER EFFORT.  BASED ON WHAT THEY 
HAVE TOLD US, AND ON WHAT WE SAW IN THE BANJUL AREA 
THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN, THE GOTG WORKED AT 
INTIMIDATING VOTERS.  ACCORDING TO TEMBO, FOR 
EXAMPLE, SOLDIERS IN JAMMEH\'S ENTOURAGE TOLD VOTERS 
IN MANY PLACES THAT, \"THERE IS A WAR COMING IF YOU DO 
NOT VOTE FOR JAMMEH.\"  SHE SAID THAT THE MILITARY 
ESCORT, WHICH WAS LARGE AND ARMED WITH HEAVY WEAPONS, 
TOLD VOTERS THAT, \"WE HAVE ONE BULLET FOR EVERY VOTE 
FOR DARBOE.\"  ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING THE ARMY 
SHOWED UP WITH AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND TWO TWIN FORTY 
MILLIMETER ANTI-AIRCRAFT CANNONS AT JAMMEH RALLIES IN 
THE BANJUL/KOMBOS AREA.  TEMBO ALSO CLAIMS THAT THERE 
WAS AN NIA PLAIN CLOTHES AGENT AT EVERY POLLING 
PLACE, AND THAT THE VOTERS KNEW WHO THEY WERE AND WHY 
THEY WERE THERE. 
 
7.  (C)  TEMBO, A VETERAN OF MANY AFRICAN ELECTIONS 
COMMENTED THAT THE VOTING WENT TOO PEACEFULLY.  SHE 
SAID THAT, \"THE PEOPLE ACTED LIKE ROBOTS.\"  SHE ALSO 
NOTED THE LACK OF REAL JOY AT JAMMEH\'S ELECTION AMONG 
NEARLY EVERYONE EXCEPT SOLDIERS AND SOME YOUNG 
PEOPLE.  A PHENOMENON SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER 
EXPERIENCED IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN AFRICAN ELECTION. 
 
8. (C) JAMMEH\'S CAMPAIGN STRATEGY WORKED.  HE HAD 
SPENT TWO YEARS TALKING ABOUT THE CORRUPTION OF THE 
PRECEDING THIRTY.  LAWYER DARBOE HAD DEFENDED SOME OF 
THE MINISTERS TRIED BY THE GOTG FOR CORRUPTION.  THE 
APRC TRIED TO TAR HIM WITH THE BRUSH OF GUILT BY 
ASSOCIATION.  THE PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO 
THE JAWARA YEARS.  JAMMEH HAS DONE A LOT IN 
COMPARISON WITH THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT.  HE HAS BUILT 
16 SCHOOLS, IS BUILDING A HOSPITAL AND A NEW AIRPORT 
TERMINAL, AS WELL AS A TRIUMPHAL ARCH.  HE HAS A 
STRONG BASE OF LEGITIMATE SUPPORT. 
 
9.  (C)  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OPPOSITION, IN A VERY 
SHORT TIME FRAME, WITH ALMOST NO TV OR RADIO TIME, 
AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES THAT 
JAMMEH SO FREELY USED, RECEIVED FORTY-FOUR PERCENT OF 
THE VOTE. 
 
10.  (C) COMMENT: THE APRC WAS NOT GOING TO LOSE. 
THEY DREW ON EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO THEM.  THE 
INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS THE VIOLENCE (REF A) AT THE 
END OF THE CAMPAIGN SHOWED THAT THEY WOULD DO 
WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD TO TO WIN.  NOW THEY 
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SATISFIED WHAT THEY SEE AS A 
WESTERN IMPOSED REQUIREMENT TO HAVE AN ELECTION.  THE 
PIEC, INVOKING THE SPECTER OF RWANDA AND OTHER FAILED 
STATES, AVOIDED FORCING THE GOVERNMENT TO EITHER PLAY 
FAIR OR CALL OFF THE ELECTION.  THE GOTG WOULD HAVE 
IGNORED THEM ANYWAY.  GAMBIANS ARE GENERALLY 
SATISFIED THAT THEY HAD A PEACEFUL ELECTION.  THE 
WERE AFRAID, THE GOTG PLAYED UPON THAT FEAR, ANDIT 
WORKED. 
 
11.  (C)  THE GOTG WILL SEE ANY FUTHER COMMENTS FROM 
THE WEST ABOUT AN UNLEVEL PLAING FIELD AND A POLICY 
F INTIMIDATION AS SOUR GRAPES.  NO MATTER OUR 
PROTESTATIONS THAT OUR ONLY GOAL WAS A FREE AND FAIR 
ELECTION, THEY HAVE ALWAYS PERCEIVED US AS SUPPORTING 
DARBOE (REF D).   END COMMENT.

THE MILITARY? 
 
REF: (A) BANJUL 2394 
 
1. CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY KELLY, 
REASON 1.5 B & D 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  AS THE DUST SETTLES FROM THE 
ELECTION, MORE IS CREATED AS THE MILITARY TAKE TO THE 
STREETS, EVEN THOUGH JAMMEH DISSOLVED THE ARMED 
FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) THE PRESENCE OF SOLDIERS ON THE STREETS IN THE 
GREATER BANJUL AREA HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE 
PAST MONTH COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HERE OVER 
THE PAST YEAR. DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 
YAHYA JAMMEH WAS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE 
MILITARY BODYGUARD.  THE GAMBIA NATIONAL ARMY (GNA) 
COMMANDER, LT. COL. JATTA, WAS SEEN AT JAMMEH RALLIES 
WEARING JAMMEH COLORS.  SOLDIERS MADE IT NO SECRET 
WHO THE MILITARY SUPPORTED IN THE ELECTION. 
 
4. (C) THE MILITARY TOOK TO THE STREETS IN FULL FORCE 
ON SEPTEMBER 27 AND 28 IN CELEBRATION OF YAHYA 
JAMMEH\'S VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  SEVERAL TRUCK LOADS 
OF SOLDIERS DROVE PAST THE EMBASSY, SHOUTING AND 
WAVING THEIR FISTS.  ONE ELECTION OBSERVER SAID IT IS 
AS IF THE MILITARY HAS NOW LEGITIMIZED ITSELF. 
 
5. (C) IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON SATURDAY, 
SEPTEMBER 28, JAMMEH ANNOUNCED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES PROVISIONAL RULING 
COUNCIL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE GOVERNING BODY SINCE THE 
JULY 1994 COUP.  HE STATED THAT THE CABINET IS THE 
80LE PROVISIONAL GOVERNING BODY UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT 
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN ELECTED. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: IT APPEARS THAT THE SOLDIERS SEE 
JAMMEH\'S VICTORY AS A VICTORY FOR THE MILITARY. 
THE MILITARY POWER THAT TRAVELLED WITH JAMMEH DURING 
HIS CAMPAIGN SERVED AS INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS 
PROTECTION (ALTHOUGH WHY HE WOULD NEED ANTI-AIRCRAFT 
GUNS (REFTEL) AS PROTECTION IS AN OPEN QUESTION). THE 
OVERT PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY ON THE STREETS HAS 
PROBABLY HELPED MAINTAIN THE CALM WE HAVE WITNESSED 
SINCE THE ELECTION.  WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL BE 
MAINTAINED ONCE THE SOLDIERS FINALLY GO BACK TO THE 
BARRACKS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/11 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, LI, SN, GA 
SUBJECT: THE GAMBIA -- JAMMEH\'S WEST AFRICA POLICY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR GEORGE W. HALEY FOR 
REASONS 1.5 B/D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT DEVELOPED A 
COHERENT STRATEGY FOR WEST AFRICAN REGIONAL 
SECURITY, PRESIDENT JAMMEH WANTS TO BE A MORE 
VISIBLE PLAYER IN SUB-REGIONAL DIPLOMACY. 
NEVERTHELESS, JAMMEH IS KEEN ON DEVELOPING A 
REPUTATION AS AN INFLUENTIAL PEACE BROKER.  WITH 
EFFORTS IN THE CASAMANCE STYMIED DUE TO SENEGALESE 
PRESIDENT WADE\'S SPHINX-LIKE SILENCE TO BANJUL\'S 
OVERTURES, JAMMEH PICTURES THE MANO RIVER AS HIS 
NEW WADING POOL.  SINCE PRESIDENT TAYLOR VISITED 
BANJUL LATE MARCH, THE GAMBIA HAS BEEN MORE 
INVOLVED IN ECOWAS DELIBERATIONS AND IN BILATERAL 
CONTACTS WITH MONROVIA.  THE SOPHOMORIC JAMMEH MAY 
BE OVER HIS HEAD AND WIND UP FLAILING IN THE MANO 
RIVER TURBULENCE.  HIS INTERVENTION WILL LIKELY BE 
INEFFECTUAL AND MAY ADD CONFUSION TO A MATTER 
ALREADY FLUSH WITH TROUBLE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
THE PERSON AS POLICY 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) THE GAMBIA HAS NO ARTICULATED SUB-REGION 
FOREIGN POLICY NOR STRATEGY.  JAMMEH AND COHORTS 
HANDLE ISSUES ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  THEY 
APPARENTLY HAVE EMBRACED THE WORKING ASSUMPTION 
THAT A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WOULD NOT EXCEED THE 
SUM OF ITS COMPOSITE PARTS. 
 
3. (C) THE LODESTAR OF GAMBIAN FOREIGN POLICY IS 
JAMMEH\'S APPETITE FOR INFLUENCE, HIS DESIRE TO BE A 
SUB-REGIONAL PLAYER OF SOME ACCOUNT.  BECAUSE THE 
GAMBIA IS SMALL, WEAK AND POOR, JAMMEH HAS FEW 
UTENSILS TO ACHIEVE HIS GOAL.  THUS, HE HAS USED 
THE GAMBIA\'S RELATIVE DOMESTIC STABILITY AND ITS 
INHERENT GEOPOLITICAL IMPUISSANCE TO WIGGLE HIMSELF 
INTO THE MOLD OF A PEACE BROKER.  HOWEVER, CREATION 
OF A REGIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF DURABLE PEACE AND 
CONFLICT PREVENTION SEEMS LESS AN IMPERATIVE THAN 
BEING PERCEIVED AS A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAPABLE OF 
ENGINEERING DRAMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS.  DIPLOMACY AND 
FOREIGN POLICY ARE CONDUCTED IN THE REALM OF 
PERSONAL CONTACTS AND CHEMISTRY, NOT OBJECTIVE 
NATIONAL INTERESTS.  DRUM ROLLS AND FANFARE LOOM 
MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE SUBSTANCE OF PEACE.  THE 
BIRTHPLACE OF GAMBIAN FOREIGN POLICY SEEMS TO BE 
MORE INTESTINAL THAN INTELLECTUAL. 
 
4. (C) THAT MILITARY CONFLICTS HAD VISITED GAMBIA\'S 
IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS GAVE JAMMEH READY VENUES TO 
PRACTICE HIS BRAND OF PERSONALIZED DIPLOMACY. 
AFTER TRANSIENT SUCCESSES MEDIATING DISPUTES IN 
GUINEA-BISSAU AND THE CASAMANCE IN 1999, JAMMEH\'S 
FOREIGN POLICY HAS FOUNDERED LATELY.  HIS INFLUENCE 
IN BISSAU AND DAKAR HAS WANED SINCE THE ELECTIONS 
OF PRESIDENT YALA AND WADE, RESPECTIVELY.  ALTHOUGH 
YALA AND WADE HAVE THEIR INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND 
THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH EACH OTHER, JAMMEH 
INCREASINGLY HAS BEEN THE ODD MAN OUT IN THIS PART 
OF THE WEST AFRICAN NEIGHBORHOOD. 
 
5. (C) IN HIS LATEST ATTEMPT TO AVOID THIS DE FACTO 
ISOLATION, JAMMEH HAS COURTED NOUAKCHOTT AS EVINCED 
BY HIS EARLY MAY VISIT TO MAURITANIA WHERE SEVERAL 
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION WERE 
EXECUTED.  IN PART THE DALLIANCE WITH NOUAKCHOTT IS 
A CLUMSY ATTEMPT TO MAKE DAKAR \"JEALOUS\" AND THUS 
PAY MORE ATTENTION TO BANJUL. 
 
6. (C) JAMMEH REMAINS FOCUSSED ON MAXIMIZING HIS 
INFLUENCE IN THE CASAMANCE PEACE PROCESS. 
CONSEQUENTLY, WADE\'S INSCRUTABILITY HAS BEEN TOUGH 
TO MAW.  THE GAMBIAN FEARS THAT WADE IS 
COMMUNICATING WITH MFDC MODERATES WHILE KEEPING THE 
GAMBIA OUT OF THE LOOP. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DYNAMIC 
BETWEEN WADE AND JAMMEH REMAINS PRIMARILY 
CENTRIFUGAL.  THE MORE WADE SEEMS TO KEEP JAMMEH 
SIDELINED, THE MORE JAMMEH WANTS WADE TO FAIL. 
BECAUSE OF HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VAULT INDIVIDUAL 
PIQUE OVER NATIONAL INTERESTS, JAMMEH MAY FEEL 
COMPELLED TO SYMPATHIZE WITH MFDC HARDLINERS AND 
THEIR MUSCLE-FLEXING REACTIONS TO WADE\'S PEACE 
STRATAGEM.  AS LONG AS WADE DOES NOT LET THE GAMBIA 
MEDIATE THE NEGOTIATIONS, JAMMEH\'S ATTITUDE WILL BE 
ONE OF SCHADENFREUDE NOT OF STATESMANSHIP IN 
SCULPTING A GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY THAT ACTUALLY 
PROMOTES A CASAMANCE PEACE. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
WADING INTO DEEP WATER - THE MANO RIVER FRAY 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) DENIED HIS DESIRED ROLE IN THE CASAMANCE, 
JAMMEH NOW PEERS AT THE MANO RIVER IMBROGLIO AS A 
POTENTIAL VEHICLE TO SECURE HIS MANTLE AS PEACE 
BROKER.  JAMMEH IS ALSO ENERGIZED BY THE BELIEF 
THAT HE HAS THE INSIDE TRACK ON THE ECOWAS CHAIR 
ONCE PRESIDENT KONARE COMPLETES THIS TERM. 
CURRENTLY, JAMMEH SEES NO BETTER WAY TO PREPARE 
HIMSELF FOR THIS ASCENSION THAN VISIBLE INVOLVEMENT 
IN THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE FACING THE SUB-REGION. 
PRESIDENT TAYLOR\'S LATE MARCH VISIT TO BANJUL WAS 
NOT A WHIM.  AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, TAYLOR LIKELY 
HAD TWO RELATED OBJECTIVES.  FIRST, HE RECOGNIZED 
THAT JAMMEH MAY BE IN LINE FOR THE ECOWAS -- HE 
WANTED TO CULTIVATE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP PRIOR 
TO JAMMEH\'S TENURE.  SECOND, TAYLOR WANTED ECOWAS 
TO BE A DIVIDED HOUSE REGARDING SANCTIONS AGAINST 
LIBERIA.  REALIZING THAT MOST ECOWAS COLLEAGUES ARE 
AGAINST HIM, TAYLOR SEEKS A SYMPATHETIC MINORITY TO 
PREVENT ECOWAS CONSENSUS WHICH, IN TURN, WILL 
IMPEDE ANTI-LIBERIA ACTION BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY. 
 
8. (C) ALSO, THE COMMONALTIES BETWEEN THE TAYLOR 
AND JAMMEH CANNOT BE IGNORED.  BOTH ARE DISLIKED BY 
IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS.  BOTH BASICALLY ASSUMED POWER 
BY THE MUSKET AND THUS ARE BETE NOIRE TO THEIR 
COUNTRIES\' POLITICAL INTELLIGENCIA.  BOTH HAVE 
STRONG ANTI-WESTERN STREAKS AND LONG STANDING TIES 
TO LIBYA.  TAYLOR AND BABA JOBE, ARGUABLY THE 
SECOND MOST POWERFUL FIGURE IN THE GAMBIA, TRAINED 
TOGETHER IN LIBYA IN THE 1980S.  PREDICTABLY, JOBE 
IS ENMESHED IN ALL FORMS OF SKULLDUGGERY.  WE 
SUSPECT TAYLOR AND HIS COMPANIONS MAY HAVE EXPLORED 
WITH JAMMEH AND JOBE THE USE OF THE GAMBIA AS A 
POSSIBLE BACK ALLEY FOR COMMERCE TO ESCAPE UN 
SANCTIONS.  BABA JOBE\'S ALMOST INNATE CRIMINALITY 
WOULD LEAD HIM TO ACCEPT SUCH AN OFFER.  ALTHOUGH 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED BY ANY BANGLES AND 
TRINKETS TAYLOR MIGHT HAVE OFFERED, JAMMEH WOULD BE 
MORE CAUTIOUS THAN JOBE.  NONETHELESS, THE 
DIPLOMATIC OPENING BETWEEN BANJUL AND MONROVIA 
PAVES THE ROAD FOR MORE CONTACTS AND THIS INCREASES 
THE CHANCE OF ILLICIT COMMERCE FOR THERE ARE FEW 
THINGS THAT THE LIBERIAN TOUCHES WHICH DO NOT 
BECOME SULLIED. 
 
9. (C) ALREADY, THE GAMBIA\'S VOCABULARY TOWARD 
LIBERIA HAS CHANGED.  MONTHS AGO, FM SEDAT JOBE 
WOULD IMPRECATE TAYLOR THE MOMENT THE LIBERIAN 
ISSUE WAS RAISED.  DURING A MID-MAY CONVERSATION 
WITH AMBASSADOR HALEY, JOBE GROANED THAT SANCTIONS 
AGAINST LIBERIA WERE INIMICAL TO PEACE.  JOBE 
PROTESTED THAT TRAVEL SANCTIONS WERE PARTICULARLY 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY WOULD PREVENT TAYLOR 
FROM ATTENDING PEACE CONFERENCES.  JOBE WENT SO FAR 
AS TO LABEL GUINEAN PRESIDENT CONTE, NOT TAYLOR, AS 
THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO PEACE.  (COMMENT: THAT JOBE 
WOULD UTTER SUCH AN IMPOVERISHED RATIONALE REVEALS 
THE EXTENT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NEW MARCHING ORDERS 
REGARDING LIBERIA.  END COMMENT.) 
 
10. (C) THE GAMBIANS, SEEMINGLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE 
RECENT HISTORY OF THE TROUBLED MANO RIVER UNION, 
APPARENTLY BELIEVE THEY CAN SUCCEED WHERE OTHERS 
HAVE WRECKED -- IN DISCOVERING A FORMULA THAT WILL 
PERSUADE TAYLOR TO NEGOTI9E IN GOOD FAITH.  THE 
FIRST STEP, ACCORDING TO THE GAMBIANS IS THE 
HOLDING OF A TAYLOR-CONTE SUMMIT AIMED AT 
PACIFICATION OF THE GUINEA-LIBERIA BORDER. 
CONSEQUENTLY THE GAMBIANS BLAME CONTE\'S REFUSAL TO 
MEET TAYLOR AS THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK TO THEIR 
APPROACH.  WE HAVE REMINDED THE GAMBIANS ABOUT THE 
NUMEROUS MEETINGS ATTENDED BY BOTH CONTE AND TAYLOR 
AND THE MANY COMMUNIQUQS BOTH HAVE SIGNED.  EVERY 
KNOWN PLATITUDE AND BROMIDE KNOWN TO DIPLOMATIC MAN 
HAS BEEN USED -- TO NO AVAIL.  WE ADVISED THAT 
PUSHING FOR A SUMMIT IN THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE 
PREPARATORY WORK WOULD RAISE EXPECTATIONS UNDULY. 
DISAPPOINTMENT WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE THE GULF 
BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS IS MUCH TOO VAST TO BRIDGE 
IN ONE HIGHLY VISIBLE MEETING.  INSTEAD, FOREIGN 
MINISTERS AND TECHNICAL EXPERTS NEED TO MEET TO 
LESSON THE DIFFERENCES AND IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS 
NEEDING PRESIDENTIAL RESOLUTION.  JOBE SAID HE 
WOULD INCORPORATE THIS RECOMMENDATION IN THE 
GAMBIA\'S APPROACH.  WE WILL SEE. 
 
11. (C) COMMENT: IN BOTH THE CASAMANCE AND THE MANO 
RIVER PROCESSES, THE GAMBIA SEEKS A DRAMATIC 
BREAKTHROUGH.  JAMMEH\'S EFFORTS ARE DRIVEN MORE BY 
HIS ITCH TO BE A STAR THAN HIS DESIRE TO BE A 
STATESMAN.  THEREFORE, HE SEEKS TO MAKE A BIG 
SPLASH, GIVING SECONDARY CONSIDERATION TO WHETHER 
HE IS JUMPING INTO SAFE WATERS OR A HOT CAULDRON. 
EQUIPPED WITH NO REAL STRATEGY, JAMMEH\'S EFFORTS 
LIKELY WILL NOT ADVANCE PEACE IN THE CASAMANCE NOR 
LIBERIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, JAMMEH\'S MEDDLING IN THE 
MANO RIVER FISTICUFFS WILL LIKELY SERVE TAYLOR\'S 
AIMS.  JAMMEH\'S DIPLOMATIC EXPLOITS MAY CLOUD AND 
WEAKEN ANY ECOWAS POLICY CONSENSUS REGARDING 
SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBERIA.  END COMMENT.

HOUSE IMAM, IMAM FATTY, WAS THE ONE WELL-KNOWN 
MUSLIM IN THE GAMBIA WHO SPOKE OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST 
THE US IN THE MONTH AFTER THE SEPT. 11 TRAGEDY.  HE 
BLAMED US POLICY FOR THE ATTACKS.  HIS COMMENTARY 
WAS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THAT OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE GAMBIA, A DEVOUT MUSLIM WHO TOLD 
CDA AND POLOFF THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION IN ISLAM 
FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST THE U.S. (REFTEL C).  A RIVAL

1.  WE DEPLOYED A TEAM OF SIX IEC-ACCREDITED 
ELECTION OBSERVERS FOR THE OCTOBER 18 POLL.  WE 
CONTRIBUTED OUR CDA, IROG, GSO, OUR PROGRAM 
COORDINATOR AND OUR POLITICAL ASSISTANT. IN THEIR 
CONTINUING TRADITION OF UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR 
US, EMBASSY DAKAR CONTRIBUTED THE DATT.  CDA AND OUR 
POLITICAL ASSISTANT COVERED THE WEST COAST AND THE 
INDEPENDENCE STADIUM COUNTING CENTER IN BAKAU 
(BANJUL) ON OCTOBER 18.  IROG COVERED THE FIVE FONI 
DIVISIONS AND THE BWIAM COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER 
16-19.  GSO COVERED THE THREE KIANG DIVISIONS AND 
THE KWINELLA COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER 16-19. 
THE DATT COVERED ILLIASA DIVISION AND THE FARAFENNI 
COUNTING CENTER FROM OCTOBER 17-19.  OUR PROGRAM 
COORDINATOR COVERED BIJILO (THE SUBURBAN BANJUL 
POLLING STATION THAT HAD THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF 
VOTERS REGISTERED IN A SINGLE POLLING STATION IN THE 
COUNTRY), AND CROSSED THE RIVER TO COVER ALBREDA, 
JUFFUREH AND BINTA KINTEH ON OCTOBER 18.  EACH TEAM 
PICKED ONE POLLING STATION TO OBSERVE OPEN AND 
CLOSE, AND THEN TO FOLLOW TO THE RESPECTIVE COUNTING 
CENTER. 
 
2.  OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE 509,395 REGISTERED VOTERS 
VOTED DURING THE OCTOBER 18 POLL.  THESE VOTERS 
UTILIZED 811 POLLING STATIONS.  VOTING TOOK PLACE 
FROM 0700-1600. THE VOTES CAST IN THESE 811 POLLING 
STATIONS WERE COUNTED IN GROUPS CORRESPONDING TO THE 
48 CONSTITUENCIES IN THE COUNTRY, AT 28 COUNTING 
CENTERS.  THE RESULTS FROM THESE COUNTING CENTERS 
WERE TRANSMITTED TO 7 COLLATION CENTERS 
CORRESPONDING TO THE 7 ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS IN THE 
COUNTRY.  EACH COLLATION CENTER REPORTED THEIR 
RESULTS TO IEC HEADQUARTERS IN BANJUL, WHERE THEY 
WERE ANNOUNCED AS RECEIVED BY IEC DIRECTOR GABRIEL 
ROBERTS.  PRESIDENT JAMMEH AND THE APRC RECEIVED 
242,302 VOTES (52,96 PERCENT), OUSANINOU DARBOE AND 
THE UDP COALITION RECEIVED 149,448 VOTES (32.67 
PERCENT), HAMAT BAH AND THE NRP RECEIVED 35,671 
VOTES (7.8 PERCENT), SHERIFF DIBBA AND THE NCP 
RECEIVED 17,271 VOTES (3.78 PERCENT) AND SIDIA 
JATTA AND THE PDOIS RECEIVED 13,841 VOTES (3.03 
PERCENT). 
 
3.  THE FOLLOWING PERSONS WERE AUTHORIZED TO BE 
PRESENT IN A POLLING STATION DURING THE POLL: 
POLLING STATION STAFF (CONSISTING OF A PRESIDING 
OFFICER (PO), AN ASSISTANT PRESIDING OFFICER (APO) 
AND TWO POLICE OFFICERS ASSIGNED AS SECURITY), 
POLLING AGENTS FROM ALL FIVE POLITICAL PARTIES, 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND CREDENTIALED PRESS. 
UPON ARRIVAL BEFORE THE 0700 STARTING TIME, ANY OF 
THE ABOVEMENTIONED PRESENT WERE TO INSPECT THE 
VOTING DRUMS.  EACH DRUM WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN TO 
SHOW THAT IT WAS EMPTY.  THE ASSISTANT PRESIDING 
OFFICER THEN PLACED SAND IN THE VOTING DRUM, FOR 
STABILITY.  WHILE OTHER POLLING STATION STAFF AND 
OTHER AUTHORIZED PERSONS WATCHED, THE PRESIDING 
OFFICER SEALED EACH VOTING CAN WITH NUMBERED RED 
PLASTIC SEALS AND LINKED ALL OF THE CANS TOGETHER 
WITH A METAL WIRE.  THE CANS WERE LINKED TOGETHER IN 
ALPHABETICAL ORDER BY NAME OF THE CANDIDATE (BAH OF 
THE NRP, DARBOE OF THE UDP COALITION, DIBBA OF THE 
NCP, JAMMEH OF THE APRC AND JATTA OF THE PDOIS). 
VOTING OFFICIALS RECORDED THE NUMBERS ON THE SEALS 
BEFORE THE VOTING CANS WERE TAKEN INSIDE THE VOTING 
ROOM. 
 
AS PER IEC REGULATIONS, THE VOTING CANS WERE COLOR- 
CODED ACCORDING TO POLITICAL PARTY (UDP YELLOW, APRC 
GREEN, NRP BLUE, PDOIS BROWN AND NCP WHITE). 
PICTURES OF THE POLITICAL CANDIDATES WERE AFFIXED TO 
THE VOTING CANS ALONG WITH THEIR NAMES AND 
CORRESPONDING POLITICAL PARTY SYMBOLS. 
 
THE ACTUAL VOTING AREA WAS A ROOM OR AN ENCLOSED 
AREA OUTSIDE THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR VOTING 
PURPOSES.  THE VOTING CANS WERE PLACED ON A TABLE IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  IN ORDER TO 
MAINTAIN PRIVACY DURING VOTING THERE WERE SHEETS 
PLACED ON THE WINDOWS AND THE ENTRANCE OF ROOMS, OR 
POLLING STATION STAFF GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
ENCLOSED AREA. 
 
ONCE A VOTER ARRIVED, S/HE PRESENTED HIS/HER VOTER 
REGISTRATION CARD TO THE APO.  THE APO CALLED OUT 
THE VOTER\'S NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER.  THE 
POLLING AGENTS CONFIRMED THAT THE PERSON WAS ON THE 
POLLING STATION REGISTRATION LIST PROVIDED BY THE 
IEC.  THE VOTER\'S INDEX FINGER WAS DIPPED INTO 
PURPLE INK.  THE APO GAVE THE PO THE VOTER\'S VOTER 
REGISTRATION CARD.  THE PO VERIFIED THAT THE PICTURE 
ON THE CARD CORRESPONDED TO THE PERSON PRESENT. 
AFTER RE-CONFIRMING THE VOTER\'S IDENTITY, THE PO 
GAVE THE VOTER A YELLOW MARBLE AND ALLOWED HIM/HER 
TO ENTER THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  THE APO, PO 
AND POLLING AGENTS WERE GENERALLY SEATED NEXT TO THE 
ENTRANCE OF THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  VOTERS 
PLACED THEIR MARBLE IN A TUBE ON THE CAN 
CORRESPONDING TO THEIR CANDIDATE.  AS THE MARBLE 
WENT DOWN THE TUBE INTO THE CAN, IT RANG A BELL, 
SIGNIFYING THAT A VOTE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CAST. 
THE PO LISTENED FOR THE BELL TO RING WHILE THE OTHER 
VOTING OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO PROCESS PEOPLE IN THE 
LINE.  AFTER THE BELL RANG IN THE VOTING 
ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA, THE VOTER EXITED, AND THE PO 
RETURNED HIS/HER VOTER REGISTRATION CARD.  THE PO 
THEN INSTRUCTED THE VOTER TO LEAVE THE ROOM/AREA. 
 
4. IROG NOTED THAT IEC OFFICIALS AND PARTY AGENTS IN 
THE FONI REGION SEEMED TO BE DOING THEIR BEST TO 
KEEP VOTING ORDERLY DESPITE THEIR EGREGIOUS LACK OF 
PREPARATION, ORGANIZATION, TRAINING, COMMUNICATION, 
AND MATERIALS.  WIDESPREAD INCONSISTENCIES 
UNDERMINED THE SECURITY AND UNIFORMITY OF THE 
PROCESS.  THE AREA RETURNING OFFICERS (ARO), WHO 
WERE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE MATERIALS AND DEFINITIVE 
ANSWERS, SEEMED TO BE SPREAD TOO THIN OVER LARGE 
AREAS, AS THEY WERE NEVER AROUND WHEN THE POS NEEDED 
THEIR SERVICES. 
 
AMONG 15 POLLING STATIONS, IROG NOTED AT LEAST THREE 
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONTROVERSIAL RULE 
ON THE PROCEDURE FOR VOTERS WHO HAD CARDS BUT WERE 
NOT ON THE REGISTRATION LIST.  AT LEAST 5 POLLING 
STATIONS WERE NOT ABLE COMPLETELY SEAL THE BALLOT 
DRUMS.  AT THE SIBANOR COUNTING CENTER AT BWIAM, ONE 
CONSTITUENCY FOLLOWED IEC RULES TO THE LETTER, WHILE 
THE AROS FOR THE OTHER CONSTITUENCY DID NOT SEEM TO 
KNOW ANY OF THE RULES FOR COUNTING. 
 
VOTERS WERE PATIENT AND CALM IN LINE AND IN  POLLING 
STATIONS DESPITE EXTREME HEAT, WAITING PERIODS OF UP 
TO FOUR HOURS, AND CONFUSION ABOUT RULES AND 
PROCEDURES.  DESPITE THE OBVIOUS HOLES IN THE VOTING 
PROCESS, IROG SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT THOSE HOLES WERE 
MALICIOUSLY EXPLOITED TO MANIPULATE THE RESULTS. 
 
THE ATMOSPHERE IN FONI WAS SO STUBBORNLY PRO-JAMMEH 
THAT IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL THAT AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER 
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE VOICING HIS OPINION. 
MOREOVER, KNOWING HOW MANY OF HIS FELLOW VILLAGERS 
WOULD VOTE FOR JAMMEH, ANYONE VOTING FOR ANOTHER 
CANDIDATE WOULD KNOW HIS SINGLE VOTE IN THE BALLOT 
DRUM WOULD STAND OUT. 
 
5.  CDA AND OUR POLITICAL ASSISTANT COVERED THE WEST 
COAST (THE NICKNAME FOR THE GAMBIA\'S WESTERN 
DIVISION, AS WELL AS THE NAME OF THE GAMBIA\'S MOST 
POPULAR RADIO STATION, BROADCAST ON 95.3 FM), WHICH 
INCLUDED POLLING STATIONS IN KANIFING, KOTU, KOLOLI, 
LAMIN, BAKAU, CAPE POINT, BRUFUT, FAJARA, GUNJUR AND 
KARTUNG ON OCTOBER 18.  WE CHOSE THIS AREA BECAUSE 
THERE WERE FEARS THAT FOREIGNERS OF PRESIDENT 
JAMMEH\'S DJOLA ETHNIC GROUP WOULD ATTEMPT TO USE 
FALSE VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE FOR HIM IN 
THESE POROUS BORDER AREAS. 
 
GAMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY AND POLICE OFFICIALS HAD 
ANNOUNCED THAT SOLDIERS WOULD BE CONFINED TO THEIR 
BARRACKS ON OCTOBER 18 (SINCE SECURITY WOULD BE 
PROVIDED BY THE POLICE), SO WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE 
UNIFORMED SOLDIERS AT THE FAJARA, BAKAU AND CAPE 
POINT POLLING STATIONS.  INQUIRIES TO THE RESPECTIVE 
COMMANDERS ELICITED THE INFORMATION THAT ANY SOLDIER 
PRESENT AT A POLLING STATION WAS REGISTERED THERE 
AND SOLELY AT THAT STATIONS TO VOTE.  WE VERIFIED 
THAT ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT WE SAW AT THE THREE 
POLLING STATIONS WERE ALL REGISTERED VOTERS THAT ALL 
VOTED AND LEFT PROMPTLY AFTER DOING SO. 
 
THE IEC DID NOT REVERSE THEIR DECISION TO RESTRICT 
VOTING TO VOTERS LISTED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE POLLING 
STATION WHO HAD CORRESPONDING VOTER REGISTRATION 
CARDS, ALTHOUGH THEY DID ALLOW IEC WORKERS WITH 
VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE WHEREVER THEY WERE 
ASSIGNED.  AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE 
OR RECEIVE ANY REPORTS OF FOREIGNERS USING FALSE 
REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE.  CDA NOTED SEVERAL WOMEN 
IN LINE NURSING THEIR CHILDREN WHILE WAITING, AS 
WELL AS SEVERAL VOTERS WHO STOOD ON LINE WITH THEIR 
LIVESTOCK... 
 
6.  AS THE GAMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED THAT 
THEIR LAND BORDERS WOULD BE CLOSED FROM OCTOBER 17- 
19, WE ASKED OUR DATT TO COVER ILLIASA DIVISION.  AN 
OPPOSITION STRONGHOLD AS WELL AS CONTAINING THE MAIN 
UPCOUNTRY ROAD/FERRY CROSSING AT FARAFENNI, ILLIASA 
ALSO HOSTS THE MAJOR UPCOUNTRY MILITARY BARRACKS AND 
CUSTOMS POST.  IN LINE WITH OUR OTHER OBSERVERS, THE 
DATT NOTED THAT THE VOTING PROCESS WENT MORE OR LESS 
SMOOTHLY, WITH HIGH VOTER TURNOUT AND VOTERS 
PATIENTLY WAITING IN LONG LINES WHICH WERE IN 
EVIDENCE BY 0615 IN THE MORNING.  THE BORDER 
REMAINED HERMETICALLY SEALED THROUGHOUT THE 
ANNOUNCED PERIOD, FREEING THE NUMEROUS CUSTOMS 
OFFICIALS IN THE REGION TO PERFORM THEIR CIVIC DUTY 
WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING CALLED IN TO WORK.  THE DATT 
DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OR RECEIVE ANY REPORTS OF 
FOREIGNERS USING FALSE REGISTRATION CARDS TO VOTE IN 
THIS HEAVILY-TRANSITED AREA. 
 
7.  WE SENT OUR GSO TO THE OTHER OPPOSITION 
STRONGHOLD OF KWINELLA, THE NEXUS OF KIANG CENTRAL 
DIVISION.  THERE WERE VASTLY MORE WOMEN VOTING IN 
THIS DIVISION THAN MEN.  THIS DISCREPANCY WAS 
EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MOST MEN IN THE DIVISION 
WORKED IN THE GREATER BANJUL AREA, AND HAD CHANGED 
THEIR REGISTRATION ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION TO 
STRICTLY ADHERING TO VOTING PROCEDURES, OUR GSO 
NOTED THAT EACH POLLING STATION HAD DESIGNATED ONE 
OF THEIR POLICE OFFICERS TO ASSIST VOTERS WHO WERE 
ELDERLY/DISABLED OR OTHERWISE NEEDED ASSISTANCE 
TO/FROM (BUT NOT INTO) THE VOTING ROOM/AREA.  HE SAW 
NO OTHER OBSERVERS OR MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES IN THE 
POLLING STATIONS HE VISITED.  GSO ALSO NOTED THAT 
ALL VOTERS IN THIS AREA WERE DRESSED IN THEIR 
FINEST, COMMENSURATE WITH THE IMPORTANCE THEY 
ATTACHED TO THE OCCASION... 
 
8. THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS AT BIJILO 
EXCEEDED 1,000.  TO ACCOMMODATE THIS LARGE NUMBER OF 
VOTERS, THE IEC DECIDED TO CREATE TWO POLLING 
STATIONS AT BIJILO PRIMARY SCHOOL.  THE POLLING 
STATIONS WERE LOCATED IN THE SAME SCHOOL BLOCK BUT 
SEPARATED BY A FEW CLASSROOMS.  OUR PROGRAM 
COORDINATOR (PC) OBSERVED THAT VOTERS APPEARED 
CONFUSED BY THIS ARRANGEMENT.  THE FIRST VOTES AT 
EACH POLLING STATION WERE CAST AFTER 0700, BUT 
BEFORE 0800.  SHE NOTED THAT VOTING WENT ON AT A 
BRISK PACE UNTIL SHE LEFT AT 1015 TO TRAVEL TO 
ALBREDA BY BOAT.  SHE RETURNED TO BIJILO AT 1530 TO 
OBSERVE THAT BOTH POLLING STATIONS CLOSED ON TIME. 
 
ARRIVING AT THE ALBREDA DOCK AT 1200, OUR PC WAS 
STRUCK BY THE SEA OF GREEN WHICH GREETED HER.  THERE 
WERE LARGE GREEN FLAGS FLYING IN FRONT OF HOUSES AND 
SHOPS ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL TO THE POLLING 
STATION.  THE PERSON WHO GUIDED HER FROM THE DOCK TO 
THE POLLING STATION VOLUNTEERED THAT ALBREDA AND 
JUFFUREH WERE APRC STRONGHOLDS. 
 
THE POLLING STATION (NORMALLY USED AS A COMMUNITY 
HEALTH CENTER) WAS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A VOTING 
LOCATION.  ONCE INSIDE THE COMPOUND, THE POLICE 
ASSIGNED TO THIS POLLING STATION DIRECTED OUR PC  TO 
THE VOTING AREA.  ALBREDA IS ONE OF THE FEW POLLING 
STATIONS WHERE A TEAM MEMBER MET REPRESENTATIVES OF 
ALL FIVE POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE POLLING STAFF 
APPEARED WELL ORGANIZED AND CARRIED OUT THEIR DUTIES 
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. IN RESPONSE TO HER 
INQUIRY, POLLING STAFF STATED THAT VOTING HAD TAKEN 
PLACE WITHOUT INCIDENT. VOTING BEGAN PROMPTLY AT 
0700, AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LONG LINES, EVERYONE 
COOPERATED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS.  STAFF HAD 
NOT COME ACROSS ANY VOTERS WHO WERE NOT PROPERLY 
REGISTERED TO VOTE. OUR PC WAS HEARTENED BY WHAT SHE 
SAW AT THIS POLLING STATION. 
 
BEFORE DEPARTING FROM THE ALBREDA DOCK, OUR PC 
WALKED TO JUFFUREH (ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY) TO ELICIT 
BINTA KINTEH\'S THOUGHTS ON THE POLL.  MS. KINTEH 
CLAIMS TO BE THE OLDEST LIVING PERSON IN THE 
ALBREDA/JUFFUREH AREA, AS WELL AS A RELATIVE OF 
KUNTA KINTEH (OF `ROOTS\' FAME) AND FORMER U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO THE GAMBIA GEORGE HALEY.   MS. KINTEH 
STATED THAT SHE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE 
TO VOTE AND NOTED THAT SHE AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS HAD 
VOTED EARLIER IN THE DAY (THEY DIDN\'T SAY WHO THEY 
HAD VOTED FOR).  THEY PROUDLY DISPLAYED THEIR PURPLE 
FINGERS TO OUR PC TO PROVE IT.  MS. KINTEH 
ADDITIONALLY STATED THAT SHE FELT THAT VOTING IN HER 
AREA HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A FAIR AND PEACEFUL MANNER. 
OUR PC AND MS. KINTEH ENDED THEIR CONVERSATION BY 
WISHING EACH OTHER WELL. 
 
9. THE SURPRISING EASE OF THE POLL DID NOT EXTEND TO 
THE COUNT.  POLLING STATIONS OBSERVED STOPPED 
ACCEPTING NEW VOTERS MORE OR LESS AT OR AROUND 1600. 
HOWEVER, THEY THEN ALLOWED ANY VOTER PRESENT TO 
COMPLETE THE VOTING PROCESS, WHICH, IN SOME CASES, 
TOOK UP TO THREE MORE HOURS.  THE PO, APO AND 
POLITICAL PARTY AGENTS THEN CARRIED THE VOTING CANS 
OUTSIDE THE VOTING ROOM/ENCLOSED AREA.  IN THE 
PRESENCE OF THE POLICE, POLLING STAFF AND ANY OTHER 
AUTHORIZED PERSONS PRESENT, THE PO SEALED THE VOTING 
CANS WITH A WHITE CARD AND A NUMBERED RED PLASTIC 
SEALS (FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE ON EACH CAN).  AT THIS 
POINT, THE PO BEGAN TO TALLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAD CAST BALLOTS.  THE PO CHECKED THE NUMBER OF 
MARBLES REMAINING AGAINST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
MARBLES ISSUED FOR THE POLLING STATION BY THE IEC. 
THE PO ALSO CHECKED THE NUMBER OF MARBLES USED 
AGAINST THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE APO MARKED ON THE 
REGISTRATION LIST AS HAVING VOTED.  THE POLITICAL 
PARTY AGENTS ALSO CHECKED THEIR LISTS TO CONFIRM 
THAT THE NUMBERS WERE THE SAME.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
REGISTERED VOTERS VERSUS THE NO-SHOW VOTERS WAS ALSO 
TALLIED.  ONCE THIS PROCESS WAS CONCLUDED, POLLING 
STAFF RECORDED ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION ON IEC 
FORMS.  THEN POLLING STAFF AND POLITICAL PARTY 
AGENTS WAITED FOR THE IEC-ASSIGNED ARO TO COME TO 
THE POLLING STATION WITH THE AUTHORIZED TRANSPORT TO 
THE COUNTING CENTER. 
 
ONCE THE ARO ARRIVED WITH APPROVED TRANSPORT (THE 
EARLIEST THIS TOOK PLACE WAS AT 1745 AT CDA\'S 
POLLING STATION, WHERE VOTING ENDED ON SCHEDULE AT 
1600), THE VOTING CANS WERE PLACED IN IT.  THE CANS 
WERE THEN TRANSPORTED TO THE RELEVANT COUNTING 
CENTER IN THE SAME VEHICLE ACCOMPANIED BY ALL 
POLLING STAFF, POLITICAL PARTY AGENTS THAT WERE 
PRESENT (NORMALLY JUST FROM THE UDP AND APRC) AND 
THE POLICE ASSIGNED TO THE POLLING STATION.  THIS 
PROCESS WAS PATHOLOGICALLY DISORGANIZED THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY, AND WAS THE MAJOR BASIS FOR THE MORE 
THAN 24-HOUR DELAY IN ANNOUNCING THE FINAL ELECTION 
RESULTS. 
 
CDA FOLLOWED THE VOTING CANS FROM HER CHOSEN POLLING 
STATION TO THEIR ASSIGNED COUNTING CENTER AT 
INDEPENDENCE STADIUM IN BAKAU (BANJUL).  HER POLLING 
STATION WAS THE FIRST TO TURN OVER ITS CANS AT 1755. 
THE PO (IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER POLLING STAFF 
AND ACCOMPANYING POLITICAL PARTY REPRESENTATIVES) 
HANDED OVER THE VOTING CANS TO THE CONSTITUENCY IEC 
RETURNING OFFICER. 
 
ANOTHER MAJOR RESULTS-DELAYING FACTOR WAS THE FACT 
THAT THE RETURNING OFFICERS REFUSED TO COUNT THE 
RESULTS FROM POLLING STATIONS UNTIL ALL THE CANS 
FROM EACH CONSTITUENCY WERE PRESENT, RATHER THAT 
COUNT THEM AS THEY CAME IN.   COUNTING FOR JESHWANG 
DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL 2130, AFTER THE CANS FROM ALL 
THE 24 POLLING STATIONS IN THE CONSTITUENCY ARRIVED. 
COUNTING STARTED WITH THE CANS FROM CDA\'S CHOSEN 
POLLING STATION, SINCE THOSE CANS HAD BEEN TURNED 
OVER FIRST.  THE COUNTING PROCESS WAS SYSTEMATIC, 
ORDERLY, TRANSPARENT AND ACCURATE, INCLUDED A 
CHALLENGE FROM THE APRC PARTY REPRESENTATIVE 
(LOOKING FOR 6 NON-EXISTENT ADDITIONAL VOTES) AND 
ENDED AT 2200. 
 
ONCE ALL OF THE POLLING STATIONS HAD BEEN COUNTED 
(AT 1030 ON OCTOBER 19 FOR JESHWANG, SIMILARLY FOR 
THE OTHERS OBSERVED BY THE TEAM), THE RESULTS WERE 
ENTERED ON AN IEC FORM AND THEN TAKEN TO THE 
COLLATION CENTER, WHICH WAS IN CDA\'S CASE 
CONVENIENTLY LOCATED IN ANOTHER ROOM AT THE STADIUM. 
FROM THERE, THE RESULTS WERE FAXED TO IEC 
HEADQUARTERS AT 1100 ON OCTOBER 19.  IEC DIRECTOR 
GABRIEL ROBERTS THEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THE 
RESULTS AT 1400 ON OCTOBER 19. 
 
10.  INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS WERE UNIFORM 
IN EXPRESSING THEIR GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE 
CONDUCT OF VOTING ON OCTOBER 19.  THERE WERE OVER 
100 INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS PARTICIPATING IN THE 
POLL, INCLUDING OUR SIX.  DR. JACKIE DUGARD OF THE 
COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT (WHO FIELDED ABOUT 25 
OBSERVERS) STATED THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED AAT HOW 
WELL EVERYTHING HAD GONE.  SRSG JAMES GBEHO, 
CURRENTLY AN INDEPENDENT MP IN GHANA, CONGRATULATED 
THE GAMBIAN PEOPLE ON A JOB WELL DONE.  EU RESREP 
GEORGE-MARC ANDRE STATED THAT HIS OVERALL IMPRESSION 
OF THE POLL WAS POSITIVE.  UN RESREP JOHN KAKONGE 
STATED THAT THE FLAWS HE OBSERVED DID NOT PERTAIN TO 
THE ACTUAL POLLING OR COUNTING PROCESS.  PURPORTED 
WORLD CONFERENCE OF MAYORS REPRESENTATIVE USC JOHNNY 
FORD AND HIS TEAM REPORTEDLY `HIGH-FIVED\' ALL THE 
GAMBIANS PRESENT IN THE BAR WHERE THEY HEARD THE 
OFFICIAL RESULTS ANNOUNCED, THEN STATED THAT THEY 
LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A GAMBIA FREE OF 
OPPRESSIVE COLONIALST INFLUENCE... 
 
11.  IN A STUNNING SHOW OF ELECTORAL GRACE RARELY 
SEEN IN AFRICA OR ELSEWHERE, MAJOR CHALLENGER AND 
UDP OPPOSITION COALITION LEADER OUSAINOU DARBOE (WHO 
POLLED 32.67 PERCENT OF THE VOTE) CALLED PRESIDENT 
JAMMEH DURING THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 19 TO CONCEDE 
DEFEAT.  DARBOE THEN CONVENED A PRESS CONFERENCE AT 
HIS HOME TO ANNOUNCE HIS CONCESSION.  HE STATED THAT 
HIS CONCESSION IN NO WAY SUGGESTED THAT THE ELECTION 
WAS FLAWLESS, RATHER IT SUGGESTED THAT AS A DEMOCRAT 
COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, HE RECOGNIZED 
THAT HE HAD LOST THE ELECTION AND WAS READY TO FOCUS 
HIS EFFORTS ON THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS SCHEDULED 
FOR SPRING 2002, IN WHICH HE EXPECTS THAT THE 
COALITION WILL WIN A MAJORITY.  THIS SENTIMENT WAS 
ECHOED TO CDA BY HIS CHIEF LIEUTENANT, M. DIALLO, AT 
A RECEPTION FOR INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS 
HOSTED BY THE UK HIGH COMMISSIONER THE EVENING OF 
OCTOBER 19. 
 
12.  WE SHALL PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS SEPTEL.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PREL, PINR, GA 
SUBJECT:  GAMBIAN ELECTION FALLOUT: ADMIRATION TURNS TO 
ACCUSATION 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  A WAVE OF CRITICISM HAS REPLACED THE 
POSITIVE COMMENTARY HEARD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCTOBER 
18 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE UPC COALITION AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ALLEGE WIDESPREAD HARASSMENT AND 
UNREASONABLE ARRESTS SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
OFFICIAL ELECTION RESULTS AND CALL ELECTION AUTHORITIES 
INEFFICIENT AND CORRUPT.  OTHER OPPOSITION PARTY 
MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN TARGETED AS OF YET.  END SUMMARY. 
 
UPC COALITION ACCUSES APRC OF HARASSMENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) WIDESPREAD AND FAIRLY CREDIBLE REPORTS INDICATE 
THAT UPC SUPPORTERS AND THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED 
SINCE THE FINAL ELECTION RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED FRIDAY. 
UNIFORMED POLICE AND ARMY HAVE ALLEGEDLY ARRESTED OVER 
SIXTY KNOWN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND TAKEN THEM TO 
POLICE STATIONS OR THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
(NIA) HEADQUARTERS.  IN ADDITION, CIVILIAN MEMBERS OF 
THE APRC, ALSO RUMORED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE RATHER MORE 
SINISTER JULY 22 MOVEMENT, HAVE REPORTEDLY ASSAULTED 
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. 
 
3. (U) SPECIFICALLY, UPC OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THAT APRC 
MILITANTS ATTACKED THE HOMES OF THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE: 
UDP ORGANIZING SECRETARY LAMIN WAA JUWARA, UDP 
COALITION CAMPAIGN COORDINATOR FOR WESTERN DIVISION 
ALHAJI DEMBO JATTA, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMBO 
BOJANG, AND OMAR JALLOW (OJ). 
 
4. (U) WELL-KNOWN DETAINEES INCLUDE DR. MOMODOU LAMIN 
MANNEH, AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER WHO RETURNED TO THE 
GAMBIA TO CAMPAIGN AFTER BEING GRANTED ASYLUM IN THE 
U.S., CITIZEN FM RADIO DIRECTOR GEORGE CHRISTENSEN AND 
MUHAMMED LAMIN SILLAH, COORDINATOR OF THE COALITION OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF AMNESTY 
INTERNATIONAL\'S GAMBIA CHAPTER.  THE THIRTEEN-YEAR OLD 
BROTHER OF ONE OF POST\'S SECURITY LES STAFF WAS ALSO 
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT THE NIA DURING THE POLITICAL 
CLASHES IN TALLINDING ON OCTOBER 16.  AS OF OCTOBER 24, 
HE HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED AND HIS FAMILY HAD NOT BEEN 
ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.  POST WILL TRANSMIT AN 
ADDITIONAL LIST OF DETAINEE NAMES SEPTEL. 
 
5. (U) ACCORDING TO UDP COALITION PARTY LEADERS, THEY 
HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE 
INTERIOR, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, AND APRC 
PARTY LEADERS, TO NO AVAIL.  THEY WOULD LIKE THE 
GOVERNMENT OR THE APRC TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT ON 
RADIO OR TELEVISION CONDEMNING HARASSMENT OF OPPOSITION 
SUPPORTERS AND DIRECTING ALL APRC `MILITANTS\' TO 
EXERCISE RESTRAINT UNDER THREAT OF PUNISHMENT.  THE 
COALITION PARTY LEADERS STATE THEY HAVE RECEIVED NO 
RESPONSE TO THEIR REQUEST. 
 
6. (U) COALITION LEADERS REPORT THAT THEIR MEMBERS ARE 
GETTING RESTLESS AND FRUSTRATED, AND WITHOUT ACTION 
FROM THE APRC OR GOVERNMENT, COALITION LEADERS CANNOT 
GUARANTEE THEIR SUPPORTERS\' CONTINUED CALM.  MORE 
OMINOUSLY, ONE COALITION REPRESENTATIVE SAID, \"IF THE 
GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES CANNOT PROTECT US, WE WILL 
DEFEND OURSELVES.\" 
 
UDP COALITION CRITICIZES IEC ELECTION MANAGEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (U) THE UDP COALITION HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE 
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24, TO PUBLICIZE ITS ACCUSATIONS OF 
APRC HARASSMENT, AND USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICIZE 
SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTION PROCESS, FROM 
REGISTRATION ONWARD.  ONE REPORTER ASKED THE REASONABLE 
QUESTION, \"IF YOU OBJECTED TO HOW THE ELECTION WAS RUN, 
WHY DID YOU RUSH TO CONGRATULATE THE PRESIDENT AND 
ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BEFORE ALL OF THE 
COUNTS WERE EVEN REPORTED?\"  THE RESPONSE WAS A) \"THE 
GAMBIA IS LARGER THAN OUSAINOU DARBOE OR THE UDP,\" AND 
DARBOE NEEDED TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP AND ACCEPT THE 
RESULTS TO ENSURE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY AFTER THE 
ELECTIONS; AND B) THE COALITION BECAME AWARE OF MANY OF 
THE ALLEGED ELECTION IRREGULARITIES ONLY IN THE DAYS 
AFTER THE ELECTIONS. 
 
8. (U) COMMENT: THE POINT THAT DARBOE HAD TO ACCEPT THE 
ELECTION RESULTS TO MAINTAIN PEACE IN THE GAMBIA IS 
WELL-TAKEN; COALITION SUPPORTERS WERE ON-RECORD 
DECLARING THAT THEY WOULD `FIGHT IN THE STREETS\' IF 
THEIR CANDIDATE DID NOT WIN.  HOWEVER, IF THE COALITION 
IS AS RESTLESS AND FRUSTRATED AS THEIR LEADERS 
INDICATE, PUBLICLY LAMBASTING THE GOVERNMENT, THE APRC 
AND ELECTION AUTHORITIES IS AS DANGEROUS AND 
INFLAMMATORY NOW AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON ELECTION DAY. 
END COMMENT. 
 
9. (U) THE COALITION\'S STATEMENT AND PRESS RELEASE RE- 
VISITED THE CONTROVERSIAL PROBLEM OF VOTERS WHO HAD 
VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS BUT WERE NOT LISTED ON THE 
COMPUTER PRINTOUT OF THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIST. 
DARBOE LEVELED THE ACCUSATION THAT THE FINAL DECISION 
TO ALLOW SUCH VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION WAS 
MADE BY INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (IEC) CHAIR 
GABRIEL ROBERTS AT THE BEHEST OF THE APRC AND WITHOUT 
THE CONSENT OF THE REST OF THE IEC.  HE ALSO POINTED 
OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THE VOTING PUBLIC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO OBJECT TO ANY NAME ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIST 
THAT WAS PUBLISHED BEFORE THE ELECTIONS, THEY DID NOT 
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE 
NAMES WERE ADDED WHEN THEY WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE ON 
ELECTION DAY. DARBOE CHARGED THAT THE POLICY THUS 
DENIED THE VOTING PUBLIC ONE OF THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED 
UNDER THE ELECTION CODE OF CONDUCT. 
 
10. (U) IEC OFFICIAL SAID YUSUPH ADMITTED AT THE 
OPPOSITION PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE ENTIRE VOTER 
REGISTRATION PROCESS WAS CARRIED OUT HURRIEDLY IN A 
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, LEAVING SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY 
FOR ERROR. MR. YUSUPH EXPLAINED THAT `YOUNG LADIES, 
FRESH FROM SCHOOL, WHO MAYBE DID NOT APPRECIATE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING\', ENTERED THE VOTER 
REGISTRATION DATA INTO THE COMPUTER.  ACCORDING TO MR. 
YUSUPH, ALTHOUGH THE IEC FOUND ERRORS IN THE DATABASE, 
THEY DECIDED IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO DISENFRANCHISE 
VOTERS WHO HAD LEGITIMATELY COMPLETED THE REGISTRATION 
PROCESS ON THE BASIS OF DATA ENTRY ERRORS. 
 
11. (U) DARBOE FURTHER ALLEGED THAT THE ELECTORAL 
PROCESS WAS CORRUPTED FROM THE BEGINNING BY THE VOTER 
REGISTRATION PROCESS.  HE STATED THAT MANY NON-GAMBIANS 
HAD OBTAINED NATIONAL ID CARDS AND USED THEM TO 
REGISTER TO VOTE, AND THAT REGISTRATION HAD OCCURRED IN 
SECRET OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICIAL REGISTRATION PERIOD AT 
UNOFFICIAL PREMISES.  HE THEN PRODUCED THE SENEGALESE 
NATIONAL ID CARD AND GAMBIAN VOTER REGISTRATION CARD OF 
A MAN NAMED EBOU COLI, AND SAID IT WAS BUT ONE EXAMPLE 
OF MANY.  HE CLAIMED THE IEC HAD NOT ACTED TO CORRECT 
THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITION ALERTED THE IEC 
TO THE CASE OF EBOU COLI AND MANY OTHERS BEFORE THE 
ELECTION. 
 
12. (U) COMMENT: WHILE SOME IMPERFECTIONS, 
IRREGULARITIES, AND EVEN INTENTIONAL MANIPULATION OF 
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WERE INEVITABLE, THE NEWS OF 
ASSAULTS AND ARRESTS IS ALARMING.  THE APRC HAS WON THE 
ELECTIONS, AND PRESUMABLY HAS NO MORE NEED TO 
INTIMIDATE COALITION SUPPORTERS.  THE TARGETING OF THE 
UDP COALITION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS FOR THESE 
ASSAULTS AND ARRESTS UNDERLINES THE RETALIATORY NATURE 
OF THE APRC/GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  THIS UNABASHED AND (SO 
FAR) UNCHECKED ABUSE OF POWER HINTS AT THE SENSE OF 
IMPUNITY FELT BY LOYALISTS UNDER THE APRC UMBRELLA. 
END COMMENT.
