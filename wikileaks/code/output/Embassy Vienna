2.  SUMMARY:  WITH THE FANFARE OF FIREWORKS, THE ROAR OF 
THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS, THE UNCORKING OF HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE, SLOVAKS CELEBRATED 
NOT ONLY THE COMING OF THE NEW YEAR JANUARY 1 BUT ALSO 
THE MILENNIAL ACHIEVEMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT STATE.  THE 
SLOVAK PARLIAMENT, MEETING ON THAT DAY, FORMALLY ISSUED 
A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  OFFICIALS ATTENDED A 
HIGH MASS THAT DAY, AND HELD A RECEPTION FOR AMBASSADORS 
OR CHARGES FROM THE SEVENTYODD COUNTRIES THAT HAVE 
ALREADY RECOGNIZED SLOVAKIA.  THE SPIRIT OF THE DAY 
SEEMED TO BE \"WE CAN DO IT;\" A SUBTLE PSYCHOLOGICAL TURN 
SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO THE REALIZATION THAT SLOVAKS 
NOW ARE TRULY ON THEIR OWN.  THE MAKINGS OF A NEW STATE 
ARE STILL INCOMPLETE, AND THE UNCERTAINTIES OF OUTSIDERS 
WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO BE RELIEVED.  AS SLOVAKS RETURN 
TO THEIR EVERYDAY CARES, THEY WILL SOON FIND OUT WHAT IS 
IN STORE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN OF INDEPENDENCE. 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.  THE SQUARE OF THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING, 
BRATISLAVA\'S MAIN SQUARE, WHICH HAS WITNESSED MANY 
DRAMAS OF SLOVAK HISTORY SINCE IT WAS FILLED TO 
OVERFLOWING IN THE HEADY DAYS OF THE NOVEMBER 1989 
REVOLUTION WAS THE SCENE OF ONE MORE EPOCHAL EVENT AS 
CHURCH BELLS RANG IN THE NEW YEAR OVER THE SLOVAK 
CAPITAL.  DESPITE THE COLD, THOUSANDS OF MERRY-MAKERS 
FILLED THE SQUARE\'S LOWER PORTION, TO HEAR PRIME 
MINISTER VLADIMIR MECIAR ANNOUNCE THAT SLOVAKIA WAS NOW 
INDEPENDENT.  MANY, HOWEVER, WERE TOO INVOLVED IN THE 
MERRIMENT OF THE MOMENT TO HEAR HIS WORDS.  THE NEXT 
MORNING, HUNDREDS OF SLOVAKS LINED THE STREETS WAITING TO 
BUY THE FIRST POSTAGE STAMPS OF THE NEW REPUBLIC. 
 
4.  IN A NEW YEAR\'S SPEECH TO THE NATION, MECIAR CALLED 
THE DEMISE OF THE CSFR PART OF THE GEOPOLITICAL CHANGES 
OCCURRING IN THE WORLD, AND ALSO OF THE DIFFERENT 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CZECH AND SLOVAK 
REPUBLICS AFTER 1989, AND OF THE \"MISTAKES\" MADE DURING 
THAT TIME.  HE SAID THERE IS INDEED SOMETHING TO 
CELEBRATE: NOT ONLY THE CULMINATION OF A MILLENIAL LONGING 
FOR ONE\'S OWN STATE, BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECTLY 
PARTICIPATING IN EUROPEAN AND WORLD-WIDE INTEGRATION. 
SLOVAK SECURITY WOULD BE GUARANTEED IN AN \"ALL EUROPEAN 
SECURITY SYSTEM.\" (NOTE: ON JANUARY 4, IN A SPEECH TO THE 
BUDDING SLOVAK MILITARY, MECIAR SAID THAT AN ARMY IS NEED 
BECAUSE, \"WHILE WE HAVE NO ENEMIES, WE HAVE NO ALLIES 
EITHER\").  MECIAR DENIED THAT SLOVAKIA WOULD BE ISOLATED 
INTERNATIONALLY, AND POINTED TO RAPID RECOGNITION BY OTHER 
STATES. 
 
5.  IN DESCRIBING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., MECIAR CALLED 
THEM \"IMPORTANT.\"  HE SAID THAT, WHILE SOMEONE TRIED TO 
\"EMBITTER\" THOSE RELATIONS TOWARD THE END OF LAST YEAR, HE 
BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED (MECIAR REFERRED 
TO THE EAVESDROPPING INCIDENT IMPLICITLY ONLY).  WHILE NOT 
EXPLICITLY VOWING TO INSURE THAT SUCH INCIDENTS NOT REPEAT 
THEMSELVES, MECIAR DID STATE THAT SLOVAKIA WILL RESPECT 
THE INVIOLABILITY OF THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICES OF ALL STATES 
AND ALL OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTIONS.  AFTER MENTIONING THE U.S., MECIAR PLACED 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE UKRAINE AND THEN WITH THE 
CZECH REPUBLIC, RELATIONS WHICH HE SAID WOULD BE THE \"MOST 
NUMEROUS.\"  RELATIONS WITH AUSTRIA ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
OF THE COUNTRY\'S CHARACTER AS A MARKET ECONOMY AND 
ADVANCED DEMOCRACY, AND WITH HUNGARY ON THE BASIS OF 
\"NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS\" AND \"INVOLABILITY 
OF BORDERS.\"  THE GABCIKOVO PROBLEM, MECIAR SAID, SHOULD 
BE SOLVED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. 
 
6.  MECIAR SAID THAT THE STRUCTURE OF SLOVAK 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, 
STARTING WITH CENTRAL STATE ORGANS AND CONTINUING WITH 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION; HE ASSURED THERE 
WOULD BE NO \"BLAVO(BRATISLAVA)CENTRALISM\" TO MAKE UP FOR 
THE DETESTED \"PRAGOCENTRALISM.\"  THE COUNTRY WOULD BE 
BUILT UP ACCORDING TO LEGAL NORMS PREVALENT IN THE EC. 
PRIVATIZATION WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE AIM OF ESTABLISHING 
AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS.  MECIAR CLOSED BY NOTING THAT 
\"IF WE BELIEVE OURSELVES, THE WORLD WILL BELIEVE US AS 
WELL.\" 
 
7.  AT A SESSION HELD ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY 1, THE 
SLOVAK PARLIAMENT APPROVED A DECLARATION ANNOUNCING 
SLOVAKIA AS ONE OF THE TWO SUCCESSOR STATES TO THE CSFR. 
THE DECLARATION ASSURED THAT SLOVAKIA WOULD ASSUME ITS 
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMITMENTS AND BE GOVERNED ACCORDING 
TO THE RULES OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY.  THE PARLIAMENT 
DECLARED SLOVAKIA\'S INTENTION OF JOINING THE UN AND 
COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND ITS READINESS TO EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH ALL STATES BASED ON \"FRIENDSHIP AND 
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE (NA MIEROVOM SPOLUNAZIVANI), ON THE 
BASIS OF EQUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, 
AND INVOLABILITY OF BORDERS.  IN REMARKS BEFORE PARLIAMENT 
THAT MORNING, MECIAR WARNED THAT THE COMING YEAR WOULD BE 
\"DIFFICULT,\" BUT NOT NECESSARILY MORE SO THAN PAST ONES. 
PARLIAMENT SPEAKER IVAN GASPAROVIC, FOR HIS PART, ASKED 
HIS COLLEAGUES FOR \"UNITY,\" NOT IN THE FORMAL SENSE THAT 
DISREGARDS THE NATURAL DIFFERENTIATION OF INTERESTS, BUT 
ONE THAT PLACES POLITICAL STABILITY, SPIRITUAL RENEWAL, 
AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AS AIMS FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF 
PARTY.  IN THE JANUARY 4 \"PRACA,\" GASPAROVIC URGED HIS 
FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN TO BE REALISTIC -- NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE 
THEIR OWN POTENTIAL, BUT TO REALISTICALLY JUDGE THE 
ECONOMIC, MORAL, AND PHYSICAL RESERVES OF THE COUNTRY AND 
ITS POPULATION. 
 
8.  FOREIGN MINISTER MILAN KNAZKO, IN A JANUARY 1 PRESS 
CONFERENCE, SOUGHT TO PLACE SLOVAK FOREIGN POLICY IN THE 
CONTOURS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND SECURITY.  HE SAID 
SLOVAKIA WANTS TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE VISEGRAD FOUR, AND 
THAT AS FAR AS ARMS SALES ARE CONCERNED, SLOVAKIA WOULD 
NOT EXPORT TO RISK AREAS AND WOULD SEEK TO COORDINATE ITS 
APPROACH WITH SUCH STATES AS THE U.S. AND FRANCE.  HE 
REJECTED THE NOTION OF A RENEWED \"LITTLE ENTENTE\" AGAINST 
POSSIBLE FUTURE HUNGARIAN EXPANSIONISM.  FINALLY, HE 
CAREFULLY FIELDED A JOURNALIST\'S QUESTION WHICH SOUGHT TO 
FORCE HIM TO DIFFERENTIATE HIS CONCEPTION OF FOREIGN 
POLICY FROM MECIAR\'S (MECIAR HAD PLACED THE U.S. FIRST IN 
DISCUSSING FOREIGN RELATIONS, WHEREAS KNAZKO HAD SAID THAT 
RELATIONS WITH SLOVAKIA\'S NEIGHBORS, ESPECIALLY THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC, WOULD BE ITS PRIORITIES). 
 
9.  MARIAN TKAC, WHO IS ORGANIZING THE SLOVAK NATIONAL 
BANK, PREDICTED IN A JANUARY 4 INTERVIEW IN \"NARODNA 
OBRODA\" THAT ONCE FLOATED, SLOVAKIA\'S CURRENCY SHOULD NOT 
LOSE MORE THAN 10 PCT OF ITS VALUE, WHICH HE CONSIDERS A 
\"FANTASTIC SUCCESS\" GIVEN THE MUCH LARGER FALL IN THE 
CZECHOSLOVAK KORUNA\'S VALUE SINCE 1990.  TKAC ALSO SAW ONE 
OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF INDEPENDENCE BEING THAT IT 
ALLOWS SLOVAKIA TO EXECUTE ITS OWN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL 
STRATEGY. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  WHILE TEARS SHED LAST WEEKEND WERE MOSTLY 
TEARS OF JOY, A FEW DIE-HARDS GATHERED NEW YEAR\'S EVE TO 
GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THEIR CZECH CONNECTION AT THE CZECH 
LION -- THE TRADITIONAL MONUMENT TO CZECH-SLOVAK 
STATEHOOD.  IN THE RECENT PAST, MANY SLOVAKS HAVE BEEN 
GLOOMY ABOUT THE EFFECT OF INDEPENDENCE ON THEIR ECONOMIC 
FUTURE.  THOSE THAT CELEBRATED, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO BE 
GENUINELY ELATED AT THE NOVELTY OF LIVING IN THEIR OWN 
STATE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE.  ONE CAN 
EXPECT THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL PLURALITY WILL 
CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THE RULING HZDS AS SLOVAKIA LOOKS AWAY 
FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE AND MORE TOWARD DEVELOPING 
BOTH POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AS A STATE. 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, KNAZKO AGAIN TOOK THE ROLE OF 
DISSIDENT WITHIN HIS OWN MOVEMENT; IN REPLY TO A POLL 
CONDUCTED BY \"NARODNA OBRODA,\" (JANUARY 4), HE REJECTED 
THE IDEA THAT THE HZDS A A MOVEMENT IS OVERSENITIVE TO 
MEDIA CRITICISM, AND SUGGESTED THE QUESTIONER CONSIDER 
WHICH SPECIFIC PERSONS ACT IN SUCH A WAY.  HE SAID HE 
REGARDS THE OPPOSITION AS AN INDELIBLE PART OF A 
PLURALISTIC SYSTEM AND AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION AS THE 
BEST COLLABORATOR OF A GOVERNING POLITICAL GROUPING. 
KNAZKO WAS ALSO TRUE TO THIS THOUGHT WHEN, IN A SIDE 
CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE AFTER RECEIVING THE FIRST 
DIPLOMATIC VISA ISSUED BY THE US EMBASSY, HE NOTED THAT IT 
WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT IN A NEW SUNDAY WEEKLY INTERVIEW 
PROGRAM, SLOVAK TV DECIDED TO HAVE THE WIVES OF PROMINENT 
GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS (MRS. MECIAR, PROKES, GASPAROVIC, 
WEISS, KOVAC), BUT NOT THE WIVES OF MEMBERS OF THE 
OPPOSITION.  HACKER UNQUOTE

SUBJECT:  THE KURDISH PKK IN AUSTRIA 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  FOR SEVERAL YEARS MEMBERS OF THE KURDISH 
COMMUNITY IN VIENNA HAVE REGULARLY HELD EVENTS TO 
HIGHLIGHT THEIR CAUSE TO THE MEDIA.  RADICAL GROUPS SUCH 
AS THE PKK, THE TURKISH COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE 
REVOLUTIONARY LEFT OPERATE CLUBS IN VIENNA.  INTERIOR 
MINISTRY SOURCES SAY AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR ACTIVISTS OF KURDISH LEFT-WING GROUPS CLOSELY, BUT 
NO BAN OF THE PKK IS PLANNED.  OF THE TURKISH COMMUNITY 
(119,000) IN AUSTRIA, THE MAJORITY ARE BELIEVED TO BE 
KURDS.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA SAID 
HE EXPECTED MORE BOMB ATTACKS AGAINST TOURIST CENTERS IN 
TURKEY \"ANY TIME SOON.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  OVER SEVERAL YEARS, KURDISH ACTIVISTS IN VIENNA 
ALTERNATELY SELECTED HIGH VISIBILITY LOCATIONS SUCH AS THE 
NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE AUSTRIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT 
PARTY (SPO), THE VIENNA OFFICES OF LUFTHANSA AND TURKISH 
AIRLINES, THE OFFICE OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL TV NETWORK ORF, AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS CENTER AT THE UN IN VIENNA TO STAGE 
PROTESTS.  IN MARCH 1988 KURDISH PROTESTERS TRIED TO STORM 
THE IRAQI EMBASSY IN VIENNA.  SIXTY-FOUR DEMONSTRATORS 
WERE BRIEFLY ARRESTED.  IN AUGUST AND OCTOBER OF 1991 
KURDISH ACTIVISTS OCCUPIED VIENNA\'S ST. STEPHEN\'S 
CATHEDRAL -- THE CITY\'S MAJOR LANDMARK -- TO PROTEST 
\"SUPPRESSION OF KURDS IN TURKEY AND IRAQ.\"  THE 
DEMONSTRATION ENDED PEACEFULLY. 
 
3.  AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE TOLD THE EMBASSY JUNE 29 
THAT SEVERAL REGISTERED TURKISH CLUBS EXISTED IN AUSTRIA 
-- MOST OF THEM IN VIENNA.  A MAJORITY ARE BELIEVED TO BE 
PKK SYMPATHIZERS.  OTHER KURDISH ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
DOMINATED BY ACTIVISTS SUBSCRIBING TO THE TURKISH 
COMMUNIST PARTY (TKP) OR THE DEVRIMCI SOL (REVOLUTIONARY 
LEFT).  THEY TOO, RUN CLUBS IN VIENNA, ALL OF WHICH ARE 
REGISTERED WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY SOURCE, AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES 
WATCH ACTIVITIES BY ALL THESE EXTREME LEFT GROUPS 
CLOSELY.  AUSTRIA\'S LAW ON ASSOCIATION -- WHICH REQUIRES A 
GROUP TO REPORT TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ANY EVENT, 
GATHERING OR ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY -- PROVIDES A GOOD 
LEGAL BASE FOR MONITORING THESE GROUPS.  SINCE THE PKK IS 
NOT REGISTERED AS A POLITICAL GROUP IN AUSTRIA, ANY DEBATE 
ABOUT BANNING THE PKK AS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE. 
 
5.  THE PKK HAS REGULARLY PARTICIPATED AT THE ANNUAL MAY 1 
PARADE IN DOWNTOWN VIENNA.  UNTIL A YEAR AGO, PKK 
SYMPATHIZERS WOULD CARRY PICTURES SHOWING STALIN.  THIS 
YEAR THESE PICTURES WERE REPLACED BY PHOTOS OF ABIMAEL 
GUZMAN, HEAD OF PERU\'S SHINING PATH GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION. 
 
6.  AN OFFICIAL AT THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA, BRUNO 
BILEK, IS QUOTED IN THE VIENNA DAILY \"KURIER\" SAYING THE 
SITUATION IN TURKEY AFTER THE RECENT BOMB ATTACK ON A 
TOURIST HOTEL WAS \"VERY GRAVE.\"  THE EMBASSY WAS AWARE OF 
TERRORIST THREATS AGAINST TOURISTS IN VACATION AREAS ON 
THE AEGEAN SEA AS WELL AS IN CAPPADOCIA.  HE IS QUOTED AS 
SAYING HE EXPECTS ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK \"ANY TIME 
SOON.\"  SINCE TURKEY IS A POPULAR VACATION DESTINATION FOR 
AUSTRIANS, AND SINCE JULY AND AUGUST ARE MAJOR VACATION 
PERIODS IN AUSTRIA, THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A TERRORIST 
THREAT TO TOURISTS IN TURKEY BY A GOA OFFICIAL IS 
SIGNIFICANT, EVEN IF THE GOA IS NOT ISSUING A TRAVEL 
ADVISORY.  THE GOA MAINTAINS A HIGH LEVEL OF VISIBLE 
SECURITY PRESENCE AT THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN VIENNA.

TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EINV, AU, EUN 
SUBJECT: LACK OF COMPETITION IN AUSTRIA\'S ELECTRICITY MARKET 
 
REF:  04 VIENNA 2972 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (U) According to a recent report from Austria\'s Federal 
Competition Authority, the anticipated benefits from the 
liberalization of the electricity market in 2001 have not 
materialized because incumbent providers have successfully 
cooperated to maintain a de-facto oligopoly.  The incumbents 
have therefore managed to block foreign competitors from 
entering the market and prices have remained high.  The 
Austrian Chamber of Commerce has called on the GoA to 
liberalize the market fully by eliminating the requirement 
that federal, state, or local governments maintain a 51% 
share in existing regional energy suppliers.  End Summary. 
 
 
\"Liberalization\"-Fending Off Foreign Competition 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2.  (U) A year-end report from the Federal Competition 
Authority (FCA) has reinforced previous assessments (ref A) 
that there is a lack of competition in Austria\'s electricity 
market.  The report also highlighted the difficulties 
potential foreign competitors face in entering the Austrian 
market, in which incumbent providers have created a de-facto 
oligopoly.  The FCA report concluded that electricity prices 
remain high, because incumbents prefer the status quo to 
price competition.  The report opined that the first steps 
towards market liberalization in Europe have not led to 
trans border competition, and especially not in Austria. 
The report criticized the numerous mergers and cross- 
holdings that followed liberalization of the electricity 
market in 2001, arguing that companies\' primary focus has 
been to fend off competition from foreign suppliers and 
start-ups. 
 
3.  (U) The report asserted that incumbents maintained high 
prices by demanding \"all-inclusive,\" non-flexible contracts 
for bulk electricity users, forcing them to pay a fixed 
price.  This mitigated any benefits that might accrue from 
subsequent reduced network tariffs, which represent 30% of 
the overall price.  Regarding the household sector, 
competition for household accounts remains virtually non- 
existent.  In some states, local suppliers have raised 
household prices by as much as 23% this year. 
 
 
Business Calls for Full Privatization 
------------------------------------- 
4.  (U) Christoph Leitl, President of the Austrian Chamber 
of Commerce, publicly called for the full privatization of 
regional energy suppliers.  (Note: A constitutional law 
requires that federal, state, or local governments own 51 
percent of shares in existing energy suppliers  End Note). 
In press interviews, Leitl said public ownership had failed 
because state governments had used energy suppliers to 
\"fatten their budgets.\"  He argued that only complete 
privatization would lead to real competition and lower 
energy prices. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
5.  (SBU) The initial \"liberalization\" of the electricity 
market has not created the anticipated effects -- more 
(foreign) competition and lower prices.  A contact in the 
energy regulator, E-Control, told us that experiences with 
electricity markets in other EU countries are very similar. 
Unstable energy markets worldwide account for a part of the 
steep price increases in the sector.  However, successful 
efforts by incumbent suppliers to fend off competition have 
also contributed to an oligopolistic situation and higher 
prices.

GIRL TO BE RETURNED TO POLISH FATHER DESPITE CLAIM OF 
\"GRAVE RISK\" 
 
REF: (A) VIENNA 4198   (B) VIENNA 4200 
 
1.  SUMMARY: AUSTRIAN COURTS HAVE AGAIN ORDERED THE 
RETURN OF A CHILD UNDER THE HAGUE CONVENTION, THIS TIME 
TO HER FATHER IN POLAND.  THIS MARKS THE THIRD TIME IN 
2004 THAT THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED THE RETURN 
OF A CHILD UNDER THE HAGUE CONVENTION, DESPITE INVOCATION 
OF ARTICLE 13B, WHICH CONCERNS THE POSSIBLE \"GRAVE RISK\" 
WHICH COULD OCCUR BECAUSE OF A RETURN.  THIS IS ALSO THE 
SECOND TIME IN AS MANY MONTHS THAT A LITTLE GIRL WAS 
ORDERED RETURNED TO HER FATHER.  THIS MAY BE THE LAST 
HAGUE RETURN CASE IN AUSTRIA TO BE HEARD BY A REGULAR 
COURT ?S OF JANUARY 1, 2005, ONLY 16 SPECIALLY 
DESIGNATED COURTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SPECIAL TRAINING 
WILL HANDLE HAGUE RETURN CASES. END SUMMARY 
 
2.  ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, LITTLE 
\"ANITA J.\" WAS ABDUCTED BY HER MOTHER IN JULY 2003, AND 
BROUGHT TO AUSTRIA, WHERE THE MOTHER\'S SISTER WAS 
WORKING.  THE PARENTS HAD BEEN LIVING APART WHILE THE 
MOTHER WORKED ABROAD. ANITA WAS BEING RAISED BY HER 
FATHER, AN AGRICULTURAL WORKER.  THE MOTHER RETURNED HOME 
FOR A SHORT VISIT AND WHILE THE FATHER WAS TEMPORARILY 
AWAY, TOOK THE CHILD TO AUSTRIA.  SHE THEN FILED FOR 
DIVORCE IN POLAND IN SEPTEMBER 2003, AND WAS ULTIMATELY 
GRANTED CUSTODY, BUT THE DIVORCE DECREE HAS NOT YET BEEN 
FINALIZED. 
 
3.  THE CASE MOVED EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY COMPARED TO 
OTHER HAGUE CASES IN AUSTRIA.   THE FATHER DID NOT FILE 
FOR RETURN UNDER THE HAGUE CONVENTION UNTIL SOME TIME 
AFTER THE MOTHER FILED FOR DIVORCE, BUT BEFORE THE 
CUSTODY DECISION BECAME FINAL IN JANUARY 2004.  THEN, ON 
JANUARY 28, 2004, THE AUSTRIAN LOWER COURT RULED AGAINST 
A RETURN, CITING ARTICLE 13B BASED ON THE MOTHER\'S CLAIMS 
THAT THE FATHER ABUSED ALCOHOL AND THREATENED THE CHILD. 
THE FATHER WAS NOT HEARD IN COURT, AND THE TRANSLATOR FOR 
THE CHILD WAS THE CHILD\'S OWN MATERNAL AUNT.   AN APPEALS 
COURT NONETHELESS UPHELD THIS DECISION ON MARCH 3, 2004, 
AND DISMISSED THE FATHER\'S ASSERTION THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN 
HEARD IN COURT.  ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, THE AUSTRIAN 
SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF AN EXTRAORDINARY APPEAL 
(THE APPEALS COURT HAD INITIALLY RULED OUT FURTHER 
APPEALS) AND ORDERED THE LOWER COURT TO REVIEW THE CASE 
AND TO VERIFY THE MOTHER\'S CLAIMS, AS REQUESTED BY THE 
FATHER. 
 
4.  THE SUPREME COURT RULING EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
CONVENTION IMPLIES THAT THE RETURN IS IN ITSELF GOOD FOR 
THE CHILD\'S WELL-BEING, AND THEREFORE THE MERE RETURN 
CANNOT ITSELF BE GROUNDS FOR INVOKING ARTICLE 13B.  IT 
ALSO CITED THE PURPOSE OF THE CONVENTION IN DETERRING 
ABDUCTION BY FACILITATING THE RETURN OF THE ABDUCTED 
CHILD.  THE SUPREME COURT CONCURRED WITH THE FATHER\'S 
REQUEST THAT THE MOTHER\'S ALLEGATIONS SHOULD FIRST BE 
VERIFIED.  THE FATHER CLAIMS THE MOTHER IS LIVING 
ILLEGALLY IN AUSTRIA, AND ALSO ABUSES ALCOHOL.  THE CASE 
WAS ULTIMATELY REMANDED TO THE LOWER COURT FOR SOCIAL 
CIRCUMSTANCE REPORTS ON BOTH PARENTS\' LIVING CONDITIONS, 
AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 13.  THE AUSTRIAN SOCIAL 
WORKERS HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED THEIR REPORT; THE POLISH 
REPORT IS PENDING.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BY THE TIME THAT 
REPORT IS COMPLETED THE POLISH DIVORCE DECREE GIVING THE 
MOTHER CUSTODY WILL ALREADY HAVE BECOME FINAL, ALLOWING 
THE MOTHER TO TRAVEL TO POLAND AND TAKE BOTH LEGAL AND 
PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF THE GIRL. 
 
5.  EMBASSY COMMENT: IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE AUSTRIAN 
SUPREME COURT HAS FINALLY STATED CLEARLY FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF LOWER AUSTRIAN COURTS THAT ARTICLE 13B ?HICH 
PROVIDES THAT A RETURN MAY BE DENIED IN CASES WHERE THE 
CHILD WOULD BE PUT IN GRAVE RISK IF RETURNED ?OES NOT 
APPLY MERELY BECAUSE THE CHILD WOULD BE (ONCE AGAIN) 
UPROOTED FROM HIS/HER CURRENT HOME (THUS OTHERWISE 
REWARDING THE ABDUCTOR FOR CREATING THE STATUS QUO).  WE 
NOTE THAT AS OF JANUARY 1 OF THIS YEAR ALL HAGUE RETURN 
CASES ARE CONSOLIDATED INTO 16 COURTS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY 
RECEIVED SPECIAL TRAINING ON THE HAGUE CONVENTION. 
 
6.  EMBASSY COMMENT CONTINUED: THE REPORTING IN THIS 
CABLE WAS FACILITATED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY COOPERATION WE 
RECEIVED FROM THE AUSTRIAN COURTS.  THE SUPREME COURT 
FAXED US A COPY OF THE COURT\'S DECISION UPON OUR REQUEST, 
AND THE LOWER COURT READILY PROVIDED US WITH AN UPDATE ON 
THE STATUS OF THE CASE WHEN WE CALLED.  END COMMENT.

1.  (S) Summary:  The Ambassador raised the transfer of 
Steyr-Mannlicher sniper rifles to Iran with Foreign Minstry 
Secretary General (Deputy Secretary equivalent) Johannes 
 
SIPDIS 
Kyrle on January 7.  Kyrle stressed that the Foreign Ministry 
had verified the end-user as an Iranian government entity, 
and had required a written end-use certificate.  The 
Ambassador outlined information about the other Iranian 
military equipment which has ended up in Iraq.  The 
Ambassador asked for a halt to further shipments; for Austria 
to enforce the end-use certification; and for Austria to 
provide us with the serial numbers of the weapons shipped. 
Kyrle undertook to consult with the Foreign Minister and with 
Interior Ministry officials.  End summary. 
 
2.  (S) The Ambassador stressed our concerns that these 
weapons would end up in the hands of insuragents in Iraq, 
putting our forces, and those of coalition countries, at 
great risk.  The Ambassador said we found the purpose the 
Iranians had given for the purchase -- counter narcotics and 
border control -- to be questionable, and the number of 
weapons -- 2,400 -- to seem excessive for any law enforcement 
purposes. 
 
3.  (S) Kyrle said the Foreign Ministry had been diligent in 
checking the Iranian request.  The Austrian Embassy in 
Tehran, he said, had verified that the end-user was an 
Iranian government entity, he said.  Iran was extremely 
concerned about drug flows across its border with 
Afghanistan, and both the EU and the U.S. were engaged in 
counter-narcotics programs on the Afghan side of the border. 
Kyrle stressed that Austria had demanded precise, written 
end-use certifications from the Iranians, and the Iranians 
had provided the necessary documents. 
 
4.  (S) Drawing on the information provided ref (a), the 
Ambassador outlined evidence that insurgents in Iraq had 
recently obtained Iranian-origin military equipment.  Kyrle 
acknowledged that this constituted \"proof that weapons in 
Iraq had come from Iran,\" whether from government sources, 
the black market, or any other mechanism. 
 
5.  (S) The Ambassador asked Kyrle for three things:  first, 
to stop any further shipments of these weapons to Iran; 
second, to follow up Iran\'s end-use certification (since, as 
the Ambassador said, the fact that the Iranians had signed a 
piece of paper did not guarantee anything); and third, to 
provide us with the serial numbers of the shipped weapons, so 
we can know immediately where they came from if we found any 
in Iraq. 
 
6.  (S) Kyrle asked if the United States were making similar 
presentations elsewhere in Europe.  After all, he said, other 
arms manufacturers had commercial relations with Iran.  The 
Ambassador said that we were pursuing the same general 
policy, but the reason we were engaged in this matter in 
Austria was because there was an ongoing sale involving 
military weapons from Austria.  Kyrle noted that many arms 
manufacturers had licensing agreements with countries 
elswhere in the world, making it difficult to enforce strict 
controls.  (Note:  we understand that Steyr-Mannlicher has 
such a licensing agreement with Malaysia.  End note.)  The 
Ambassador said these were also of concern, and we would 
respond similarly to transfers such as the current Austrian 
one. 
 
7.  (SBU) Kyrle undertook to convey the Ambassador\'s points 
to Foreign Minister Plassnik (who was departing shortly for 
an EU meeting on the Asian tsunami), as well as to the 
relevant officials in the Interior Ministry.  The Ambassador 
told Kyrle that he would raise this issue in his introductory 
meeting with new Interior Minister Liese Prokop.

1.  (U) The Ambassador presented refs (a) and (b) demarches 
on January 7 to Foreign Ministry Secretary General (Deputy 
Secretary equivalent) Johannes Kyrle.  Kyrle broke out of a 
 
SIPDIS 
tsunami strategy meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 
 
SIPDIS 
Interior and Defense in order to see the Ambassador.  Foreign 
Minister Plassnik was going to leave momentarily for an EU 
meeting in Brussels on the topic.  On the January 11 meeting 
in Geneva, the Ambassador reviewed ref (a) points outlining 
key U.S. goals for the meeting. 
 
----------------------------- 
Austrian Relief Contributions 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Kyrle listed the following contributions to disaster 
relief and reconstruction: 
 
--  The Austrian federal government\'s pledge of eight million 
euros \"was doubled\" by the state governments.  (Note:  In 
addition, Austrian private sector contributions total some 18 
million euros.  End note.) 
 
--  An Austrian military contingent has deployed to Sri 
Lanka, and has taken up contact with the U.S. forces in 
Galle.  The Austrian unit, from the NBC (nuclear, biological 
and chemical warfare unit), will provide water purification 
systems which can serve some 40,000 people per day.  The unit 
will remain four to six weeks, with a possibility of 
prolonging the mission, if needed.  There are also demining 
experts in the Austrian contingent from the Austrian 
deminingj school in Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria.  The 
Austrian military contingent also includes logistics experts, 
at the request of the UN.  Kyrle said the Austrians have been 
asked to name a liaison officer to the U.S. forces in Sri 
Lanka. 
 
--  As one of six net payers in the EU, Austria is 
responsible for part of any EU contribution. 
 
------------------- 
Austrian Casualties 
------------------- 
 
3.  (U) The Austrian MFA estimates that there were 5,296 
Austrians in the affected region.  The MFA confirmed the 
welfare of some 4,800 in the first week after the disaster. 
Some 480 remain missing, of which 300 were in Thailand and 
Sri Lanka.  In Thailand, the Austrians think there were heavy 
Austrian casualties in two hotels, the Sofitel and the Sea 
View, which catered mainly to Austrians, Germans and Swedes. 
 
4.  (U) The Austrian government has repatriated all the 
Austrians who wanted to come back.  This included 70 injured, 
some of whom required medical attention on the aircaft. 
Kyrle mentioned that Austria used Austrian Airlines (AUA) 
planes for transport, outfitting them with medical teams and 
equipment to permit even surgery to occur during the flight. 
For the time being, only two injured Austrians remain in 
Bangkok hospitals, and Austrian doctors are present to give 
them clearance to travel back to Austria. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
EU Consular Coordination (or lack thereof) 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) The normally placid Kyrle complained in rather 
bitter terms about the lack of consular coordination among EU 
member states in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. 
Austria pressed hard for mutual consular assistance among EU 
states after the disaster struck, but met very little 
success.  Only Sweden and Germany were \"somewhat positive,\" 
while others, especially the UK, objected.  The result was 
that Austria, with diplomatic representation only in Bangkok, 
Delhi, Kuala Lampur and Jakarta, had to send 200 officers to 
the region.  Kyrle said the EU itself, which has its own 
representation in the region, did not even reply to Austrian 
requests for assistance until a full week after the diaster. 
The EU representation in Bangkok, with a staff of 85 people 
and an Austrian at its head, had no orders to intervene on 
behalf of any member state, Kyrle said.  The draft EU 
constitution speaks of mutual assistance in the development 
of a common EU foreign service, and the Austrians had always 
touted EU membership as an opportunity to get assistance in 
such disasters.  However, in the event, \"each EU member was 
on its own,\" he said.  The most direct contacts Austria had 
were with Switzerland -- not even an EU member. 
 
6.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Plassnik was going to make this a 
primary topic in the January 7 meeting in Brussels, Kyrle 
promised. 
 
---------------------------- 
January 11 Meeting in Geneva 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Austria would \"of course\" send people to the January 
11 meeting in Geneva, although Kyrle was not prepared to 
announce names.  Kyrle said that the Austrian government 
would meet again on Sunday, January 9, to take stock of 
Austria\'s position.

REFS:  (A) 04 VIENNA 3647; (B) 04 VIENNA 0273 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  Austria\'s GDP grew 2.0% in 2004, driven by booming 
exports in response to strong world economic growth, 
according to two leading Austrian economic institutes. 
The institutes now forecast real GDP growth of 2.2-2.3% 
in 2005 and 2.2-2.4% in 2006. The strong Euro, high oil 
prices and the U.S. twin deficits represent downward 
risks for the 2005/2006 forecasts.  However, economists 
do not see recession as a possibility.  The recovery is 
still export-driven.  Investments should recover only in 
2006, but private consumptions should pick up soon when 
the 2005 income and corporate tax cuts take effect. 
These tax cuts will cause the public sector deficit to 
rise from 1.3% of GDP in 2004 to at least 1.9% in 2005. 
The GoA\'s 2006 deficit goal is 1.7%.  Employment growth 
in both 2005 and 2006 will have little effect on the 
unemployment rate of 4.2-4.4%.  Inflation will tick up to 
1.9-2.3% in 2005 and ease to 1.7% in 2006.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MODERATE 2004 RECOVERY 
---------------------- 
2.  The Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) 
and Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS) recently 
presented their latest 2004 estimates, revised 
projections for 2005 and a first forecast for 2006.  For 
2004, WIFO and IHS maintained their estimate from 
September for GDP growth of 2.0%.  They agreed that the 
Austrian economy had gained momentum in 2004, mainly as a 
result of booming exports to Germany, the U.S., the ten 
new EU member states, and some Asian markets.  However, 
the strong Euro and higher oil prices dampened this 
momentum.  While the GoA\'s extension of the investment 
premium to the end of 2004 (ref A) stimulated 
investments, private consumption remained sluggish. 
Austria\'s 2.0% growth rate in 2004 was moderate compared 
to previous cyclical upswings and lagged behind the world 
economic growth of more than 5.0%.  WIFO Deputy Director 
Ewald Walterskirchen declared that \"this is not yet an 
upswing, which would require at least 3.0% growth.\" 
 
CONTINUED MODERATE GROWTH IN 2005 AND 2006 
------------------------------------------ 
3.  For 2005, the institutes reduced their growth 
expectations by a quarter of a percentage point, because 
of the dampening effects of the strong Euro.  They now 
project growth of 2.2-2.3% in 2005.  In 2006, all demand 
aggregates should contribute more evenly to economic 
growth of 2.3-2.4%.  However, this implies a lower Euro 
exchange rate and lower oil prices.  The 2005 forecast 
reflects an estimated .25% boost to growth from the GoA\'s 
2005 income and corporate tax cut (ref B).  Less robust 
global economic growth, in combination with a strong 
Euro, will slow Austrian export growth.  Investments will 
grow moderately in 2005, since many companies moved 
forward investments in 2004 in response to the GoA\'s 
investment premium (ref A).  However, economists predict 
investments will pick up again in 2006 because of 
necessary investments in new technologies and record high 
business profits.  An improved employment outlook and the 
income tax cut should stimulate consumption in both 2005 
and 2006.  The savings rate will rise from 8.1% of 
disposable incomes in 2004 to around 8.5% in 2005/2006, 
according to the Austrian National Bank (ANB). 
 
4.  The WIFO and IHS 2005/2006 forecasts are in line with 
recent ANB projections for real GDP growth of 2.3% in 
2005 and 2.1% in 2006; OECD growth projections of 2.3% 
and 2.6%, respectively; and European Commission 
predictions of 2.4% growth for both years. 
 
5.  An October 2004 Industrialists\' Association poll 
revealed less optimism among members, compared to 
previous polls, regarding the business outlook over the 
next six months.  This seems to confirm analysts\' 
prediction that the peak of the industrial cycle is 
already over.  A year-end public opinion poll revealed 
that the Austrians have become more pessimistic about the 
economic future:  36% view the coming year \"with 
skepticism\" (compared to 33% at year-end 2003); 35% \"with 
confidence\" (down from 43%); and 29% expect no change. 
 
RISKS ?XCHANGE RATES, OIL PRICES, U.S. TWIN DEFICITS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
6.  WIFO Director Helmut Kramer listed several exogenous 
factors that could negatively affect growth:  unfavorable 
exchange rates; higher oil prices; and the twin deficits 
in the U.S.  Kramer predicted Austrian exports would 
continue to grow, but at a slower pace than in 2004. 
Nevertheless, Kramer cautioned that continued growth is 
dependent on stable oil prices and a halt in the dollar\'s 
slide vis-`-vis the Euro.  IHS director Bernhard Felderer 
identified exchange rate developments as the greatest 
risk for the 2005/2006 forecasts.  Despite these 
uncertainties, neither institute foresees a scenario of 
recession. 
 
7.  The ANB also considers exchange rates and oil prices 
as the greatest risks to its 2005/2006 forecasts.  The 
ANB calculated that a 10% increase in the Euro exchange 
rate in 2005 would reduce Austrian GDP growth by 0.1% in 
both 2005 and 2006.  A 20% increase in oil prices in 2005 
would reduce Austrian GDP growth by 0.15% and 0.25% in 
2005 and 2006, respectively. 
 
ASSUMPTIONS FOR GROWTH FORECASTS 
-------------------------------- 
8.  The institutes based their 2005/2006 forecasts on the 
following assumptions: 
-- U.S. economic growth of 2.8-3.3% in 2005 and 3.1-3.5% 
in 2006; 
-- Euro area growth of 1.7% in 2005 and 2.2% in 2006; 
-- EU-25 growth of 2.0% in 2005 and 2.3% in 2006; 
-- German growth of 1.3% in 2005 and 1.6-1.8% in 2006; 
-- oil prices of USD 40-42 per barrel in 2005 and USD 38- 
40 in 2006; and 
-- dollar/Euro exchange rates of 0.75-0.76 in 2005 and 
0.76-0.78 in 2006. 
 
INFLATION TO TICK UP, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STICKY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
9.  In 2004, one quarter of Austria\'s 2.0% inflation rate 
was due to higher oil prices.  WIFO has revised its 2005 
inflation forecast upward to 2.3%, due to higher energy 
prices, a rise in the tobacco tax and rising housing 
costs.  For 2006, the institutes expect inflationary 
pressures to ease to 1.7%.  However, this decrease in 
inflation implies a decline in the price of oil to USD 
38-40 per barrel in 2006. 
 
10.  WIFO and IHS predict no significant reduction in the 
unemployment rate.  Rising labor demand will be offset by 
a continued influx of foreign labor, measures to raise 
the retirement age, and more women entering the labor 
market.  Thus, despite a marked increase in employment in 
both 2005 and 2006, the projected 2005 unemployment rate 
of 4.4% is only marginally lower than the expected rate 
of 4.5% in 2004.  The unemployment rate should again 
decrease marginally to 4.2-4.3% in 2006. 
 
PUBLIC DEFICIT GROWING 
---------------------- 
11.  Due to the investment premium extension, tax revenue 
shortfalls and a lower profit transfer from the ANB, the 
institutes estimate the total public sector deficit will 
be 1.3% of GDP in 2004.  In 2005, the income and 
corporate tax cuts will push the deficit to at least 
1.9%.  In a November 2004 update of its 2004-2008 
Stability Program, the GoA predicted a 1.7% deficit in 
2006, a 0.8% deficit in 2007, and a balanced budget in 
2008.  WIFO Director Kramer noted the 1.7% deficit 
projection for 2006 acknowledges that there will most 
likely be increased spending in an election year.  Kramer 
doubted that the GoA would balance the budget in 2008, 
noting this would require further austerity measures.

1.  Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel announced on January 9 that 
Austrian assistance to the region of the Asian tsunami would 
total 50 million Euros (USD 67 million at current exchange 
rates) for 12 assistance projects.  Speaking after a meeting 
with representatives of federal, state and local governments 
and the \"social partners\" (the employers\' and workers\' 
chambers), Schuessel said the funds would come from all 
levels of government.  The federal gogernment would provide 
34 million Euros, the states would provide 10 million Euros, 
and local governments would give 6 million Euros.  The focus 
of the projects will be reconstruction.  Projects include 
construction of \"SOS Children\'s Villages\" for orphans in the 
region; construction of hospitals; environmental assistance 
projects; and reconstruction of water treatment facilities. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Military and Civilian Deployments 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  Austria has sent some 200 officials to provide 
assistance, both for Austrian victims and for the countries 
of the region.  A military detachment of 77 people is 
providing both water purification and de-mining assistance in 
Sri Lanka.  Austria is using a C-130 transport aircraft to 
support its deployments.  (Note:  Austria has three C-130s, 
which it uses primarily to support peacekeeping deployments 
in the Balkans and the Golan Heights.  Two are currently 
undergoing scheduled maintenance.  End note.)

2.  In principle, Austrian laws make no distinction between 
Austrian and foreign firms with regard to access for 
services.  However, some minor non-tariff barriers exist, 
particularly in the telecom, and legal and accounting 
services sectors.  Regarding private sector management of 
social security funds, private companies have no access to 
the basic mandatory social insurance funds in Austria 
(public pension, health, accident, and unemployment funds). 
Private companies can, however, compete in the sectors of 
supplementary insurance and private pension funds.

REF: SECSTATE 233497 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified. 
 
1.  (SBU) Embassy conveyed reftel points to Austrian MFA 
DAS-equivalent for Latin American Kornelia Weihs on January 
10.  Pol Unit Chief followed up with Weihs (who had just 
returned from the COLAT EU working group meeting in Brussels) 
on January 12.  Weihs told us that the Luxembourg Presidency 
had also distributed the U.S. non-paper on the Common 
Position on Cuba at the COLAT meeting, but that the paper had 
arrived too late for member state reps to consider it. 
 
2.  (SBU) Weihs explained that although the December General 
Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) had taken a 
decision in principle to suspend some of the measures against 
Cuba, the modalities of this were still to be worked out. 
After the COLAT, the PSC, COREPER, and finally, the January 
31 GAERC would take final action on implementation. 
 
3.  (SBU) Weihs told us that the Cuban government\'s freeze on 
contacts with EU member state Embassies and the EU Commission 
representation in Havana had led to an unproductive 
stalemate.  EU Member states had therefore settled on a 
suspension of the EU agreed measures until the end of June 
2005 in an attempt to re-start a dialogue with the Cuban 
regime and bring some movement into a stagnant situation. 
The Cuban government then abandoned its divide-and-conquer 
tactics on January 3 by agreeing to renew diplomatic contacts 
with all the EU member state missions and the Commission. 
 
4.  (SBU) However, the release (into house arrest) of 14 
gravely ill detainees had impressed none of the member 
states, Weihs said.  All were convinced that the regime\'s 
sole motivation was to avoid having any of the dissidents die 
in detention.  The EU was still seeking consensus on how to 
proceed in order to help bring about an improvement in the 
status of the detainees and, generally, to promote democracy 
and human rights in Cuba.  It was up to the Luxembourg 
presidency to propose a common approach at the February 8 
COLAT, when the U.S. paper would also be on the agenda.

1.  (SBU) Embassy conveyed reftel points to Austrian MFA 
Middle East Africa Bureau on January 10.  Pol Unit Chief 
followed up with Middle East desk officer Wolfgang Lapuh on 
January 12.  Lapuh agreed with our assessment that successful 
elections would represent a critical turning point for Iraq. 
However, he pointed out current GoA policy prohibiting TDYs 
by Austrian officials in Iraq would likely preclude MFA 
involvement in the International Mission for Iraq elections 
(IMIE).  Lapuh asked whether Austrians with election 
observation experience could participate on a private basis. 
PolOff said that election and election monitoring expertise 
would be in high demand and urged Lapuh to have such 
individuals contact Elections Canada to volunteer their 
services. 
 
2. (SBU) Pol Unit Chief noted recent media accounts of 
arrangements for out-of-country voting for Iraqis resident in 
Germany, including polling stations in four German cities. 
He urged Lapuh to try to facilitate similar arrangements for 
Iraqis in Austria.  Lapuh promised to look into possibilities 
for Iraqi absentee voting in Austria.
