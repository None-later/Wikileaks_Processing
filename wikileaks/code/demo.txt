ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES

OF %QUOTES%PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION%QUOTES% FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- 
LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28

FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT %QUOTES%PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION%QUOTES% 
STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY 
SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED 
UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE 
LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY 
WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED 
AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS.

COUNTRY TEAM. MESSAGE 
 
 
BEGIN SUMMARY 
 
GENERAL AZIMI, MINISTER OF WAR, ON INSTRUCTION OF SHAH ASKS THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER HARD LOOK AT F-4E PRODUCTION LINE IN ORDER ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF ONE SQUADRON OF F-4ES TO IRAN IN 1972. REQUEST REFLECTS SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S INCREASING CONCERN OVER SOVIET AMBITIONS IN AREA AND ESPECIALLY THREAT SHAH SEES TO IRAN OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY IRAQ AND USSR. SHAH RECOGNIZES PROBLEMS THIS POSES FOR US BUT IS TURNING TO USG WITH THIS REQUEST TO GIVE IRAN HIGHER PRIORITY ON FA-4E PRODUCTION SCHEDULE BECAUSE HE REGARDS US AS MOST DEPENDABLE FRIEND. END SUMMARY 
 
ACTION REQUESTED: COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDS US REVIEW F-4E PRODUCTION LINE AND RESPOND FAVORABLY TO SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S REQUEST FOR 16 F-4ES IN 1972 FROM WHATEVER SOURCE MAY BE AVAILABLE. 
 
1. ON FEB 24 CHARGE WAS CONVOKED BY MINSTER OF WAR, GEN. REZANUZIMI, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM SHAH. AZIMI SAID SHAH MOST DEEPLY CONCERNED AT TRENDS IN SECURITY SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST AND EXPECIALLY ON HIS WESTERN BORDERS. US OFFICALS ALREADY AWARE OF SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONCERN THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS (SEE REFTELS), BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ SOVIET RELATIONS INCLUDING AGREEMENT TO DELIVER MORE MIGS AND OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT PLUS INDICATION THAT RECENT IRAQI-SOVIET TALKS IN MOSCOW INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY AS WELL AS INCREASED MILITARY COOPERATION INJECT NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S TIMETABLE FOR MODERNINZING AND STRENTHENING HIS ARMED FORCES. MOST SPECIFICALLY, SITUATION REQUIRED IRAN ACCELERATE ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT AND HOST PARTICULARLY DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT. 
 
2. AZIMI RECALLED THAT GOI HAD REQUESTED DELIVERY OF 16 OF F-4E AIRCRAFT NOW ON ORDER BY IRAN (FIRST OF WHICH WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY UNTIL AUGUST 1973) BE ADVANCED TO CY 1972. HOWEVER, GOI HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED BY USG AND MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS THAT PRODUCTION LINE FOR IRAN COULD NOT RPT NOT BE ADVANCED TO MEET 1972 DELIVERY DATES DESIRED. SHAH WAS MOST DISTURBED, AS ADDITION OF F-4ES IN 1972 WAS VITAL TO IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S SECURITY AT THIS TIME. SHAH HAD DIRECTED THAT USG BE ASKED, IF PRODUCTION FOR IRAN COULD NOT IN FACT BE ADVANCED, TO MAKE REQUESTED F-4ES AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S DESIRE IS FOR DELIIVERY OF F-4FS IN LOTS OF FOUR DURING JUNE TO DECEMBER TIME-FRAME. 
 
3. CHARGE REVIEWED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN US-IRAN MILITARY COOPERATION, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND CREDIT, AND STRESSED THAT RECORD INDICATED WE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONCERNS AND DESIRES AND HAD BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S WISHES. CURRENTLY, AZIMI%SINGLEQUOTES%S DEPUTY GEN. TOUFANS, WAS IN US DISCUSSING VERY QUESTION OF ACCLERATED EQUIPMENT ACQUISIION INCLUDING F-4E. ACCELERATION OF F-4E DELIVERY RAISED DIFFICULT TECHNICAL AND COST PROBLEMS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS OF OTHER COMMITMENTS AND PRIORITIES. UNDOUBTEDLY THESE ISSUES WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN FULL WITH GEN. TOUFANIAN TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY INFORMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS AND REASONS FOR ANY LIMITATIONS ON MEETING GOI REQUEST THAT MIGHT EXIST. GEN. TOUFANIAN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FULLER PICTURE OF SITUATION THAN WE NOW HAD IN IRAN. 
 
4. AZIMI RESPONDED THAT GOI WAS BEING KEPT INFORMED OF TOUFANIAN DISCUSSIONS, BUT DECISON ON F-4E COULD NOT BE DELAYED. AZIMI MADE CLEAR SHAH FELT AQUISITION OF 16 F-4E AIRCRAFT IN 1972 WAS MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE MILITARY PROBLEM OUTSTANDING. HE STRESSED SHAH BELIEVED THAT NUMBER REQUIRED WAS SMALL IN RELATION TO US INVENTORY, AND THAT UNSETTLED SITUATION CONFRONTING IRAN WARRANTED ACCELERATED DELIVERY TO IRAN AS AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE DISPOSITIONS (AS TO EUROPE OR EVEN USAF) IN SAME TIME FRAME. 
 
5. CHARGE NOTED WE WOULD TRANSMIT SHAHS REQUEST TO, WASHINGTON AND THAT USG IN SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MARKED OUR RELATIONS WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE RESPONSIVE. CHARGE SAID THIS SAME FRIENDSHIP REQUIRED HIM TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S NEEDS AS SHAH SAW THEM, OUR MILITARY ADVISERS, AS GOI KNEW, WERE CONCERNED THAT ACCELERATION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION WOULD STRAIN SUPPORT AND OPERATIONAL MANPOWER OF IIAF AND COULD LEAD TO DECREASE RATHER THAN INCREASE IN IIAF EFFECTIVENESS. AZIMI REPLIED THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED HAD BEEN, CLOSELY STUDIED BY IlAF WITH MAAG ASSISTANCE, AND IIAF WAS SATISFIED THAT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT REQUESTED COULD BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO PRESENT FORCE STRUCTURE. AZIMI CLOSED MEETING BY ASKING THAT USG ANSWER SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S REQUEST AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
6. COMMENT. SHAH IS DEEPLY CONCERN AT DEVELOPMENTS OVER PAST YEARS STRENGTHENING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN MIDEAST AND INDIAN OCEAN AND APPEARING TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIALLY ENLARGED SOVIET COMMITMENT, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY, TO IRAQ. HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASED PRESENT DANGER REQIRES IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S FIRST LINE AIR DEFENSE TO BE BEEFED-UP NOW RATHER THAN IN PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED SCHEDULE STARTING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE NUMBER, FREQUENCY AND TONE OF DEMARCHES ON SUBJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS VIRTUALLY UNPARALLELLED, AND CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HIM CONSIDERS ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. 
 
7. WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONCERN, WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT REQUEST --LIKE USG DECISION IN 1970 ON SALE TO IRAN OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SQUADRONS OF F-4E --HAS BECOME ANOTHER GUT ISSUE IN SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S MIND. SHAH IS AGAIN TURNING TO USG BECAUSE IN PERIODS OF ANXIETY SHAH FEELS HE CAN LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND HE HOPES THAT US AS RELIABLE FRIEND WILL FIND CHANCE BE RESPONSIVE ON MATTER HE CONSIDERS IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S SECURITY. THUS USG CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DECISION INVOLVES UNUSUAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE RELATED TO FABRIC OF USG-GOI RELATIONS. DECISION SHOULD ALSO NOT OVERLOOK OR UNDERESTIMATE IMPORTANCE OF IRAN FOR VITAL US NATIONAL INTERESTS. 
 
8. ACTION REQUESTED. COUNRY TEAM URGES THAT USG GIVE PROMPT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION TO SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S REQUEST FOR 1972 DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT, FROM WHATEVER SOURCES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED (INCLUDING DELIVERIES TO USAF). WE RECOGNIZE THAT REQUEST MAY RAISE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, BUT URGE THAT EVERY AVENUE BE EXPLORED TO REACH POSITIVE RESPONSE. IT IS ALSO MOST IMPORTANT THAT COUNTRY TEAM BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS TO ENABLE US CONTINUE TO MEET AND TEMPER SENSE OF URGENCY ON SUBJECT WHICH PREVAILS WITHIN GOI. IF DELAYS OR BARRIERS TO FULLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE MATERIALIZE, WE TRUST THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE (E.G. PARTIAL DELIVERY IN 1972) AND THAT PERSUASIVE RATIONALE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO SHAH REASONS FOR ANY SHORTCOMING. IN ORDER TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

SUBJECT: TRIALS/EXECUTIONS OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS: STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AND SHAH LASHES OUT AT FOREIGN CRITICS 
 
1. IN PROTEST AGAINST RECENT TRIALS/PUNISHMENT (PARTICULARLY EXECUTIONS, WHICH NOW TOTAL 10) OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT-ELEMENTS, TEHRAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -- LEAD BY FACULTY OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS-- MOUNTED ON-CAMPUS DEMONSTRATION AFTERNOON OF MARCH 7 AND EVEN LARGE ONE (CIRC 600) MORNING OF MARCH 8. WHILE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION FELT CAPABLE OF HANDLING MARCH 7 DEMONSTRATION WITHOUT HELP OF OUTSIDE POLICE, THEY APPARENTLY FELT UNABLE DO SO MARCH 8 AND CALLED NATIONAL POLICE ONTO CAMPUS FOR BRIEF PERIOD. RESULT WAS MUCH MANHANDLING OF STUDENTS BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY SERIOUS CASUALTIES/CLASHES, AND UNIVERSITY WAS QUIET BY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
 
2. SOME FACULTIES AT OTHER TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES (E.G. ARYAMEHR, NATIONAL AND POLYTECHNIC) ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SYMPATHY STRIKES%QUOTES% MARCH 8 BUT SO FAR NO DEMONSTRATIONS REPORTED* THERE IS RELIABLE REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATIONS BY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF MESHED (SIX OF 10 EXECUTED CAME FROM MESHED AREA) BECAME SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT UNIVERSITY WAS CLOSED THREE DAYS AGO AND STILL REMAINS CLOSED. (COMMENT: WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF GOI ORDERS TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES CLOSED UNTIL AFTER NO RUZ HOLIDAY.) 
 
3. FROM COMMENTS OF STUDENTS AND OBSERVERS CLOSE TO ACADEMIC CIRCLES, IT SEEMS CLEAR LARGE PART OF MOTIVATION FOR DEMONSTRATION AND SYMPATHY STRIKES  IS STUDENT ANGER OVER GOI%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONTINUED DETENTION OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AS %QUOTES%ANTI-STATE%QUOTES% SUBVERSIVES AND, EVEN MORE, ANGER OVER RECENT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS OF THOSE CONVICTED OF ANTI-STATE ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY INDICATIONS, HOWEVER, THAT GOI CONSIDERS TIMING OF DEMONSTRATIONS (PERHAPS DEMONSTRATIONS THEMSELVES) PROMOTED BY ANTI-STATE ELEMENTS TO EMBARRASS GOI DURING VISIT OF CHANCELLOR BRANDT AND HIS CONSIDERABLE PRESS RETINUE. 
 
4. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR EARS OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS SHAH LASHED OUT STRONGLY IN MARCH 7 PRESS CONFERENCE (WITH GERMAN PRESSMEN) AT WHAT HE LABELLED DISTORTED FOREIGN REPORTING ABOUT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS. HIM HIT AT LE MONDE VIGOROUSLY AND REPEATEDLY, AND TOOK PARTICULAR EXCEPTION TO LE MONDE%SINGLEQUOTES%S APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONVICTED IN RECENT TRIALS. AFTER ASKING TWO RHETORICAL QUESTIONS %QUOTES%HAS LE MONDE EVER ASKED WHETHER THESE MURDERERS HAVE RIGHT TO TAKE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE?

SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN 
 
REF: TEHRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S A-077 OF MAY 15, 1972: TEHRAN 3312 
 
SUMMARY: TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN SEEM TO BE INCREASING INSTEAD OF USUAL SUMMER SUBSIDENCE DUE TO VACATION FOR STUDENTS, PERHAPS INDICATING BETTER ORGANIZATION AND BROADENING OF APPEAL TO NON-STUDENT GROUPS. VIGOROUS ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN ON PART OF IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS NETTING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT HARSH GOI POLICY APPARENTLY UNABLE BRING GUERRILLAS UNDER CONTROL AND MAY IN FACT BE HARDENING ATTITUDES OF GUERRILLAS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS. WHILE TERRORIST GROUPS NOT YET THREAT TO REGIME, GOI UNLIKELY SUCCEED IN HALTING THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING BASIC QUESTION OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. DESPITE CONTINUING LARGE-SCALE CAMPAIGN ON PART OF GOI SECURITY ORGANS, URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE MAINTAINING RATE OF ACTIVITY. DURING PAST FOUR MONTH PERIOD THERE HAVE BEEN 28 CONFIRMED EXPLOSIONS (11 OF WHICH DIRECTED AGAINST US PRESENCE), TEN SHOOTOUTS AND SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS INCLUDING UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP DAUGHTER OF COURT MINISTER ALAM, AND PLOT TO SABOTAGE ISFAHAN STEEL MILL. OTHER UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS REPORTED ON ALMOST DAILY BASIS. 
 
2. IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANS, INCLUDING SAVAEEEAAA GENDARMERIE AND LOCAL POLICE, REACTING VIGOROUSLY AND WITH HEAVY HAND. DURING SAME PERIOD AT LEAST 16 GUERRILLAS KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, 13 OTHERS ANNOUNCED EXECUTED, TEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT REPRIEVED AND SENTENCE TO LIFE IN PRISON, NINE OTHERS GIVEN LIFE, AND 39 CONVICTED AND GIVEN SENTENCES RANGING FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS. ALL OF ABOVE TRIED BY MILITARY TRIBUNALS, AND MAJLES HAS RECENTLY PASSED LAW PROVIDING SPECIFICALLY THAT ALL THOSE ENGAGING IN ACTS OF SABOTAGE WILL BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WITH POSSIBLE SENTENCES RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO DEATH. GOI HAS COMMITTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO SO FAR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CONTROL TERRORISTS--FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF OFFICERS NORMALLY DETAILED TO WORK WITH BNDD AGENTS ON NARCOTICS MATTERS HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO GUERRILLA PROBLEM. 
 
3. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED IN TEHRAN THAT URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ARE BEING REPORTED IN THE CONTROLLED LOCAL MEDIA. BUT INCREASED RAPPORTAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT AS MUCH FROM REPUTED PRESSURE FROM LOCAL PRESSMEN ON GOI AS FROM CONTINUING GOVERNMENT DESIRE TO EXPLOIT LESS SAVORY ASPECTS OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS DOES NOT COVER ALL INCIDENTS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED BY EMBASSY LET ALONE THE MANY GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WHICH ARE RUMORED BUT NOT CONFIRMED. MOREOVER FREQUENCY OF UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAS INCREASED BY A FACTOR AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THAT OF THOSE GIVEN MEDIA COVERAGE, LEADING TO PRESUMPTION THAT STEPPED UP TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS A REALITY AND NOT A RESULT OF INSPIRED PUBLICITY. PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN INCREASED GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS FACT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF INCIDENTS HAS CONTINUED INTO SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS, WHO HAVE IN PAST PROVIDED BULK OF RECRUITS FOR GUERRILLAS, DISPERSED FOR VACATIONS. THIS MAY MEAN THAT UNDERGROUND MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND ARE CATCHING ON WITH NON-STUDENT GROUPS, WHICH IF TRUE, WOULD HEIGHTEN DIFFICULTY OF PENETRATING AND CONTROLLING GUERRILLA GROUPS. 
 
4. DESPITE GOI APPARENT INABILITY TO SUPPRESS GUERRILLAS, EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT TERRORISTS AT PRESENT CONSTITUE AN IRRITANT AND EMRARRASSMENT BUT POSE NO THREAT TO REGIME. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT TO US, AGAIN VERY TENTATIVELY, THAT GOI TACTICS OF HARSH REPRESSION AGAINST GUERRILLAS ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND MAY PROVOKE SNOWBALL EFFECT OF ACTION AND REACTION PART OF SAVAK TERRORISTS, LEADING TO BROADENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE AGAINST SAVAK PERVASIVENESS AND TACTICS. EVENTUALLY REGIME WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS RESPONSIVE TO AT LEAST SOME OF THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMPLAINTS WHICH FORM BASES OF GUERRILLA DISSATISFACTION. WE DO NOT ENUMMERATE THESE COMPLAINTS HERE, PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY FORMED AND DEFINED IN OUR OWN MINDS OR EVEN, PERHAPS IN THE MINDS OF THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES. MOREOVER, TERRORIST MOVEMENT IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OR ORGANIZATIONALLY UNIFIED AND NATURE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS VARIES FROM GROUP TO GROUP. WE SHALL BE EXAMINING FURTHER AND REPORTING ON THESE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, WITHOUT SOUNDING ANY ALARM BELLS, THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED TO ALERT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE URBAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN IRAN CONTINUES TO BE A FACT OF LOCAL POLITICAL LIFE WHICH BEARS CONTINUING SCRUTINY. 
 
5. THE U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAN, WHILE TARGETED BY THE TERRORISTS, IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY TARGET AND SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE SUCH AS PRESIDENT NIXON%SINGLEQUOTES%S MAY VISIT (SEE REFTEL) OR THE JANUARY SAVAK TV SHOW WHICH PRECEDE LAST SPRING%SINGLEQUOTES%S SHOW TRIALS HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO BRING ON BOMBINGS AT AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING ALL REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS.

SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST VIOLENCE 
 
REF: TEHRAN 4887 
 
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION OF GENERAL SAID TAHERI, BOMBING AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SAVAK MAINTAINING ITS POLICY OF WIDESPREAD PREVENTIVE ARRESTS AND, WHILE THIS RUNS RISK OF HEIGHTENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE, OFFICIALS SEEM CONFIDENT THAT GUERRILLAS ARE ON THE RUN. WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE OFFICIAL OPTIMISM AND FEEL THAT SANGUINE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE GUERRILLA REACTION THEY USUALLY PROVOKE MAY FURTHER ERODE CREDIBILITY OF SECURITY ORGANS IN MIND OF PUBLIC. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. IN WAKE OF SMOOTHLY HANDLED ASSASSINATION AUGUST 13 OF HEAD OF PRISONS BRIGADIER GENERAL SAID TAHERI (REFTEL) WHO WAS ALSO CHIEF OF AN ANTI-GUERRILLA SUBCOMMITTEE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FREQUENCY OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS INCREASED. RECENT CONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAVE INCLUDED A BOMB IN A TEHRAN DEPARTMENT STORE WHICH INJURED THE TERRORIST PLANTING IT, BOMB IN TEHRAN NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY BUILDING WHICH KILLED WATCHMAN, APPREHENSION OF A TERRORIST IN SOUTH TEHRAN WHICH RESULTED IN ONE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED, AND SHOOTING TO DEATH OF THREE POLICEMEN IN A SMALL BAZAAR IN SOUTH TEHRAN. NUMEROUS OTHER BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS RUMORED BUT NOT VERIFIED BY EMBASSY OR CONFIRMED BY GOI. 
 
2. SAVAK AND OTHER SECURITY ORGANS ARE PROCEEDING WITH A WIDESPREAD AND, WE HEAR, NOT VERY WELL TARGETED ROUND-UP OF SUSPECTS, AIDED BY LISTS OF NAMES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOUND IN DWELLING OF A RECENTLY SLAIN TERRORIST LEADER. POLICE NETS, WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY HAULING IN THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY, HAVE EXTENDED AS FAR AFIELD AS ISFAHAN WHERE A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED TWO WEEKS AGO. 
 
3. DESPITE INCREASING LEVEL OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, POLICE OFFICIALS REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. CHIEF OF NATIONAL POLICE LTG JAFFARQOLI SADRI ASSURED EMBOFF AUG. 17 THAT CURRENT FLURRY OF INCIDENTS CONSTITUTES DYING GASP OF GUERRILLAS WHO, HE CLAIMS, HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS IN PAST YEAR AND ARE FORCED TO ACT NOW TO SHOW THEY STILL EXIST. IN A MEDIA INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LOCAL PRESS AUG. 19, SADRI UPPED FIGURE FOR REDUCTION OF GUERRILLA FORCES TO THREE FOURTHS, PREDICTED THAT REMAINING TERRORISTS WOULD SOON BE WIPED OUT AND REITERATED STANDARD GOVERNMENT LINE THAT GUERRILLAS ARE CONFUSED MISGUIDED INDIVIDUALS OF MARXIST-LENINIST BENT BUT WITHOUT GOALS OR PROGRAM. IN DISCUSSION WITH EMBOFF SADRI ATTACHED NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MURDER OF GENERAL TAHERI, ASSERTING THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISIFED WITH ANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICER AND CHOSE TAWERI ONLY BECUASE OF IOSLATED LOCATION OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR LONG WALKS ALONE. SADRI ALSO DISCOUNTED POSSIBILITY THAT ASSASSINS WERE OF HIGHER CALIBER THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL GUERRILLAS, POINTING OUT THAT SHOTS WHICH KILLED TAHERI HAD BEEN FIRED FROM 50 CENTIMETERS AND THAT %QUOTES%A CHILD COULD HIT A MAN FROM THAT DISTANCE.%QUOTES% 
 
COMMENT: WE CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT TAHERI WAS PERSONALLY TARGETED DUE TO HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH ASSASSINATION CARRIED OUT, REQUIRING CAREFUL PLANNING AND RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS DEFT EXECUTION, APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THOSE INVOLVED WERE MUCH BETTER TRAINED THAN AVERAGE TERRORISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THEIR OWN BOMBS. 
 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NUMBER OF GUERRILLA INCIDENTS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER OFF, BUT WE DO NOT SHARE SADRI%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONFIDENCE THAT HIS TACTICS AND THOSE OF SAVAK CAN COMPLETELY HALT TERRORIST ACTIVITY. IN FACT OVER REACTION AND TOO ZEALOUS A REPRESSION BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEM AT LEAST AS LIKELY TO RECRUIT NEW GUERRILLAS AS TO STAMP OUT OLD ONES. IN ADDITION WISDOM SEEMS QUESTIONABLE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS MAKING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT BREAKUP OF GUERRILLA GROUPS AND PREDICTIONS OF THEIR DEMISE. WE RECALL THAT THE LAST SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT LAST JANUARY WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS ON US-PROPERTIES AND OTHER SITES IN TEHRAN. IN OUR VIEW SUCH PUBLIC DECLARATIONS RUN RISK OF INCREASING CREDIBILITY GAP AND RESENTMENT ON PART OF PUBLIC WHO LIKELY BE INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE STAMPING OUT TERRORISTS. 
 
THE PROGNOSTICATION THEREFORE IS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE TERRORISM BUT, DESPITE SUCCESSFUL MURDER OF TAHERI, WE DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT GUERRILLAS WILL NOW PLACE GREATER RELIANCE ON ASSASSINATION AS A TOOL. REASON IS THAT TERRORISTS STILL LACK ENOUGH TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PULL OFF ASSASSINATIONS ON REGULAR BASIS.

TIES WITH IRAN. END SUMMARY. ACTION REQUESTED: 
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE BY OPEN OF BUSINESS APRIL 4 
SUMMARY OF OUR ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN IN LAST 18 
MONTHS, HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENTLY REVISED ANNOUNCED ARMS 
POLICY TO PAKISTAN AND ANY OTHER POINTS DEPT OR ISLAMABAD 
THINK USEFUL TO PASS TO SHAH REGARDING BHUTTO VISIT. 
 
1. ON MORNING APRIL 5 I WILL BE PRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS 
TO SHAH. THIS OCCASION TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
AUDIENCES BEING SCHEDULED FOR APRIL DURING VISITS OF 
DEPSEC RUSH AND GENERALS GOODPASTER AND RYAN WILL 
PROVIDE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO SHAH MESSAGES OR 
THOUGHTS WE MAY HAVE ON: ( A) US/ IRANIAN RELATIONS, 
( B) DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND, ( C) ROLE 
IRAN CAN PLAY IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. 
 
2. AT PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES% S CUSTOM 
IS TO TAKE AMBASSADOR ASIDE AFTER CEREMONIALS FOR PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION. THIS BEING MY FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING 
WITH SHAH AS AMBASSADOR, MY INTENTION IS TO LISTEN TO 
WHAT SHAH HAS TO SAY. I ANTICIPATE SHAH, AS IS HIS CUSTOM, 
WILL TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS %QUOTES% TOUR D%SINGLEQUOTES% HORIZONS%QUOTES%. WITH 
BHUTTO EXPECTED IN TOWN APRIL 7, PAKISTAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
COME UP. SHAH WILL PROBABLY CHIDE US FOR NOT HELPING 
BHUTTO ADEQUATELY. IF SO, I PLAN REMIND SHAH OF ALL WE 
HAVE DONE ECONOMICALLY FOR PAKISTAN IN LAST YEAR OR SO 
AND OF RECENT DECISION TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON NILITARY 
ITEMS FROZEN IN PIPELINE SINCE 1971. TO THIS END WOULD 
APPRECIATE HAVING BY MORNING APRIL 4 LOCAL TIME BREAKDOWN 
OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN FOR LAST 18 MONTHS AND 
MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN 
AND INDIA. 
 
3. IN ADDITION GIVEN SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES% S CLOSE RELATIONS WITH 
BHUTTO AND INFLUENCE ON PAK PRESIDENT, ARE TTHERE ANY 
POINTS REGARDING PAKISTAN WHICH DEPT OR ISLAMABAD THINK 
I COULD USEFULLY PUT TO SHAH FOR HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO. 
 
4. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED ZAHEDI%SINGLEQUOTES% S DESCRIPTION OF SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES% S 
CONCERNS, WE BELIEVE THIS TO REFLECT SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES% S WORRY OVER 
TREND OF EVENTS IN THIS AREA WHICH HE CONSIDERS HOSTILE 
TO IRANIAN INTERESTS AND HIS NEED FOR PERIODIC REASSURANCE 
THAT HE IS NOT ISOLATED, THAT HE CAN COUNT ON 
CONTINUED US INTEREST IN IRAN AND THAT ANY DETENTE 
ACHIEVED BETWEEN US AND USSR WILL NOT WORK TO IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES% S 
DISADVANTAGE. 
 
5. IF SUBJECT COMES UP I PROPOSE MAKE SAME POINTS AS 
DEPSEC RUSH MADE TO ZAHEDI AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE 
HAVE NOT AND WOULD NOT DISCUSS IRAN/ US RELATIONS WITH 
USSR WITHOUT IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES% S FULL KNOWLEDGE. 
 
6. FINALLY, AT APPROPRIATE TIME I SHALL MENTION 
PRESIDENT%SINGLEQUOTES% S DEEP INTEREST IN HAVING SHAH AND EMPRESS 
PAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO WASHINGTON DURING 1973.

1. MINISTRY OF INFORMATION ANNOUNCED OCTOBER 2 THE ARREST OF 
TWELVE PERSONS INCLUDING TWO WOMEN ON CHARGES OF PLOTTING TO 
KIDNAP OR KILL MEMBERS OF THE IMPERIAL FAMILY. ACCORDING TO 
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, GROUP, WHICH INCLUDED FILMMAKERS, CAMERAMEN

SUBJECT: SHAH ON CORRUPTION 
 
1. AFTER AMBASSADOR BYROADE%SINGLEQUOTES%S AUDIENCE WITH SHAH WAS 
FINISHED, I ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO DISCUSS WITH SHAH 
APPROACH OF SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO SWEDISH AMBASSADOR AND 
OTHERS ABOUT ALLEGED INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO 
GOI AS RESULT SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S RECENT DECREES ON CORRUPTION AND ON 
NEW REQUIREMENT THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IMMEDIATE 
SUBORDINATES DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ANY SHARES THEY HOLD IN 
ANY COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES. SHAH WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED 
TO LEARN THAT SOVIETS WERE CLAIMING TO NOTE INCREASED 
OPPOSITION AND ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ANYONE COULD IMAGINE 
SUCH A THING. WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS SOVIET PSYCHOLOGICAL 
WARFARE DESIGNED TO UNSETTLE THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
THE SHAH IMMEDIATELY TIED IT IN TO THE RECENT 
TUDEH PARTY/IRAQI COMMUNIST PROCLAMATION CRITICIZING GOI 
ACTIVITIES. SHAH IS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS ARE ATTEMPTING 
TO RECREATE TUDEH PARTY AND PUT MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING 
OF IRANIAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT. 
 
2. BEING PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSING, THE SHAH SAID, %QUOTES%PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO TOUGH 
ON CORRUPTION.%QUOTES% TO WHICH I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, %QUOTES%NO, SIR, 
YOU CANNOT BE TOO TOUGH ON CORRUPTION.%QUOTES% THERE THEN ENSUED 
A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN IRAN IN THE YEARS AHEAD 
IF CORRUPTION IS NOT STEMMED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
FLOATING AROUND IN THE ECONOMY. IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM 
THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE SHAH INDEED IS CONVINCED THAT HIS 
PROGRAM AND THE COUNTRY%SINGLEQUOTES%S FUTURE WILL GO RIGHT DOWNHILL 
IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE. 
 
3. WHEN THE SHAH MENTIONED HIS INSISTENCE THAT CERTAIN 
HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DIVEST THEMSELVES OF STOCKS 
AND HOLDINGS, I SAID, %QUOTES%WON%SINGLEQUOTES%T MANY OF THEM HAVE TO UNLOAD?%QUOTES% 
THE SHAH REPLIED, %QUOTES%A FEW, NOT ALL.%QUOTES%

E.O. 11652: GDS 
TAGS: PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH 
 
SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH 
MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE 
REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS 
OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. 
SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY 
BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED 
FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT 
CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. 
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS 
NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE 
IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED 
TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS 
THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO 
BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
1. SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S LENGTHY STATEMENT AT HIS MARCH 2 PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM 
WITH CORRESPONDENTS FOR FOREIGN MEDIA WERE EXCLUDED, (TEXT SENT BY 
AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL 
ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, 
AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER 
GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY 
GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER 
PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY%SINGLEQUOTES%S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR 
ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS 
WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER 
UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. 
 
2. SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY 
WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT 
OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES 
AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. 
SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE 
COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES 
UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES% GOALS. IN 
ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE 
SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW 
ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) 
MONARCHY, (2) IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) 
REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS 
WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO 
VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. 
BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE 
THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS 
UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. 
IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE 
IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL 
PARTICIPATION IN IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP 
IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION 
THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO 
ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. 
 
3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY 
SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM 
AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. 
AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN 
1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI 
MANSUR%SINGLEQUOTES%S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT 
TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY 
WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM 
MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH 
AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. 
AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES 
GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED 
OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS 
HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF 
MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY 
STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO 
APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS 
YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME 
REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED 
FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN 
IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC 
JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE 
FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. 
 
4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF 
QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE 
TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT 
JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO 
SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS 
OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY 
GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S DEVELOPMENT 
AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT 
SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY 
DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. 
 
5. SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND 
MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES 
WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY 
WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE 
PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL 
ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL 
PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM 
THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE 
WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING 
OUT SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S WISHES. 
 
6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO 
INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S IMAGE AS 
COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY%SINGLEQUOTES%S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD 
SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF 
COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR 
LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. 
 
7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION 
IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM 
DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN 
CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION 
OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS 
POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. 
 
8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, 
SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO 
OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM 
WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

SUBJ: SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISSIDENCE IN QOM 
 
1. IN MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS SORT FOR YEARS, 5 
DEMONSTRATORS WERE SHOT DEAD AND 9 INJURED WHEN POLICE 
OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY A POLICE 
STATION IN THE HIGHLY RELIGIOUS CITY OF QOM JAN 9. A 
POLICE OFFICE AND 3 POLICEMEN WERE INJURED BY THE 
DEMONSTRATORS AND ONE 13 YEAR BOY WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH 
IN THE STAMPEDE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHOOTING. 
 
2. INCIDENT OCCURRED ON ANNIVERSARY OF LAND REFORM 
LEGISLATION PASSED IN 1963. IT FOLLOWED A MUCH MILDER 
PROTEST BY STUDENTS OF RELIGION SHOUTING ANTI-NATIONAL 
SLOGANS ON JAN 7 THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF REZA SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
DECREE ABOLISHING THE VEIL FOR WOMEN. 
 
3. ON THE 9TH A MOB OF PROTESTORS ARMED WITH STONES, 
IRON BARS, AND WOODEN STAVES REPORTEDLY RAMPAGED THROUGH 
THE STREETS SMASHING WINDOWS OF SHOPS AND DESTROYING 
PREMISES OF REASTAKHIZ PARTY HEADQUARTERS. THEY THEN 
TRIED TO TAKE OVER A POLICE STATION, DAMAGING POLICE 
VEHICLES OUTSIDE. POLICE WARNINGS AND WARNING SHOTS INTO 
THE AIR WENT UNHEEDED, AND POLICE THEN FIRED INTO THE 
CROWD. 
 
4. INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 
BY PARS NEW AGENCY AFTERNOON JAN 10. SAME INFORMATION WAS 
GIVEN TO DCM BY COURT MINISTER HOVEYDA AT SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S DINNER 
THAT EVENING FOR VISITING CODE. 
 
5. COMMENT: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING ASCRIBED BY POLICE 
AUTHORITIES -- ACCURATELY WE BELIEVE -- TO CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS (THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY TO 
FOLLOWERS OF KHOMEINI OR TO ISLAMIC MARXISTS AS SUCH). 
THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, IN OUR RECOLLECTION, 
THAT POLICE HAVE KILLED SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS BY FIRING 
INTO A CROWD. SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO 
ARGUE AGAINST THOSE AMONG THE JOURNALISTS AND OTHER 
OBSERVERS HERE WHO HAVE SUSPECTED MANY RECENT INCIDENTS 
WERE COOKED UP BY IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES TO IMPRESS THE 
SHAH AND/OR USG. BY THE SAME TOKEN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT RELATIVE POLICE LENIENCY, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN 
LACK OF EFFECTIVE REACTION TO STUDENT DEMONSTRATION JAN 7, 
ENCOURAGED MORE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WHICH NECESSITATED 
VIOLENT REPRESSION TO PUT DOWN. AT LEAST IT IS CONCEIVABLE 
THAT THE MANY PROPONENTS OF THE MAILED FIST IN GOI 
ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT SO ARGUE TO THE SHAH AND PRIMIN 
AMOUZEGAR IN EFFORT TO REVERSE RELATIVE LIBERALIZATION OF 
RECENT MONTHS.

SUBJECT: FIRST CONVERSATION WITH NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT 
 
1. MUR MOHAMHAD TARAKI, THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S NEW 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND HE LIKES TO BE CALLED %QUOTES%MR. PRESIDENT,%QUOTES% 
RECEIVED ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE AT THE OLD PRIME MINISTRY BUILDING 
AT 5 P.M. ON MAY 6, I WAS RECEIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING 
BY THE SAME CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD SERVED THE 
PREVIOUS REGIME. AS AN INDICATION OF THE TIMES, THE DEPUTY CHIEF, 
WHO IS A MOHAMMADZAI, STARTED WEEPING WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY. IT WAS IN THIS MOOD THAT HE USHERED ME INTO HIS NEW CHIEF%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
OFFICE. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL, WITH ONLY ONE 
ARMORED VEHICLE VISIBLE IN THE COMPOUND OF THE PRIME MINISTRY. 
 
2. TABAKI GREETED ME WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE AND A FRIENDLY SMILE, 
DULY RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS. WE THEN SAT DOWN IN THE CORNER OF 
HIS OFFICE AND EXCHANGED A FEW PLEASANTRIES WHILE OUR PICTURES 
CONTINUED TO BE SNAPPED. I GOT A GOOD LAUGH FROM HIM WHEN I SAID I 
WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MET HIM DURING MY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN 
AFGHANISTAN -- AND EVEN SORRIER DURING THE PAST NINE DAYS. TARAKI 
SPOKE EXCELLENT, IF SOMEWHAT RUSTY, ENGLISH. 
 
3. TARAKI BEGAN HIS CONVERSATION BY RECOUNTING WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE 
AND RELISH THE SUCCESS OF HIS REVOLUTION, STRESSING THAT IT IS A 
REVOLUTION AND NOT A COUP. HE SAID ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, THE TANKS 
FIRST MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF KABUL ABOUT 9 A.M., BUT TOOK MORE 
THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH THE CENTER OF THE CITY. BY EVENING, THE 
DAOUD REGIME HAD LOST THE BATTLE, ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED IN VAIN 
DURING THE NIGHT TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS FROM CENTRAL CORPS 
HEADQUARTERS AND FROM KARGHA. WITH THE COMING OF DAYLIGHT, HE SAID, 
THE AIR FORCE WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE JOB. MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE 
PALACE DAOUD HAD BEEN ASKED TO SURRENDER, BUT REFUSED, SHOT AT HIS 
ATTACKERS, AS DID HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, AND WAS THEREFORE KILLED. 
THE INTENTION, SAID TARAKI, HAD BEEN TO TAKE HIM AS A CAPTIVE. 
TARAKI ADDED THAT DAOUD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT-MARTIALED 
AND POSSIBLY SHOT. TARAKI HAD YESTERDAY  
THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY DAOUD%SINGLEQUOTES%S %QUOTES%WHITE PISTOL%QUOTES%. 
 
4. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST 
AMBASSADOR TO CALL ON HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
IN AFGHANISTAN IS A %QUOTES%GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR 
THE PEOPLE.%QUOTES% CORRECTING HIMSELF A BIT, HE SAID HE HAD ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTION OF THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR BECAUSE PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN 
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON, CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY. 
 
5. I THEN EXPLAINED THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT EXTEND FORMAL 
RECOGNITION BUT INDICATE, AS WE HAVE DONE, THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. I SAID, IN FACT, WE HOPE TO HAVE CLOSE 
WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT. I ADDED, AS OUR NOTE 
STATED, THAT I HOPE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE SOON TO 
AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS. HE MAD NO 
COMMENT ON THAT SUGGESTION. 
 
6. AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THESE PRELIMINARY EXCHANGES, TARAKI 
REFERRED TO THE TIME HE HAD SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES, HIS 
FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICANS, AND HIS LIKING FOR THE AMERICAN QUALITY OF 
FRANKNESS. WE AGREED THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS HAVE LOTS IN COMMON 
IN THIS REGARD. 
 
7. I THEN STATED I WANTED TO BE FRANK WITH HIM. I SAID THAT, AS HE 
KNEW, THE UNITED STATES HAD NEVER SOUGHT ANY STRATEGIC OR POLITICAL 
ADVANTAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN. HE AGREED. I SAID THAT ONE OF THE CARDINAL 
POINTS OF OUR POLICY IS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE, 
ITS INTEGRITY, AND ITS NATIONAL IDENTITY. HE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. 
I SAID THAT SINCE THE BRITISH LEFT INDIA, IT WAS OUR VIEW THAT THE 
ONLY COUNTRY THAT COULD POSSIBLY THREATEN AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S INDEPENDENCE 
IS THE SOVIET UNION. IN PAST TIMES, I NOTED, OUR POLICY HAD BEEN TO 
TRY TO CONSTRUCT BLOCS AGAINST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM, BUT THAT OUR 
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM HAD, IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME MORE 
SOPHISTICATED. 
 
I STATED WE COULD READILY UNDERSTAND -- GIVEN AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND ECONOMIC NEEDS -- WHY IT WOULD WANT A CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION. BUT, I SAID, WE WOULD BE DISTURBED 
IF AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES WERE TO BECOME 
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
OBLITERATE AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S NATIONAL IDENTITY AND WOULD GIVE RISE TO 
TENSIONS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHICH COULD THREATEN PEACE. I SAID 
THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S NONALIGNED 
POLICY. 
 
8. IN RESPONSE, TARAKI AFFIRMED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AND DESIRES TO 
REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY AND MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY. HE SAID HE 
WAS PLEASED THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE VIEW OF THE 
WORLD AND ADMITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT MADE A MISTAKE IN VIETNAM. HE 
REFERRED TO HIS BEING IN WASHINGTON DURING THE DAYS OF SENATOR MCCARTHY, 
AND NOTED THAT THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT NIXON HAD REFUSED ONCE TO COME 
TO AN AFGHAN EMBASSY RECEPTION BECAUSE AFGHANISTAN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE 
SOVIET UNION. HE WAS PLEASED THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE APPROACH THE 
UNITED STATES TAKES TOWARD HIS COUNTRY. 
 
9. I THEN SAID THAT IN EVALUATING THE POLICIES OF A GOVERNMENT IN A 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOOK FIRST 
AND FOREMOST AT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF 
LIVING OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL. AT THIS POINT, TARAKI BECAME 
MUCH MORE ANIMATED AND HELD FORTH AT SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT OF HOW 
HIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HE 
AND HIS COLLEAGUES -- UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, REALLY CARE ABOUT THE 
POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN PUTTING MONEY IN 
SWISS BANKS. HE SAID THAT IN JUDGING HIS GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S POLICIES, WE 
SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN WHETHER THEY THINK THEY ARE 
SUCCESSFUL. IN THE PAST, HE BELIEVED FOREIGNERS TENDED TO ASK THE 
ARISTOCRATS WHO, OF COURSE, WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE POOR 
BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY WOULD THREATEN THEIR OWN PROSPERITY. REGARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS, TARAKI SAID THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND THAT 
EACH NATION MUST JUDGE FOR ITSELF THE KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE MOST 
SUITED TO ITS OWN SITUATION AND CULTURE. HE MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT 
HE WOULD NOT WANT US TO MAKE VALUE JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT 
TO INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I ASSURED HIM THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAD NO DESIRE TO TRY TO TRANSPLANT ITS GOVERNMENTAL 
SYSTEM ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WE, NEVERTHELESS, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS. 
 
10. TARAKI THEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD JUDGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS BY 
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED, BUT THAT HE 
WOULD BE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE AS, INDEED, HE WOULD BE ASKING THE 
SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HE SAID THAT THE PRINCIPAL SLOGAN, 
ADDING THAT HE REALLY MEANT POLICY AND NOT SLOGAN, OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS 
TO PROVIDE BREAD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER FOR THE MASSES. I DESCRIBED OUR 
AID PROGRAM OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS EMPHASIS ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND 
AGRICULTURE FOR THE RURAL POOR. HE SAID HE WOULD TELL ME, AS HE HAD 
TOLD THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR, THAT OUR RESPECTIVE AID PFORAMS HAD FAILED, 
AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMITMENT OF THE PREVIOUS 
REGIME. I SAID I AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR AID PROGRAM HAD NOT ACHIEVED 
ITS GOALS. HE ASKED ME WHY. I REPLIED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN COUNTRY 
BETTER THAN I, AND THAT I WOULD MERELY SAY THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT 
WAS NOT CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WE WISHED TO 
SEE IMPLEMENTED. HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MY SAYING THIS. 
 
11. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE 
MEANT BY %QUOTES%BREAD%QUOTES%. HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF 
AFGHANS WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY TO WORK IN IGNOMINY ABROAD. THIS WILL 
MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HE HOPED WE 
WOULD HELP WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE THE APPROPRIATE MINISTERS IN 
HIS GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS WITH US, MY AID 
MISSION DIRECTOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. 
 
12. I THEN SAID THAT ONE OTHER MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED 
STATES IS THE STABILITY OF THIS REGION IN THE WORLD. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN 
DELIGHTED AT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN 
DEVELOPING REGIONAL COOPERATION. TARAKI SAID THAT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, 
A MATTER THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE STUDYING. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN 
ONE TALKS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION, THAT MEANS NOT ONLY COOPERATION WITH 
INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND IRAN -- BUT ALSO WITH THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
13. THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITH PLEASANTRIES AS IT HAD BEGUN. HE SAID 
THAT HE HOPED THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE BUILT MORE 
MOSQUES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE HOPED WE WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE, 
HIMSELF, DID NOT GO TO A MOSQUE. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING 
HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD ALSO TOLD THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
14. COMMENT:  TARAKI IS A SLIM, WHITE-HAIRED, PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO LOOKS 
SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN 61. HE HAS THE CHAN AND EMPATHY THAT ONE LEARNS TO 
ASSOCIATE WITH AFGHANS. HE IS ALSO CLEARLY HARDHEADED AND EXHILARATED BY 
HIS SUCCESS. WHEN HE IS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A POINT HE IS 
MAKING, HIS EYES ASSUME A FIERCE, INTENSITY. OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND WAS ALSO, I THINK, A REAL DIALOGUE.

TAGS: PEPR, IR 
SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE 
EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND 
SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, 
HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING 
BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES 
THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL 
REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, 
BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES 
ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, 
WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF 
BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS 
COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. 
 
3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN 
PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE 
IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY 
WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL 
EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION 
WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS 
OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE%SINGLEQUOTES%S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION 
LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS 
DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY 
IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE 
PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY 
OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN 
CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED 
TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. 
 
4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, 
AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, 
IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN 
WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT 
HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH 
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES 
TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT 
SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED 
%QUOTES%BAZAAR MENTALITY%QUOTES% SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A 
MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN 
FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES 
PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER 
NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND 
HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH GTE. 
 
5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A 
GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS 
EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT 
AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT 
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE 
WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 
IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE 
INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING 
THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE 
PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION 
IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING 
IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN 
AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE%SINGLEQUOTES%S OWN 
ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. 
 
6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY 
SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. 
AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE 
IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN 
IN PLACE. %QUOTES%BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY 
WOULD GO BY MONDAY,%QUOTES% HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS 
THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS %QUOTES%90 PERCENT SOLVED,%QUOTES% BUT WHEN 
A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING 
HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS 
MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY ACTION AND RESULTS. 
 
6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE 
AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER 
AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. 
PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE 
INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS 
ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE 
EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY 
PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST 
YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? 
 
7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE 
WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: 
 
- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF 
THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL 
BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH 
SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION 
OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. 
 
- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY 
TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP 
BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH 
HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF 
THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED 
TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING 
RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING 
WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT 
LEAST TO THE LATTER. 
 
- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS 
OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND 
REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY 
COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. 
 
- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE 
SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS 
OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. 
 
- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL%SINGLEQUOTES%S SAKE 
IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL 
TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE 
TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE 
MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED 
ON BOTH SIDES. 
 
- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT 
OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT 
BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN 
NEGOTIATOR%SINGLEQUOTES%S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE 
IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL 
(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. THIS IS AN INFORMATION MESSAGE; NO ACTION REQUIRED. 
 
3. MFA DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA KOKSAL, HAS TOLD US THAT TURKS HAD HEARD IRANIANS WERE PLANNING TO LAUNCH NEW MILITARY ACTION AGAINST CONCENTRATION OF KURDISH REBELS IN AREA NEAR IRAQI BORDER.  WHILE FOR THE MOMENT SITUATION IN KURDISH AREA SEEMS CALM, REPORT SUGGESTED THAT TEST OF STRENGTH BETWEEN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND KURDISH OPPONENTS WAS LIMITED BUT THEY HAD THE IMPRESSION THE KURDS, DESPITE LACK OF POLITICAL UNITY AMONG THE VARIOUS GROUPS, HAD MANAGED TO AMASS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ARMS AND COULD POSE A CONSIDERABLE GUERRILLA THREAT TO THE IRANIAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FORCES. 
 
4. THE POSSIBILITY OF ARMED ACTION NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER ALSO RAISED THE QUESTION OF IRAQI RESPONSE.  SO FAR THE GOT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT GAME IRAQ WAS PLAYING VIS-A-VIS IRAN.  ON THE ONE HAND INSTABILITY IN THE REGION WAS AS UNHELPFUL TO IRAQ AS IT WAS TO ANYONE ELSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT POINTS OF FRICTION BETWEEN A REVOLUTIONARY IRAN AND IRAQ THAT THE LATTER MIGHT WELL WISH TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-KHOMEINI FORCES. 
 
5. REGARDING TIES BETWEEN IRANIAN KURDS AND OUTSIDE COUNTRIES, KOKSAL SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REPORTS, BUT NOT MUCH HARD EVIDENCE, OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE IRANIAN KURDS.  HE ASSUMED THAT OUTSIDE POWERS NOTWITHSTANDING PREDICTABLE DENIALS WOULD FEEL STRONG URGE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN KURDISH ACTIVITIES.  REGARDING LINKS BETWEEN TURKISH AND IRANIAN KURDS, KOKSAL EMPHASIZED THAT RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT TURKISH KURDS WERE PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ASSISTANCE WERE TOTAL JOURNALISTIC FABRICATIONS.  TO DATE, GOT DID NOT HAVE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL LINKAGE ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE KURDS IN IRAN WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON ATTITUDES OF TURKISH KURDS. 
 
6. BECAUSE OF THIS, AS WELL AS IN THE INTEREST OF REGIONAL STABILITY, TURKEY%SINGLEQUOTES%S OVERRIDING CONCERN WAS THAT IRAN MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND HAVE A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS REASON THE GOT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST AND APPROVAL CHARGE LAINGEN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RECENT STATEMENT AFFIRMING US SUPPORT FOR IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. 
 
7. COMMENT: WHILE NEW TO THE JOB, KOKSAL, FORMERLY WITH THE POLICY PLANNING STAF, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE OPEN THAN HIS PREDECESSORS IN DISCUSSING KURDISH QUESTION.

E.O. 12065: GES 9/17/95 (LIMBERT, JOHN) OR-P 
TAGS: PGOV, PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: PM BAZARGAN CRITICIZED 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, PM MEHDI BAZARGAN 
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF CRITICISMS FROM VARIOUS SIDES. HE HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI-CLERICALISM, OF INEFFECTIVENESS, AND OF 
GENERAL BUNGLING. BAZARGAN HAS ANSWERED THESE ATTACKS BY 
CLAIMING THAT THE SAME PERSONS WHO WERE CRITICIZING HIM ARE 
NOT ALLOWING HIS GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. DEPSITE THESE 
ATTACKS, IT APPEARS THAT BAZARGAN STILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT 
OF KHOMEINI AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) THE FIRST ATTACK ON BAZARGAN CAME FROM AYATOLLAH DR. 
MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS, 
MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH PARS NEW AGENCY IN QOM ON SEPTEMBER 14, DR. 
BEHESHTI BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND PM BAZARGAN FOR FAILING 
TO IMPLEMENT A BILL ON THE FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
ACCORDING TO BEHESHTI, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAD APPROVED A BILL CALLING FOR THE FORMATION OF 
COUNCILS AT PROVINCE, CITY, DISTRICT, AND VILLAGE LEVELS. 
BEHESHTI SAID DR. BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT 
THIS BILL, EITHER BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE PROCRASTINATION OR 
BECAUSE OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WEAKNESS. (DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER BANI-ASSADI TOLD CHARGE SEPT 17 THAT BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
OFFICE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL%SINGLEQUOTES%S BILL, HAD SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNCIL TELLING 
THEM THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED WAS UNREALISTIC BUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK OUT A FEASIBLE BILL ALONG THOSE LINES. 
 
3. (C) LATER THE SAME DAY, THE MONOTHEISM PARY (HEZB-E- 
TOWHIDI) ISSUED A SEVEN-POINT STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE 
BAZARGAN GOVERNMENT FOR NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE. LITTLE IS 
KNOWN ABOUT THE HEZB-E-TOWHIDI EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL GROUPING WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO AYATOLLAH SADEQ 
ROWHANI. THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED AT BAZARGAN INCLUDED: 
 
-  (A) GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE TO CRITICISMS OF IRAN IN THE 
FOREIGN PRESS, BOTH WESTERN AND NON-ALIGNED. 
 
-  (B) SEEKING POPULARITY BY PLAYING WITH WORDS AND BY 
OPPOSING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. %QUOTES%PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE IRANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IS LED BY 
THE CLERGY.%QUOTES% 
 
-  (C) DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL%SINGLEQUOTES%S BILL 
ON FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
 
-  (D) NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW AYATOLLAH ROWHANI%SINGLEQUOTES%S ADVICE ABOUT 
THE NECESSITY OF PURGING THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY 
ELEMENTS. 
 
4. (U) THESE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ATTACK ON 
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 BY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND COUNCIL 
OF EXPERTS MEMBER ABU-AL-HASAN BANI-SADR. SPEAKING TO AN 
AUDIENCE IN YAZD, BANI-SADR ATTACKED BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S ECONOMIC 
POLICIES AND ACCUSED HIM OF HINDERING THE WORK OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. BANI-SADR ALSO ACCUSED BAZARGAN OF: 
 
-  (A) REFUSING TO ACCEPT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 
 
-  (B) BUNGLING IN KURDESTAN AND THEN TRYING TO CLAIM CREDIT 
FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION THERE. 
 
-  (C) OPPOSING THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS, A FAVORITE 
PROGRAM OF BANI-SADR. 
 
-  (D) BURYING HIMSELF IN TRIVIA AND NOT ORGANIZING HIS WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
5. (U) IN AN ATTACK APPEARING IN THE ENGLISH AND PERSIAN- 
LANGUAGE PRESS OF SEPTEMBER 16, TEHRAN REVOLUTIONARY 
PROSECUTOR AYATOLLAH AHMAD AZARI-QOMI CRITICIZED BAZARGAN 
FOR ALLEGEDLY ANTI-CLERICAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
EULOGY FOR AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY ON 
SEPTEMBER 11. AZARI-QOMI (WHO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION FOR 
HEALTH REASONS) SAID THAT BAZARGAN HAD SAID THAT TALEGHANI, 
UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WAS NOT OPPOSED TO 
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. ACCUSING BAZARGAN 
 OF WEAKENING REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, AZARI-QOMI SAID, %QUOTES%IT IS 
VERY STRANGE THAT A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE AS MR. BAZARGAN WOULD 
MAKE AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLERGY. WAS IT NOT 
TALEGHANI%SINGLEQUOTES%S GOAL TO UNITE ALL GROUPS, THE FOREMOST OF WHICH 
WAS A COMMITTED AND ACTIVE CLERGY? HOW CAN HE (BAZARGAN) PRAISE 
TALEGHANI BY STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE CLERGY AND BY 
CONDEMNING THIS PROGRESSIVE AND ACTIVE GROUP AS REACTIONARY?%QUOTES% 
 
6. (C) LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS OF BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S SPEECH DID NOT 
INCLUDE THE STATEMENTS WHICH OFFENDED AZARI-QOMI. EMBASSY WILL 
CHECK FULL TEXT OF SPEECH (WHEN AVAILABLE) TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY 
WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAID. 
 
7. ALTHOUGH THE PRESS HAS BEEN GIVING WIDE PUBLICITY TO THESE 
ATTACKS, BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S REACTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED TO A 
STATEMENT AT AN ECONOMIC SEMINAR (REPORTED BY ETTELAAT OF 
SEPTEMBER 16) THAT THE SAME (UNNAMED PERSONS WHO WERE 
CRITICIZING HIS GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS WERE THE 
SAME ONES WHO WERE INTERFERING IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND 
PREVENTING HIS CABINET FROM OPERATING.) 
 
8. (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME (NOR WILL IT BE THE LAST 
TIME) THAT BAZARGAN HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. 
ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS COMING FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND FROM 
VARIOUS PERSONALITIES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF ANY CONCERTED 
ANTI-BAZARGAN CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE ENOUGH COMMON THEMESE IN THE 
CRITICISMS TO INDICATE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF HIS OPPONENTS. 
THESE THEMES INCLUDE: 
 
-  (A) IGNORING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. 
 
-  (B) IGNORING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. 
 
-  (C) GENERAL INEFFECTIVENESS AND BUNGLING. 
 
9. (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT NONE OF THESE ATTACKS 
MENTION AYYATOLLAH KHOMEINI BY NAME AND THAT NONE OF THE 
ATTACKERS NOTE ANY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR HIM. IN PREVIOUS 
DISAGREEMENTS OF THIS KIND, BAZARGAN HAS HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT 
FROM THE IMAM TO OVERCOME CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL. IT IS LIKELY 
THAT AS LONG AS BAZARGAN CONTINUES TO HAVE KHOMEINI%SINGLEQUOTES%S SUPPORT 
(AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HIS LOSING IT) HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
SURVIVE SUCH ATTACKS. BAZARGAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S SURVIVAL, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY 
TO MAKE HIS GOVERNMENT ANY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THOSE 
WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER MOST OF HIS FUNCTIONS.

SUBJECT: MODERATION:  DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE? 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. SUMMARY:  THE MODERATE IRANIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH 
WERE ACTIVE DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WHICH HAVE A 
LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH, HAVE BEEN PUSHED INTO 
THE BACKGROUND BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO FOLLOW A 
NARROW AND AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WITHIN THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS, MODERATE GROUPS WHO FAVOR A MORE BALANCED 
SOCIETY RESEMBLING A WESTERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, HAVE BECOME 
MORE VOCAL. WHILE NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZING AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, 
THEY HAVE FOCUSED THEIR CRITICISM ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS 
FAILURES OF THE PRESENT REGIME. THE POLITICAL POSITION OF 
THESE GROUPS IS STILL PRECARIOUS. IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH 
A FEW SECULAR SPOKESMEN, SOME LIBERAL CLERICS, AND SOME SMALL 
NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH STILL NOT A MAJOR FORCE ON THE IRANIAN 
POLITICAL SCENE, THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE 
THEMSELVES ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IDEAS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE 
RULING ESTABLISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE ROLE OF SECULAR AND CLERICAL MODERATES -- THE HEIRS IS 
STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE. SINCE THE REVOLUTION FIGURES SUCH AS 
MATIN-DAFTARI NAZIH, FORUHAR, SANJABI, AND BAZARGAN HIMSELF 
HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY KHOMEINI AND BY HIS ALLIES WHO SHARE 
HIS VISION OF A THEOCRATIC IRAN. NOT ALL OF THESE SUPPORTERS 
OF KHOMEINI ARE CLERICS; THEY INCLUDE THE %QUOTES%SECULAR MULLAHS%QUOTES% 
SUCH AS QOTEZADEH, YAZDI, CHAMRAN, TABATABA%SINGLEQUOTES%I AND OTHERS. THIS 
GROUP HAS DOMINATED THE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESS, THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS. IT HAS 
HARRASSED AND IGNORED ITS OPPONENTS. BARZARGAN REMAINS 
POWERLESS; MATIN-DAFTARI AND NAZIH ARE IN HIDING; FORUHAR IS 
IGNORED; AND SAXJABI QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
4. ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE MODERATE PARTIES IS STILL VERY 
FRAGILE, IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF LIFE. 
ALTHOUGH THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS, INCLUDING THE NEWSPAPER 
AYANDEGAN AND THE POPULAR HUMOR MAGAZINE AHANGAR, WERE 
SUPPRESSED IN AUGUST, THEY HAVE BEGUN PUBLISHING SMALL PAPERS 
SUCH AS KHALO-E-MOSALMAN (FROM THE MUSLIME REPUBLICAN PEOPLES%SINGLEQUOTES% 
PARTY); JONBESH (PUBLISHED BY ALI ASGHAR HAJ SEYYID JAVADI), 
JFBHEH-YE-AZADI FROM THE IRAN PARTY AND AZADI FROM THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT. ALTHOUGH THE CIRCULATION OF THESE 
PAPERS IS LIMITED AND THEY CARRY MUCH LESS INFLUENCE THAN THE 
THREE MAJOR DAILIES (SAYHAN, ETTELAAT, AND BAMDAD) THEY DO 
OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON EVENT -- A 
COMMENTARY OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL VERSION. 
 
5. FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE MUSLIM REPUBLICAN PEOPLES PARTY 
(MPRP) HAS ORGANIZED FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETINGS AT ITS TEHRAN 
HEADQUARTERS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST MEETING ATTRACTED ONLY ABOUT 
100 PEOPLE, EMBASSY POLITICAL OFFICER AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT 
ATTENDED OCTOBER 19 MEETING AND FOUND AN OVERFLOW OF OVER 1500. 
THE CROWD WAS LARGELY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WELL-EDUCATED. THERE 
WERE MANY WOMEN, SOME VEILED, A FEW CLERICS. THE SPEAKERS 
INCLUDED AHMAD ALIZADRH, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MPRP, 
AND KAHMATULLAH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE%SINGLEQUOTES%I, LEADER OF THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE AND SPEAKERS HAD NO AFFECTION 
FOR THE OLD REGIME, THERE WERE FEW MENTIONS OF AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI, AND NO ANTI-AMERICAN STATEMENTS. 
 
6. THE SPEAKERS ELICITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE BY THEIR 
ATTACKS ON AKHUNDBAZI (CLERICAL MEDDLING), ON THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS, AND ON ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEOCRATIC 
DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIM. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 
FOUND THE CROWD%SINGLEQUOTES%S PULSE WHEN HE SAID, %QUOTES%WE WANT THE ISLAM OF DR. 
SHAR%SINGLEQUOTES%IATI; WE DON%SINGLEQUOTES%T WANT THE ISLAM OF ........)%QUOTES% AND LEFT THE 
END EMPTY FOR THE CROWD TO FILL IN. BOTH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE%SINGLEQUOTES%I 
AND ALIZADEH WERE CRITICAL OF THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH. THE LATTER 
SAID, %QUOTES%THIS CLAUSE IS AN ACT OF TREASON AGAINST FUTURE 
GENERATIONS OF IRANIAN PEOPLE. WE HAD A REVOLUTION NOT TO 
PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF DESPOTISM.%QUOTES% sPEAKING 
PRIVATELY AFTER THE MEETING, MOQOADAM-MARAGHE%SINGLEQUOTES%I SAID THAT EVEN 
THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP HAS NOW REALIZED THAT IT WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO SELL THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE IN ITS 
PRESENT FORM. %QUOTES%THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN 
DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT WILL 
BE POSSIBLE.%QUOTES% 
 
7. THE MODERATES, IN CRITICISING VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, HAVE FOUND 
SOME ALLIES AMONG CLERICS SUCH AS AYATOLLAHS NURI AND SHARI%SINGLEQUOTES%AT- 
MADARI WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IF NOT 
PROPERLY DEFINED, COULD LEAD TO A DICTATORSHIP. ONE OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE ENTRANCE OF 
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI%SINGLEQUOTES%S SON, HOJJAT AL-ISLAM AHMAD KHOMEINI, INTO 
THE DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT. IN THESE DEBATES, THE YOUNG 
KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN A POSITION WHICH HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE 
MODERATE VIEW THAT VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, AS DEFINED BY THE 
CONSTITUTION, CONTAINS SOME DANGEROUS AMBIGUITIES. EMBASSY WILL 
DISCUSS THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE. 
 
8. IN PART, RECENT OUTSPOKENNESS OF THE MODERATES CAN BE 
ATTRIBUTED TO DISILLUSION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE REVOLUTION -- 
ESPECIALLY TRENDS TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN, CLERICAL RULE. THE 
MODERATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S OBVIOUS 
MISHANDLING OF CERTAIN ISSUES TO ATTRACT ALLIES BEYOND THE 
NORMALLY MINISCULE CONTITUENCY OF GROUPS SUCH AS THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT, THE IRAN PARTY, AND TEH NATIONAL FRONT. FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE OBVIOUS FAILURE OF A MILITARY POLICY IN KURDESTAN HAS 
BROUGHT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION, EVEN BY FIGURES WITHIN THE 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. A COLUMNIST IN THE NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES HAS URGED THE WITHDRAWAL OF NON- 
KURDISH GUARDS FROM THE REGION; THE TUDEH PARTY PAPER MARDOM, 
STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS OF SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KURDESTAN, HAS 
CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. ONLY THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMIC 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THROUGH ITS ORGAN JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI, HAS 
CONTINUED TO REFER TO THE KURDISH INSURGENTS AS %QUOTES%AMERICAN 
MERCENARIES%QUOTES%. HOWEVER, THE IRP HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
IN ITS POSITION. 
 
9. THE GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S FAILURE TO ENSURE PERSONAL SECURITY, ITS 
CRUDE ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND SCANDALS INVOLVING THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COURT SYSTEM -- LARGE-SCALE BRIBERY AND THEFT 
INVOLVING NO LESS A FIGURE THAN FORMER TEHRAN PROSECUTOR 
AYATOLLAH AZARI-QOMI HIMSELF -- HAS ALSO WIDENED THE APPEAL OF 
THE MODERATE MESSAGE. THE PAPER AZADI OF OCTOBER 18 PRINTED A 
BITTER ATTACK ON THE REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCUSING IT 
OF IGNORING THEFTS BY ILYAVI, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PROSECUTOR- 
GENERAL HADAVI, WHILE SENDING PROSTITUTES AND SMALL-TIME DRUG 
SMUGGLERS TO THE FIRING SQUAD. THE RECENT ATTACK ON TWO 
JOURNALISTS AT THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS BUILDING LED THE ULTRA- 
ESTABLISHMENT PAPER ETTELAAT OF OCTOBER 22 TO WRITE A STRONG 
FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL ENTITLED %QUOTES%LET US NOT REPEAT MISTAKES%QUOTES%, 
POINTING OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF QOM AND TABRIZ REBELLED IN THE 
SHAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S TIME BECAUSE FOR DECADES THEY HAD BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
 
10. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS ADD UP TO? MOST IMPORTANT, THE 
MODERATES OF THE IRAN PARTY, THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND OTHER 
GROUPS ARE ONCE AGAIN FINDING THEIR VOICE AND BEGINNING TO SPEAK 
OUT. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME SEVERAL MAJOR 
OBSTACLES: 
 
-   A) THE MEDIA REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART IN THE HANDS OF THEIR 
OPPONENTS. JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI BECOMES MORE RABID BY THE DAY, AND 
THE OTHER MAJOR PAPERS ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. THE RADIO AND THE 
TELEVISION, UNDER QOTEZADEH%SINGLEQUOTES%S OPPORTUNISTIC AND UNENLIGHTENED 
GUIDANCE, RARELY DEVIATES FROM ITS DAILY MENU OF PSEUDO- 
RELIGIOUS DRIVEL INTERSPERSED WITH PSEUDO-REVOLUTIONARY DRIVEL. 
 
-   B) ALL INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY KHOMEINI%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
DENUNCIATIONS. HIS FAMOUS AUGUST DECLARATION THAT %QUOTES%WE DO NOT WANT 
INTELLECTUALS%QUOTES% IS STILL REMEMBERED. HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST WESTERN 
DECADENCE HAVE MADE ALL WESTERN MANIFESTATIONS, INCLUDING 
NICETIES, SUSPECT IN HIS FOLLOWERS%SINGLEQUOTES% EYES. 
 
11. THESE MODERATE GROUPS STILL LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE ON 
THE FRINGES OF IRANIAN POLITICAL LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY 
ARE LEFT ALONE TO HOLD THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLISH THEIR 
NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS. HOWEVER, IN HIS MOST RECENT SPEECHES, KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN 
NOTE OF THEM AND HAS CRITICIZED THEM HARSHLY FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON 
VELAYAT-E-FAQIH AND ON THE CLERGY. IN A SPEECH TO TEHRAN RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ON OCTOBER 20, KHOMEINI REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MPRP 
MEETING, SAYING, %QUOTES%RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, ONE OF THESE 
MISGUIDED ONES, WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM, SUGGESTED THAT THE 
COUNCIL OF EXPERTS SHOULD BE DISSOLVED. AND THE REST CHEERED... 
YOU, WHO DID NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING (FOR THE COUNCIL) 
HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THIS... IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO GAVE 
YOU (OPPONENTS OF VELAYATI-E-FAQIH) THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU WERE IN HIDING WHEN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
WERE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SHAH AND HIS FATHER. NOW YOU WANT TO 
DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY?... YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. I 
WILL SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH. STOP THIS AND JOIN THE RANKS OF ISLAM 
AND LET THIS COUNTRY PUT ITSELF IN ORDER.%QUOTES% 
 
12. KHOMEINI%SINGLEQUOTES%S ATTACKS ON THIS GROUP ARE STILL ONLY WORDS AND ARE 
UNLIKELY TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-OUT REPRESSION INVOLVING THE 
CLOSING OF NEWSPAPERS, THE BANNING OF MEETINGS, AND THE ARREST OF 
LEADERSHIP. MANY OF THESE GROUPS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVE 
DISTINGUISHED RECORDS OF OPPOSITION TO THE MONARCHY - RECORDS WHICH 
ARE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE. HOWEVER, THE HARD-LINE CLERGY AND ITS 
ALLIES HAVE BEEN ISOLATING AND ATTACKING INDIVIDUAL TARGETS FROM 
AMONG THE MODERATES SUCH AS ??AZIH, METEN-DAFTARI, AND FORUHAR. 
 
13. AS THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO MISHANDLE MATTERS SUCH AS ARAB- 
IRANIAN RELATIONS, PROVINICIAL AFFAIRS, AND REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE, 
THE MESSAGE OF THESE MODERATE GROUPS COULD ATTRACT A WIDER 
FOLLOWING. PERHAPS THEY COULD FORCE SOME CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO 
DO NOT SHARE THE IMAM%SINGLEQUOTES%S VISION OF AN IRAN RULED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE TEACHINGS OF THAT SPECIALIZED VIEW OF ISLAM HELD BY ONE SECTOR 
OF A MINORITY SECT OF THAT RELIGION. 
 
14. IN THE LONGER TERM, IF THESE GROUPS CAN PRESERVE SOME 
COHERENCE THEY MAY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CLERICAL MONOPOLY 
OF POWER IN POST-KHOMEINI IRAN. AT THAT TIME THEIR REVOLUTIONARY 
CREDENTIALS MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT; BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
FUTURE, THIS GROUP WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE PERIPHERY OF 
IRANIAN POLITICS -- ARTICULATE, INTERESTING, BUT WIELDING LITTLE 
REAL POWER.

QUESTION USG CALCULATION OF GOJ QUOTA UNDER %QUOTES%PAST

END SUMMARY. 
- 
2.  (C) ON JANUARY 8, REGFISHATT MET WITH SUSUMU 
AKIYAMA AND KENRO IINO, DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
RESPECTIVELY OF THE FISHERY DIVISION OF THE ECONOMIC 
AFFAIRS BUREAU OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA), 
AND DELIVERED A COPY OF THE FIVE TALKING POINTS 
GIVEN IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  BOTH INDICATED THE 
TALKING POINTS WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER WITHIN 
MOFA AND WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FISHERY AGENCY OF 
JAPAN (FAJ).  IINO NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT FAJ 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSULTATIONS REGARDING THE WHALING ISSUE WITH USG 
OFFICIALS.  AKIYAMA STATED THAT %QUOTES%NO DECISION HAS 
BEEN MADE%QUOTES% IN GOJ REGARDING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF 
WHALES TO BE HARVESTED IN THE ANTARCTIC BY THE 
JAPANESE FLEET THIS SEASON.  HE MENTIONED THREE 
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING AN %QUOTES%APPROPRIATE%QUOTES% 
HARVEST AS FOLLOWS: 
- 
(A) THE MOST RECENT HARVEST LEVELS SET BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) THAT HAD 
BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOJ (I.E., THE 1984 SEASON OVERALL 
QUOTA OF 3,027); 
- 
(B) CONSULTATIONS WITH CONCERNED COUNTRIES; AND 
- 
(C) THE FINDINGS OF THE IWC SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
AT THE 1984 IWC MEETING. 
- 
HE FURTHER MENTIONED HIS %QUOTES%PERSONAL VIEW%QUOTES% THAT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF THE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE THOSE 
WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT GOJ WOULD OFFICIALLY 
RESPOND LATER TO THE U.S. BELIEF THAT %QUOTES%THERE IS NO 
NEED FOR CONSULTATIONS.%QUOTES%  AKIYAMA ALSO POINTED OUT 
THAT JAPAN HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING AN UNLIMITED 
NUMBER OF WHALES EVEN THOUGH THE FILING OF AN 
OBJECTION WITH THE IWC MEANS GOJ IS NOT BOUND TO 
ANY SPECIFIC QUOTA. 
- 
3.  (C) AKIYAMA SAID THAT GOJ AND THE SOVIET UNION 
HAVE EXCHANGED %QUOTES%EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION%QUOTES% TO CONDUCT 
THIS SEASON%SINGLEQUOTES%S WHALING FOR MINKE WHALES IN THE 
ANTARCTIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL CATCH WILL NOT 
EXCEED LAST SEASON%SINGLEQUOTES%S HARVEST LEVELS OF 3,027 WHALES 
FOR JAPAN AND 3,028 WHALES FOR THE SOVIET UNION. 
AKIYAMA NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF INTENTIONS WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION CORRESPONDED TO THE ARRANGEMENT 
REACHED BETWEEN THE USSR, GOJ, AND BRAZIL 
REGARDING LAST SEASON%SINGLEQUOTES%S ANTARCTIC HARVEST, A 
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE IWC SECRETARIAT. 
- 
4.  (C) SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 
THE TALKING POINTS: 
- 
(A) IINO REFERRED TO THE LAST TALKING POINT, AND 
POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE ESTABLISHES A 1984/85 
HARVEST OF 342 WHALES FOR BRAZIL INSTEAD OF THE 
376 USED BY THE USG.  AKIYAMA THOUGHT THAT THE 376 
FIGURE PROBABLY INCLUDES THE TEN PERCENT IWC 
MARGIN OF ERROR THAT IS ALLOWED FOR WHALING IN 
AREA II, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE 
OF THE USSR/GOJ/BRAZIL AGREEMENTS HAS  BEEN NOT 
TO PROVIDE FOR ANY MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE 
HARVEST IN AREA II.  THUS, IN THE 1983/84 SEASON 
THE FIVE PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR ALLOWED BY THE 
IWC FOR AREA II WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A BRAZILIAN 
HARVEST OF 630 MINKE WHALES, BUT THE GOJ/USSR/BRAZIL 
ARRANGEMENT LIMITED BRAZIL%SINGLEQUOTES%S HARVEST TO 600 WHALES. 
SIMILARLY, FOR THE 1984/85 SEASON, BRAZIL WILL 
HARVEST 342 WHALES IN AREA II, NOT 342 PLUS TEN PERCENT, 
OR 376 WHALES.  ACCORDINGLY, GOJ%SINGLEQUOTES%S QUOTA UNDER THE 
IWC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE 1,941 MINKE WHALES, NOT 
1,924. AKIYAMA AND IINO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THE 
USG REALIZED THAT A %QUOTES%PAST PRACTICE%QUOTES% CALUCATIONS 
WOULD ALLOW GOJ A HARVEST QUOTA OF 1,941 FOR THIS 
SEASON. 
 
(B) THE FISHERY DIVISION OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED FOR 
USG CLARIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE IN THE SECOND 
TALKING POINT TO THE NOVEMBER 13, 1984, LETTER OF THE 
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE REGARDING THE PHRASE %QUOTES%IN 
EXCESS OF THE 1984/85 QUOTA FOR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE 
MINKE WHALES.%QUOTES%  IN PARTICULAR, GOJ WANTS TO KNOW IF 
GOJ IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF CERTIFICATION UNDER 
THE PACKWOOD AMENDMENT TO THE MAGNUSON FISHERY 
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT (MFCMA) IF GOJ 
HARVESTS FOR ANTARCTIC MINKE WHALES DO NOT EXCEED 
A CEILING OF 1,924 (OR 1,941) WHALES.  FURTHER 
ELABORATION ON THE SAME QUESTION WAS RAISED 
WITH THE COMMENT THAT USSR AND GOJ WHALERS BOTH 
OPERATE IN AREAS 4 AND 6 BUT ONLY GOJ OPERATIONS 
OCCUR IN AREA 5.  AS A RESULT, AKIYAMA AND IINO 
WONDERED IF THE TALKING POINTS WERE ONLY REFERRING TO 
AN OVERALL ANTARCTIC QUOTA FOR GOJ OF 
1,924 (OR 1,941) OR WHETHER THE QUOTA FOR EACH 
AREA WOULD BE EXAMINED IN ANY USG EVALUATION OF 
WHETHER MINKE CATCH LIMITS ARE BEING EXCEEDED THIS 
SEASON. 
- 
5.  (U) REGARDING REFTEL%SINGLEQUOTES%S PARA 5, AKIYAMA 
CONFIRMED THAT 106 SPERM WHALES, ALL MALES, 
HAD BEEN HARVESTED BY THE JAPANESE COASTAL 
WHALING FLEET THROUGH JANUARY 7.

SUBJECT: ANGOLANS IN SADF SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF, 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES, SOUGHT REFUGEE STATUS IN BOTSWANA AND 
APPLIED FOR THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  AFTER MEETING WITH 
EMBOFFS, THE MEN WERE SENT TO THE LOCAL UNHCR OFFICIALS TO 
REGISTER AS REFUGEES.  PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THEIR APPLI- 
CATIONS FOR REFUGEE STATUS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF%SINGLEQUOTES%S 32ND- 
BATTALION %QUOTES%BUFFALO COMPANY,%QUOTES% CAME TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING REFUGEE 
STATUS AND INQUIRING ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
(SEPTEL).  THE TWO FAMILIES TOTAL 15 PEOPLE. 
 
4.  THE MEN, JOAO FAUSTINO SALES AND LASERU NHUKWETE, CLAIMED 
THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA IN THE 
DEBACLE OF 1976, SALES FROM SA DA BANDIERA (NOW LUBANGO) AND 
NHUKWETE FROM LUIMBALE (NEAR HUAMBO).  BOTH MEN SUPPORTED FNLA, 
SALES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AND GUNS FOR THE 
FNLA. 
 
5.  FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE FAMILIES REPORTEDLY LIVED IN AN 
ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP NEAR RUNDU ON THE ANGOLAN-NAMIBIAN BORDER; 
ANOTHER ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP WAS LOCATED FURTHER EAST IN THE 
CAPRIVI.  IN 1978, THE SOUTH AFRICANS GAVE THE REFUGEES TWO OPTIONS: 
THEY COULD JOIN THE SADF, OR BE RETURNED TO ANGOLA.  THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS WERE TO BE DESTROYED.  SALES AND NHUKWETE JOINED 
THE SADF AND ENDED UP AS TEACHERS FOR ANGOLAN CHILDREN OF OTHER 
RECRUITS.  SALES TAUGHT PORTUGUESE AND NHUKWETE SCIENCE.  SALES 
HELD RANK OF LANCE CORPORAL AND NHUKWETE CORPORAL. 
6.  ACCORDING TO SALES AND NHUKWETE, THE 32ND BATTALION IS 
COMPOSED COMPLETELY OF ANGOLANS, UNTIL 1978 ALL FNLA SUPPORTERS. 
SINCE THEN, A NUMBER OF UNITA SUPPORTERS AND %QUOTES%APOLITICAL%QUOTES% 
ANGOLANS HAVE ALSO JOINED THE 32ND.  WHILE THE ENLISTED MEN ARE 
BLACK ANGOLANS, THE OFFICERS ARE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO ARE 
EORCED TO LEARN PORTUGESE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE.  (SALES AND 
NHUKWETE SPOKE PASSABLE ENGLISH, BUT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE 
TALKING IN PORTUGUESE WITH THE EMBASSY%SINGLEQUOTES%S REFUGEE OFFICER.) 
 
7.  IN NOVEMBER 1983, THE MEN SAID THAT %QUOTES%SOUTH AFRICAN 
INTELLIGENCE%QUOTES% OFFICERS ENCOURAGED THE FOUNDING IN WINDHOEK OF A 
GROUP CALLED %QUOTES%THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANGOLANS IN 
SOUTH WEST AFRICA.%QUOTES%  THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OR NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGEDLY TIMOTYO VICTOR, A UNITA 
SYMPATHIZER.  THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS INTRODUCED TO THE 
ANGOLANS AT RUNDU BY A COL. VILJOEN (WHOSE NICKNAME IS 
%QUOTES%FANAKOLO,%QUOTES% THE NAME GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SOUTH AFRICAN 
MINES, SINCE VILJOEN ALLEGEDLY WORKED IN THE MINES BEFORE JOINING 
THE SADF).  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUNDU BRANCH IS JOAO APOLINARIO 
WHILE NHUKWERE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND SALES SECRETARY. 
ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE SPEECH GIVEN BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER (EMBASSY HAS ENGLISH COPY WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO 
AF/S), THE PURPOSE OF THE REORGANIZATION IS %QUOTES%TO PROMOTE 
FRIENDLY CULTURAL TIES AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE ANGOLAN COMMUNITY

SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN CHURCHES BOMBED IN TRIPOLI 
 
1.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS AGAINST 
CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS IN TRIPOLI DURING THE 
PERIOD JANUARY 8-9.  TWO CHURCHES, MARONITE AND 
GREEK ORTHODOX, WERE BOMBED ON TUESDAY, CAUSING 
SERIOUS DAMAGE, WHILE ANOTHER GREEK ORTHODOX 
CHURCH AND AN EVANGELICAL INSTITUTION WERE DAMAGED 
IN ATTACKS WEDNESDAY.  A CHRISTIAN CEMETARY WAS 
ALSO BOMBED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
 
2.  (U)  ISLAMIC UNIFICATION MOVEMENT (TAWHIID) 
HAS ISSUED TWO CONSECUTIVE CONDEMNATIONS OF THE 
ATTACKS, NOTING THAT TRIPOLI HAS TRADITIONALLY 
BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS UNITY, AND DEPLORING 
EFFORTS %QUOTES%TO FRIGHTEN THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE 
CITY.%QUOTES%  WEEKLY MEETING OF ISLAMIC DAR AL-FATWA 
WEDNESDAY ALSO CONDEMNED THE BOMBINGS, AS DID 
BRIG. OTHMAN OTHMAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES DURING A VISIT TO 
TRIPOLI WEDNESDAY. 
 
3.  (C)  CHRISTIAN NOTABLE AND LEBANESE FORCES 
CHARTER MEMBER, CHARLES MALIK, TOLD POLOFF THAT 
FOUR CHRISTIANS HAVE, AS WELL, BEEN MURDERED ON 
ROADS NEAR TRIPOLI, AND THAT CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS 
OF AREA FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES.  HE SAID THAT 
%QUOTES%LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY%QUOTES% IS THINKING OF 
PREPARING A DEMARCHE TO STATE DEPARTMENT ON 
TRIPOLI VIOLENCE. 
 
4.  COMMENT (C):  AS ALWAYS IN BEIRUT, LIST OF 
POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF THESE ATTACKS IS A LONG 
ONE, BEGINNING WITH TAWHIID ITSELF.  MANY 
OBSERVERS ATTRIBUTE BOMBINGS, WHICH COME SOON 
AFTER RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF LAF INTO TRIPOLI 
AS PART OF NORTHERN SECURITY PLAN, AS EFFORT 
TO EMBARASS GOL (WHILE AT SAME TIME INTIMIDATING 
CHRISTIANS).  ELABORATING ON THIS HYPOTHESIS, 
CHRISTIAN LEBANESE EMBASSY EMPLOYEE FROM KOURA 
REGION HAS TOLD US THAT MUCH BLAME IS BEING LAID 
AT FEET OF STILL-ACTIVE COMMUNISTS IN TRIPOLI, 
WITH RATIONALE BEING THAT LATTER ARE TRYING TO 
DISRUPT SECURITY PLAN THERE AND PLACE THE BLAME 
ON TAWHIID %QUOTES%PRINCE%QUOTES% SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN, WHO RECENTLY 
BOASTED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT THE COMMUNISTS 
HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN TRIPOLI.  A SIMILAR ARGUMENT, 
HOWEVER, COULD BE MADE THAT TAWIID%SINGLEQUOTES%S MAIN RIVAL 
IN TRIPOLI, THE ARAB DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS 
BEHIND BOMBINGS.

DESTROYED HIS CAR LAST MONTH, HE IS CERTAIN THAT 
LAST NIGHTS ABORTED EXPLOSION WAS IMED AT HIM. 
HE SAID THAT CHARGE WAS PLACED DIRECTLY UNDER THE

NOW MAKING PLANS TO MOVE HIS FAMILY INTO THE EAST 
WHERE IT IS SAFE. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  LEBANESE PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE 
INEVITABLY ACCUSED ISRAEL OF BEING BEHIND BLASTS, 
WHILE THE SYRIAN BA%SINGLEQUOTES%ATH PARTY HAS SINGLED OUT 
PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS.  JOURNALISTS RESIDENT IN

ABITUN, WHICH THEY SAY IS RETURNING TO THE AREA IN 
FORCE AND REINVIGORATING THE OLD MURABITUN-PSP FEUD, 
OR HIZBALLAH,SIGNS OF WHOSE PRESENCE THEY SAY ARE 
INCREASINGLY DAILY.  IN THIS REGARD, U.S. JOURNALISTS 
DESCRIBED THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN WEST BEIRUT AS 
HAVING SUNK TO TRULY HOBBESIAN LEVELS OF NASTINESS 
IN LAST MONTH, WITH THE COMBINATION OF CAR BOMBS 
AND ARMED ROBBERIES KEEPING MQST PEOPLE LOCKED

1.  ON JANUARY 14 A DISSIDENT COLUMN OF FARC GUERRILLAS 
ATTACKED A COLOMBIAN NAVY BOAT ON PATROL IN THE 
MAGDALENA RIVER, SOUTH OF BARRANCABERMEJA IN 
SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, 
THREE MARINES WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED. 
THE NAVY BOAT WAS FIRED UPON BY APPROXIMATELY 20

1.  ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICIES: 
- 
2.  RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE:  SOMALIA IS A LARGE, 
SPARSELY SETTLED COUNTRY OF 5 MILLION PEOPLE, WHOSE 
MAJOR RESOURCES ARE ITS LAND AND LOCATION.  SITUATED 
ADJACENT TO THE MARKETS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND 
WITHIN EASY SHIPPING RANGE OF EUROPE, SOMALIA POSSESSES 
A LAND AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 64 MILLION HECTARES. 
OF THIS, ABOUT 8.2 MILLION HECTARES ARE ARABLE, BUT, 
WITH WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LABOR LIMITING FACTORS 
ONLY ABOUT 900,000 HECTARES ARE UNDER CULTIVATION.  OF 
THE REMAINING LAND, ABOUT 60 PERCENT IS SUTIABLE FOR 
GRAZING WITH THE BALANCE WASTE.  ITS FISHING POTENTIAL 
AND MINERAL RESOURCES REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN AND UN- 
EXPLOITED, THOUGH SIX FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES ARE 
CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN SURVEYS AND EXPLORATION.  THE 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE  BASE IS WEAK, WITH ONLY TWO 
MAJOR URBAN CENTERS (MOGADISHU AND HARGEISA), THREE 
DEEPWATER PORTS (MOGADISHU, KISMAYO AND BERBERA), A 
POORLY DEVELOPED INTERNAL ROAD NETWORK, AND NO RAILROAD. 
PUBLIC UTILITY, EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE 
LARGELY CONFINED TO THE MAJOR CITIES.  THE HUMAN 
RESOURCE BASE IS ALSO WEAK, WITH MANAGERIAL AND 
TECHNICAL SKILLS PARTICULARLY SCARCE. 
- 
3. STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY:  THE ECONOMY IS DOMINATED 
BY THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, AND WITHIN AGRICULTURE BY 
LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION.  OVERALL GDP (AT CURRENT MARKET 
PRICES) WAS ABOUT US DOLS 1.3 BILLION IN 1983; WITH A 
POPULATION (INCLUDING REFUGEES) OF 5 MILLION, PER 
CAPITA GDP WAS ABOUT US DOLS 260.  LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION 
NORMALLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 38 PERCENT OF GDP; 50-60 
PERCENT OF TOTAL EMPLOYMENT AND 80 PERCENT OF EXPORT 
EARNINGS.  CROP PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 7-10 
PERCENT OF GDP, WITH BANANAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT EXPORT 
CROP, AND SORGHUM, MAIZE AND SESAME GROWN FOR LOCAL 
CONSUMPTION.  THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS SMALL 
(7 PERCENT OF GDP), INEFFICIENT, AND DOMINATED BY 
38 PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WHICH NOW ACCOUNT FOR 80 PER- 
CENT OF ALL VALUE ADDED IN MANUFACTURING.  DESPITE 
CHANGES UNDERWAY, SERVICES ARE STILL DOMINATED BY 
PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WITH BANKING, INSURANCE AND 
PORTIONS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE THE PROVINCE OF 
PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES.  REMITTANCES REMAIN AN 
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN NATIONAL INCOME, WITH TRANSFERS 
FROM 100,000 SOMALIS NOW WORKING IN THE GULF ACCOUNT- 
ING IN PAST YEARS FOR UP TO ONE-THIRD OF SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
TOTAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS 
RELATIVELY STABLE.  IN PLACE FOR 15 YEARS, WITH THE 
SECURITY SERVICES UNDER FIRM CONTROL, IT HAS THUS FAR 
WEATHERED SUCCESSFULLY DROUGHTS, WARS AND REFUGEE 
CRISES, AND, MORE RECENTLY, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY 
PRESSURES ON THE BORDER AND ATTACKS ON NORTHERN 
TERRITORIES BY DISSIDENT  GROUPS   BASED IN ETHIOPIA. 
- 
4. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS:  SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S OVERALL 
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS DETERIORATED BADLY OVER THE 
PAST TWO YEARS AS A SERIES OF BLOWS TO ITS EXTERNAL 
ACCOUNT HAVE COMBINED WITH BURGEONING FISCAL DEFICITS 
TO RECREATE THE LOW GROWTH, HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENT 
THAT HAD PREVAILED IN THE LATE 1970S.  WITH EXPORT 
EARNINGS CUT TO LESS THAN HALF THEIR 1982 LEVEL 
(LARGELY AS A RESULT OF SAUDI ARABIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S 1983 BAN ON 
CATTLE IMPORTS FROM AFRICA) AND FOREIGN AID FINANCING 
DOWN 18 PERCENT FROM ITS 1982 PEAK, SOMALIA CLOSED 
1984 WITH ITS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE OVERALL BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS DEFICIT, A NEGATIVE NET FOREIGN ASSETS 
POSITION AND GROSS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES EQUAL TO 
BARELY SIX WEEKS OF CASH FINANCED IMPORTS.  DEPRESSED 
BY IMPORT SHORTAGES AND WEAK RAINS, REAL GDP GROWTH 
IN 1983 SLIPPED TO ONLY 1 PERCENT AND SEEMS IN 1984 
LIKELY TO HAVE TOTALLED NO MORE THAN 1 TO 2 PERCENT, 
EVEN WITH STRONG RAINS AND RECORD CROP PRODUCTION. 
INFLATION, MEANWHILE, HAS SOARED, RISING FROM AN 
AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF 24 PERCENT IN 1982 TO 36 PER- 
CENT IN 1983 AND 93 PERCENT IN 1984. 
- 
5. LOOKING AHEAD TO 1985, PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND 
PRICE STABILITY WILL DEPEND UPON THE WEATHER, 
SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S SUCCESS IN MUSTERING INTERNATIONAL AID 
SUPPORT FOR ITS PROPOSED IMF STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, 
AND THE GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN ITS 
COMMITMENT TO THE ECONOMIC REFORM PROCESS.  IF THE 
POLITICAL COMMITMENT IS FIRM, THE RAINS ADEQUATE, 
AID SUPPORT SUFFICIENT, SOMALIA MAY BE ABLE TO WORK 
THROUGH ITS PROPOSED STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT TOWARDS 
CONSISTENT, EXPORT LED GROWTH.  IF NOT, SOMALIA 
COULD WELL REMAIN TRAPPED WITHIN THE LOW GROWTH, 
HIGH INFLATION VORTEX INTO WHICH IT STUMBLED IN 
1983 AND 1984. 
- 
6. ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE, A WORLD BANK SPONSORED 
CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING ON SOMALIA IN OCTOBER 
1983 PROVIDED THE STIMULUS FOR AN INITIAL REVIEW OF 
SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WHICH THE WORLD 
BANK HAS SINCE FOLLOWED UP WITH STAFF VISITS 
THROUGHOUT 1984.  AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 1985, THE 
RESULT OF THESE REPEATED REVIEWS IS A PUBLIC INVEST- 
MENT PROGRAM LARGELY FREE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANTS 
THAT HAD PLAGUED PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT PLANS, BUT 
STILL OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE COUNTRY%SINGLEQUOTES%S REAL FISCAL 
AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES.  RETURNS ON IN- 
VESTMENT HAVE BEEN ABSURDLY LOW OVER THE PAST 13 
YEARS (BELOW 6.7 PERCENT PER ANNUM ON AVERAGE TO JUDGE 
FROM GDP GROWTH AND NATIONAL INVESTMENT RATES) AND 
LIKELY WILL REMAIN LOW IN COMING YEARS, IF MORE CARE- 
FUL CONTROL IS NOT EXERTED OVER THE DISTRIBUTION AND 
USE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS.  A SECOND CONSULTATIVE GROUP 
MEETING NOW TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 1985 
WILL PROVIDE DONORS WITH A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO  IN- 
FLUENCE THIS PROCESS. 
- 
7. POLICY FRAMEWORK:  SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT 
STEPS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO ESTABLISH THE 
INCENTIVES, OPPORTUNITIES AND FREE OPERATING 
ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A 
MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC SYSTEM.  IT HAS ENDED 
PRICE CONTROLS, VIRTUALLY ABOLISHED IMPORT AND EXPORT 
LICENSING, DEVALUED REPEATEDLY (BY A TOTAL OF 83 PER- 
CENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TERMS), AND, IN JANUARY 1985, 
ESTABLISHED A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET WITH A 
FREE AND LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET FOR MOST FOREIGN EX- 
CHANGE TRANSACTIONS.  IT HAS ALSO BOOSTED BANKING 
SYSTEM LOAN AND DEPOSIT RATES BY 8 TO 10 POINTS (IN 
TWO STAGES OVER THREE YEARS), AND COMPLETELY LIBERAL- 
IZED INTERNAL FOODGRAIN MARKETING.  HOWEVER, IT HAS 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY BACK THESE REFORMS 
WITH THE REQUISITE FISCAL AND MONETARY DISCIPLINE. 
REAL INTEREST RATES REMAIN NEGATIVE, AND THE EFFECTS 
OF PAST DEVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY WIPED OUT 
BY EXCESSIVE MONETARY EXPANSION.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
ALSO BEEN SLOW TO ATTACK INTERNAL MONOPOLY POSITIONS. 
WHILE IT HAS ENDED MOST PUBLIC SECTOR TRADING MONO- 
POLIES, IT HAS LEFT IN PLACE MONOPOLIES IN BANKING, 
INSURANCE, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE 
ECONOMY.  IT HAS ALSO LEFT IN PLACE AN UNREALISTIC 
(THOUGH LARGELY UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WMICH OFFICIALLY 
DEPRIVES EMPLOYERS OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE AS 
THEY PLEASE.  OVERALL, THEREFORE, WHILE SOMALIA HAS 
TAKEN MANY OF THE BASIC AND MOST CRITICAL STEPS TOWARDS 
A FREELY OPERATING MARKET ECONOMY OVER THE PAST THREE 
YEARS, IT STILL NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE TASK WITH 
ADJUSTMENTS IN INTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND IMPROVE- 
MENTS IN GENERAL PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT.

10. MONEY SUPPLY:  FISCAL DEFICITS, ONLY PARTIALLY 
OFFSET BY CONSEQUENTIAL DECLINES IN NET FOREIGN ASSETS, 
HAVE PROVIDED THE MAJOR IMPETUS FOR MONEY SUPPLY 
GROWTH IN SOMALIA OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. 
THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS PATTERN WAS DURING THE 1981 
TO 1983 PERIOD, WHEN, UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF A SERIES 
OF IMF PROGRAMS, NEW NET CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
ACCOUNTED FOR VIRTUALLY ALL MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH.  WHEN 
SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S IMF PROGRAMS LAPSED IN 1984, HOWEVER,

- 
12. MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS:  SOMALIA OPERATES 
A RELATIVELY SIMPLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF 
A CENTRAL BANK, A COMMERCIAL BANK, A DEVELOPMENT 
BANK AND A SINGLE INSURANCE COMPANY, ALL GOVERNMENT 
OWNED.  THE CENTRAL BANK TENDS TO RELY UPON QUANTI- 
TATIVE CONTROLS ON CREDIT ALLOCATIONS TO CONTROL 
THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THE CENTRAL BANK ALSO HAS POWERS 
TO FIX INTEREST RATES AND ADJUST COMMERCIAL BANK 
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS (NOW 10 PERCENT).  HOWEVER, IT 
HAS NOT ADJUSTED RESERVE REQUIREMENTS SINCE 1972, 
AND INTEREST RATES, WHILE ADJUSTED UPWARDS IN RECENT 
YEARS, REMAIN NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS AND INEFFECTIVE 
IN CONTROLLING THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THERE IS NO MONEY 
MARKET OR OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA. 
- 
13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND MARKET POLICIES: 
SOMALIA NOW OPERATES A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
MARKET.  THE OFFICIAL MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED 
BY GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND LOANS AND 35 PERCENT OF 
ALL EXPORT EARNINGS, PROVIDES FINANCING FOR ALL 
DEBT AND OTHER OFFICIAL SERVICE PAYMENTS AND FOR 
ALL PUBLIC SECTOR OIL IMPORTS.  THE EXCHANGE RATE 
IN THIS MARKET IS NOW 36:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS) 
AND IS ADJUSTED UPWARDS MONTHLY BY HALF A SHILLING 
PLUS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S CONSUMER 
PRICE INDEX AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE IN- 
FLATION RATES OF THE FIVE SDR BASKET CURRENCIES. 
- 
14.  ALL OTHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS; I.E., 
ALL TRANSACTIONS NOT SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE 
OFFICIAL MARKET, ARE COVERED IN A LEGAL PARALLEL 
MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED BY PRIVATE TRANSFERS AND 
RETAINED EXPORT EARNINGS (65 PERCENT OF ALL EARN- 
INGS).  ALL TRANSACTIONS IN THIS MARKET TAKE PLACE 
THROUGH FOREIGN AND LOCAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS OF THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK, WHICH CAN BE OPENED 
BY ANY RESIDENT (FOREIGNER OR NATIONAL) OF SOMALIA. 
THE EXCHANGE RATE IN THIS MARKET FLOATS, WITH THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK SETTING A DAILY RATE 
FOR ITS OWN TRANSACTIONS AT THE AVERAGE OF THE 
PREVIOUS DAY%SINGLEQUOTES%S MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  STARTING AT 
75:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS), THIS BANK RATE HAS 
MOVED TO 82 IN THE THREE WEEKS SINCE THIS NEW 
MARKET WAS ESTABLISHED ON JANUARY 2, 1985, AND WILL 
EVENTUALLY APPROACH THE REAL CURRENT PARALLEL MARKET 
RATE OF 93 TO 95:1. 
- 
15. EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN SOMALIA INCLUDE DIRECT 
RESTRICTIONS ON REMITTANCES OF PROFITS, EARNINGS 
AND CAPITAL, AND A LICENSING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL 
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  UNDER SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S CURRENT 
INVESTMENT LAW, REGISTERED INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE 
DEEMED %QUOTES%PRODUCTIVE%QUOTES% ARE ENTITLED TO REMIT ANNUALLY 
EARNINGS EQUIVALENT TO 30 PERCENT OF INVESTED 
CAPITAL; %QUOTES%NON-PRODUCTIVE%QUOTES% INVESTMENTS ARE PERMITTED 
NO REMITTANCES FOR THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS, AND 
REMITTANCES ANNUALLY EQUIVALENT TO ONLY 10 PERCENT 
OF INVESTED CAPITAL.  WAGE EARNINGS OF FOREIGN 
WORKERS, SIMILARLY, ARE RESTRICTED TO 50 PERCENT 
OF ANNUAL INCOME.  ALL OF THESE RESTRICTIONS 
REMAIN IN EFFECT UNDER SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S NEW DUAL FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE MARKET SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ACCOUNT 
ARRANGEMENTS AT THE COMMERCIAL BANK, THESE RESTRIC- 
TIONS EFFECTIVELY APPLY ONLY TO THOSE FUNDS WHICH 
ORIGINALLY ARRIVED IN COUNTRY AS EXPORT PROCEEDS. 
- 
16. GOVERNMENT BUDGET OPERATIONS:  CENTRAL GOVERN- 
MENT OPERATIONS HAVE ABSORBED A HIGH AND INCREASING 
PERCENTAGE OF GDP IN SOMALIA.  BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ABSORBED AN AVERAGE 
OF 22.6 PERCENT OF GDP ANNUALLY, A PERCENTAGE WHICH 
ROSE TO 26.3 PERCENT BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  REVENUES, 
HOWEVER, HAVE NOT KEPT PACE, AVERAGING 15.3 PERCENT 
OF GDP IN BOTH PERIODS.  DEFICITS IN BOTH PERIODS 
WERE FINANCED PRIMARILY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS. 
IN THE EARLIER PERIOD, HOWEVER, THIS FOREIGN 
FINANCING WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY SIZEABLE BANKING 
SYSTEM CREDITS, A REQUIREMENT THAT WAS ELIMINATED 
BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983 BEFORE REAPPEARING IN 1984.

19. TAXATION:  SOMALIA RAISES THE VAST MAJORITY 
OF ITS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE FROM TAXES ON 
TRADE AND TRANSACTIONS.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY 
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES, TAXES ON INCOME AND PROFIT 
IN 1983 ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 4 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
REVENUE; PROPERTY TAXES CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENT; WHILE 
LEVIES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES AND DEPARTMENTAL 
SURPLUSES ACCOUNTED FOR 17 PERCENT.  THE BALANCE 
WAS COVERED BY TAXES ON IMPORTS (51 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
REVENUE), EXPORTS (3 PERCENT), EXCISE TAXES (12 
PERCENT) AND STAMP TAXES (6.8 PERCENT).  RATES 
VARIED BY SOURCE.  ON PERSONAL INCOME EARNED FROM 
EMPLOYMENT, TAX RATES RANGED FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS 
LESS THAN US DOLS 6  PER MONTH TO 18.9 PERCENT FOR 
EARNINGS ABOVE US DOLS 42 PER MONTH.  FOR OTHER 
PERSONAL INCOME, RATES RANGE FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS 
LESS THAN US DOLS 67 PER YEAR TO 30 PERCENT FOR EARN- 
INGS ABOVE US DOLS 835 PER YEAR.  PRIVATE CORPORATE 
PROFITS ARE TAXED AT A FLAT 35 PERCENT RATE. 
SPECIFIC EXCISE TAXES ARE LEVIED ON SUGAR, TOBACCO, 
MATCHES, BEVERAGES, MINERAL WATER, SOAP AND SHAMPOO; 
A GENERAL 5 PERCENT SALES TAX HAS ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED 
WHICH WILL APPLY TO ALL BUT ESSENTIAL GOODS. 
CUSTOMS DUTIES AVERAGE 60-65 PERCENT OF THE VALUE OF 
DUTIABLE MERCHANDISE AND ARE APPLIED AT RATES THAT 
RANGE FROM ZERO TO OVER 100 PERCENT ON 120 PERCENT 
OF THE L/C VALUE OF IMPORTED COMMODITIES VALUED 
AT AN ADMINISTRATIVE RATE OF 60:1 (SHILLINGS TO 
DOLLARS).  EXPORT TAXES ARE APPLIED ON ALL MAJOR 
EXPORTS AT RATES RANGING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF FOB 
VALUE.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND STATISTICAL TAXES ARE 
ALSO APPLIED AT A 10 PERCENT AD VALOREM RATE TO ALL 
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.  TAXES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
INCLUDE A TURNOVER TAX (APPLIED AT A RATE OF 50 
PERCENT ON NET PROFIT), A PROFIT TAX (APPLIED AT A 
35 PERCENT RATE AFTER DEDUCTION OF THE TURNOVER TAX) 
AND A 50 PERCENT GOVERNMENT SHARE IN ANNUAL DEPRECIA- 
TION ALLOWANCES. 
- 
20. PRICING POLICIES:  CONSUMER PRICES:  SOMALIA 
OFFICIALLY ENDED ALL CONSUMER PRICE CONTROLS IN 
JANUARY 1985.  OIL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE IMPORTED BY 
A GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY OPERATING AT THE OFFICIAL 
(36:1) EXCHANGE RATE, ARE STILL AVAILABLE AT WHAT 
AMOUNTS TO SUBSIDIZED PRICES (E.G., 17 SHILLINGS PER 
LITER OF GASOLINE).  ALL OTHER PRICES, HOWEVER, 
INCLUDING PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER, HAVE 
BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT FULL COSTS AT THE PARALLEL 
MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE. 
- 
21. PRODUCER PRICES:  AGRICULTURAL MARKETS AND PRICES 
WERE LARGELY DECONTROLLED BY SOMALIA IN JANUARY 1984, 
AND, IN THE YEAR SINCE, BASIC FOOD PRICES HAVE RISEN 
TO MARKET RATES.  THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION, THE GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY WHICH 
PREVIOUSLY HELD A MONOPSONY ON ALL GRAIN PURCHASES 
IN SOMALIA, STILL HOLDS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO PURCHASE 
UP TO 5 PERCENT OF EACH YEAR%SINGLEQUOTES%S CROP, BUT HAS NOT 
EXERCISED THAT RIGHT IN RECENT YEARS.  BANANA EXPORTS 
FROM SOMALIA ARE ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF A 
PRIVATE/PUBLIC JOINT VENTURE, WHICH, OBLIGED IN THE 
PAST TO OPERATE AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, HAS 
NOT ALWAYS OFFERED COMPETITIVE PRICES FOR EXPORT 
QUALITY FRUIT.  NOW FREE TO OPERATE AT THE PARALLEL 
MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER 
COMPETITIVE PRICES IN THE FUTURE. 
- 
22. STATE ENTERPRISE PRICES:  THE PRICE DECONTROL 
INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 1985 HAS LEFT ALL PUBLIC 
ENTERPRISES WITH FULL FREEDOM TO SET INPUT AND 
OUTPUT PRICES AT LEVELS THAT WILL FULLY COVER 
COSTS.  MANY, HOWEVER, ENJOY MONOPOLY POSITIONS IN 
THE ECONOMY, AND HAVE NOT BEEN FORCED BY COMPETITIVE 
PRESSURES OR PRICE DEVELOPMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE 
ECONOMY TO MOVE THEIR PRICES TO ECONOMIC LEVELS.  IN 
THIS CLASS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MONOPOLIES ARE THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK; THE STATE INSURANCE 
COMPANY OF SOMALIA; THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM AGENCY, 
WHICH CONTROLS OIL IMPORTS; THE SOMALI COOPERATIVE 
MOVEMENT,WHICH CONTROLS IN-COUNTRY OIL DISTRIBUTION 
AND, THROUGH THE FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH AGENCY, EX- 
PORTS OF AROMATIC GUMS; THE SOMALI LEATHER AGENCY, 
WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF HIDES AND SKINS, ASPIMA, 
WHICH CONTROLS IMPORTS OF VETERINARY DRUGS; 
SOMALFRUTTA, WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF BANANAS; 
THE SOMALI SHIPPING AGENCY, AND THE SOMALI CLEARING 
AND FORWARDING AGENCIES. 
- 
23. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT POLICIES:  THE PUBLIC 
ENTERPRISES:  THERE ARE NOW 51 PARASTATAL CORPORATIONS 
OPERATING IN SOMALIA, INCLUDING FIVE FINANCIAL, 33 
NON-FINANCIAL AND EIGHT NON-COMMERCIAL PUBLIC ENTER- 
PRISES, WHICH TOGETHER DOMINATE MOST BANKING, 
INSURANCE, AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN SOMALIA. 
DURING THE 1970%SINGLEQUOTES%S THESE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT TREATED 
PRIMARILY AS PROFIT-MAKING COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, 
BUT OFTEN AS SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL 
WELFARE POLICIES.  SURPLUSES WERE TAXED AWAY BY HIGH 
PROFIT TAXES AND GOVERNMENT CLAIMS ON DEPRECIATION 
ALLOWANCES; WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT WERE DISTORTED BY 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AND PRICES FOR BOTH INPUTS 
AND OUTPUTS MAINTAINED AT UNREALISTICALLY LOW LEVELS. 
BEGINNING IN 1981, SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO 
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.  THREE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
HAVE BEEN CLOSED; OTHERS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH 
FOREIGN MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE.  THE REST ARE BEING 
REVIEWED TO DETERMINE WHICH TO RETAIN AS SERVICE 
INSTITUTIONS ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES, WHICH TO DIVEST 
OR CLOSE, AND WHICH TO ESTABLISH AS COMMERCIAL 
ENTERPRISES IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS.  DECISIONS HAVE 
ALSO BEEN TAKEN TO GRANT ALL PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
AUTONOMY IN REGARD TO WAGE, EMPLOYMENT AND PRICING 
DECISIONS, AND WHERE POSSIBLE, TO ELIMINATE THE 
REMAINING PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES IN TRADE, BANKING 
AND SERVICES.  PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THESE DECISIONS, 
HOWEVER HAS BEEN SLOW. 
- 
24. PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  INCENTIVES:  SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
CURRENT INVESTMENT LAW OFFERS NEW INVESTMENTS TAX 
HOLIDAYS ON ALL INCOME, IMPORT, EXCISE AND PROPERTY 
TAXES FOR PERIODS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS.  IT ALSO 
GUARANTEES REMITTANCES AT THE RATES OUTLINED ABOVE. 
IN ADDITION, J  FHE NEW FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET 
ARRANGEMENTS, FACILITIES FOR REMITTANCES ABOVE THE 
RATES DEFINED IN THE LAW ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEW 
LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET.  SOMALIA HAS NEGOTIATED A 
BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
OF GERMANY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR MOST FAVORED NATION 
OR NATIONAL TREATMENT FOR GERMAN INVESTORS, PROMPT 
AND ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IN CASE OF EXPROPRIATION, 
AND FREE TRANSFER OF CAPITAL, DIVIDENDS, INTEREST 
AND EARNINGS.  IT ALSO HAS UNDER CONSIDERATION TWO 
DRAFT BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN. 
- 
25. DISINCENTIVES:  DISINCENTIVES TO PRIVATE INVEST- 
MENT INCLUDE THE COUNTRY%SINGLEQUOTES%S GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURAL AND 
INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES, THE CONTINUING THREAT OF 
POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, THE PRE-EMPTION 
OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
MONOPOLIES, A CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY REGARDING 
MARKET FREEDOMS, THE CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS ON 
WAGE AND CAPITAL REMITTANCES, THE LACK OF A WELL 
DEFINED BODY OF COMPANY AND COMMERCIAL LAW, AND AN 
ONEROUS (THOUGH UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WHICH OFFICIALLY 
DEPRIVES THE EMPLOYER OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE 
FREELY, MANDATES AN UNECONOMICALLY HIGH LEVEL OF WORKER 
BENEFITS, AND RESTRICTS THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN 
NATIONALS.  A REVIEW OF INVESTMENT LAW NOW UNDER WAY 
MAY ELIMINATE SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS NOW IMPOSED 
ON REMITTANCES, AND PROVIDE A FULLER SET OF PROPERTY 
RIGHTS FOR NEW INVESTORS. 
- 
26. LEVELS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  THERE 
HAVE BEEN WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN PRIVATE SECTOR 
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS, AS 
WEATHER INDUCED FLUCTUATIONS IN INVENTORY ACCUMULATION 
IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT LIVESTOCK SECTOR OVERWHELMED 
RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF PRIVATE SECTOR FIXED CAPITAL 
FORMATION.  PUBLIC SECTOR SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT HAVE 
ALSO VARIED WIDELY AS WARS, DROUGHTS AND REFUGEE 
CRISES HAVE REPEATEDLY SWELLED RECURRENT EXPENDITURES. 
OVERALL, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT TOTALLED APPROXIMATELY 
18 PERCENT OF GDP (10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 8 PERCENT PRIVATE) 
BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, RISING TO 21 PERCENT (10 PERCENT 
PUBLIC, 11 PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983. 
SAVINGS LAGGED, TOTALLING ONLY 3 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS 
7 PERCENT PUBLIC, 10 PERCENT PRIVATE) IN 1972 TO 1980, 
AND 4 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS 10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 14 
PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  THE BALANCE 
OF INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES WERE COVERED BY FOREIGN 
GRANTS AND LOANS, AND REMITTANCES, WHICH TOGETHER 
AVERAGED 15 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, 
AND 18 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  FOR 1984 
TO 1986, SOMALIA HAS PROPOSED A PUBLIC INVESTMENT 
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD RAISE NATIONAL INVESTMENT TO 23 
PERCENT OF GDP (16 PERCENT PUBLIC AND 7 PERCENT 
PRIVATE) FINANCED ENTIRELY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS 
(25.5 PERCENT OF GDP).  WITH FOREIGN FINANCING AND 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR%SINGLEQUOTES%S OWN ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY SETTING 
LIMITS TO PUBLIC SECTOR ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, ACTUAL 
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT TOTALLED ONLY ABOUT 9 PERCENT 
OF GDP IN 1984 - A RATE THAT LIKELY WILL HOLD FOR THE 
NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. 
 
- 
27. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT (AS SHARES OF GDP): 
 
-                                1972-80     1981-83

- 
28. AID ASSISTANCE:  DISBURSEMENTS OF GRANTS AND 
LOANS TO SOMALIA FROM ALL OFFICIAL SOURCES FOR 
ALL USES (REFUGEE, DEVELOPMENT AND BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS ASSISTANCE) HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY OVER 
THE PAST NINE YEARS, RISING FROM SLIGHTLY OVER 
US DOLS 120 MILLION IN 1975 TO APPROXIMATELY US 
DOLS 300 MILLION IN 1983, BEFORE DROPPING OFF 
SLIGHTLY IN 1984 TO APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 260 
MILLION.  GRANTS ACCOUNTED FOR A GRADUALLY IN- 
CREASING PROPORTION OF THIS ASSISTANCE (ABOVE 50 
PERCENT IN 1984), AND LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS 
FROM THE IMF AND ARAB MONETARY FUND, FOR THE 
BALANCE.  MAJOR DONORS AND LENDERS INCLUDED SAUDI 
ARABIA, KUWAIT, THE UNITED STATES, ITALY, THE 
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, THE EEC, THE IBRD, 
THE IMF, THE ARAB FUND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK.  FOR 1985 AND 1986, 
SOMALIA HAS PROJECTED FURTHER GRANT AND LOAN DIS- 
BURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 900 MILLION, 
THOUGH ACTUAL DISBURSEMENTS MAY FALL SOMEWHAT 
SHORT OF THIS TARGET. 
- 
29. PARALLELING THE RAPID INCREASE IN AID DIS- 
BURSEMENTS HAS BEEN AN EQUALLY RAPID RISE IN SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
EXTERNAL DEBT.  BETWEEN YEAR END 1979 AND YEAR END 
1984, SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT ROSE TO APPROX- 
IMATELY US DOLS 1445 MILLION, UP US DOLS 848 MILLION 
FROM THE US DOLS 597 MILLION LEVEL WHICH HAD PRE- 
VAILED AT THE CLOSE OF 1979.  THANKS TO EXTENSIVE 
REFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, (WITH MIDDLE EASTERN 
CREDITORS, IN PARTICULAR), OVERALL DEBT SERVICE 
PAYMENTS HAVE REMAINED MANAGEABLE (50 PERCENT OF 
GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS IN 1984).  WITHOUT 
FURTHER RESCHEDULINGS, HOWEVER, DEBT SERVICE PAY- 
MENTS WILL RISE TO, AND MAY EXCEED, THE TOTAL OF 
SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS OVER THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS. 
- 
30. SOURCES:  THE PRIMARY SOURCES USED IN COMPILING 
THIS REPORT WERE THE WORLD BANK%SINGLEQUOTES%S PRELIMINARY 
ESTIMATES OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT AGGREGATES PUBLISHED 
IN AUGUST 1984, THE IMF%SINGLEQUOTES%S REVIEW OF SOMALIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S STAND- 
BY ARRANGEMENT PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1984, THE IMF%SINGLEQUOTES%S

MONETARY DATA IS RELIABLE THROUGH THE CLOSE OF 1983. 
THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DATA ARE RELIABLE THROUGH THE 
CLOSE OF 1982.

2.  RUMORS ARE PROBABLY ALWAYS ABUNDANT HERE BUT AN FSN

KIND ARE CIRCULATING, AS FOLLOWS: 
 
--FAILURE TO ANNOUNCE A DATE FOR THE INAUGURAL MEETING OF 
THE NEW PARLIAMENT REFLECTS SIAD BARRE%SINGLEQUOTES%S INDECISION ABOUT 
POSSIBLE MAJOR CHANGES; 
 
--THE PRESIDENT MAY ABSENT HIMSELF FROM THE COUNTRY FOR 
EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS ON GROUNDS OF HEALTH, DECIDING ONLY 
AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD WHETHER TO RETURN; 
 
--HE MAY RE-CREATE THE POST OF PRIME MINISTER AND MAKE 
SAMANTAR, NOW FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND DEFENSE MINISTER, 
PRIME MINISTER TO RUN THE COUNTRY IN HIS ABSENCE; 
 
--GENERAL GANNI, THE HARSH MILITARY COMMANDER IN THE 
NORTH, MIGHT REPLACE SAMANTAR AS DEFENSE MINISTER; 
 
--SECOND VICE PRESIDENT KULMIE MIGHT BE GIVEN THE 
HONORIFIC POST OF CHAIRMAN OF PARLIAMENT. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  THESE RUMORS ARE NOT OUT OF LINE WITH OTHER 
INFORMATION THE EMBASSY (INCLUDING SIRO) HAS REPORTED, 
WHICH INDICATE THAT SIAD BARRE IS FEELING MORE AGED AND 
WORRIED AND THAT THE QUESTION OF HIS LEAVING THE COUNTRY 
HAS INDEED COME UP, ALTHOUGH HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID 
THAT HE WILL NOT LEAVE.  THE DEPARTMENT WILL RECALL THAT 
MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCT ADDOU CONFIRMED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR A FEW DAYS AGO THAT A CABINET SHAKEUP WAS 
COMING AND MIGHT INVOLVE THE TWO VICE PRESIDENTS. 
WHETHER THE INAUGURAL MEETING OF PARLIAMENT IS ACTUALLY 
BEING DELAYED IS NOT CLEAR; WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT 
IT MAY BE HELD THIS COMING WEEK.

1. (SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
- 
2. THE FOLLOWING IS IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS 
POSED IN PARAGRAPH FIVE OF REFTEL. 
 
- 
3. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SOMALIA. 
 
- 
4. SOMALIA HAS NO OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH LIBYA. 
THE GSDR VIEWS QADHAFI AS AN ENEMY BECAUSE HE 
SUPPORTS THE SOMALI DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS TRYING 
TO BRING DOWN THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT.   THERE HAVE 
BEEN RUMORS RECENTLY OF TENTATIVE CONTACTS BETWEEN 
SOMALIA AND LIBYA ABOUT RESTORING RELATIONS. 
ITALIANS HAVE TOLD US THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER 
WAY ABOUT PLACING A SOMALI DIPLOMAT IN THE ITALIAN 
EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI AND A LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN THE 
YUGOSLAV EMBASSY IN MOGADISHU.  IT SEEMS LIKELY, 
IF TRUE, THAT PRESIDENT SIAD WILL TRY TO USE THE 
LIBYANS%SINGLEQUOTES% DESIRE FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS AS A LEVER 
TO PERSUADE THEM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE DISSIDENTS. 
 
- 
5. OVERT OPPOSITION TO THE SIAD REGIME IS CENTERED 
ON TWO DISSIDENT GROUPS, THE SOMALI NATIONAL 
MOVEMENT (SNM) AND THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC SALVATION 
FRONT (SDSF), WHICH ARE HEADQUARTERED IN ADDIS 
ABABA AND OPERATE AGAINST SOMALIA OUT OF ETHIOPIA. 
WE UNDERSTAND LIBYA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THESE GROUPS 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS. 
 
- 
6. LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE DISSIDENTS HAS BEEN 
CONSTRAINED ON OCCASION BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS%SINGLEQUOTES% 
RELUCTANCE TO MERGE AS QADHAFI DESIRES OR TO FOLLOW 
A MORE RADICAL IDEOLOGICAL LINE. 
 
- 
7. AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE GSDR IS UNLIKELY TO 
SUPPORT LIBYAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN 
AFRICA EXCEPT AGAINST ETHIOPIA.  OVER THE PAST 
YEAR, SOMALIA PUBLICLY HAS CRITICIZED LIBYAN 
ACTIVITIES IN CHAD AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA, AS WELL 
AS LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE SNM AND THE SDSF. 
HOWEVER, SOMALIA DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO 
ASSIST ANY COUNTRY THREATENED BY THE LIBYANS. 
 
- 
8. THE FACT THAT SOMALIA AND LIBYA ARE BOTH ISLAMIC 
COUNTRIES IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THEIR 
RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER. 
 
- 
9. ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN SOMALIA AND LIBYA IS 
POSSIBLE IF LIBYAN FORCES WERE TO BE SENT TO 
ETHIOPIA AND TOOK UP POSITIONS ALONG THE BORDER 
WITH SOMALIA.  WE BELIEVE THAT FULL-SCALE WAR 
BETWEEN SOMALIA AND ETHIOPIA IS UNLIKELY.  CROSS 
BORDER SKIRMISHES, HOWEVER, ARE RECURRENT AND 
POSSIBLE LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, 
ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD MEAN ADDING A NEW ELEMENT 
TO THE CURRENT SOVIET/CUBAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT 
IN ETHIOPIA.

SUBJECT: BOTSWANA CHARGES BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THREAT TO INVADE 
 
REF: GABORONE 461 (NOTAL) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA HAS ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE 
STATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE 
BOTSWANA UNLESS IT HALTS THE PASSAGE OF ANC CADRE THROUGH BOTSWANA 
INTO ITS TERRITORY AND THAT OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE RELEASE ALSO CITES 
PIK BOTHA AS SAYING THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH 
INTO ANY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE ANC GROUPS 
ARE PASSING INTO THEIR TERRITORY. THE RELEASE STATES THAT BOTSWANA 
DOES NOT PERMIT USE OF ITS TERRITORY FOR ATTACKS ON ITS NEIGHBORS AND 
THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA %QUOTES%WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY 
FORCES AND ARMIES%QUOTES% SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES 
THAN BOTSWANA. THE RELEASE WAS APPARENTLY AIRED ON RADIO BOTSWANA THE 
EVENING OF FEBRUARY 4 AND WAS PICKED UP ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV THE SAME 
EVENING. THE PRESS HAS REPORTED A RECENT MEETING BETWEEN FOREIGN 
MINISTER CHIEPE AND BOPHUTHATSWANA OFFICIALS, DENIED BY THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER. THE PRESS STATEMENT MAY REPRESENT GOB EFFORTS TO POSITION 
ITSELF FOR THE UPCOMING MEETING WITH SAG OFFICIALS REPORTED REFTEL. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A GOB PRESS STATEMENT RELEASED 
LATE FEBRUARY 4.  QUOTE: BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE 
BOTSWANA UNLESS THAT PASSAGE OF A.N.C. CADRES INTO REPUBLIC OF SOUTH 
AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA, WHICH BOPHUTHATSWANA BELIEVES TAKES 
PLACE THROUGH BOTSWANA, STOPS. 
 
THIS WARNING HAS SINCE BEEN REPEATED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER, THE HON. PIK BOTHA, WHO HAS STATED THAT THE REPUBLIC OF 
SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH INTO ANY 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE A.N.C. CADRES PASS 
INTO BOPHUTHATSWANA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, WHETHER SUCH 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY APPROVES OR KNOWS ABOUT SUCH INFILTRATION OR NOT 
BOTSWANA THEREFORE FACES THE RISK OF INVASION WHETHER OR NOT IT 
APPROVES OF THE ALLEGED A.N.C. INFILTRATION OR EVEN KNOWS ABOUT IT OR 
NOT. THE BOPHUTHATSWANA THREAT IS ALL THE MORE SURPRISING AS 
BOPHUTHATSWANA HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY COMPLAINED TO BOTSWANA ABOUT 
SECURITY MATTERS. 
 
BOTSWANA FOR ITS PART, HAS EXPLAINED, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE, THAT 
IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY AS A BASE FOR ATTACKS ON 
ITS NEIGHBOURS OR ANY OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THAT MATTER. BOTSWANA HAS 
ALWAYS ARRESTED, TRIED AND IMPRISONED ANYBODY WHO WAS CAUGHT 
IMPORTING OR CARRYING OR IN POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IN BOTSWANA. 
BOTSWANA IS NO MORE GUILTY OF PERMITTING A.N.C. CADRES TO ENTER 
ITS TERRITORY THAN BOPHUTHATSWANA AND SOUTH AFRICA ARE OF PERMITTING 
THESE CADRES TO ENTER THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIES. SOUTH AFRICA AND 
BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY FORCES AND ARMIES, CAPABLE 
OF INVADING BOTSWANA, SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES 
AGAINST A.N.C. INFILTRATION WHICH BOTSWANA WITH ITS SMALL POLICE 
FORCE AND ARMY AND SEVERELY LIMITED RESOURCES IS UNABLE TO DO. OFFICE 
OF THE PRESIDENT, FEBRUARY 4, 1985. END QUOTE. 
 
3. (C) OUR COPY OF THE RELEASE INDICATES THAT THE STATEMENT WAS TO BE 
READ OVER RADIO BOTSWANA%SINGLEQUOTES%S ENGLISH NEWS AT 6 P.M. AND 9 P.M. FEBRUARY 
4. EMBASSY OFFICIALS DID NOT HEAR THESE BROADCASTS BUT PICKED UP A 
REPORT ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV DURING THE SAME EVENING REPORTING ON THE 
RELEASE. IT WAS NOT AIRED ON THE 7 A.M. RADIO BOTSWANA ENGLISH NEWS 
FEBRUARY 5. 
 
4. (S-NOFORN) COMMENT. WE ARE SEEKING EARLY MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN 
MINISTRY AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO ASCERTAIN THE BACKGROUND TO THIS 
BPZARRE PRESS RELEASE. WE SUSPECT THAT IT REPRESENTS GOB EFFORTS TO 
POSITION ITSELF FOR THE SECURITY MEETING WHICH THE SAG REPORTEDLY 
HAS INSISTED UPON (REFTEL). INTERESTINGLY, THE INDEPENDENT GUARDIAN 
REPORTED ON FEBRUARY 1 THAT MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CHIEPE MET 
SEDETLY ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IN A GABORONE MOTEL WITH BOPHUTHATSWANA 
OFFICIALS. THE GUARDIAN SAID THAT DR. CHIEPE HAS %QUOTES%EMPHATICALLY DENIED 
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MEETING. THE GUARDIAN CONTINUED THAT 
INFORMED SOURCES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE BANTUSTAN GOVERMMENT SEEKS 
ASSURANCE FROM GABORONE THAT ANC FREEDOM FIGHTERS ARE NOT OPERATING 
FROM BOTSWANA.%QUOTES% THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO FOLLOWS A SIRO REPORT OF AN 
ARMED CLASH FEBRUARY 3 ON THE FRONTIER TWO KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE 
TLOKWENG BORDER POST BETWEEN 3 ARMED ANC CADRE AND A SOUTH AFRICAN 
DEFENSE FORCE PATROL IN WHICH ONE SOUTH AFRICAN SOLDIER WAS SAID TO 
HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY WOUNDED. THE ANC GROUP REPORTEDLY FLED BACK INTO 
BOTSWANA. END COMMENT.

E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR 
TAGS:        PTER 
SUBJECT:     INTERNATIONAL LINKS OF LARF 
 
REF:  1. ROME 1902, 2. STATE 31565  3. STATE 014859 
 
 
1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. 

2.  REFTEL 1 RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND LEBANESE TERRORIST 
GROUPS AS THEY MIGHT RELATE TO INVESTIGATON  OF 
LADISPOLI SEVEN. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION MIGHT BE 
USEFUL IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT WITH ITALIAN 
MAGISTRATE. 
 
3.  AN ETA-LARF LINK.  ACCORDING TO ROME 1902 THERE IS 
REASON TO SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE RECENT BOMB ATTACKS ON 
TRAINS CLAIMED BY BASQUE FATHERLAND THE FREEDOM (ETA) 
HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE LEBANESE ARMED 
REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) ON BEHALF OF ETA. 

4.  WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THIS IS 
BASED.  IN LATE 1984 THERE WERE THREE INCIDENTS IN WHICH 
ETA WAS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT BOMBINGS ON RAILWAY 
STATIONS OR NEAR RAILWAY TRACKS, BUT NOT AGAINST A 
TRAIN.  TWO OF THESE WERE LOW-LEVEL EXPLOSIONS CAUSING NO 
CASUALTIES AND LITTLE DAMAGE.  THE THIRD WAS A 
BOOBY-TRAPPED DEVICE THAT KILLED SEVERAL CIVIL GUARDS, 
BUT WAS CONSISTENT WITH PAST ETA ACTIONS. 

5.  THE REFERENCE IN ROME 1902 MAY BE TO A FEBRUARY18, 
1984 EXPLOSION AT URRUGNE NEAR THE FRENCH-SPANISH BORDER 
THAT APPARENTLY WAS DESIGNED TO CAUSE A MID-COURSE 
COLLISION BETWEEN TWO TRAINS, ONE BOUND FOR MADRID, THE 
OTHER FOR PARIS.  THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO INJURIES OR 
COLLISION, BUT ONLY A STROKE OF LUCK PREVENTED A MAJOR 
CATASTROPHE.  CLAIM FOR THE ATTACK, HOWEVER, WAS NOT MADE 
BY ETA BUT BY IPARRETARRAK (%QUOTES%MEN OF THE NORTH%QUOTES%), A FRENCH 
BASQUE GROUP FIGHTING FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THREE 
BASQUE-POPULATED FRENCH PROVINCES.  ALTHOUGH THE TWO 
GROUPS ARE SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SIMILARITY OF 
THEIR AIMS COULD CAUSE CONFUSION.  IN THE PAST ETA HAS 
GENERALLY SHUNNED RELATIONS WITH IPARRETARRAK NOT WISHING 
TO OFFEND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. 

6.  THE FEBRUARY 18 INCIDENT WAS A POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE 
VIOLENT ATTACK THAN USUAL IPARRETARRAK ACTIONS, AND IT 
REPORTEDLY ANGERED SEVERAL JAILED IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS. 
THE BOMBING, HOWEVER, APPARENTLY WAS THE WORK OF 
IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS WHO (CLAIMED) THAT THEY HAD WARNED 
FRENCH OFFICIALS ABOUT THE BOMB TEN MINUTES BEFORE IT 
WENT OFF AND DID NOT INTEND TO CAUSE A TRAIN COLLISION. 

7.  THE RED BRIGADES-LARF LINK.  AGAIN ACCORDING TO ROME 
1902 LARF AND THE ITALIAN RED BRIGADES (RB) HAVE BEEN 
PROVEN TO HAVE CONNECTIONS.  WE SUSPECT THAT THIS 
ASSERTION IS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF LEAMON HUNT%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
DRIVER WHO HAS IDENTIFIED MOHAMAD FAHS -- ONE OF THE ROME 
SEVEN -- AS HUNT%SINGLEQUOTES%S ASSASSIN.  GIVEN THAT BOTH LARF AND 
THE RB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR HUNT%SINGLEQUOTES%S DEATH, SOME 
ITALIAN OFFICIALS MAY BELIEVE THAT FAHS WAS CONNECTED 
WITH LARF AND PERHAPS %QUOTES%CONTRACTED%QUOTES% BY THE RB TO KILL HUNT 
-- HENCE A LARF-RB LINK.  ALTHOUGH IN NO POSITION TO 
DISPROVE THIS THEORY, WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO CONFIRM THIS 
LINK BASED UPON AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. 

8.  THE LARF  ISLAMIC JIHAD LINK.  WE CANNOT YET VERIFY 
THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN LARF AND ISLAMIC 
JIHAD.  THE TWO GROUPS APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS 
FROM SEPARATE ISLAMIC SECTS.  THEY ARE ACTIVE IN 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND USE DIFFERENT MO%SINGLEQUOTES%S. 

9.  %QUOTES%ISLAMIC JIHAD%QUOTES% IS APPARENTLY THE OPERATIONAL 
COVERNAME USED BY ONE OR MORE PROIRANIAN RADICAL 
LEBANESE SHIITE ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE GROUPS, GENERALLY 
KNOWN UNDER THE RUBRIC HIZBALLAH (PARTY OF GOD) ARE 
OFFSHOOTS OF THE MODERATE AMAL ORGANIZATION LED BY NABIH 
BERRI.  SOME HIZBALLAH MEMBERS RETAIN TIES TO AMAL AND 
MAY EVEN KEEP UP MEMBERSHIP IN IT. 

10.  HIZBALLAH HAS PROBABLY BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL 
MAJOR ANTI-WESTERN TERRORIST ACTS IN LEBANON.  THE 
EARLIEST OF THESE, BEGINNING IN 1983, INVOLVED CAR BOMBS 
LOADED WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES SUCH AS HEXOGER.  LATER 
ATTACKS IN LEBANON CLAIMED BY ISLAMIC JIHAD ALSO INCLUDED 
SHOOTINGS AND KIDNAPPINGS.  ALTHOUGH ANONYNOUS CALLERS 
ALLEGED TO BE SPOKESMEN FOR %QUOTES%ISLAMIC JIHAD%QUOTES% HAVE CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS OUTSIDE LEBANON (MURDER OF 
GENERAL OVERSSI, MINING OF RED SEA AND DECEMBER L983 
KUWAIT BOMBINGS) WE CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE THIS. 

11.  LARF, ACCORDING TO MOST REPORTING, IS COMPOSED OF 
LEFTIST/MARXIST LEBANESE AND/OR PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS 
FORMERLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF PALESTINE.  LARF SEEMS TO OPERATE ON A 
SMALLER SCALE THAN ISLAMIC JIHAD. 

12.  INFORMATION ON MOHAMED FAHS.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION 
ON MOHAMAD FAHS THAT IS NOT ALREADY KNOWN TO THE ITALIANS. 

13.  THERE FOLLOWS A LIST OF LARF ACTIONS: 

NOVEMBER 1, 1981

THAT HE HAD RESPONDED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE READY 
BUT SEVERAL THINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. THE 
SOMALIS WOULD HAVE TO TREAT HIM PRDPERLY AS AN 
AMBASSADOR; THEY WOULD HAVE TD STOP THEIR ANTI- 
SOVIET COMPAIGN; THEY WOULD HAVE TD CALL OFF THE

TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW; MOREOVER,

APPROACH TO THE SOVIETS ON NORMALIZATION. MY

SIAD WOULD ASSUME THAT WE WOULD BECOME AWARE OF 
THE APPROACH. BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO CONCEIVABLE 
THAT EVEN IF SIAD SEES NO POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING

HE MIGHT THINK IT POSSIBLE TO GET THE SOVIETS TO 
RESTRAIN THE ETHIOPIANS FROM PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
HIS BORDERS.

SUBJECT: HIZBALLAH ON THE MOVE 
 
1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  SOME WEEKS AGO, IN A MESSAGE ON 
POTENTIAL NEW HIZBALLAH TACTICS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
JENCO KIDNAPPING AND THE MURDER OF TWO FRENCH MILITARY 
OBSERVERS, EMBASSY BEIRUT SPECULATED THAT HIZBALLAH IS 
BEGINNING TO SHIFT TOWARD A MORE PUBLIC, VISIBLE STANCE, 
PARTLY BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY FELT STRONG ENOUGH.  WE 
NOW HAVE MORE EVIDENCE OF THIS.  FIRST, ON FEBRUARY 16 
HIZBALLAH ISSUED ITS FIRST PUBLIC PROGRAMMATIC MANIFESTO 
(BEIRUT 1013), INTER ALIA, CALLING FOR THE DEPARTURE OF 
THE US, FRANCE AND THEIR ALLIES FROM LEBANON AND THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC REGIME.  SECOND, ON 
FEBRUARY 18, ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, VARIOUSLY 
NUMBERED AT 1500-12,000, WERE BUSSED TO SIDON FROM BEIRUT 
AND CONTROLLED THE CITY%SINGLEQUOTES%S STREETS FOR A DAY AS ARMY 
STOOD BY.  THIS WAS AN OMINOUS DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH 
AND WILL AND ABILITY TO ACT THAT WILL SHARPEN EXISTING 
BATTLE LINES AND TENSIONS IN LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  BUSLOADS OF HEAVILY ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, 
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND ESTIMATED BY WESTERN NEWS AGENCIES 
TO NUMBER 1500-12,000, DROVE FROM BEIRUT TO SIDON ON 
FEBRUARY 18 TO MARCH THROUGH CITY STREETS, BURNING THE 
LEBANESE FLAG AND SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST PRESIDENT 
GEMAYEL.  SOME 20 SHOPS SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
WERE SACKED.  AS SIDON RESIDENTS AND LAF TROOPS LOOKED 
ON WITHOUT INTERVENING, DEMONSTRATORS ARMED WITH AK-47S 
AND ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES RALLIED IN CITY SQUARES, 
SHOUTING SLOGANS SUCH AS %QUOTES%DEATH TO GEMAYEL,%QUOTES% %QUOTES%SIDON IS 
MUSLIM AND CANNOT BE RULED BY A MARONITE,%QUOTES% AND %QUOTES%GEMAYEL 
IS AN AGENT.%QUOTES%  DEMONSTRATORS WAVED IRANIAN AND HIZBALLAH 
FLAGS AND CARRIED PICTURES OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI.  A 
SMALLER GROUP OF AMAL MEMBERS CONDUCTED THEIR OWN 
DEMONSTRATION SEPARATE FROM THAT OF HIZBALLAH.  (AMAL 
LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT DENOUNCING THE HIZBALLAH RALLIES 
AND CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE.) 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AT THE ARMY CHECKPOINT AT 
KHALDE, LAF TROOPS CHEERED AND WAVED THE BUS CONVOY 
THROUGH, WHILE PSP MILITIAMEN FURTHER SOUTH ALSO 
WELCOMED IT. 
 
5.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY STAR, SIDON DEPUTY 
NAZIH BIZRI, A SUNNI, EXPRESSED DISMAY THAT THE 
MILITIAMEN IGNORED THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY SIDON%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
LEADERS NOT TO ALLOW THE BEARING OF ARMS IN THE CITY.  HE 
SAID THAT THE PEOPLE OF SIDON WERE CROSS AND ANGRY, BUT 
THAT THE INCIDENT WILL NOT SPOIL THE UNITY OF THE CITY. 
HE SAID THAT THE ARMY DID NOT INTERVENE IN ORDER NOT TO 
PROVOKE A CLASH.  ON MONDAY, A GROUP OF SIDON SUNNI 
NOTABLES ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE CONDEMNING MONDAY%SINGLEQUOTES%S %QUOTES%ARMED 
AND MASSIVE%QUOTES% DEMONSTRATION.  %QUOTES%WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE, 
REGARDLESS OF FACTION, TO VIOLATE THE DECISION TO BAN 
ARMS FROM THE LIBERATED CITY, OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE 
ARMY AND THE ISF.%QUOTES% 
 
6.  COMMENT: THE FEBRUARY 16 MANIFESTO AND MONDAY%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
DEMONSTRATION MARK A NEW STEP BY HIZBALLAH TOWARDS BE- 
COMING AN ACTIVE POLITICAL MOVEMENT OVERTLY DECLARING 
AND PURSUING ITS GOAL OF THE ISLAMICIZATION OF LEBANON. 
AT A MINIMUM, THIS MEANS THAT THE TENSIONS AND BATTLE 
LINES AMONG COMPETING FORCES IN LEBANON WILL BE MUCH 
MORE SHARPLY DRAWN: 
 
A.  WITHIN THE SHIA COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS 
PROVIDED GRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF AMAL-HIZBALLAH RIVALRY. 
PRESS REPORTS SPOKE OF EVIDENT DISPLEASURE ON THE PART 
OF AMAL DEMONSTRATORS, WHILE AMAL%SINGLEQUOTES%S LATER DENUNCIATION 
OF THE DEMONSTRATION IS THE FIRST EXPLICIT DISAPPROVAL OF 
THIS TYPE THAT WE CAN RECALL.  MOREOVER, HIZBALLAH HAS 
CLEARLY MARKED OUT ITS FUTURE POLITICAL IDENTITY IN 
LEBANON--IN THE SIDON RALLIES, ITS SLOGANS SUPPORTING 
AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC TOOK PRIDE OF PLACE OVER AMAL%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
CALLS FOR THROWING THE ISRAELIS OUT OF THE SOUTH. 
 
B.  SUNNI-SHIA.  HIZBALLAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S RALLY IN THE VERY HEART 
OF THE SUNNI CAPITAL OF THE SOUTH RECALLS THE WORST FEARS 
OF THE SUNNIS, AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR COMMUNIQUE.  IN 
FURTHER SUNNI REACTION, A DELEGATION FROM THE SUNNI 
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION MAQASSAD (WHICH IS HEADED BY 
SAIB SALAM%SINGLEQUOTES%S SON TAMAM) IS TRAVELLING TO SIDON ON 
TUESDAY IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS THAT A PTT EMPLOYEE HAS 
BEEN KILLED BY ARMED MEN NEWLY APPEARING ON CITY STREETS. 
 
C.  THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS 
WILL ALSO EVOKE THE WORST FEARS OF THE CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITY, FURTHER PROVOKING A DEFENSIVE, SEIGE 
MENTALITY AND PUTTING MORE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE 
POLITICAL PROCESS.  WE ARE STRUCK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY 
HIZBALLAH%SINGLEQUOTES%S SINGLING OUT THE PHALANGE IN ITS WEEKEND 
COMMUNIQUE AND BY ITS ATTACKS ON GEMAYEL.  THIS, 
TOGETHER WITH JUMBLATT%SINGLEQUOTES%S HEATED RHETORIC AGAINST THE 
REGIME AND MIMICKING OF THE ISLAMIC CAUSE OVER THE 
WEEKEND (BEIRUT 0993),WILL HARDLY ENCOURAGE ANY 
CHRISTIAN TENDENCIES TOWARD FLEXIBILITY. 
D.  SECURITY AND THE ROLE OF THE ARMY.  THE LIMP 
AND EVEN HARMFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE ARMY ON MONDAY HAS 
ABRUPTLY NULLIFIED THE EUPHORIA OF THE SIDON CITIZENRY 
AS A RESULT OF THE LAF%SINGLEQUOTES%S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO THE CITY 
ON SATURDAY.  PRECISELY WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN 
ORDER AND TO SUPPORT SIDON NOTABLES%SINGLEQUOTES% CALLS FOR 
%QUOTES%DISARMAMENT,%QUOTES% THE LAF FAILED ITS FIRST, AND PERHAPS 
MOST CRUCIAL, TEST. 
 
7.  IN ONE SENSE, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE MORE 
HIZBALLAH COMES OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND BATTLE LINES 
ARE DRAWN, THE BETTER THE SITUATION IS IN TERMS OF 
GALVANIZING BARRI (WHOM WE HAVE BEEN WARNING ON THIS 
VERY TOPIC FOR SOME TIME) AND THE SUNNIS, AT LEAST 
IN SIDON.  ONE THING IS CLEAR: FEW LEBANESE OF ANY 
COMMUNITY OR PERSUASION WANT TO LIVE IN AN ISLAMIC 
REPUBLIC.  (THE BULK OF THE SHIA DO NOT FOLLOW THIS LINE 
YET, ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLE LATENT STRENGTH.) 
IN ANY EVENT, ON THIS POINT, THERE IS A TIE THAT BINDS 
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS TO THE GREAT MAJORITY 
OF CHRISTIANS.  ACCORDINGLY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO 
FIND A BASIS FOR CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM COOPERATION IN MEETING 
A THREAT TO ALL OF THEM WHICH IS GREATER THAN ANY 
DIFFERENCES THAT MAY SEPARATE THEM.  THEN AGAIN, THIS 
IS LEBANON.  IN ANY CASE, WE WILL BE CLOSELY TRACKING 
THE REACTION TO THE SIDON DEMONSTRATIONS, PARTICULARLY 
ON THE PART OF THE MODERATE SHIAS.

1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
- 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE ONLY POPULAR MOVEMENT EVER TO HAVE 
MOUNTED A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S REGIME--THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD--HAS NOT RECOVERED FROM ITS INTERNAL 
DIVISIONS AND THE DEVASTATING BLOW SUFFERED AT HAMA. 
THE JANUARY 25 %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% ANNOUNCED FOR CERTAIN MUSLIM 
BROTHER EXILES IS FAR LESS THAN A GENERAL AMNESTY; 
PROBABLY FEW MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATING 
IT AND FEW WILL BENEFIT FROM IT.  THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% WAS USE- 
FUL TO ASAD IN BOLSTERING HIS IMAGE OF %QUOTES%BENEVOLENCE%QUOTES% 
IN THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE FEBRUARY 10 REFERENDUM. 
IT TESTIFIES TO THE CONTINUED WEAK STATE OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS:  DEFEATED, DIVIDED, & DISCREDITED 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.  SINCE THE MASSIVE ARRESTS THAT BEGAN IN DECEMBER 
1981 AND THE DEMOLITION OF HAMA IN FEBRUARY 1982, THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAS BEEN TAME.  IN THE INTERIM, 
ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S INTERNAL PROBLEMS HAVE DERIVED FROM AN ENTIRELY 
DIFFERENT AREA--HIS OWN LAPSE OF HEALTH AND HIS BROTHER 
RIF%SINGLEQUOTES%AT%SINGLEQUOTES%S GRAB FOR POWER.  HAMA IS USUALLY VIEWED AS THE 
WHOLE EXPLANATION FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERS%SINGLEQUOTES% FALL, BUT 
THE EXPLANATION IS MORE COMPLEX. 
 
- 
4.  LONG BEFORE HAMA, IN THE SEVENTIES, THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPLIT INTO AT LEAST THREE %QUOTES%TENDENCIES.%QUOTES% 
THERE WAS, AND STILL IS, A GROUP CENTERED AT AACHEN IN 
WEST GERMANY, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF %SINGLEQUOTES%ISAM AL-%SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR, 
WHO WAS EXILED FROM SYRIA IN 1964.  AS EARLY AS 1970 
MUSLIM BROTHERS IN SYRIA DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED A 
LEADER CLOSER TO HOME, AND %SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY 
IRRELEVANT.  AT PRESENT, ACCORDING TO OUR GERMAN 
COLLEAGUES, %SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR IS OLD AND AILING, HE IS STILL IN 
AACHEN, AND HE HAS BECOME ONLY A RELIGIOUS %QUOTES%THINKER.%QUOTES% 
HE SEEMS NO LONGER TO HAVE MUCH OF A FOLLOWING. 
- 
 
5.  LEADERSHIP OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS CAME TO BE 
DIVIDED INTO POLITICAL AND MILITARY %QUOTES%TENDENCIES.%QUOTES%  THE 
POLITICAL TENDENCY WAS, AND STILL IS, LED BY A GROUP 
OF OLDER MEN (BORN IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES) 
SUCH AS %SINGLEQUOTES%ADNAN SA%SINGLEQUOTES%D AL-DIN, SA%SINGLEQUOTES%ID HAWWA, AND THE AL- 
BAYANUNI BROTHERS.  THESE MEN MAY BE IN BAGHDAD OR 
THEY MAY MOVE BETWEEN BAGHDAD AND AMMAN.  THE %QUOTES%POLITICAL%QUOTES% 
GROUP FALLS INTO THE TRADITIONAL MOLD OF THE FOUNDER 
OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, THE EGYPTIAN HASAN AL-BANNA: 
MEN WHO ARE %QUOTES%FUNDAMENTALIST%QUOTES% IN WISHING TO CREATE A 
STATE BUILT ON THE KORAN BUT WHO CAN ACCEPT CERTAIN 
WESTERN HUMANISTIC AND PARLIAMENTARY IDEAS.  IN THE 
EARLY SEVENTIES, THESE MEN EMBRACED THE IDEA OF MILITARY 
OPERATIONS (%QUOTES%JIHAD%QUOTES%), IN OPPOSITION TO THE LESS 
MILITARISTIC ORIENTATION OF %SINGLEQUOTES%ISAM AL-%SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR, BUT THEY 
WERE SUBSEQENTLY UPSTAGED BY THE FAR MORE ACTIVE 
MILITARISM OF THE %QUOTES%MILITARY TENDENCY%QUOTES% THAT DEVELOPED IN 
THE MID-SEVENTIES.  (IRONICALLY, %SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR IS TODAY MORE 
IDEOLOGICALLY ALLIED WITH THE MILITARY TENDENCY THAN 
THE POLITICAL TENDENCY.) 
 
6.  THE %QUOTES%MILITARY TENDENCY%QUOTES% FROM THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN 
LED BY A MUCH YOUNGER GROUP OF MEN.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION 
IN THE MID-SEVENTIES, IT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS AL-TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A 
AL-MUQATILA LIL-MUJAHIDIN (THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF 
WARRIORS).  IT HAS BEEN WILLING TO RESORT TO ANY FORM 
OF TERROR (E.G., BLOWING UP THE CADETS%SINGLEQUOTES% ARTILLERY 
SCHOOL IN ALEPPO IN 1980, WITH OVER FIFTY KILLED).  ITS 
LEADERS HAVE REJECTED WESTERN IDEAS, ANY FORM OF 
COMPROMISE WITH SECULAR MOVEMENTS, AND ANY MERCY FOR 
ALAWIS.  IN THEIR FANATICISM, THEY FORM A SUNNI ANALOGUE 
TO THE KHOMEINISTS.  THIS GROUP%SINGLEQUOTES%S EARLY LEADERS WERE ONE 
BY ONE KILLED BY ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S SECURITY FORCES WHEN 
ASAD BEGAN TO STEP UP HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERS IN 1979-80.  THE LEADER--OR %QUOTES%CALIPH,%QUOTES% AS HE 
WAS CALLED BY HIS ADHERENTS--WHO SUCCEEDED THEM WAS 
%SINGLEQUOTES%ADNAN %SINGLEQUOTES%UQLA (BORN 1950). 
 
7.  FOR A TIME, BEGINNING WITH THE FORMATION OF AN 
%QUOTES%ISLAMIC FRONT%QUOTES% AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE %QUOTES%MANIFESTO 
OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OF SYRIA%QUOTES% IN NOVEMBER 1980 
(SIGNED BY %SINGLEQUOTES%ADNAN SA%SINGLEQUOTES%D AL-DIN, SA%SINGLEQUOTES%ID HAWWA, AND %SINGLEQUOTES%ALI AL- 
BAYANUNI--THE LAST NAMED AS THE ISLAMIC FRONT%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
%QUOTES%SECRETARY GENERAL%QUOTES%), THERI WAS GREATER COOPERATION 
WITHIN THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  %SINGLEQUOTES%ISAM AL-%SINGLEQUOTES%ATTAR 
JOINED THE FRONT, AND %SINGLEQUOTES%UQLA AND THE %QUOTES%POLITICAL TENDENCY%QUOTES% 
HELD NEGOTIATIONS TO TRY TO PATCH UP THIIR DIFFERENCES. 
IT APPEARS THAT THEY MAY EVEN HAVE COORDINATED TO TRY 
TO EFFECT A COUP AGAINST ASAD, WHICH THEY FORESAW 
WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY MASS UPRISINGS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY.  (THEY ALSO HOPED FOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE-- 
FROM IRAQ, IN PARTICULAR.)  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS 
APPARENTLY HAD SYMPATHIZERS IN MANY QUARTERS OF THE 
REGIME, INCLUDING IN HIGH PLACES IN THE ARMED FORCES. 
PRESS REPORTING OF THE PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT COORDINATION 
AND PLANNING WERE, HOWEVER, LACKING.  ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S SECURITY 
FORCES GOT WIND OF THE PLOTTING AND BEGAN A MAJOR 
ARREST CAMPAIGN BY THE END OF 1981.  FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS 
WERE REPORTEDLY ARRESTED IN JANUARY, 1982.  BY THE TIME 
ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S MEN LOCATED THE MUSLIM BROTHERS%SINGLEQUOTES% HEADQUARTERS IN 
HAMA, ON FEBRUARY 2, 1.82, ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S MEN HAD PROBABLY 
ALREADY BROKEN THE BACK OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS%SINGLEQUOTES% 
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE REGIME.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERS 
IN HAMA, FORCED TO MAKE A STAND OR FACE ARREST AND 
EXECUTION, OVERWHELMED THE ARMED FORCE THAT ASAD 
ORGINALLY SENT IN TO HAMA, AND A SIEGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS 
ENSUED, RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.  ( A TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A 
SOURCE IN SEPTEMBER 1982 CLAIMED THAT 6,000 OF ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
FORCES, 400 %QUOTES%MUJAHIDIN,%QUOTES% AND 15,000 CIVILIANS WERE 
KILLED.  MORE RECENTLY, SYRIANS ARE WONT TO CITE VERY 
MUCH HIGHER FIGURES.) 
 
8.  TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A AND THE %QUOTES%POLITICAL TENDENCY%QUOTES% HAD ALREADY 
BROKEN OFF THEIR NEGOTIATIONS IN DECEMBER 1981, AT 
THE TIME WHEN THE MAJOR ARRESTS HAD BEGUN, TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAMA.  HAMA ITSELF, THEREFORE, WAS NOT THE CAUSE 
OF THE FINAL RUPTURE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STRONG FEELING 
AMONG THE %QUOTES%POLITICAL TENDENCY%QUOTES% THAT THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A BOTCHED 
THE JOB IN HAMA.  THE RUPTURE BECAME OFFICIAL WHEN THE 
%QUOTES%POLITICAL TENDENCY%QUOTES% JOINED THE NEWLY CONSTITUTED 
%QUOTES%NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR THE LIBERATION OF SYRIA%QUOTES% IN 
MARCH 1982, WITH NINETEEN OTHER OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS 
OR INDIVIDUALS,MOST OF THEM SECULAR AND CENTERED IN 
IRAQ.  SA%SINGLEQUOTES%D AL-DIN REPRESENTS THE ISLAMIC FRONT IN THE 
NATIONAL ALLIANCE, WHICH INCLUDES THE PRO-IRAQI WING 
OF THE SYRIAN BA%SINGLEQUOTES%TH PARTY (MICHEL %SINGLEQUOTES%AFLAQ), THE ARAB 
SOCIALIST MOVEMENT (LED BY %SINGLEQUOTES%AFLAQ%SINGLEQUOTES%S ERSTWHILE ALLY 
AKRAM AL-HAWRANI), NASSERISTS, AND INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS 
FORMER SYRIAN DICTATOR AMIN AL-HAFIZ. 
 
9.  THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE SIGNALED 
HOW FAR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAD FALLEN.  NOT ONLY HAD 
IT LOST MUCH OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE PLANTED IN THE REGIME 
AND MUCH OF ITS FIGHTING FORCE, IT HAD BECOME 
IRRECONCILABLY SPLIT AND THE POLITICAL WING HAD SULLIED 
ITSELF BY ASSOCIATING WITH GROUPS ALIEN TO THE IDEA OF AN 
ISLAMIC STATE AND BY PUTTING ITSELF SQUARELY INTO THE 
GRIP OF THE IRAQI REGIME.  IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT IN 
THE PERIOD AFTER THOSE DEVASTATING MONTHS, DECEMBER 1981 
TO MARCH 1982, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OR NO  TERRORIST 
ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN 
SYRIA, AND INDEED, LITTLE APPARENT POLITICAL ACTIVITY. 
(THE ISRAELI INVASION OF LEBANON IN JUNE 1982 WAS 
ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, SINCE THAT INVASION HAD 
THE EFFECT OF BINDING THE SYRIAN POPULACE AGAINST THE 
PERCEIVED ENEMY, AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY--EVEN 
LEAVING ASIDE THE DISCREDITING TRAUMA OF HAMA--WOULD 
HAVE FOUND LESS POPULAR SYMPATHY THAN NORMALLY.) 
 
10.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
HAS EVER RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  WITH 
ITS INTERNAL STRUCTURE DISRUPTED AND ITS NAME BLACKENED 
AMONG ITS OWN PURISTS AND AMONG THE SYRIAN POPULACE AT 
LARGE, IT PRESUMABLY HAS HAD TO LOOK EVEN MORE ACTIVELY 
FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL 
CONSTRAINTS THAT CAUSE US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NOT 
HAD GREAT SUCCESS: 
 
--SECULAR, BA%SINGLEQUOTES%THI IRAQ WELCOMED AT LEAST SOME OF THE 
LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL   TENDENCY %QUOTES%WITH OPEN ARMS.%QUOTES% 
BUT IT CLOSED THE DOOR TO THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A.  (%SINGLEQUOTES%UQLA COULD NOT 
FIND REFUGE THERE.  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS HE WAS 
ARRESTED WHEN TRYING TO SNEAK BACK INTO SYRIA EITHER 
IN 1983 OR 1984; HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM RECENTLY.) 
A JORDANIAN COLLEAGUE SAYS THAT IRAQ %QUOTES%MAY BE%QUOTES% TRAINING 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERS NOW, BUT ON A LIMITED BASIS.  THE 
IRAQI REGIME APPARENTLY WILL NOT COUNTENANCE 
ANY OPERATIONS NOT TOTALLY UNDER ITS CONTROL. 
 
--JORDAN MAINTAINS AN INTELLIGENCE LINK TO THE BROTHER- 
HOOD AND REPORTEDLY ALLOWS ALL FACTIONS OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, BUT IT WOULD BE 
EXTREMELY NERVOUS ABOUT ANY OPERATION AGAINST SYRIA, 
WHICH WAS SEEN TO BE PLANNED OR TAKE PLACE FROM JORDAN. 
IT APPARENTLY GIVES LITTLE ACTIVE ASSISTANCE, AND IT IS 
SUSPICIOUS OF ALL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY. 
 
--ARAFAT%SINGLEQUOTES%S PLO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF COOPERATION WITH 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERS (ONE OF MANY REASONS FOR ASAD%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
ANTIPATHY), BUT ARAFAT%SINGLEQUOTES%S ABILITY TO BE HELPFUL IS PROBABLY 
NOT VERY GREAT.  ARAFAT AND OTHER FOUNDERS OF FATAH WERE 
THEMSELVES MUSLIM BROTHERS , AND FEDAYEEN AND MUSLIM 
BROTHERS TRAINED TOGETHER IN JORDAN BEFORE THE 1970 
CIVIL WAR.  MORE RECENTLY, ARAFAT AND SHAYKH SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN, 
TAWHID LEADER IN TRIPOLI, LEBANON, WERE CLOSE ALLIES 
UNTIL ARAFAT WAS DRIVEN OUT IN DECEMBER 1983.  (SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN, 
WE BELIEVE, IS A MUSLIM BROTHER, AND SOME OF THE SYRIAN 
MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO FLED AFTER HAMA TOOK REFUGE IN 
TRIPOLI AND FORM A PART OF THE TAWHID.)  ARAFAT%SINGLEQUOTES%S DIRECT 
ASSISTANCE--AT LEAST IN THE FORM OF ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING--WAS PROBABLY DISRUPTED 
BY HIS OUSTER FROM TRIPOLI AND WE ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO 
THE DEGREE OF CONTINUING COOPERATION. 
 
--IRAN IS ANATHEMA TO THE POLITICAL TENDECY, BOTH 
BECAUSE OF ITS SUPPORT FOR THE ASAD/ALAWI REGIME 
AND BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL TENDENCY%SINGLEQUOTES%S ASSOCIATION 
WITH IRAQ.  IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RELATIONSHIP WITH TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A IS MORE 
NUANCED.  TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A REVILES IRAN FOR ITS SUPPORT FOR ASAD, 
BUT THERE IS A COMMON FANATICISM AND THERE MAY BE A 
REALIZATION WITH THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A THAT IRAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RELATIONSHIP 
WITH ASAD IS PURELY TACTICAL AND THEREFORE THAT IRAN 
IS NOT %QUOTES%BEYOND REDEMPTION.%QUOTES% 
 
--SAUDI ARABIA IS SIMILARLY REVILED FOR ITS ENORMOUS 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ASAD REGIME,  BUT WE HEAR 
PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT RIYADH HAS ALSO PROVIDED 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND REFUGE TO CERTAIN OF THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERS.  SAUDI DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS HERE 
STOUTLY DENY ANY ASSOCIATION WITH ANY SYRIAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERS, AVERRING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN 
AND MUCH TO LOSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE ALMOST 
CERTAINLY MUSLIM BROTHERS IN MECCA, WHOSE PRESENCE IS 
TOLERATED BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS UNDERPINNINGS AND 
TIES TO THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
 
THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES%:  PUBLICITY PLOY AND SIGN OF BROTHERHOOD 
WEAKNESS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11.  INTO THE APPARENT  THREE-YEAR VOID IN 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITY, ASAD HAS NOW INJECTED HIS 
LIMITED PARDON OF JANUARY 25.  SOME SYRIANS AND 
DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED SURPRISE TO US 
THAT ASAD DID NOT MAKE SOME %QUOTES%GRAND GESTURE%QUOTES% SOME MONTHS 
AGO, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF HIS RECOVERY IN HEALTH 
AND RIF%SINGLEQUOTES%AT%SINGLEQUOTES%S EXILE.  HOWEVER, ASAD PROBABLY NEEDED ALL 
OF 1984 TO BUILD BACK FROM THE CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY 
HIS HEART ATTACK, AS SHOWN BY HIS CONTINUAL DEFERRAL 
OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS. 
 
- 
12.  THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% IS FAR FROM A GENERAL AMNESTY: 
 
--IT DECLARES:  %QUOTES%CONTACTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HELD 
BETWEEN US AND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD ORGANIZA- 
TION (TANZIM AL%SINGLEQUOTES%TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A) LEADERSHIP ABROAD.%QUOTES%  THE NAME, 
%QUOTES%TANZIM AL%SINGLEQUOTES%TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A,%QUOTES% IS NOT THE SAME AS %QUOTES%AL-TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A AL- 
MUQATILA LIL -MUJAHIDIN,%QUOTES% THE OFFICIAL NAME THAT HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE %QUOTES%MILITARY TENDENCY.%QUOTES% 
 
--%QUOTES%ABROAD%QUOTES% IMPLIES THAT THE AMNESTY IS INTENDED ONLY FOR 
EXILES, NOT FOR MUSLIM BROTHERS IN PRISON IN SYRIA. 
(A TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A SPOKESMAN IN 1982 CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE 
10,000  MUSLIM BROTHERS IN JAIL IN SYRIA.  ALL OF OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS ON THE SUBJECT ASSERT THAT THERE ARE 
%QUOTES%THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS%QUOTES% OF SYRIANS IN JAIL, ACCUSED 
OF BEING OR ASSOCIATING WITH MUSLIM BROTHERS, DATING 
FROM THE LATE SEVENTIES BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THE HAMA 
PERIOD.  INDEED, IT IS COMMON TO MEET SYRIANS WHO HAVE 
SOME FAMILY MEMBER, OR WHO KNOW OTHERS WHO HAVE SOME 
FAMILY MEMBER, IN JAIL UNDER ACCUSATIONS RELATING TO 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  10,000 SEEMS A FAIR ESTIMATE-- 
AND A VERY LARGE NUMBER FOR A SMALL COUNTRY.) 
 
--IT DECLARES THAT %QUOTES%THIS LEADERSHIP%QUOTES% HAS EXPRESSED %QUOTES%NEW 
CONVICTIONS%QUOTES% RECOGNIZING THE PERFIDY OF THE %QUOTES%PLOT 
CONCOCTED AGAINST SYRIA%QUOTES% BY %QUOTES%THOSE TRADING IN THE NAME 
OF RELIGION.%QUOTES%  THIS FORMULATION SUGGESTS THAT MUSLIM 
FANATICS--IF INDEED THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A--HAD A CHANGE OF HEART, 
INCLUDING A RECOGNITION THAT THEIR PREVIOUS ACTS 
AGAINST THE ASAD REGIME IN THE NAME OF ISLAM WERE 
ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO ISLAM. 
 
--IT DECLARES THAT %QUOTES%THIS LEADERSHIP%QUOTES% HAS EXPRESSED, IN 
ITS NAME AND %QUOTES%THE NAME OF MANY OF THE BROTHERHOOD 
BASES,%QUOTES% THE DESIRE TO %QUOTES%RETURN TO THE HOMELAND%QUOTES% AND THAT 
%QUOTES%THIS PARDON WILL BE APPLICABLE TO EVERYONE WHO 
RETURNS TO HIS HOMELAND WITH AN OPEN HEART.%QUOTES%  IT 
SUGGESTS, THUS, THAT THE PARDON--WHILE ONLY ADDRESSED TO 
EXILES--IS SOMEHOW ADDRESSED NOT TO ONE GROUP ONLY, 
BUT TO ALL BROTHERHOOD %QUOTES%BASES%QUOTES% AND %QUOTES%EVERYONE%QUOTES% WHO 
SOMEHOW %QUOTES%PROVES%QUOTES% HIS ALLEGIANCE AND CHANGE OF HEART. 
 
--FINALLY, IT DECLARES THAT %QUOTES%SOME OF THESE CITIZENS 
HAVE ALREADY RETURNED%QUOTES% UNDER A %QUOTES%SPECIAL PARDON FROM 
HAFIZ AL-ASAD.%QUOTES% 
 
13.  ON THE VERY SAME DAY AS THIS %QUOTES%PARDON,%QUOTES% THE FINAL 
DECLARATION OF THE EIGHTH REGIONAL CONGRESS WAS ISSUED, 
CARRYING AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MESSAGE.  DURING THE 
CONGRESS, WE HAD HEARD THAT TWO %QUOTES%SECRET%QUOTES% SESSIONS 
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AND 
THESE REPORTS WERE BORNE OUT IN THE FINAL DECLARATION. 
 
--%QUOTES%DURING ITS STUDY OF THE DOMESTIC SITUATION, THE 
CONGRESS DISCUSSED THE PLOT OF THE AGENT MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD GANG, WHICH HAS SOUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THE 
PLANS OF IMPERIALISM AND SOME OF ITS TOOLS IN THE 
REGION THROUGH BASES OF SUPPORT, SUPPLIES, TRAINING, 
AND HELP FROM JORDAN AND IRAQ.  THE CONGRESS ALSO 
REVIEWED THE MEASURES TAKEN TO LIQUIDATE THAT AGENT 
GANG AND TO PURSUE ITS ELEMENTS...IT PRAISED THE MEASURES 
EXERTED...TO LIQUIDATE THIS GANG AND TO FOIL THE 
IMPERIALIST-ZIONIST SCHEMES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.%QUOTES% 
 
- 
THERE IS NOT A WORD OF LENIENCY IN THIS FORMULATION.  IN 
EFFECT, IT IS A STATEMENT THAT IMPLIES THAT HAMA WAS 
NECESSARY, THE REGIME IS NOT SORRY ABOUT IT, AND IT 
WILL DO IT AGAIN IF NECESSARY. 
 
14.  THUS THIS %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% IS HIGHLY SUSPECT ON SEVERAL 
COUNTS: 
 
--IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE THOUSANDS OF MUSLIM BROTHERS 
WHO ARE IN PRISON.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE VERY 
MANY MUSLIM BROTHER EXILES BEING LURED BACK TO  SYRIA 
WITHOUT A DEMONSTRATION THAT OTHERS, NOT SO FORTUNATE 
TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLEE, WOULD NOT ALSO BE FORGIVEN. 
IN FACT, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REPORTS THAT SOME OF 
THOSE IN PRISON--A %QUOTES%SMALL NUMBER,%QUOTES% OR %QUOTES%MORE THAN A 
HUNDRED,%QUOTES% OR %QUOTES%FIVE HUNDRED%QUOTES%--HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
(ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, MOST OF THESE WERE WOMEN). 
ON THE OTHER HAND, MOST OF OUR CONTACTS KNOW OF NO 
PROGRESS WHATSOEVER ON RELEASE OF MUSLIM BROTHERS, AND 
THEIR INQUIRIES INTO THE FATE OF RELATIVES CONTINUE 
TO MEET THE SAME DEADLY SILENCE AS HAS PREVAILED FOR 
THREE YEARS.  BY THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ACCOUNT, THERE 
SCARCELY SEEMS TO DE THE KIND OF DEMONSTRATION OF 
%QUOTES%GOOD INTENTIONS%QUOTES% THAT MUSLIM BROTHERS WITH A HEALTHY 
INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION WOULD REQUIRE BEFORE 
CONTEMPLATING A RETURN TO SYRIA.  (THE REGIME WOULD HAVE 
A MAJOR PROBLEM IN GRANTING A GENERAL AMNESTY.  MANY 
OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO WERE IMPRISONED HAVE 
UNDOUBTEDLY %QUOTES%DISAPPEARED%QUOTES%--ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, 
SEVERAL WERE INTENTIONALLY %QUOTES%RELEASED%QUOTES% FROM PALMYRA 
PRISON AND THEN HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED--AND OTHERS 
TORTURED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE 
%QUOTES%PRESENTABLE%QUOTES% TO THE PUBLIC.) 
 
--THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% IS EXTREMELY VAGUE ON HOW AN EXILE IS 
MEANT TO %QUOTES%PROVE%QUOTES% HIS SINCERITY AND ALLEGIANCE, ANOTHER 
FACTOR THAT WOULD DISSUADE %QUOTES%HOMESICK%QUOTES% EXILES. 
 
--IT TALKS ABOUT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VANGUARD 
ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP ABROAD, RATHER THAN THE LEADER- 
SHIP OF THE FIGHTING VANGUARD OF THE WARRIORS. 
%QUOTES%VANGUARD%QUOTES% (TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A) IS A COMMONLY USED CATCHWORD IN 
SYRIAN POLITICAL PARLANCE.  THE SYRIANS THUS MAY NOT BE 
REFERRING TO THE SAME GROUP; THEY MAY EVEN BE 
INTENTIONALLY USING PART OF THE NAME IN AN EFFORT TO 
DISCREDIT THE %QUOTES%MILITARY TENDENCY%QUOTES% FURTHER.  IT IS 
NOTEWORTHY THAT IF %SINGLEQUOTES%ADNAN %SINGLEQUOTES%UQLA, THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A %QUOTES%CALIPH,%QUOTES% 
IS IN FACT IN A SYRIAN PRISON, THE SYRIANS HAVE 
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED HIM IN THEIR FORMULATION. 
 
--FINALLY, THE VERY NATURE OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERS--AND ESPECIALLY THE WELL-KNOWN FANATICISM OF 
THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A--IS SUCH AS TO SUGGEST THAT VERY FEW OF THEIR 
MEMBERS, MUCH LESS THEIR LEADERS, WOULD ACCEPT THE 
HUMILIATION OF KOWTOWING TO HAFIZ AL-ASAD. 
 
15.  NEVERTHELESS,  WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT 
SYRIAN SECURITY OFFICIALS DID CONDUCT NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLING ITSELF 
%QUOTES%TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A%QUOTES%--MEANT TO BE THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A OF %SINGLEQUOTES%ADNAN %SINGLEQUOTES%UQLA--A 
PROCESS THAT SUPPOSEDLY BEGAN WITH THE INTERVENTION OF 
SA%SINGLEQUOTES%ID SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN AND POSSIBLY THE IRANIANS.  WE EVEN HAVE 
A REPORT THAT SOME %QUOTES%FEW HUNDRED%QUOTES% TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A MEMBERS HAVE 
RETURNED TO SYRIA FROM REFUGE IN SAUDI ARABIA, THANKS 
TO THE INTERVENTION OF CROWN PRINCE %SINGLEQUOTES%ABDALLAH, WHEN HE 
WAS IN DAMASCUS JANUARY 21-FEBRUARY 1 (AND POSSIBLY 
ALSO DURING HIS SEPTEMBER 1984 VISIT), AND THAT TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A 
MAY EVEN JOIN THE SYRIAN %QUOTES%NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE FRONT%QUOTES%* 
 
- 
16.  IF THESE REPORTS HAVE ANY TRUTH TO THEM, THEY 
ARE THE STRONGEST INDICATION YET OF THE LOW STATE TO 
WHICH THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS HAVE FALLEN.  IN 
SEPTEMBER 1982, AN UNNAMED SPOKESMAN FOR TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A, IN 
AN INTERVIEW WITH LE MATIN, POINTED A FINGER AT THE 
%QUOTES%POLITICAL TENDENCY,%QUOTES% DISDAINFULLY ACCUSING ITS LEADERS 
(SA%SINGLEQUOTES%D AL-DIN ET AL) OF BEING ON THE VERGE OF JOINING A 
COALITION WITH ASAD.  NOW IT MAY BE THAT TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A ITSELF, 
OR SOME ELEMENTS IN IT, HAVE DONE JUST THAT. 
 
17.  GIVEN THE RELIABILITY OF THESE RECENT REPORTS, WE 
ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT A SMALL OR FRINGE ELEMENT 
OF THE TALI%SINGLEQUOTES%A, OR AN ELEMENT OF MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO 
HAVE ASSUMED  THE NAME, HAS ENGAGED IN THESE NEGOTIA- 
TIONS WITH THE SYRIANS.  THE SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN CONNECTION IS 
PLAUSIBLE--INDEED, OUR SAUDI AND JORDANIAN DIPLOMATIC 
CONTACTS HERE, WITHOUT PROMPTING, INDICATED TO US THAT 
THERE WERE NUMEROUS %QUOTES%MEN FROM TRIPOLI%QUOTES% MILLING ABOUT 
IN DAMASCUS IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
THE %QUOTES%PARDON,%QUOTES% AND THEY BELIEVE %QUOTES%TRIPOLI%QUOTES% WAS WHAT IT 
WAS ALL ABOUT.  A SWEDISH DIPLOMAT HERE, A LONG-TIME 
FOLLOWER OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS (APPARENTLY 
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM IN SWEDEN), INFORMS US ALSO 
THAT HE HAD HEARD, AT THE TIME OF SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S REMARK- 
ABLE VISIT TO DAMASCUS IN SEPTEMBER 1984, THAT SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN 
HAD RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE RETURN TO SYRIA OF SOME 
OF THE SYRIAN MUSLIM BROTHERS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE 
IN TRIPOLI.  (THE SWEDE ALSO SAYS THAT SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN, A 
MORTAL ENEMY OF ASAD, ONLY AGREED TO COME TO DAMASCUS, 
AT IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHAMENEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S URGING, WHEN 
KHAMENEI AGREED TO KEEP AN IRANIAN MINISTER IN TRIPOLI 
AND ASAD AGREED TO SEND A HIGH-RANKING SYRIAN OFFICIAL 
TO TRIPOLI AS GUARANTORS OF SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S SAFE RETURN.) 
SA%SINGLEQUOTES%ID SHA%SINGLEQUOTES%BAN MADE HIS SECOND VISIT TO SYRIA ON 
FEBRUARY 20, THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD THAT THE 
LATTER VISIT HAD A MUSLIM BROTHERS CONNECTION. 
 
18.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% FOR MUSLIM 
BROTHERS FORMED A PART OF THE PRE-REFERENDUM 
PUBLICITY BUILD-UP.  IT IS CLEAR THAT ASAD WANTED TO 
GO INTO THE REFERENDUM WITH HIS %QUOTES%RELIGIOUS FLANK%QUOTES% AS 
WELL COVERED AS POSSIBLE.  IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 
THE REFERENDUM ON FEBRUARY 10, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESS 
WAS REPLETE WITH HEADLINES OF ACCLAIM FOR ASAD FROM 
EACH OF THE PRINCIPAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN SYRIA, 
INCLUDING EVEN A JOINT MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN DECLARATION. 
ASAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL TO APPEAR TO BE A DEVOUT 
MUSLIM--DESPITE BEING AN ALAWI AND THUS DESPISED BY 
DEVOUT MUSLIMS--AND HE HAS ALWAYS TROTTED OUT CHRISTIAN 
LEADERS AT TIMES WHEN IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE 
NATIONAL UNITY; BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN QUITE SO MUCH OF 
IT ALL AT ONCE. 
 
19.  BUT HIS NEED FOR THIS %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% AT THIS TIME GOES 
DEEPER.  HAMA CONTINUES AS A VERY PRESENT, VERY 
HORRIBLE NATIONAL MEMORY.  NOTHING LIKE HAMA HAD EVER 
OCCURRED IN LIVING MEMORY.  (JAMAL PASHA%SINGLEQUOTES%S HUPPRESSION 
OF CHRISTIAN MINORITIES INVOLVED TURKISH BUTCHERY 
OF CHRISTIANS, MOSTLY ARMENIANS AND MARONITES--THUS 
THIS IS NOT A MEMORY OF SYRIANS BUTCHERING FELLOW 
SYRIANS.)  WE BELIEVE THAT ASAD SOUGHT TO GO INTO HIS 
THIRD TERM %QUOTES%CLEANSED,%QUOTES% WITH THE HORROR OF HAMA PUT 
BEHIND HIM.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE MEMORY OF HAMA HAS 
ITS UTILITY, IN REMINDING THE PEOPLE THAT ASAD IS 
WILLING TO BE UNIMAGINABLY TOUGH WHEN HE HAS TO BE. 
THUS, HE GAVE DOUBLE, APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY 
MESSAGES--THE %QUOTES%PARDON,%QUOTES% AND THE EIGHTH CONGRESS FINAL 
DECLARATION ON THE SAME DAY STRESSING CONTINUED TOUGH- 
NESS.  INDEED, THE %QUOTES%PARDON%QUOTES% IS ALSO QUITE TOUGH IN

1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BEGINNING A FEW YEARS BEFORE INDEPENDENCE, 
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH HAD OCCURRED IN THE SHARE OF BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
PRIVATE ECONOMY OWNED BY ETHNIC MALAY CITIZENS, %QUOTES%BUMIPUTRA%QUOTES% 
BUSINESS, AS IT IS CALLED.  WHILE THIS HAS ENRICHED A NUMBER 
OF BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WEALTH HAS 
BEEN SHARED HAS NOT SATISFIED EVERYONE.  CONTACTS WITH THE 
LOCAL MALAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE ELICITED SEVERAL 
EXPRESSIONS OF DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS GROWTH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY TWO COMPANIES, 
QAF AND JASRA, PARTICULARLY THE FORMER.  THESE TWO COMPANIES 
ARE OWNED BY THE SULTAN%SINGLEQUOTES%S BROTHERS, AND THEIR RAPID GROWTH 
TO BECOME THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN PGUNAI ASIDE FROM 
BRUNEI SHELL IN JUST A FEW YEARS HAS CAUSEX RESENTMENT. 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.  THE MALAY CHAMBER HAS AMONG ITS LEADERSHIP -- INCLUDING 
ITS PRESIDENT -- MEN WHO WERE PROMINENT IN THE OPPOSITION 
PARTY THAT DIED WITH ELECTORAL POLITICS IN THE MID-SIXTIES 
AND, ACCORDING TO ONE CHAMBER OFFICIAL WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER 
OF THAT PARTY, THE ORGANIZATION CARRIES A BURDEN IN STILL 
BEING IDENTIFIED WITH IT.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER, 
HOWEVER, IS A FORMER MENTERI BESAR -- A CHIEF MINISTER -- 
AND IS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF QAF. THE CHAMBER, DESPITE ITS %QUOTES%BURDEN%QUOTES%, 
MANAGES TO SERVE AS A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION TO THE GOVERNMENT 
IN ELICITING POLICIES FAVORABLE TO ITS MEMBERS.  AN EXAMPLE 
IS THE CURRENT RUMOR THAT BRUNEI WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL 
BANK:  CHAMBER OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THIS IS THEIR SUGGESTION 
SINCE THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING FROM 
EXISTING BANKS TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS GROWTH.  INTERESTINGLY, 
THEY DO NOT BLAME THE BANKS, OF WHICH ONLY TWO ARE HEADQUARTERED 
HERE AND EVEN THOSE TWO ARE MAJORITY-OWNED BY FOREIGNERS, 
FOR THIS LACK OF SUPPORT.  THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY SAY, THAT 
THE BANKS MUST HAVE COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN, BUT MOST BUMIPUTRA 
BUSINESSMEN HAVE LAND AS THEIR CHIEF ASSET AND THEY CANNOT 
PLEDGE THEIR LAND AS COLLATERAL BECAUSE THE BANKS COULD NOT 
SIMPLY FORECLOSE AND GAIN POSSESSION OF THE LAND IN THE EVENT 
OF DEFAULT.  ALL LAND TRANSFERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL 
OF THE SULTAN AND LAND CANNOT BE OWNED BY NON-CITIZENS. 
(THEORY AND PRACTICE DIVERGES SOMEWHAT ON THE QUESTION OF LAND 
OWNERSHIP IN BRUNEI.  IN THEORY, CITIZENS DO NOT OWN LAND 
EITHER, IN THE SENSE OF HAVING CLEAR TITLE, BUT MERELY 
HOLD LAND AT THE SUFFERANCE OF THE SULTAN;  IN THEORY THE SULTAN 
COULD REPOSSESS LAND, E.G., AGRICULTURAL LAND ALWOWED TO LIE 
IDLE FOR TWO YEARS, BUT IN PRACTICE HE DOES NOT.)  THE LAW 
THAT PROVIDES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS IS BLAMED BY THE CHAMBER 
OFFICIALS FOR THEIR FINANCING DIFFICULTIES, AND THE REQUIREMENT 
THAT THE SULTAN APPROVE LAND TRANSFERS IS REGARDED AS AN 
UNWARRANTED LIMITATION OF THEIR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. 
CHAMBER MEMBERS HAVE SAID THAT INADEQUATE FULFILLMENT OF 
PROMISES TO FAVOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES IN AWARDING GOVERNMENT 
CONTRACTS IS A FAVORITE THEME OF THE GOB - CHAMBER MEETINGS. 
 
4.  THE TWO BIG BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES, HOWEVER, HAVE SUFFERED 
FROM NO SUCH PROBLEMS.  QAF IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE MOHAMED, 
ONE OF THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS OF THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI (AND 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS)  AND ITS RAPID EXPANSION TO A 
COMPANY WITH 1,500 EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IN BOTH 
BRUNEI AND SINGAPORE IN THE SHORT TIME SINCE 1982 IS ACCOUNTED 
FOR MAINLY BY ITS ABILITY TO DRAW ON HUGE FINANCIAL RESERVES 
TO BUY EXISTING BUSINESSES AND THEN ASSURE THEIR SUCCESS 
THROUGH A NETWORK OF GOOD CONNECTIONS.  QAF%SINGLEQUOTES%S SINGAPORE 
ASSETS INCLUDE BEN AND CO., THROUGH WHICH QAF STOCK WILL BE 
TRADED ON THE SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE, AND NATIONAL COLD 
STORAGE, A WELL-KNOWN FOOD WHOLESALER AND RETAILER THERE, IN 
ADDITION TO STAKES IN SEVERAL TRADING AND REAL ESTATE 
COMPANIES.  QAF RECENTLY MADE NEWS IN THE BUSINESS PAPERS IN 
SINGAPORE WHEN IT SOLD ITS PIZZA HUT FRANCHISE.  IN BRUNEI, 
QAF%SINGLEQUOTES%S INFLUENCE IS BROAD, RANGING FROM CONTROLLING INTEREST 
IN THE ONE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED HERE THROUGH FOOD RETAILING TO 
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A PARTIAL LIST OF QAF%SINGLEQUOTES%S LOCAL 
HOLDINGS INCLUDE OWNERSHIP OF QAF PLAZA, BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S NEWEST (AND 
LEAST CONVENIENTLY LOCATED) SHOPPING AND OFFICE COMPLEX: 
20 PERCENT OF THE ISLAND DEVELOPMENT BANK, ONE OF TWO 
LOCALLY-CHARTERED BANKS AND A RECENT ACQUISITION (THE ROYAL 
FAMILY REPORTEDLY OWNS 30 PERCENT OF THE OTHER LOCAL BANK -- 
NATIONAL BANK OF BRUNEI -- AND PRINCE SUFRI IS PRESIDENT OF THE 
BANK);  75 PERCENT OF BRUNEI PRESS, WHICH PUBLISHES THE BORNEO 
BULLETIN;  50 PERCENT OF LOCAL DAIRY FARM OPERATIONS, WHICH OWNS THE 
BEST LOCAL SUPERMARKETS AND WESTERN RESTAURANT, IN ADDITION TO 
CATERING SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ROYAL BRUNEI AIRLINES) AND 
WHOLESALE FOOD DISTRIBUTION;  49 PERCENT OF Q-CARRIER, WHICH 
MARKETS AND SERVICES AIR CONDITIONERS;  50 PERCENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL 
GAS COMPANY, SUPPLIER TO BRUNEI SHELL, AND 100 PERCENT OF FOUR 
OR FIVE OTHER COMPANIES THAT SUPPLY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO 
BRUNEI SHELL;  PLUS VARYING PERCENTAGES OF COMPANIES THAT ARE 
AGENTS FOR SUCH FOREIGN COMPANIES AS MERCEDES-BENZ, NISSAN, 
SUZUKI, BEECHAMS, CADBURY SCHWEPPES, PROCTOR & GAMBLE, AND 
INTERNATIONAL PAINTS.  IN ADDITION, RUMORS HAVE CONNECTED 
QAF WITH THE PLANNED CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL- 
STANDARD HOTEL, TO BE CALLED THE PRINCE HOTEL. 
 
5.  JASRA HAS ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 
AS QAF, BUT IN AN ECONOMY THE SIZE OF BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S, THE GROWTH TO 
THAT LEVEL OVER ONLY SIX YEARS PUTS JASRA INTO THE SAME VERY 
VISIBLE CATEGORY.  JASRA IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE JEFRI, ALSO 
DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNMENT 
TENDER COMMITTEE, AND HAS GROWN THROUGH EXPANSION OF ITS SUPPLY 
AND SERVICE CONTRACTS TO BRUNEI SHELL.  NOW THAT ITS 
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED, THE MAIN BUSINESS 
OF THE COMPANY IS OIL.  JASRA IS A PARTNER IN THE ONLY ACTIVE 
OIL EXPLORATION EFFORT IN BRUNEI IN RECENT YEARS OUTSIDE BRUNEI 
ASMELL, UNDERTAKEN BY JASRA JACKSON, A JOINT VENTURE OF JASRA 
AND THE AMERICAN JACKSON OIL CO.  IF JASRA JACKSON WERE TO 
STRIKE OIL IN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES, IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING 
COMPLICATION IN THE ROYAL FAMILY%SINGLEQUOTES%S BUSINESS AFFAIRS, AS PRINCE 
JEFRI IS ALSO REPORTEDLY PART-OWNER WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY OF A COMPANY THAT EITHER BUYS OIL FROM BRUNEI 
SHELL OR RECEIVES A QUANTITY AS A PAYMENT IN KIND AND THEN 
RESELLS IT THROUGH SHELL OIL%SINGLEQUOTES%S MARKETING ORGANIZATION.  THIS 
PAPER TRANSACTION, OF UNKNOWN VALUE, IS WHERE THE ROYAL FAMILY 
RECEIVES MUCH OF ITS PRIVATE FLOW OF WEALTH FROM BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S OIL. 
JASRA ALSO OWNS THE LARGEST CAR RENTAL AGENCY IN BRUNEI AND, 
AS WITH NEARLY ALL BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS, IS ACTIVE IN REAL 
ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A RECENT MAJOR MOVE WAS THE ACQUISITION 
OF 50 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL OFFICE OF THE VENERABLE HARRISONS 
AND CROSFIELD TRADING COMPANY, A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF IMPORTED 
GOODS TO THE PRIVATE ECONOMY, HENCEFORTH TO BE KNOWN IN BRUNEI 
AS JASRA HARRISONS.  JASRA ITSELF HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTER 
AND SUPPLIER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND BRUNEI SHELL. 
 
6.  THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COMPANIES OWNED BY THE ROYAL 
BROTHERS LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS SOME PLANNED 
OBJECTIVE FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY IN BECOMING SO ACTIVE SO FAST 
IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY COORDINATION 
OF THE FAMILY%SINGLEQUOTES%S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  SPECULATION ON MOTIVE 
WAS MERELY FUELED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER 1984 TO 
THE EFFECT THAT THE SULTAN OFFICIALLY DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF BRUNEI HAD ANY INTENTION TO BUY ANY COMMERCIAL COMPANY 
%QUOTES%FOR EXAMPLE, QAF LIMITED%QUOTES%.   THE ANNOUNCEMENT, IN BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
OFFICIAL NEWSPAPER, PELITA BRUNEI, WENT ON TO SAY THAT %QUOTES%THIS 
STRONG DENIAL WAS MADE TODAY IN A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE WHICH WENT ON TO SAY THAT ANY INVOLVEMENT 
BY MEMBERS OF THE BRUNEI ROYAL FAMILY IN ANY COMMERCIAL 
COMPANY WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY IS THEIR OWN 
PERSONAL MATTER AND HAS NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER WITH HIS 
MAJESTY%SINGLEQUOTES%S GOVERNMENT.%QUOTES%  THE ANNOUNCEMENT ALSO CAUSED SOME 
SPECULATION THAT IT MIGHT BE EVIDENCE OF A FAILURE TO COORDINATE 
THE ROYAL FAMILY%SINGLEQUOTES%S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THAT, IN FACT, THE 
SULTAN MIGHT BE ANNOUNCING HIS DISAPPROVAL OF QAF%SINGLEQUOTES%S -- AND 
BROTHER MOHAMED%SINGLEQUOTES%S -- ACTIVITIES. 
 
7.  THREE POSSIBLE MOTIVES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED BY 
EXPATRIATE OBSERVERS WHO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ACCOMPANYING 
GROWTH IN DISSATISFACTION FROM OTHER BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN 
AS WELL AS FROM THE CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  (IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD THAT PARTICULARLY CHINESE BUSINESS IN THE SERIA/ 
KUALA BELAIT AREA HAS BEEN AFFECTED, WHERE THE CHINESE WHO LONG 
SERVED AS LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO BRUNEI SHELL HAVE BEEN 
SQUEEZED.)  THERE ARE:  (1)  THAT THE BUSINESS INTERESTS ARE 
INTENDED TO ACHIEVE THE SAME THING AS ANY OTHER BUSINESS, MAKE 
A PROFIT AND ENRICH, IN THIS CASE, FURTHER ENRICH THE OWNERS; (2) 
THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY OBSERVED THAT EXISTING BUMIPUTRA 
BUSINESS WAS NOT ADEQUATELY SKILLED OR SUFFICIENTLY FINANCED 
TO EXPAND INTO AREAS THAT NATIONAL POLICY WANTED TO SEE TAKEN 
OVER FROM FOREIGNERS (OR THAT THEY WERE DISMAYED BY THE 
TENDENCY FOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES TO BE %QUOTES%ALI BABA%QUOTES% COMPANIES, 
ONES WHICH HAVE BUMIPUTRA EQUITY PARTICIPATION, AND A MALAY 
NAME, BUT WHICH ARE ACTUALLY ONLY CONTINUATIONS OF WELL- 
ESTABLISHED CHINESE FIRMS WHERE THE MANAGEMENT, LABOR AND 
MOST OF THE EQUITY REMAINS CHINESE), SO THEY DECIDED TO DO IT 
THEMSELVES, OR (3) THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY, ALREADY ASSURED OF A 
MONOPOLY ON POLITICAL POWER, WANTED TO ASSURE THAT LEAVING THE 
HIGH POINTS OF THE ECONOMY IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS, EVEN IF THEY 
WERE BUMIPUTRAS, DID NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE 
POWER CENTERS IN THE SOCIETY. 
 
8.  THE THIRD POSSIBILITY PROBABLY CAN BE DISMISSED FAIRLY 
QUICKLY BECAUSE NOT VERY MUCH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GOES ON IN 
BRUNEI THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR BRUNEI 
SHELL, BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE ROYAL POLITICAL 
MONOPOLY.  MOST BUSINESSES HERE OF ANY SIZE COULD BE QUICKLY 
RUINED IF CUT OFF FROM CONTRACTS FROM THOSE TWO SOURCES.  AN 
ANNOUNCED SCHEME TO SELL QAF STOCK TO BRUNEI CITIZENS, WITH 
LIMITATIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO RESELL IT, MAY BE INTENDED TO 
ALLOW PARTICIPATION IN PRIVATE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY A WIDER GROUP 
WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOSING CONTROL OF A KEY ECONOMIC SECTOR TO 
ANYONE.  THE PLAN WOULD HAVE 30 PERCENT OF THE QAF STOCK 
SOLD AT A SPECIAL PRICE TO QUALIFIED BUYERS. 
 
9.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS PUT THE DOMESTIC ROYAL BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES DOWN TO A SIMPLE DESIRE TO GET RICHER, WHICH MAY 
SEEM UNNECESSARY, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, BUT NOT UNUSUAL 
CERTAINLY IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN CONTEXT.  THIS MAY WELL 
HAVE BEEN THE INITIAL MOTIVATION, BUT THE BUSINESS 
PRACTICES OF THE TWO COMPANIES SEEM TO BE ALLOWING FOR THE 
SECOND POSSIBILITY TO BE AT LEAST A CONSIDERATION.  OFFICIALS 
OF BOTH COMPANIES AT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OR FINANCIAL 
CONTROLLER LEVEL HAVE DECLARED TO EMBOFF THAT THEY NO LONGER BID 
FOR THE BASIC CATERING, SUPPLY AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS OF 
BRUNEI SHELL AND THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ONCE DID.  THESE ARE 
CONSCIOUSLY LEFT TO SMALLER BUMIPUTRA COMPANIES.  QAF AND 
JASRA HAVE MOVED %QUOTES%UPMARKET%QUOTES%, DOING MORE TECHNICAL OR MORE 
CAPITAL INTENSIVE THINGS AS THEY SEE OTHER BUMIPUTRA 
COMPANIES ABLE TO DO THE SIMPLER THINGS.  TO THE EXTENT THIS 
IS NOT A BUSINESS DECISION, BUT INSTEAD A MATTER OF POLICY 
AIMED AT ACHIEVING A GIVEN STRUCTURE IN THE BUMIPUTRA COMMUNITY, 
THEN HIGHER MOTIVES CAN BE ASCRIBED TO THE ROYAL BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST, IT IS A BUSINESS 
JECISION, AS A JASRA MANAGER ADMITTED TO EMBOFF.  THE LOWER 
END OF THE RANGE OF CONTRACTS HAS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, WITH 
PROFIT MARGINS THINNER AND PRICING TOUGHER, SO THE MANAGERS OF 
THE ROYAL COMPANIES MAY SIMPLY BE MOVING ON TO WHERE THE 
CREAM IS THICKER. 
 
10.  AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHAT THE FOURTH BROTHER, PRINCE 
SUFRI, WILL BE ALLOWED AS HIS SHARE.  HE APPEARS TO BE 
BELATEDLY MAKING HIS MOVE INTO THE BRUNEI BUSINESS WORLD, 
(ASIDE FROM REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, IN WHICH HE HAS HAD 
INTERESTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS) 
WITH THE VEHICLE BEING SINARAN, A COMPANY THAT HAS EXISTED 
SINCE 1974, BUT INACTIVE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY.  SINARAN, REGISTERED 
AS A TRADING AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, MAY BE THE RECIPIENT, IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH AN AMERICAN FIRM, OF SOME OF THE LARGE 
CONTRACTS THAT ARE RUMORED AS AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, 
INCLUDING A NEW AIR BASE, SEVERAL MORE PIECES OF BRUNEI%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
COASTAL HIGHWAY, A MAJOR BRIDGE ACROSS THE BRUNEI RIVER AND 
PERHAPS A RE-TENDERING OF THE CONTRACT TO BUILD A COGENERATION 
PLANT.  CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN FIRM HAS INDICATED IT BELIEVES 
IT HAS A GOOD CHANCE AT THESE, BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTION WITH 
SINARAN.  IF ALL THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS SET OUT TO BUILD 
LARGE BUSINESSES WITHIN BRUNEI, THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER 
BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN WILL BE ACCORDINGLY LIMITED.  THIS IS 
EVEN MORE TRUE WHEN THE ACTIVITIES OF SISTERS AND OTHER 
ASSORTED IN-LAWS ARE ADDED.  SEVERAL SECOND-RANKING TRADING 
AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS COUNT ROYALTY AMONG THEIR OWNERS. 
 
11.  THE CONCLUSION IS THAT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE ROYAL 
FAMILY DOMINATES THE MALAY BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO AN EXTENT THAT 
PROBABLY IS CAUSING GREATER DISSATISFACTION THAN THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH THEY DOMINATE THE NATION%SINGLEQUOTES%S POLITICS.  MOTIVES MAY BE 
TRADITIONAL BUSINESS REASONS, AND THE ECONOMIC DOMINANCE 
INADVERTENT, MERELY THE NATURAL RESULT OF BETTER FINANCING AND 
GOOD CONNECTIONS, BUT THE RESENTMENT BEARS WATCHING.  OFFICIALS 
OF THE TWO BIG COMPANIES THEMSELVES ARE AWARE OF IT, BUT THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH THE ROYAL FAMILY BELIEVES IT SOMETHING TO 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS UNKNOWN.  PRINCE SUFRI%SINGLEQUOTES%S BUSINESS 
PROSPECTS MAY BE BOTH DEPENDENT ON AND AN INDICATION OF THE 
EXISTENCE OF SUCH CONCERN.

ANNIVERSARY: MARKING THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
VIOLENT DEATH OF THE MOSLEM CLERIC SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB, 
THE IMAM OF THE VILLAGE OF JABSHIT IN SOUTH LEBANON, 
%QUOTES%HIZBULLAH%QUOTES% STAGED A MASS RALLY AT THE CHIYAH SUBURB 
SATURDAY, FEB. 16, 1985.  SHEIKH HARB WAS A STAUNCH 
OPPONENT OF ISRAEL OCCUPATION, AND AN ADVOCATE OF 
%QUOTES%HIZBULLAH%QUOTES% AND THE RISE OF A PAN-ISLAMIC %QUOTES%NATION OF THE 
PARTY OF GOD.%QUOTES%  HE WAS ASSASSINATED REPORTEDLY BY

LEBANESE SYSTEM AS %QUOTES%DESPOTIC%QUOTES% AND RENOUNCED THE REGIME

TO HAVE MARCHED INTO SIDON MONDAY, FEB. 18,

SMASHED A NUMBER OF STORES AND SUPER MARKETS 
SELLING LIQUOR, AND RAISED IRANIAN FLAGS AND 
PORTRAITS OF THE IRANIAN RELIGIOUS LEADER

E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR 
TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, SHUM, EG 
SUBJECT:  GROWING DEBATE ON SHARIA LAW 
 
REF:  CAIRO 5284 
 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY.  MOMENTUM IS BEGINNING TO BUILD TOWARD 
A MAY DEBATE IN THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ON ISLAMIC SHARIA 
(KORANIC LAW).  IN RECENT DAYS, KEY OPPOSITION FIGURES 
FUAD SIRAJ AL-DIN (CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW WAFD PARTY) AND 
OMAR TALMASSANI (GENERAL GUIDE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD) 
APPEARED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY%SINGLEQUOTES%S RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR PURGING OF EXISTING LEGISLATION 
NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA.  THE SPEAKER OF THE 
ASSEMBLY, RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, WHILE SUPPORTING THE OVERALL 
OBJECTIVE, LEFT DELIBERATELY VAGUE THE TIMING AND EXTENT 
OF THE PURGE.  THE ADVOCATES DOUBTLESS KNOW THE PROCESS 
OF IMPLEMENTING %QUOTES%FULL SHARIA%QUOTES% WILL BE PROTRACTED; INDEED, 
MUBARAK IS PERCEIVED AS UNCOMPROMISING IN OPPOSITION TO 
%QUOTES%THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.%QUOTES%  IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY 
DEBATE PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF, AND MANEUVERING ABOUT, SHARIA 
ISSUES IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  WE RECENTLY REPORTED AT LENGTH ON MUBARAK%SINGLEQUOTES%S EVOLVING 
DEMOCRACY -- SEE CAIRO 5284.  THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC IN THE 
LAST FEW DAYS HAS WITNESSED A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION 
OF THIS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, AS WAFD PARTY CHAIRMAN FUAD 
SIRAJ AL-DIN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GENERAL GUIDE OMAR 
TALMASSANI BOTH ATTENDED HEARINGS OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY 
RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.  THEIR ATTENDANCE, PROMI- 
NENTLY REPORTED ON TELEVISION AND IN THE PRESS, WAS A 
SIGNAL OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT 
AND TWO OF THE CHIEF FOES OF FORMER PRESIDENTS NASSER 
AND SADAT. 
 
- 
4.  THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEARINGS, ALSO 
ATTENDED BY SPEAKER RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, A NUMBER OF 
AL-AZHAR SHEIKHS, AND OTHER ISLAMIC EXPERTS, ARE IN 
PREPARATION FOR A MAY ASSEMBLY DEBATE ON SHARIA (KORANIC) 
LAW.  MAHGOUB MADE CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S SUPPORT FOR 
%QUOTES%PURGING%QUOTES% EXISTING LEGISLATION OF PROVISIONS IN CONFLICT 
WITH SHARIA, AND HE WAS ECHOED BY SIRAJ AL-DIN, 
TALMASSANI, AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTY FIGURES.  THE 
SPEAKER, HOWEVER, WAS DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THE 
TIMING AND SPEED OF THE PURGE, AS WELL AS ABOUT HOW FAR 
IT WOULD GO IN CHANGING THE MYRIAD LAWS ON THE EGYPTIAN 
BOOKS.  THE EXCHANGES GAVE THE PUBLIC A TASTE OF MORE TO 
COME IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, EGYPTIAN STYLE, WHEREIN 
ALL SIDES CAN ADDRESS MAJOR ISLAMIC ISSUES LONG UNRESOLVED, 
BUT WITHOUT ANY CONCRETE RESULT LIKELY -- AT LEAST 
IMMEDIATELY. 
 
- 
5.  KEY QUESTIONS ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE TO EGYPTIAN 
SOCIETY -- THE TREATMENT OF THE COPTIC CHRISTIAN MINORITY 
IF SHARIA LAW IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED; POSSIBLE CHANGES IN 
THE STATUS OF WOMEN; THE IMPACT OF ABOLITION OF BANKING 
INTEREST ON THE ECONOMY; THE EFFECTS ON TOURISM OF BANNING 
ALCOHOL; WESTERN REACTION TO THE ADOPTION OF ISLAMIC PUN- 
ISHMENTS SUCH AS AMPUTATION, FLOGGING, AND STONING (EVEN 
IF SPARINGLY APPLIED).  FEW OBSERVERS EXPECT THESE DIF- 
FICULT ISSUES UNDERLYING THE SHARIA DEBATE TO BE RESOLVED 
IN THE ASSEMBLY DISCUSSIONS IN MAY.  THOUGH THEY CANNOT 
SAY SO PUBLICLY, OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE SIRAJ AL-DIN AND 
TALMASSANI ACKNOWLEDGE PRIVATELY THAT THE SHARIA DEBATE 
WILL ONLY BE THE BEGINNING OF A LONG UNCERTAIN PROCESS. 
INDEED, NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND OPPOSITION OBSERV- 
ERS BELIEVE THAT MUBARAK WILL NOT COMPROMISE IN HIS OP- 
POSITION TO %QUOTES%THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA,%QUOTES% BECAUSE 
THE SOCIAL, SECTARIAN, AND INTERNATIONAL COSTS ARE TOO 
HIGH.  WHAT MARGINAL COMPROMISES, IF ANY, HE MAY CONCEDE 
 
- 
6.  MEANWHILE, HAPPENINGS ON OTHER FRONTS ARE BOTH 
PROVOKING AND REENFORCING PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF ISLAMIC 
SHARIA ISSUES.  HANDLING OF SUCH DISPARATE SUBJECTS AS 
OPPOSITION POLITICAL ALLIANCES, PUNISHMENT OF RAPE, AND 
WOMEN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RIGHTS INCREASINGLY FEED THE DEBATE.  TO WIT: 
 
--  ONE OF THE STRONGEST PROPONENTS OF SHARIA, SHEIKH 
SALAH ABU ISMAIL, WAS HASTILY EXPELLED FROM THE NEW WAFD 
OPPOSITION PARTY AFTER CRITICIZING SIRAJ AL-DIN FOR NOT 
PUSHING SHARIA HARD ENOUGH.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE 
TALMASSANI TURNED HIS BACK ON THE OUTSPOKEN SHEIKH AND 
HAS MAINTAINED THE MB%SINGLEQUOTES%S ALLIANCE WITH THE WAFD. 
TALMASSANI OBSERVED TO POLCOUNS AND POLOFF MARCH 5 THAT 
THE SHEIKH SOMETIMES SPEAKS OUT BEFORE HE CONSIDERS ALL 
THE CONSEQUENCES; SHEIKH SALAH WAS NOW IN THE PROCESS 
OF MAKING PEACE WITH THE WAFD (THOUGH NOTHING WAS SAID 
ABOUT HIS BEING RETURNED TO THE PARTY). 
 
--  SHARIA PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN LOUDLY CALLING FOR THE 
EXECUTION OF OFFENDERS IN SEVERAL NOTORIOUS KIDNAP/RAPE 
INCIDENTS IN RECENT WEEKS.  THE OPPOSITION PRESS IS 
GIVING FULL PUBLICITY TO THIS EVIDENCE OF EROSION IN 
TRADITIONAL EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MORES.  PUBLIC FEELING IS 
RUNNING HIGH IN CAIRO, AMIDST CHARGES THAT OFFENDERS 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOFT TREATMENT IN THE COURTS.  SOME 
CRITICS, IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR SEVERE %QUOTES%ISLAMIC%QUOTES% 
PUNISHMENT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT EXECUTION FOR KIDNAP/RAPE 
IS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PRESENT LEGAL CODE.  (MANY ALSO 
ARE NOW SAYING THAT AMERICAN-MADE TV FILMS ABOUT VIOLENCE 
AND CRIME AVAILABLE ON EGYPTIAN TELEVISION ARE CORRUPTING 
THE YOUTH.) 
 
--  THE MINISTER OF AWQAF (ISLAMIC ENDOWMENTS) AND THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY%SINGLEQUOTES%S COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE HAVE GONE 
PUBLIC WITH DEMANDS TO AMEND THE LAW OF PERSONAL STATUS -- 
SO THAT SHARIA PROVISIONS REGARDING DIVORCE AND PROPERTY 
EOULD AGAIN BE ENFORCED.  THE LAW, PASSED UNDER THE LATE 
PRESIDENT SADAT AND INFORMALLY NAMED THE %QUOTES%JEHAN LAW%QUOTES% 
AFTER HIS WIFE, GAVE THE WIFE THE RIGHT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME TO INITIATE DIVORCE IF HER HUSBAND MARRIED A SECOND 
WIFE; THE LAW ALSO GAVE A DIVORCED WIFE FIRST RIGHTS TO 
THE HOUSEHOLD UNTIL SHE IS PROVIDED EQUIVALENT QUARTERS. 
TODAY, IMPORTANT SHEIKHS, WHO IN 1979 TRIMMED THEIR 
INTERPRETATIONS TO SUIT %QUOTES%WOMEN%SINGLEQUOTES%S RIGHTS%QUOTES% PUSHED BY SADAT 
AND HIS WIFE, HAVE BEGUN TACKING TOWARD A MORE LITERAL 
INTERPRETATION OF SHARIA. 
 
7.  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF GROWING SHARIA DISCUSSIONS, 
THE STATE AUTHORITIES     IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE 
AGAINST FRINGE ELEMENTS OF THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS SPECTRUM. 
 
--  AT CAIRO%SINGLEQUOTES%S AL-NUR MOSQUE, A MAGNET FOR ISLAMIC HARD- 
LINERS IN THE CAPITAL, RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS (SOME FROM 
AL-JIHAD, SOME FOR AL-HIDAIYA AL-ISLAMIYA) HAVE BEEN 
PICKED UP ON THREE SUCCESSIVE WEEKENDS FOLLOWING FRIDAY 
PRAYERS -- FOR DISTRIBUTING LEAFLETS WHOSE CONTENTS HAVE 
NOT BEEN REPORTED.  NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN PLACED, AND THE 
DETAINEES RELEASED UPON PAYMENT OF TOKEN FINES.  SIMILAR 
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED (BUT NOT DETAILED) IN THE 
UNIVERSITY TOWNS OF MINYA AND ASSIUT AGAINST FORMER 
DEFENDANTS FREED LAST OCTOBER IN THE PROLONGED TRIAL OF 
THOSE CHARGED IN THE ARMED REVOLT FOLLOWING SADAT%SINGLEQUOTES%S 1981 
ASSASSINATION. (BEHIND THE SCENES THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF 
SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING TO EXERCISE SUPERVISION OVER AL-NUR, 
WHOSE LEADING SHEIKH IS STILL DENIED THE PULPIT.  IN THE 
LATTER SADAT YEARS, AL-NUR MOSQUE DREW UP TO THIRTY 
THOUSAND WORSHIPPERS ON FRIDAYS TO LISTEN TO ANTI-SADAT 
SERMONS.) 
 
--  IN ALEXANDRIA, A %QUOTES%CRAZY DOCTOR%QUOTES% WAS ARRESTED ALONG 
WITH 30 OR SO FOLLOWERS; HE CLAIMED TO BE THE PROPHET 
MOHAMED, AND HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS PLUS 
IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT.  NO CHARGES HAVE YET BEEN FILED. 
 
--  IN LATE FEBRUARY, SOME 40 BAHAIS WERE ARRESTED FOR 
VIOLATING A 1960 NASSER DECREE (STILL IN EFFECT) OUTLAWING 
BAHAI ACTIVITIES IN EGYPT.  AN AL-AZHAR UNDERSECRETARY 
SENT DOCUMENTS TO THE STATE SECURITY PROSECUTOR SHOWING 
THAT THE BAHAIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED %QUOTES%APOSTATES%QUOTES% 
FROM ISLAM.  (THE BAHAIS HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN RELEASED 
WITHOUT CHARGES AND ARE PRESENTLY REMAINING IN THEIR 
HOMES.  SEE CAIRO 06100.) 
- 
--  ON FEBRUARY 26 TALMASSANI WAS SUDDENTLY (AND WITH- 
OUT EXPLANATION) FORBIDDEN ACCESS TO CAIRO UNIVERSITY. 
HE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS A MEETING AT THE COM- 
MERCE COLLEGE, AT THE INVITATION OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL. 
PERMISSION WAS IN WRITING, AND STAMPED BY THE VICE 
CHANCELLOR%SINGLEQUOTES%S OFFICE.  HOWEVER, HE TOLD POLCOUNS AT 9:30 
ON THE MORNING OF THE SPEECH, HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE 
PERMISSION HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN.  THE STUDENT DEMONSTRA- 
TION FOLLOWED (SEE CAIRO 5919).  TALMASSANI CRITICIZED 
THE DECISION TO US, NOTING THAT THE STUDENT COUNCIL HAD 
A %QUOTES%MODERATE%QUOTES% ISLAMIC MAJORITY (SUPPORTED BY MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD) AND THAT HIS APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE PACIFIED - 
NOT INCITED - THE STUDENTS. 
 
- 
8.  COMMENT:  THESE MOVES REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT%SINGLEQUOTES%S 
POLISHING OF ITS OWN ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS (IN THE CASES 
OF THE BAHAIS AND ALEXANDRIA%SINGLEQUOTES%S DERANGED PROPHET), AND 
SETTING LIMITS FOR ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL/RELIGIOUS BE- 
HAVIOR (IN THE CASE OF AL-NUR MOSQUEAND THE BANNING 
OF TALMASSANI%SINGLEQUOTES%S UNIVERSITY SPEECH.) AS FOR THE INCIPIENT 
DEBATE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND PRESS ON SHARIA, IT IS AT THIS 
STAGE MORE SHADOW THAN SUBSTANCE; BUT IT IS NONETHELESS 
AN IMPORTANT REFLECTION OF THE MOOD OF THE SOCIETY.  PRO- 
FOUND SOCIAL ISSUES ARE INVOLVED.  THE GOAL OF %QUOTES%SECULAR- 
ISTS%QUOTES% WHO RUN THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENCOMPASS MODERATE 
ISLAMIC ELEMENTS WITHIN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, UNDERCUT- 
TING EXTREMISM WHILE PREVENTING THE ADOPTION OF THE COM- 
PLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.  THE ISLAMIC SIDE, WHICH 
INCLUDES THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND TO SOME EXTENT THE 
WAFD, PLUS MAINSTREAM MUSLIM LEADERS FROM AL-AZHAR AND 
THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF, HOPES TO USE THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS TO BUILD UP AN IRREVERSIBLE MOMENTUM TOWARD 
SHARIA.  BOTH SIDES AT PRESENT ARE KEEN TO MAINTAIN THE 
STABILITY OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY, THOUGH MISMANAGEMENT OF 
THE SHARIA ISSUE COULD CREATE SERIOUS TENSIONS.  END 
COMMENT.
