SUMMARY:  ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PUNJAB STATE ON AUGUST 6 IN CONTINUING SECTARIAN STRIFE. DELHI POLICE ARE GEARING UP TO MEET THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY BEFORE THE INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS ON AUGUST 15.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI'S CONVENTION, HELD AUGUST 4, PROVIDED A FORUM FOR EXTREME AND MODERATE POINTS OF VIEW WITH NO OBVIOUS MEETING OF MINDS.  END SUMMARY  2.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS ELEVEN PEOPLE--NINE OF WHOM WERE HINDUS--WERE KILLED IN TERRORIST RELATED VIOLENCE IN PUNJAB ON AUGUST 6.  TWO ALLEGED TERRORISTS WERE KILLED BY SECURITY FORCES WHO RECOVERED A US MADE AUTOMATIC WEAPON FROM ONE OF THE BODIES.  ALMOST ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE IN AMRITSAR DISTRICT.  A COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA ACTIVIST, AND GENERAL SECRETARY OF PARA MEDICAL EMPLOYEES, WAS SHOT BY THREE TERRORISTS.  THE KILLERS, WHO LEFT A NOTE CLAIMING TO BE FROM THE RANJIT SINGH RANA GROUP, ESCAPED ON THE VICTIM'S SCOOTER.  3.  ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE HOME MINISTRY \"HAS DEFINITE INFORMATION THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE PLOTTING DO SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE\" IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO INDEPENDENCE DAY.  OTHER SOURCES REPORT THAT THE TERRORISTS WILL PROBABLY STRIKE ON AUGUST 15 FOR MAXIMUM ALL-INDIA ATTENTION.  DELHI POLICE, REELING FROM THEIR FAILURE TO STOP RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE POSH SOUTH DELHI HOUSING COLONIES, ARE STEPPING UP THEIR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL POSSIBLE TERRORIST ENTRY TO THE CITY.  ALL ENTRY POINTS TO THE CITY ARE NOW GUARDED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE POLICE HAVE REPORTEDLY IMPROVED THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT TERRORISTS WOULD NECESSARILY STRIKE IN DELHI, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE PUBLICITY THEY DESIRE.  BOTH HARYANA AND PUNJAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR SECURITY MECHANISMS.  4.  ACTING JATHEDAR DARSHAN SINGH RAGI CONTINUED HIS LONE CAMPAIGN FOR A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE MILITANTS AND MODERATES WITH A SIKH CONVENTION ON AUGUST 4. (SEE REFTEL)  THE CONVENTION WAS A NOISY AFFAIR WITH LITTLE CONGRUENCE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE MODERATES AND MILITANTS AND AN ABUNDANCE OF RADICALISM ON THE PART OF THE MILITANTS.  ALTHOUGH MANY PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONVENTION CLEARLY DEMANDED NO LESS THAN KHALISTAN, THE CONVENTION RESOLUTION CALLED FOR THE SIKHS TO BE GIVEN AN \"AREA AND POLITICAL SETUP IN NORTH INDIA WHERE SIKHS CAN EXPERIENCE THE GLOW OF FREEDOM.\"  ACCORDING TO RAGI, THE DEMAND WAS A SPINOFF FROM AN ASSURANCE GIVEN TO THE SIKHS BY JAWAHARLAL NEHRU IN 1946.  EXPANDING ON THE THEME, THE HIGH PRIEST EXPLAINED THAT THE PROPOSED \"SET-UP\" WOULD RESULT IN GREATER AUTONOMY FOR THE STATE.  A SIKH CLAIMING TO REPRESENT SIKHS LIVING OUTSIDE PUNJAB SAID THAT SIKH DEMANDS REPRESENTED DEMANDS OF ALL INDIAN STATES AND URGED THE HIGH PRIESTS TO START A NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED AUTONOMY.  5.  MODERATE SPEAKERS CALLED FOR A NON-VIOLENT STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF THE SIKHS AND MOST SPEAKERS DEMANDED IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANANDAPUR SAHIB RESOLUTION WHICH CALLED FOR GREATER AUTONOMY IN THE STATES.  THE MILITANTS, AS WAS EXPECTED, DEMANDED THE FORMATION OF KHALISTAN AND DECLARED THAT THE GUN WAS THE ONLY ANSWER FOR THE SIKHS.  THE MILITANT GROUPS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BABBAR KHALSA, ALL QUESTIONED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HIGH PRIESTS BUT MADE NO MOVES TO REPLACE THEM.  IN RAGI'S CONCLUDING STATEMENT HE AGREED WITH THE MILITANTS THAT THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS WITHOUT WEAPONS.   BUT, THE HIGH PRIEST NOTED, WEAPONS MUST CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND THE TIMES NO LONGER CALLED FOR VIOLENT STRUGGLE.  THE TIME HAD COME, RAGI PLEADED, \"FOR UNITY BETWEEN THOSE WHO FAVORED THE GUN AND THOSE WHO FAVORED NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.\"  6.  THE CONVENTION WAS ATTENDED BY SOME FIVE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS ALL OF WHOM PASSED THROUGH STRICT POLICE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE ENTERING THE GOLDEN TEMPLE.  MODERATE POLITICIANS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AKALI DAL (L), WERE NOT INVITED TO ATTEND THE CONVENTION.  PARTICIPANTS DID INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE \"UNIFIED\" AKALI DAL, THE BABBAR KHALSA, BOTH THE MANJIT SINGH AND GURJIT SINGH FACTIONS OF THE ALL INDIA SIKH STUDENTS FEDERATION, THE BHINDRANWALE TIGERS FORCE OF KHALISTAN, THE KHALISTAN COMMANDO FORCE, THE KHALISTAN LIBERATION FORCE, THE SIKH INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL AND THE DALIT FRONT.  INDIVIDUALS LAWYERS, INTELLECTUALS AND RETIRED MILITARY ALSO ATTENDED.  7.  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE AND THE FLAT RESULT OF DARSHAN SINGH RAGI'S ATTEMPTS TO FORGE MILITANT-MODERATE UNITY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON THE SIKH'S SIDE OF THE PUNJAB DILEMMA.  THE SPEECHES AT THE SIKH CONVENTION SHOW THE DEEP DIFFERENCES THAT REMAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. INDEED, THE FINAL DECLARATION IS AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO PAPER OVER THESE DIVISIONS.  DARSHAN SINGH RAGI'S ATTEMPT WAS WELL RECEIVED BY POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND THE HIGH PRIEST REMAINS THE BEST HOPE FOR SOME SOLUTION.   STREEB " }

(C) SUMMARY. ON SEPTEMBER 24 THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ISSUED ANOTHER WARNING TO THE LTTE THAT IT WILL RESPOND MORE FORCEFULLY IF THE TAMIL MILITANT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT STOP HAMPERING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD.  THE MEA SPOKESMAN BLAMED THE LTTE FOR INSTIGATING AND ENGINEERING A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION SEPTEMBER 23 BETWEEN SRI LANKAN CIVILIANS AND ELEMENTS OF THE INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE (IPKF).  THE GROWING THREAT OF SUCH CLASHES BETWEEN SRI LANKANS AND INDIAN TROOPS APPARENTLY LIES BEHIND THE DECISION TO SEND SEVERAL BATTALIONS OF INDIAN POLICE INTO THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA (REFTEL).  THERE IS GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THE LTTE CONTINUES ITS PROVOCATIONS, THE INDIAN FORCES SHOULD MOVE MORE DECISIVELY AGAINST IT.  END SUMMARY.  2. (U) THE MEA SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED THAT A CROWD OF 900 TO 1000 PEOPLE--MAINLY LTTE SUPPORTERS WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE VANGUARD--COLLECTED IN FRONT OF THE IPKF CAMP IN MANNAR, OSTENSIBLY WANTING TO PRESENT A PETITION TO THE LOCAL INDIAN MILITARY COMMANDER. WHILE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE FOR RECEIVING THE PETITION, THE LTTE SUPPORTERS REPORTEDLY STARTED THROWING STRONES, SHOUTING SLOGANS, AND PUSHING THE CROWD INTO THE CAMP.  THE IPKF FIRED FIVE ROUNDS.  TWO PERSONS REPORTEDLY WERE WOUNDED BY THE FIRING AND 17 INJURED N THE RESULTING STAMPEDE.  ACCORDING TO THE LTTE, ONE OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE SUBSEQUENTLY DIED.  ACCORDING TO THE MEA SPOKESMAN, THE USE OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS A COVER FOR THE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WAS \"REPREHENSIBLE AND COWARDLY.\"  HE WARNED THEAT INDIAN TROOPS WOULD BE \"COMPELLED TO RESPOND WITH EVEN STRONGER MEASURES IF VIOLENCE IS DELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY THE LTTE.\"  3. (U) ACCORDING TO MAJOR INDIAN NEWSPAPERS ON SEPTEMBER 25, BOTH THE INDIAN AND SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING IPKF-CIVILIAN TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND AGREED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE INDIAN PARALIMITARY RESERVE POLICE FORCE (REFTEL) IS NECESSARY FOR CROWD-CONTROL DUTIES.  \"IT WAS FELT BY BOTH COUNTRIES THAT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF INDIA THE ARMY MUST NOT BE USED REGULARLY TO PREVENT ETHNIC OR OTHER RIOTS EXCEPT IN EXTREME EMERGENCIES AND FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS.  IT IS ALSO FELT THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE ARMY SOMETIMES ACTS AS AN IRRITANT TO GROUPS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN WARFARE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. . . .  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRPF UNITS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH TEARGAS SHELLS, RUBBER BULLETS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER SUCH VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS BY MOBS. . . . THESE FORCES CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PATROLLING AREAS FROM WHERE REPORTS OF COLONIZATION BY SINHALAS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.\"  4. (C) COMMENT.  SUCCESSIVE GOI WARNINGS TO THE LTTE HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIGH EMPHASIS IN THE INDIAN MEDIA. THERE APPEARS TO BE A GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG INFORMED INDIANS--WHICH IS BEGINNING TO BE EXPRESSED IN NEWSPAPER COMMENTARIES--THAT THE IPKF MUST MOVE DECISIVELY AND FAST TO PREVENT THE INDO-SRI LANKA ACCORD FROM GOING \"THE WAY OF THE PUNJAB ACCORD.\" THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE GOI WON AMONG TAMILS BY ITS AIR-DROP IN JUNE IS BEING ERODED BY LTTE PROPOGANDA ALLEGING THAT THE IPKF IS ACTING AS AN ALLY OF THE COLOMBO GOVERNMENT.  \"THE SITUATION CAN BE SAVED AND THE ATMOSPHERE CREATED FOR MODERATE LEADERS TO COME INTO THE OPEN,\" THE TIMES OF INDIA STATES, \"ONLY IF THE INDIAN TROOPS MOVE QUICKLY AND DISARM THE LTTE COMPLETELY.\"   DEAN " }

POST PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION, OBTAINED BY THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICE THROUGH ITS CONTACTS IN THE INDIAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU IN THE HOME MINISTRY, WHICH PROVIDED A WRITTEN REPORT ON THE JKIF.  POLOFFS HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE FROM CONTACTS IN KASHMIR VALLEY REGARDING THE JKIF, AS MOST OF THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE VALLEY.  NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE VARIOUS MILITANT GROUPS IN KASHMIR HAVE NEVER INCLUDED THE JKIF AS A MILITANT GROUP OF PROMINENCE IN KASHMIR.  BEGIN TEXT  (ENTIRE TEXT IS CONFIDENTIAL):  JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF)  THE GENESIS OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) DATES BACK TO 1989 WHEN ITS PRECURSOR, THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR STUDENTS LIBERATION FRONT (JKSLF), WAS FLOATED BY HILAL BEG FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES WITH YASIN MALIK, THE THEN COMMANDER- IN-CHIEF OF JKLF.  THE JKSLF INDULGED IN HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER CASES.  LATER IN APRIL 1991, HILAL BEG WAS PERSUADED BY PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (ISI) TO RENAME THE JKSLF AS IKHWAN-UL-MUSALMEEN (IUM).  THE IUM LED BY HILAL BEG WAS TASKED BY PAKISTAN ISI TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE JAMMU AND KASHMIR. FOR THIS PURPOSE, HILAL BEG CREATED A NETWORK OF HIS AGENTS IN CALCUTTA, BIHAR, ANDHRA PRADESH, KATHMANDU, AND DHAKA. THE ARREST OF FOUR MUSLIM TERRORISTS (INCLUDING 3 KASHMIRIS) IN OCTOBER 1993 AT HYDERABAD AND CALCUTTA REVEALED THE PLANS OF THE IUM TO STAGE BOMBAY-TYPE BLASTS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF INDIA BY RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND ORGANISING GROUPS OF SABOTEURS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE JKIF WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY ONE SAJJAD AHMED KENU, WHO WAS A WELL-KNOWN ACTIVIST OF THE IUM.  SAJJAD KENU HAD ESCAPED FROM SRINAGAR JAIL IN JUNE 1995 AND RESURFACED AS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE JKIF IN SEPTEMBER 1995. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE JKIF HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM ITS PAKISTAN-BASED LEADERSHIP TO CARRY OUT BOMB BLASTS OUTSIDE J&K, PARTICULARLY IN DELHI.  ON NOVEMBER 21, 1995, THE JKIF KINGPIN KHURSHEED AHMED, A.K.A. NAYEEM (SINCE KILLED), ENGINEERED A HIGH INTENSITY BLAST WITH THE HELP OF TWO SIKHS, NAMELY HARDEEP SINGH, A.K.A. NEELA, AND HIS BROTHER RAJINDER, CLOTH VENDORS IN SRINAGAR.  THIS EXPLOSION, IN THE CONNAUGHT PLACE AREA OF NEW DELHI, INJURED 23 PERSONS AND DAMAGED A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND SHOPS. BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1995, THE SAME SIKH MILITANTS ALSO CAUSED TWO SIMULTANEOUS GRENADE EXPLOSIONS NEAR THE RED FORT IN DELHI, INJURING 47 PERSONS.  THE JKIF ALSO CAUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSION IN SADAR BAZAR, DELHI, ON JANUARY 3, 1996, IN WHICH 7 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 36 INJURED.  THE JKIF WAS CONTROLLED FROM PAKISTAN BY PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER MEMON (PRIME ACCUSED IN THE BOMBAY BOMB BLAST CASES OF 1993).  THEIR CONTACT IN PAKISTAN-OCCUPIED KASHMIR WAS BILAL BEG, WHO WAS RUNNING AN INDOCTRINATION CAMP NEAR MUZAFFARABAD, FUNDED EXTENSIVELY BY THE ISI TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIA, ONE COLONEL FAROOQ OF PAKISTAN ISI TASKED BILAL BEG AND TIGER MEMON TO UTILISE KATHMANDU-BASED ACTIVISTS LATEEF AND JAVED KRAWAH TO SET OFF BLASTS IN DELHI BEFORE THE LOK SABHA [UPPER HOUSE OF THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT] ELECTIONS.  A TEAM OF COMMITTED JKIF CADRES WAS GIVEN A TWO WEEK SPECIALISED CAPSULE COURSE IN EXPLOSIVES NEAR THE AFGHAN BORDER IN MARCH-APRIL 1996.  ON MAY 21, 1996, THIS JKIF TEAM SET OFF A VERY HIGH INTENSITY EXPLOSION AT LAJPAT NAGAR, NEW DELHI, IN WHICH 13 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 40 OTHERS INJURED.  THE RDX USED IN THIS BLAST WAS BROUGHT FROM KATHMANDU.  ALTHOUGH OTHER ACCUSED, NAMELY FAROOQ KHAN, A.K.A. ANWAR SADAT LATIF, JAVED CHHOTA, MEHMOOD KILLE, NAZA (ALL KASHMIRIS) AND NAUSHAD (A DELHI MUSLIM) WERE ARRESTED, JAVED KRAWAH AND RIAZ, A.K.A. RIAZ MULLA, MANAGED TO ESCAPE. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS, JAVED KRAWAH IS IN PAKISTAN AT PRESENT.  THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION IN A RAJASTHAN ROADWAYS BUS NEAR DAUSA ON MAY 22, 1996 WAS ALSO ENGINEERED BY THE JKIF.  ANOTHER JKIF TEAM UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ABDUL GANI, A.K.A. ASSADULLAH, WAS SENT TO EXECUTE A BOMB BLAST IN AHMEDABAD.  THE BLAST WAS PREVENTED BY THE TIMELY ARREST OF TEAM MEMBERS IN AHMEDABAD AND THE SEIZURE OF THEIR HIGH GRADE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL.  JKIF AGAIN PLANNED A CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS IN DELHI BEFORE REPUBLIC DAY 1997 AT THE BEHEST OF PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER MEMON.  ONE FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, TASKED BY BILAL AHMED BEG AND JAVED KRAWAH IN PAKISTAN, WAS GIVEN 20 KG OF RDX AND MONEY IN KATHMANDU.  BEFORE HE COULD EXECUTE THE PLAN, FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, ALONG WITH GHULAM RASOOL MIR, A.K.A. GOGA, AIJAZ AHMED CHOUDHARY, NAZIR AHMED, AND MANZOOR AHMED DANPOSH, A.K.A. JAN, WERE ARRESTED IN KATHMANDU ON DECEMBER 11, 1996.  FOR ALL THESE VIOLENT ACTIVITIES, THE JKIF HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USING KATHMANDU AS ITS BASE WITH THE ACTIVE CONNIVANCE OF PAKISTAN ISI.  TO DISPATCH MEN AND MATERIAL, AND TO EXECUTE EXPLOSIONS IN INDIA, KATHMANDU WAS INVARIABLY MADE THE NODAL POINT AND JKIF EXPLOITED THE VULNERABLE KATHMANDU-BASED KASHMIRI BUSINESSMEN FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES SINCE THEY HAD A READYMADE AND CLEAN PAST.  JKIF KINGPIN JAVED KRAWAH HIMSELF USED TO RUN A CARPET BUSINESS IN KATHMANDU.  END TEXT  WISNER " }

(C)  SUMMARY:  INDIAN OFFICIAL REACTION TO PAKISTAN'S RECENT FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE (REFTEL) HAS BEEN MEASURED THUS FAR.  THE NEWS OF THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST RAN SECOND TO THE CORONATION OF SONIA GANDHI AS THE NEW LEADER OF THE CONGRESS PARTY IN MOST NEWSPAPERS ON APRIL 7.  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES GAVE A COOL AND DELIBERATE STATEMENT TO A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEW DELHI ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 6, NOTING THAT INDIA HAD PRIOR INFORMATION OF THE TEST.  FERNANDES DREW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TEST FIRING OF THE MISSILE AND PRODUCTION, BUT HE AVOIDED ANY COMMENT ON INDIA'S AGNI MISSILE PROGRAM. THE DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND SECURITY AFFAIRS (DISA) IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECENT SENIOR INTERAGENCY MEETING TO DISCUSS INDIA'S RESPONSE TO THE MISSILE TEST.  END SUMMARY  PROMINENT COVERAGE--BUT RELATIVELY MILD REACTION --------------------------------------------- --- 2.  (U)  INDIAN NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION PROVIDED EXTENSIVE BUT NOT INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OF THE RECENT TEST OF PAKISTAN'S GHAURI BALLISTIC MISSILE.  MOST OF THE PRESS STORIES DREW HEAVILY FROM INFORMATION RELEASED PUBLICLY BY PAKISTAN'S FOREIGN MINISTRY AS WELL AS THEIR OWN DECIDEDLY INDIAN ACCOUNT OF FACTS, SUCH AS THE TIMES OF INDIA CLAIM THAT THE TEST WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE KAHUTA NUCLEAR RESEARCH LABORATORY. THIS EVENT HAS PROVIDED ANOTHER FORUM FOR PROMINENT HAWKS IN THE MEDIA--SUCH AS IDSA'S DIRECTOR JASJIT SINGH--TO RENEW CALLS FOR INDIA'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGNI BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.  OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE ALSO PORTRAYED THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST AS CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE U.S. HAS FAILED TO STOP COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND PAKISTAN IN BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY.  INDEED, MUCH OF THE INDIAN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THINKING SEEMS TO REFLECT THE INHERENT DISDAIN FOR PAKISTAN'S SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, OF WHICH BRAHMIN HINDUS ARE CONVINCED COULD NOT PRODUCE SUCH A MISSILE INDEPENDENTLY.  3.  (U)  DEFENSE MINISTER GEORGE FERNANDES WAS THE GOI'S MAIN SPOKESMAN FOR THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS ISSUE.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE APRIL 6, HE MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:  --   INDIA'S OWN MISSILE PROGRAM IS CONTINUING. PRITHVI MISSILES ARE CAPABLE OF REACHING ANYWHERE IN PAKISTAN;  --   INDIA HAD PRIOR WARNING THAT ISLAMABAD HAD BEEN PREPARING TO TEST A MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE; HE DESCRIBED THE TEST AS NOT UNEXPECTED BUT OF A SERIOUS NATURE, ALTHOUGH INDIA AND PAKISTAN ARE NOT IN A WAR-LIKE SITUATION;  --   THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TESTING AND PRODUCTION; AND  --   IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN SINO-PAKISTANI MISSILE COOPERATION DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF MULTILATERAL CONTROL REGIMES.   SOME INSIGHTS FROM MEA ---------------------- 4.  (C)  POLOFF MET WITH AJIT KUMAR, DIRECTOR FOR DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS IN THE MINISTRY FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ON APRIL 7 (SEE SEPTEL FOR A DISCUSSION OF CWC ISSUES).  KUMAR CONFIRMED THAT SENIOR INDIAN OFFICIALS FROM SEVERAL MINISTRIES HAD MET SEVERAL DAYS AGO TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION REGARDING THE GHAURI MISSILE TEST.  KUMAR OPINED THAT FERNANDES WAS SELECTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT BY THIS GROUP; MEA DID NOT INTEND TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT ON THE MATTER.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, KUMAR AGREED THAT THE MISSILE ISSUE WAS RIPE FOR DISCUSSION IN AN INDO-PAKISTANI DIALOGUE, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF SECURITY ISSUES AS THE TWO SIDES REMAINED DEAD-LOCKED OVER THE PROCEDURAL LOGJAM OF ADDRESSING KASHMIR.  COMMENT ------- 5. (C)  IN RESPONDING TO THE PAKISTANI MISSILE TEST, WE SUSPECT THE INDIANS WILL ALLOW ACTIONS TO SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, WITH AN AGNI MISSILE TEST IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IT IS WORTH RECALLING COMMITMENTS BY PREVIOUS INDIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT THE AGNI PROGRAM REMAINED A HIGH PRIORITY, AND THAT THE INDIANS HAVE BEEN MULLING OVER A DECISION TO TEST THE AGNI FOR SOME TIME NOW. INDEED, JASJIT SINGH TOLD US THAT HE MADE ONE MORE RUN AT PUSHING FOR AN AGNI TEST DURING GUJRAL'S FINAL WEEKS IN OFFICE.  THIS BJP-LED GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DEFENSE A PROMINENT ISSUE IN ITS AGENDA AND SEVERAL OF ITS \"SECURITY EXPERTS\" HAVE CALLED FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF LONGER RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES TO ADDRESS THE PERCEIVED CHINA THREAT.  THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S COMMENTS THAT INDIA CAN TARGET ALL OF PAKISTAN WITH PRITHVI MISSILES CERTAINLY BOLSTERS ISLAMABAD'S BELIEF THAT IT NEEDS LONGER RANGE MISSILES TO KEEP UP WITH ITS SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBOR.  THE UPCOMING VISITS OF SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS WILL PRESENT A USEFUL OPPORTUNITY TO URGE RESTRAINT WITH BOTH SIDES, ALTHOUGH NEW DELHI ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO PORTRAY ITS MISSILE PROGRAMS AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CHINA THREAT.

DHAKA 3127      B. NEW DELHI 5486      C. CALCUTTA 350  Classified By: PolCouns Geoffrey Pyatt.  Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh watchers in New Delhi have reacted with concern to recent violence there, citing the August 21 attack on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina as symptomatic of a deterioration in the country's political culture, fueling instability in Bangladesh which contributes directly to violence in India's northeast.  Home Secretary Dhirendra Singh will raise these issues and others when he travels to Dhaka later in September.  In a new twist, some prominent Indian commentators are now blaming the GOI for having an inadequate Bangladesh policy.  The Bangladeshi High Commission insists Indo-Bangladesh relations are excellent. End Summary.  2. (C) While the April 2 Chittagong arms haul and the attempted assassination of the British High Commissioner in Sylhet, have worried Indian Bangladesh watchers, the August 21 attack on Awami League Leader Sheikh Hasina set off a new round of concern in New Delhi.  General (Retd.) Dipankar Banerjee, Director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies (IPCS) called the grenade attack \"a violent manifestation of Islamic extremism,\" which had grown in Bangladesh.  \"The Hindu\" editorialized that the incident was a result of the BDG's \"laissez faire attitude towards extremist groups.\"  Dr. Sreeradha Datta, Associate Fellow at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses (IDSA) warned us that pervasive lawlessness in many parts of Bangladesh enables extremist individuals and groups to operate outside Dhaka's reach.  Bangladesh's Backyard ---------------------  3. (C) These concerns about extremist groups based in Bangladesh, reiterated by MEA officials during Ambassador Cofer Black's Counterterrorism Joint Working Group meeting (Ref C), are nothing new.  What is new is that the GOI may be prepared to engage more directly with Dhaka to tackle some of these issues.  During his upcoming September 16-17 trip to Dhaka, Home Secretary Dhirendra Singh will provide to the BDG a list of insurgents' installations, for the sixth time, according to MEA Under Secretary (Bangladesh) Puneet Kundal. He told Poloff the meeting is intended to restart a dialogue on security issues that has been stalled since 2000.  Singh will also request the BDG to turn over fugitives the GOI believes have taken refuge in Bangladesh, reportedly including United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) Commander-in-Chief Paresh Barua.  The problem, Kundal explained, is that Bangladesh sees India's northeast as its \"backyard.\"  New Delhi can take no other approach, Kundal added, except to continue to have talks, biannually between the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles, and at the Home Secretary level.  4. (C) The August 21 attack on Hasina has deepened Indian concerns about the links between Bangladesh-based groups and guerrillas in India's northeast.  The group that Indian media reported as responsible for the incident, Harkat-ul-Jehad-I-Islami Bangladesh (HUJI-B), has connections that can be traced to India, according to Delhi-based South Asia Terrorism Portal's SATP.org.  SATP reports that HUJI-B is affiliated with the ULFA and runs ULFA camps in Bangladesh as well as sending its own members into West Bengal and Assam.  Retired General Banerjee remarked that corruption among India's Border Security Forces facilitates cross-border infiltration.  The MEA's Kundal added that there is an \"ethnolinguistic homogeneity\" among Bangladeshis and Indians in the border area which in combination with Dhaka's desire for \"leverage\" over New Delhi, contributes to the BDG's unwillingness to limit militant activity (Ref A).  Neglecting the Neighbor -----------------------  5. (U) The Sheikh Hasina incident has prompted a spate of analysis of New Delhi's policy towards Bangladesh by some of India's more prominent foreign policy commentators, with widespread concern that New Delhi's approach has been inadequate.  Head of South Asia Studies at Jawarhalal Nehru University (JNU) and strategic affairs writer C. Raja Mohan on August 27 accused the GOI of \"drift\" in its regional foreign policy.  Compared to India's current relationships with Pakistan and China (its \"two most difficult neighbors\") India's policy on Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives suffers from a \"lack of sustained attention and a seriousness of purpose.\"  The attempt on Hasina \"showcased the gathering storm,\" in Bangladesh, he wrote.   Similarly, Prem Shankar Jha, former editor of the Hindustan Times, wrote of the negative effects on Dhaka of India's \"past inaction.\"  The GOI has taken decisions that have profound impacts on Bangladesh, including river interlinking, without consulting Dhaka, which has fostered a deep resentment in Bangladesh about India, Jha argued.  6. (C) Echoing Mohan and Jha, the IDSA's Datta argued that New Delhi has contributed to poor ties with Dhaka by not keeping its neighbors happy, and that the countries suffer from a \"communication gap.\"  General Banerjee described India's policy towards Bangladesh as \"deliberately hands-off,\" although he noted that the GOI has few alternatives as India cannot interfere in Bangladesh's internal affairs.  Wary that India may have to pay a price for that policy, retired intelligence officer Bibhuti Bhusan Nandy charged in a long, two-part September op-ed piece that the NDA looked the other way while minorities became victim to \"fundamentalist forces.\"  Bangladesh as a Warning to India --------------------------------  7. (C) Prompted by these events \"Hindustan Times\" editor Manoj Joshi recently took his analysis of events in Bangladesh a step further asking whether India will go the way its dysfunctional neighbors already have.  Joshi argued that the domestic political situation of complete non-cooperation between the two dominant parties in Dhaka has \"allowed space for scores of uncontrolled extremist groups.\" Urging New Delhi to heed the warning sounding from India's borders, Joshi wrote that PM Singh should \"make the political-administrative system functional again,\" lest India go the way of Bangladesh.  High Commission: Everything is OK ---------------------------------  8. (C) Our contacts at the Bangladesh High Commission (BHC) have consistently maintained that reports of terrorist camps in Bangladesh are \"baseless\" and \"outrageous.\"  Nonetheless, BHC poloff Bodiruzzaman told us on September 2 that while there are temporary irritants in the bilateral relationship, relations are excellent, and Indians and Bangladeshis are \"brothers.\"  Hasina's Visit --------------  9. (C) During her late July visit to India, opposition leader Sheikh Hasina was received with nearly all the formalities of an official visit.  With the exception of a Hyderabad House reception, which is strictly reserved for heads of state or government, Hasina's trip to India included all the trappings of a state visit, including calls on Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister K Natwar Singh, and Leader of the Opposition LK Advani, and a dinner hosted by the Foreign Minister.  Denying the visit any particular significance, the Bangladesh High Commission's Bodiruzzaman said that such treatment is to be expected and is simply a function of a long and good relationship.  Comment -------  10. (C) It is notable that the UPA government that began its term with a strong focus on its immediate neighbors is now facing criticism from respected commentators of doing just the opposite with regard to Bangladesh.  Although Prime Ministers Singh and Zia met at the July 31 BIMSTEC Summit, GOI red carpet treatment of Hasina fueled the widely held view here that India simply prefers to deal with the Awami League and does not have the vision to build a constructive relationship with the BNP.  While the Home Secretary's visit is high-level, there is no talk of a Foreign Minister's trip to Dhaka until the PM and Natwar Singh travel to Dhaka for the January SAARC Summit.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh presents a collection of fears for India, which is worried about the spillover of extremism and anti-Hindu sentiment, the implications of political instability for India's own internal security in the northeast, groups inimical to India operating from within Bangladesh, and the demographic consequences of Bangladeshi migration into India.

QUOTE  E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/26/2014 TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PREF, UNHCR, IN, NP, BT SUBJECT: BHUTAN MOVING TOWARDS REPATRIATION OF CATAGORY ONE REFUGEES  Classified By: A/DCM Walter E. North, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: During an October 24 meeting with PRM A/S Dewey, King Jigme Wangchuck of Bhutan agreed that Category 1 refugees from the Khudunabari Camp could be repatriated and that the Government of Nepal (GON) and the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) should exchange a letter specifying the modalities.  King Wangchuck also commented, off the record, that this refugee situation is unique because Nepal and Bhutan have an open border with India and that many of the refugees are Indian.  He stated that in private negotiations, the GON has not been overly concerned about the refugee situation.  Third country resettlement is not an important part of the solution, according to the King.  He said the conditions of return had been stipulated and are in line with Bhutanese citizenship law.  The willingness of the King to move on the Category 1 refugees in Khudunabari Camp who had already been verified by the Bhutanese and Nepalese Joint Verification Teams departed significantly from the message A/S Dewey had heard previously from senior RGOB officials who held that all the Categories from all the camps must be considered before repatriation could start.  End Summary.  An Open Door for Category 1 Refugees? -------------------------------------  2.  (C) In an October 24 meeting, A/S Dewey appealed to King Jigme Wangchuck to help break the impasse over the refugee situation in southern Nepal by agreeing to take back Category 1 refugees from the Khudunabari Camp.  The King agreed to the proposal, but stipulated that the GON and the RGOB must first draft a letter setting forth the modalities of how repatriation would take place.  He promised to instruct his Ambassador to India to work with the Nepalese Ambassador to draft the letter, and after the language was finalized, the GON would send the letter to Thimphu.  King Wangchuck stated that the process must be portrayed as a bilateral initiative ) and not as a proposal advanced by an outside party.  He emphasized the need to inform India of this initiative, and asked A/S Dewey to request that Ambassador Mulford brief the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.  The King requested that Ambassador Moriarty similarly inform Minister of State Mahat in Kathmandu and support this initiative with Nepal.  In a meeting with Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk after a lunch hosted for the U.S. delegation by the King, the Foreign Minister was instructed to oversee the joint drafting of the letters with Minister Mahat.  Indian \"Refugees?\" ----------------  3.  (C) The King also asserted that a large number of camp residents are Indians and that the camps serve as a magnet due to the high quality of services UNHCR provides compared to surrounding areas.  He professed surprise that the number of refugees was not higher than 100,000, because of the discrepancy in services offered inside and outside the camps.  He argued that the international community should stop providing services in the camps that are not found in the surrounding area.  The King also criticized UNHCR policy of requiring refugees to obtain daily passes to leave the camps, stating that it limited the free movement of people between Nepal and India.  He mentioned that the RGOB knows of 2,000 people who have voluntarily left the camps, without receiving passes, to work and visit family members in India.  These people should be allowed to chose where they work and travel, he argued, because immigration laws of all three countries allow it.  Nepal-Bhutan Talks ------------------  4.  (C) Private talks between the GON and RGOB have been very good and there has been a frank exchange of ideas, commented King Wangchuck.  While the official GON line is that all the refugees are Bhutanese, the GON knows they are ethnic Nepalese and has no reservations about them staying in Nepal, he added.  Two to three million people from Bihar currently live in the region of the camps, and the GON would prefer the 100,000 refugees settle there, because it would increase the Nepalese percentage of the population.  However, the GON cannot admit this, he continued because it is politically too risky, and no government in Kathmandu has come to power supporting a mandate on a controversial issue.  Also, with all the problems Nepal is facing, the government can at least boast that it is taking care of 100,000 refugees, even though it is not paying for any of the services, commented the King.  5.  (C) King Wangchuck stated that the GON goal soon after the refugee crisis began was to increase the numbers of people in the camps from 6,000 to over 100,000 to ensure that UNHCR would have to get involved and provide support.  The King then reiterated the Bhutanese complaint that UNHCR had compounded the problem by not adequately screening refugees. He doubted they could remain neutral after 12 years as \"judge and jury\" and consistently calling the people in the camps \"Bhutanese Refugees.\"  He added that while the RGOB has had problems with the UNHCR, there was no point in \"harping on the past\" and that it was time to move forward.  If the UNHCR stopped funding the camps it would not be a large problem, because those refugees who could not find jobs in Nepal could do so in India, he stated.  Third Country Resettlement --------------------------  6.  (C) There is no need for third country resettlement, which is only a \"hypothetical solution,\" the King maintained.  The refugee situation is \"very unique, but very simple,\" he argued, because all the refugees are from India, Nepal and Bhutan and therefore only those three countries are needed for a solution.  The refugees are free to live and work in India, Nepal and Bhutan, but only under the citizenship laws of each country, he remarked.  Because the people in the camps are from one of the three counties, the refugees would only become stateless by deciding to go the third country resettlement route.  While he welcomed that option, it was not necessary.  Conditions of Return --------------------  7.  (C) King Wangchuck stated that the RGOB had given UNHCR and the GON the conditions of return prior to the December 2003 attack in the Khudunabari camp.  Any issue involving disbursement of land would be covered under Bhutanese law. If a person had sold his land before leaving Bhutan, that person would not be eligible to get it back or be given any free acreage from the RGOB.  However, the king noted that those who had been illegally evicted would have the right to get property back, and he fully expected that some returning category 1 refugees would file cases to do so.  The Joint Verification Teams (JVT) had agreed to a liberal interpretation of the law, but stressed they would not go so far as to change property or citizenship laws, he commented.  8.  (C) King Wangchuck assured A/S Dewey that there would be no risk for return of Category 1 refugees, that they would be fully protected by Bhutanese citizenship laws, and that the numbers of returnees does not matter, as long as they were bona fide Bhutanese citizens.   A/S Dewey raised this again with the Foreign Minister at the dinner he hosted in the evening of October 24.  The Foreign Minister reiterated opposition to UNHCR or any international direct monitoring saying, \"you will have to trust us.  But we would not dare violate their citizenship rights given the number of UN agencies accredited in Bhutan that will be watching.\"  Comment -------  9.  (C) The King's decision to accept Category 1 refugees from the Khudunabari camp, prior to completion of the JVT surveys of the other camps, was a surprise response to A/S Dewey,s personal appeal to try to find a way around the seemingly impenetrable \"swamp,\" rather than to keep revisiting it.  It was also a change from the message A/S Dewey heard from other senior members of the RGOB, including Prime Minister Yeshey Zimba and Minister of Foreign Affairs Khandu Wangchuck.  The two ministers repeated old RGOB positions and focused on the history of the refugee situation, the need for Bhutan to protect its national security, the violence committed against the Bhutanese JVT members, and a desire for recognition from the US for Bhutanese support on Iraq and Article 98.  The King clearly took the matter in his own hands to set out a formula to get by the impasse.  He defined the concept, then instructed the Foreign Minister to work out the details so that repatriation of this discrete group could begin. 10.  (U) A/S Dewey has cleared this cable.

NEW DELHI 6881  Classified By: PolCouns Geoffrey Pyatt, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  India underlined its concerns about the lack of democracy in Burma during the recent visit of Rangoon's military leader Than Shwe, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself delivering the message, MEA Joint Secretary (South East Asia - I) Mitra Vashishta told us on  SIPDIS November 1.  The decision to encourage democracy in Rangoon reflects the GOI belief that India is best placed to help Burma reform, that Aung San Sui Kyi's \"time has come and gone,\" and that democracy will take root in Burma only through greater engagement and people-to-people ties. Vashishta cited the October 29-31 visit to New Delhi of UN Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail as evidence of India's resolve to stay engaged on democracy in Burma.  The GOI would welcome US suggestions on how to best to promote democracy there, and has agreed to provide grants and limited military equipment to Rangoon in an attempt to encourage cooperation against anti-India insurgents located along the Indo-Burma border.  However, there are no Indian plans to conduct joint military operations with the junta.  PolCouns stressed our concerns about the safety and treatment of ASSK and the democratic opposition under Burma's new Prime Minister (ref A), and urged India to continue to press for democratic reform in Rangoon.  End Summary.  Democracy ---------  2.  (C) Democracy topped India's agenda for the October 24-29 visit of Burma's military leader Than Shwe, MEA Joint Secretary (South East Asia - I) Mitra Vashishta told PolCouns  SIPDIS and Poloff on November 1.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself raised the issue with Than Shwe \"in a much more intense way than could be expressed\" in the media, she said, noting that India had decided to raise the issue of democracy with Burma despite potentially negative consequences for the relationship.  Vashishta reported that New Delhi had to battle for the inclusion of a joint statement paragraph emphasizing India's desire to see \"a stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic Myanmar.\"  She commented that the Burmese delegation was \"willing to do anything\" to have that paragraph removed, adding that the inclusion of the paragraph was a \"coup for India.\"  The final version of the document released on October 29 \"expressed support for national reconciliation and an early transition to democracy in Myanmar.\"  3.  (C) Asked about New Delhi's plan to further encourage democracy in Burma, Vashishta responded that Rangoon considers India a democratic role model, and emphasized that the GOI has the \"best credentials\" to promote democracy there.  She mused that democracy could only be established through grass-roots initiatives, and stressed that India would do \"whatever it takes\" to empower the people of Burma in this respect.  Referring to the increased people-to-people ties between India and Pakistan, Vashishta said that the GOI plans to pursue a similar strategy with Burma by promoting culture and sports links between the two countries.  \"We are much less bothered by the situation in Burma than in Pakistan,\" she noted, adding that she would welcome US suggestions on how to encourage greater reform in Rangoon.  4.  (C) According to Vashishta, democracy in Burma is too closely linked with the greatly respected Aung San Sui Kyi (ASSK), whose \"day has come and gone.\"  She said that Than Shwe had expressed a commitment to democracy during the visit, and speculated that he would be more apt to bring about democratic reform if he could do so without losing face.  PolCouns underlined US concerns about the lack of democracy in Burma and expressed the hope that India would continue to press this issue with the junta.  Engaging Burma, Meeting India's Strategic Needs --------------------------------------------- --  5.  (C) Describing the Than Shwe trip as \"entirely devoted to India's interests,\" Vashishta stated that New Delhi decided to proceed with the visit, even after the ouster of former-PM Khin Nyunt because the GOI did not view the replacement of Nyunt as an indication of \"which way the dust would fall\" on democracy.  The GOI believes the coup was an \"internal struggle,\" she said, speculating that the junta may be somewhat fragile.  As evidence, Vashishta observed that Than Shwe traveled with the wives of two other powerful generals, Thura Shwe Man and Soe Win, who she mused may have been used as \"hostages\" to ensure tranquillity among the generals in Rangoon during Than Shwe's absence.  6.  (C) Vashishta reiterated India's belief that only constructive engagement of the military regime could bring about any meaningful change, saying sanctions have only isolated Burma, and have not encouraged democratic reforms there.  Burma is so isolated that members of Than Shwe's delegation wondered whether they would have to \"go nuclear\" to get US attention, she remarked, noting the comparison to Pakistan.  She emphasized that if India also isolates Burma, no one will be able to engage Rangoon on democracy or other issues.  7.  (C) Flagging that the timing of UN Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail's October 29-31 visit to New Delhi was not coincidental, Vashishta expressed India's desire to work with the UN on Burma.  However, she argued that the organization \"has lost credibility\" in the eyes of developing countries and should at least make an attempt to be more \"pro-Myanmar.\"  The EU is too \"obvious, shabby, shortsighted and full of contradictions\" to play a meaningful role in Burma, she argued, while Thailand takes a pro-active approach to Rangoon only \"because one of their ministers wants to be the next UN Secretary General.\"  Counter-Terrorism Agreement ---------------------------  8.  (C) Billing the Memorandum of Understanding on \"Non-Traditional Security Issues\" as an agreement on counter terrorism \"whatever they call it,\" Vashishta said the MOU outlines Rangoon's obligations to crack-down on anti-India militants operating out of Burmese territory.  The GOI does not believe that Rangoon is fueling the insurgents to pressure New Delhi because \"it is not in Burma's strategic interest,\" but New Delhi is growing increasingly concerned about insurgent activities in the border regions.  The GOB agreed to move troops to the Indo-Burmese border \"not because of their interests, but because some of India's interests are now tied up with theirs,\" Vashishta said, citing economic development as an example.  She expressed optimism that Burma was taking India's request seriously, unlike in the past. She noted that Soe Win, Burma's new PM, had previously commanded forces along the border with India.  PolCouns stressed our concerns about the safety and treatment of ASSK and the democratic opposition, given Soe Win's direct involvement in the May 30, 2003 attack on ASSK and her followers (ref A).  Vashishta had different information, alleging that some of the opposition parties were hopeful about a near-term political opening.  No To Military Exercises, Yes To Grants ---------------------------------------  9.  (C) Although the India-Burma joint statement on Than Shwe's visit mentions the \"possibilities of expanding cooperation\" in defense, Vashishta categorically stated that joint military exercises \"are absolutely ruled out,\" saying this is \"a big, firm no.\"  She indicated the GOI could provide limited military equipment to Rangoon, \"on par with what the rest of ASEAN provides,\" but is \"very careful\" when it comes to military cooperation with Burma. 10.  (C) Vashishta confirmed plans to provide Burma with a USD 20 million dollar grant to be used for energy, gas, and upgrading refining facilities, and said the money would be used to entice Rangoon to reform.  She explained that the junta would not receive the funds unless \"they do certain things,\" saying that India hopes to \"engage them (with the grant) and slowly lay down conditions for reform.\"  She cast this as part of New Delhi's people-to-people strategy.  China -----  11.  (C) Expressing concern about Chinese influence in Burma, Vashishta said that the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has been \"learning from the master about how to hoodwink the international community\" on human rights.  She said that China would like an Indian Ocean port and hopes to project its influence \"everywhere India does.\"  Vashishta argued that \"what you hear about the PLA in Burma is only the tip of the iceberg,\" as US intelligence must know.  Burmese engagement with India stems in part from Rangoon's belief that \"China takes them for granted,\" she asserted.  Religion --------  12.  (C) Commenting on the delegation's visit to several important Buddhist shrines in India, Vashishta noted that over the last three years, Than Shwe had repeatedly requested a pilgrimage to the sites and speculated that the religious journey was a major factor behind the trip.  She claimed that this pilgrimage was not just aimed a burnishing the junta's Buddhist credentials, but rather was related to Than Shwe's personal sense of mortality.  But she added, the Burmese military did not think they had done anything wrong, and do not need to atone for their sins.  Comment -------  13.  (C) Led by Foreign Secretary Saran, a former Ambassador to Rangoon, the GOI has embarked on a major diplomatic initiative with Burma.  India's policy toward the GOB is pragmatic, based largely on New Delhi's security interests, but also reflects the GOI's desire eventually to see a democratic Burma to its east.  India has welcomed US input about how best to encourage democracy there, presenting an opportunity that we should seize upon to expand the US-India regional dialogue to include developments in Rangoon.

(C) Summary: In a warm and constructive November 1 discussion with the Ambassador, Parliamentary Opposition Leader Jaswant Singh reaffirmed his commitment to the US-India relationship, remarking that \"I have paid a political price for my support of better relations\" between New Delhi and Washington, \"but I will continue to do so because it's the right thing for India.\"  Not surprisingly, Jaswant was highly critical of Congress' performance in government, arguing that Manmohan Singh did not have the stature or temperament to hold together a multi-party coalition as Vajpayee did.  Jaswant cautioned that suggestions the BJP should support the UPA's efforts to continue economic reform were undercut by the \"personal vendetta\" that some in the Congress have been conducting. The former Foreign Minister was typically downbeat about US policy in Pakistan, complaining that Washington had granted President Musharraf \"a veto\" over the US-India relationship. On Iraq, Jaswant worried about the prospect of partition along ethnic and religious lines.  End Summary.  2. (C) Reviving a relationship that began when Jaswant Singh was Finance Minister, the Ambassador, joined by PolCouns, called on the Rajya Sabha Opposition Leader at his New Delhi residence on November 1.  Jaswant was completely at ease in his role as an opposition politician, remarking wistfully on his official residence \"in the servants' quarters\" of the Prime Minister's compound.  Jaswant made only a passing reference to the recent controversy over the Secretary's description of the US role in helping to sustain efforts at Indo-Pak diplomacy in April 2003.  He recalled that Vajpayee had made three major efforts at rapprochement with Pakistan -- at Lahore (1999), Agra (2001) and Srinagar (2003).  In each instance, he argued, the only driver was the Prime Minister's personal resolve to make peace with Pakistan his lasting legacy.  Without going into details, Jaswant expressed concern that President Musharraf and the Pakistani leadership have still not made the strategic decision to abandon hostility to India.  US-India --------  3. (C) On the broader US-India relationship, Jaswant was unequivocal, recalling how he and the Prime Minister resolved between themselves to make relations with Washington an NDA priority.  \"I have paid a political price for my support of better relations\" between New Delhi and Washington, Jaswant declared, joking that he had been labeled as a \"CIA agent\" within the NDA.  He declared that \"I will continue (this support for US-India partnership) because it's the right thing for India.\"  Jaswant was completely gracious in his recollection of his early meetings with Bush Administration officials, describing in detail how touched he had been by the time that the President spent with him during his May 2001 visit to Washington.  Echoing remarks he made earlier this year to former Deputy Secretary Talbott (and recounted in Talbott's memoirs), Jaswant offered a long soliloquy on the unfulfilled potential of the US-India relations.  He lamented that \"Musharraf has been given a veto\" over the pace of US-India relations, and complained that the war in Iraq and our respective election cycles have left both Washington and New Delhi too distracted to focus on our bilateral agenda.  Arc of Crisis -------------  4. (C) The Ambassador cited the NSSP as evidence of Washington's commitment to the India relationship and challenged Jaswant's implication that Iraq was less than an urgent challenge to international security, which promoted the former Foreign Minister to back track from his comments. However, after acknowledging that policy makers must work with the world as they find it, Jaswant added that he is gravely concerned about the prospect that Iraq will fracture along ethnic and religious lines.  Pulling from his library a well thumbed copy of David Fromkin's \"Peace to End All Peace,\" Jaswant cited the British legacy in the Middle East as the root of the region's current tumult, reiterating concern that an artificially drawn Iraq would eventually splinter.  5. (C) Jaswant stayed in his Dickensian mode as the conversation turned to Afghanistan, arguing that despite surface appearances the situation there remained fragile.  He pointed to Karzai's US protection detail as an error of US tactics that created an image deeply offensive to Karzai's Pashtun constituency.  Drawing on his experience negotiating with Kabul for the release of a hijacked Indian airliner, Jaswant counseled against any compromise with the Taliban.  6. (C) On Pakistan, Jaswant recounted the \"sad history\" of US engagement with Islamabad to argue that sooner or later India will be \"presented with the bill\" for the GOP's current cooperation with Washington in the war on terrorism.  As in the 1980's, he argued, the United States will eventually find itself at a dead end with its Pakistan policy.  Whither Reform? ---------------  7. (C) Jaswant's enthusiastic interventions on foreign policy betrayed his preference for that dimension of his several previous portfolios.  But the former Finance and Defense Minister also spoke with authority on issues of governance in India.  Jaswant cautioned that the US might want to \"aim off\" of (discount) his remarks on Congress, since he speaks now as a leader of the opposition bench.  With that caveat, Jaswant criticized Manmohan Singh for lacking the stature or temperament to hold together a multi-party coalition as Vajpayee did.  He called the Home Minister \"a disaster,\" described how Pranab Mukherjee had privately acknowledged that he knew nothing about the Defense portfolio, implied that Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had already been stripped of most authority by the PMO, and generally excoriated the UPA government.  8. (C) Queried about the BJP's approach to economic issues now that they are back in opposition, Jaswant argued that Congress' \"personal vendetta\" against the BJP and other NDA alliance members made it difficult for people like him who would be inclined to support the government's effort to sustain the process of reform.  He implied that the BJP at least for now will be a relentless opposition, taking advantage of Congress missteps and contradictions with the Left to score easy political points.  He was silent on questions of BJP leadership, and the struggle between Hindu hard liners and moderates like himself who recognize that a middle course is essential to the BJP's hopes for returning to power.

(C) The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) should be more proactive in the fight against the Maoists, MEA Joint Secretary (Bhutan/Nepal) Ranjit Rae told Polcouns and Poloff  SIPDIS in a November 1 meeting.  Describing the recent India-Nepal security cooperation group meeting, Rae reported that the GOI pressed the RNA to demonstrate visible results in its anti-insurgency campaign.  New Delhi was \"at a loss\" as to why the RNA had not been more forceful against the Maoists. Rae believed the cease-fire, called on account of a major local Hindu holiday, was over and that neither the GON nor the Maoists would extend it through the upcoming November 12 Diwalli holidays, as the GOI had hoped.  2.  (C) Looking ahead to King Gyanendra's late November visit to India, Rae indicated that New Delhi would press for an increased pace of counter-insurgent operations, viewing this as, \"one of the few buttons left to press.\"  Rae said the GOI will also reiterate to the King New Delhi's strong opposition to any usurpation of emergency powers by the Palace. The Indian DCM from Kathmandu (who was also present during this meeting) added that he believed the US was reluctant to use the Palace as a conduit to push for more aggressive use of the RNA.  3.  (C) Rae speculated that the October merger of the Maoist Communist Center and the People's War Group to form the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), was influenced by the Nepalese Maoists (Reftel 1244).  He observed that this development confirmed GOI concerns of a Maoist spillover into India.  4.  (C) Rae also commented on a conversation he recently had with the visiting British Ambassador to Nepal, who reportedly argued that taking a hard line with the Maoists might not be the best way to solve the problem.  Rae said the British opinion was that a weakened Maoists position would only make them more recalcitrant and less likely to negotiate. Rae said that the GOI does not agree with this argument.  He also expressed frustration about the continued European reluctance to press for a freeze on Maoist assets, calling this symptomatic of their naive approach to the violence in Nepal. MULFORD " }

Mulford, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Polcouns and Poloff met on November 1 with MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal/Bhutan) Ranjit Rae to brief on the strategy  SIPDIS recently outlined by King Wangchuck to A/S Dewey to repatriate Category 1 refugees from the Khudunabari camp (Reftel).  Rae replied that the GOI welcomes this strategy as a way break the deadlock, and is hopeful it could dove-tail to other solutions to the problem.  He indicated that King Wangchuck had described our initiative to the Indian delegation during a recent royal investiture ceremony in Thimphu and appreciated the early US consultation.  He was particularly curious about Nepalese reactions.  Rae mentioned in passing that Category 3 refugees from Nepal could also be included in the initial plan (in order to remove them from the equation), but did not press this point.  2.  (C) GOI has also pressed the GON to allow UNHCR to conduct profiling and re-registration surveys, Rae said, but Kathmandu remains concerned that this process will lead to local integration of large numbers of refugees.  Responding to reftel, he indicated that New Delhi would weigh in to support the initiative.  3.  (C) The Joint Secretary expressed concern with the strategy of having the Nepalese and Bhutanese Ambassadors to India draft letters specifying the details of an agreement on the grounds that the two have not talked to each other about the issue.  The Nepalese Ambassador has not commented publicly on refugee matters, and the prior ambassador was much more personally involved, said Rae.  The King of Nepal will visit New Delhi in late November and might discuss the refugee situation with GOI interlocutors during the trip. Rae believed the Nepalese King was generally interested in resolving the issue, and he might play a role similar to that of the King of Bhutan in moving the process forward.  4.  (C)  Concluding, Rae stressed the importance of ensuring that the UN, EU and other Friends of Bhutan states do not derail the process by harping on the conditions of return and other controversial issues.  He urged the US to encourage the Europeans and UN to support the process and not to make public statements that could cause problems. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  This is the first of two cables reporting on the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) Implementation Group.  USG and GOI counterparts met in two positive and productive sessions of the NSSP Implementation Group on October 20-21 to review accomplishments under Phase One and chart the course for Phase Two.  Although there are some pending issues we need to resolve -- some contentious such as the status of onward proliferation cases -- the GOI continues to demonstrate high-level resolve to maintain momentum.  Throughout the course of the meetings, both sides exchanged forthright views on mutual expectations, and defined areas where more information is needed or where action is pending.  After reviewing measures the GOI has already taken to strengthen its export controls, the Indians commented that work is already well-advanced on issues such as developing a framework for stronger export controls. Considerable effort, however, must be sustained to ensure effective implementation such as introducing legislation that adequately covers \"intangible\" technology transfers and provides for \"catch-all\" controls.  Other issues, such as formulation of an Indian missile defense doctrine, remain in the beginning stage.  The Indian side agreed to a further discussion of Phase Two issues in connection with the November 18-19 High-Tech Cooperation Group (HTCG) meeting. End Summary.  2.  (U) A/S Rocca led the USG delegation comprised of Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, DCM, PolCouns, and representatives from the State Department's Bureaus for South Asia, Non-Proliferation, and Arms Control, the Department of Defense, as well as the Science and Customs offices at Embassy New Delhi.  With similarly broad representation, the GOI delegation was led by MEA Additional Secretary for International Security Meera Shankar, with  SIPDIS participation from MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar, other MEA officials from the Americas and Disarmament Divisions as well as representatives from the Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Space, and the Defense Ministry's Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO).  The NSSP Implementation Group meeting took place in two sessions, October 20-21.  The following cable provides reporting on achievements and pending issues from Phase One; reporting on the next steps for Phase Two will follow septel.  Because of scheduling constraints, not all participants were able to attend all sessions. Participant list follows in para 12.  Phase One: Accomplishments and Pending Issues ---------------------------------------------  3.  (C) In her opening remarks on Phase One, A/S Rocca reviewed significant accomplishments:  Removing ISRO from the Entity List; removing licensing requirements for certain dual-use items exported to Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) subordinates; and expanding the \"presumption of approval\" for all dual use items not controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for \"balance of plant\" operations.  She inquired about the GOI response to U/S Grossman's letter offering the sale of the Patriot PAC-2 missile defense system and expressed USG desire to continue the Strategic Stability Dialogue.  4.  (C) Additional Secretary Shankar began by describing India's security perimeter as \"stretching from the Straits of Malacca to the Gulf and beyond.\"  In addition to the security concerns posed by India's immediate neighbors, Shankar said that proliferation linkages with this region also impinge on Indian security.  Chinese proliferation of centrifuge technology to Pakistan, for example, and subsequent onward proliferation to Libya, North Korea and others also pose security risks to India.  Because of the direct impact of proliferation on India's security, Shankar urged the US to share intelligence about proliferation in the region, particularly the status of dismantling the AQ Khan network. A/S Rocca responded that it may not be possible to provide more information at this time without endangering the ongoing investigation, but underlined US commitment to dismantle the AQ Khan network \"root and branch.\"  Onward Proliferation --------------------  5.  (C) Both sides agreed that it is necessary to determine the status of several pending onward proliferation cases. Shankar presented eight non-papers outlining the GOI investigation of numerous cases raised by the US (Ref A), but expressed frustration that current cases are reviewed, new ones are added, but old cases never seem to be resolved. \"Our agencies want to see the NSSP as forward-looking and prospective, not retrospective,\" Shankar said.  Caroline Russell, the NP representative, assured Shankar that Indian information is carefully considered, but since our goal is to have a dialogue, further questions often arise about the original situation, if not about GOI action.  As information is exchanged, cases can be removed from the list.  6.  (C) After A/S Rocca delivered the demarche points in Reftel B regarding Russia's transfer of MTCR Category II propellant mixers to India's ballistic missile program in 1999, GOI representatives expressed dismay and dissatisfaction on several counts (Reftel C).  Beyond their reaction to the case itself, Shankar broadened her critique by stating the GOI view that conventional weapon issues are outside the purview of the NSSP.  \"The US has raised concerns about conventional weapons based on your own foreign policy and political concerns,\" she said, \"but these concerns are best addressed by in our respective Foreign Ministries, not the NSSP.\"  \"It seems that you have some discretion in interpreting your laws and choosing which cases to raise and when,\" she continued.  \"On the case of China providing ring magnets to Pakistan,\" for instance, \"despite substantial evidence, sanctions were not imposed.\"  Shankar offered two non-papers about proliferation to Pakistan (Refs D and E), with a request that the US investigate the matters and share any resulting information with the GOI.  7.  (C) Turning the tables, Mr. Siddhartha, a consultant to MEA and former DRDO official, wanted assurances that the US would not allow Indian technology to be passed on to Pakistan, as in the case of a mission control computer developed in India that could be fitted on an F-16.  He predicted that such situations may be more common in the future as India's technology sector develops.  8.  (C) Finally, Shankar reiterated concerns that information the GOI has shared with the US on cases of onward proliferation, e.g., NEC, has been shared with other governments without GOI consent, possibly endangering cases under judicial review.  Russell assured the GOI that the US treated the information they provided with the utmost confidentiality.   She said she was unaware that any GOI  SIPDIS information had been passed on to other governments, but noted that the U.S. did on occasion share with other countries information from its own sources.  She observed that in the NEC case, the subsequent warning issued by the German government could have been based on press accounts of the public announcement of U.S. sanctions against NEC in 2002.  Sanctioned Scientists ---------------------  9.  (C) Returning to the controversial issue of US sanctions against two Indian scientists for involvement in Iran's WMD program (Reftel F), Shankar said the timing of the announcement could not have been more unfortunate because \"it tarnished the shine of the NSSP.\"  She reiterated the GOI's oft-stated defense that Dr. Surendra has never been to Iran and that Dr. Prasad worked on safety issues at the Bushehr nuclear reactor under IAEA auspices.  The sanctions determination has raised questions within the GOI about the credibility of the NSSP; a decision to drop sanctions would consequently bolster confidence among GOI skeptics, according to Shankar.  10.  (C) A/S Rocca acknowledged that the timing of these penalties was regrettable, but believed the intelligence to be solid and stated that the determination would be upheld unless the GOI presents new information.  \"We do not share your perception of this issue,\" Shankar replied.  A/S Rocca responded that it is critical to develop better means of communication to ensure that similar cases do not occur in the future.  11.  (C) Indicating the depth of GOI resentment on this case, Jaishankar again raised the issue of the sanctioned scientists on the second day of meetings.  The announcement of US penalties against the two eminent scientists \"played badly in the media, but much worse in-house,\" he said. Citing an article about the case in the local press the day before, he predicted, \"We will keep getting hammered on this (until the decision is reversed).\"  He went on to say that he is \"personally aggrieved\" by the way the announcement was handled.  Recalling that a State Department official contacted him by cell phone in a restaurant in DC to discuss an issue related to the IAEA debate in Vienna, he expressed dismay that no one in Washington tried to contact him about this issue of great concern to New Delhi.

NEW DELHI 5577      B. NEW DELHI 6980  1.  (SBU) Summary: On October 14-18, 2004, Department Senior Coordinator for International Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy Michele Markoff and DOD Director of International Information Assurance Programs Tim Bloechl participated in preparatory meetings with the GOI for the November 9-10 Cybersecurity Forum in Washington.  Arvind Gupta, Joint Secretary, National Security Council Secretariat, and Commander Mukesh Saini, Deputy Director  SIPDIS (Information Security), NSCS, hosted the consultations and will lead the GOI delegation.  Discussions included the Cybersecurity Forum's (CSF's) overall structure; designating co-chairs and selecting agenda topics for the five working groups; industry participation; site visits; and training and capacity building.  The director of India's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) briefed on his organization's capabilities.  Markoff asked Gupta for GOI support for a US-drafted UNGA Resolution calling for all UN Member States to join the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network, while Gupta and Saini shared their vision to \"inculcate a culture of cybersecurity\" in India's IT sector. End Summary.  Getting to Know You (Again) ---------------------------  2.  (SBU) Noting the long interval since the CSF last convened in April 29-30, 2002, Joint Director Gupta welcomed Markoff and Bloechl, and noted that much has changed in the field of cybersecurity technology, in the US and India's cybersecurity organizations, and in India's technical capabilities.  Markoff remarked on the successful ITAA-NASSCOM India-US Information Security Summit 2004, at which she delivered the closing keynote address.  Both Washington and New Delhi emphasized the importance of including the perspectives of both software developers and clients.  Markoff listed a few key industries that rely heavily on secure and reliable IT systems: banks, health care, utilities, and transportation.  Observing that the issue of cybersecurity is no longer \"in the weeds,\" she said it is now recognized as an important part of US-India interdependence that is larger than the IT sector.  WG1: Legal Cooperation and Law Enforcement ------------------------------------------  3.  (SBU) Markoff began by listing topics the USG wants to discuss in the area of cybersecurity legal cooperation and law enforcement:  -- How the GOI is organized to fight cybercrime; -- Updates on relevant legislation; -- Any plans to facilitate a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty for computer crime; -- The Council of Europe model cybercrime legislation; -- How Indian law enforcement agencies approach cybercrime investigations and prosecutions; and -- If India participates in, or plans to participate in, the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network.  4.  (SBU) Arguing for the inclusion of intrusion detection of Indian infrastructure to the agenda, MHA Joint Secretary Renuka Muttoo recalled a recent incident in which an American criminal/hacker allegedly misused an Indian proxy server to engage in credit card fraud and the printing of fraudulent certificates.  Noting that the incident was reported to the US DOJ, she asked how such reporting could be institutionalized. Markoff indicated that the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network, of which India was already a member, was the conduit for cyber crime reporting.  Muttoo appeared unfamiliar with the 24/7 POC cybercrime network and Markoff promised to provide the name of the GOI contact. (NOTE: Embassy later passed GOI contact information via MEA.)  5.  (SBU) Gupta queried whether this 24/7 network would be used to report all cyber incidents.  Markoff indicated that the U.S. has set up two separate 24/7 POCs -- one for watch and warning information sharing (US-CERT/NCSD), the other for law enforcement cooperation (DOJ) -- as a more effective way to ensure that information flows between professionals who understand each others priorities.  Of course, the US and Indian CERTs would also pass crime-relevant information to appropriate law enforcement contacts within their respective countries should they receive it.  6.  (SBU) Gupta indicated that the U.S. had not been responsive to all past bilateral requests for law enforcement cooperation.  Markoff suggested that Gupta supply a list of unanswered requests.  It would be useful for the CSF to review India's status in cybercrime substantive law (what activities are criminalized) as well as cybercrime procedural law (how far Indian authorities are allowed to cooperate on cross-border incidents).  As an example, Markoff described a possible intrusion that could be routed through servers in several countries; in trying to trace back an attack, any gap in bilateral cybercrime cooperation would stop the investigation dead in its tracks.  7.  (SBU) Gupta mentioned that the range of Indian law enforcement agencies with a potential role in cybercrime enforcement was larger than the delegation they could bring to the CSF, and offered to host a joint cybercrime law enforcement workshop in early 2005.  He envisioned a two-day workshop that would look at problems and possible collaboration in cyber-forensics, mutual legal assistance, and computer-based investigation, noting that this could be another venue for private industry to join the government-to-government dialogue.  Markoff responded that DOJ has participated in similar workshops, and suggested the proposal be discussed further at the CSF.  Gupta said that the issue could also be pursued in the Law Enforcement Joint Working Group, and that the GOI Department of Information Technology had already held one working group on cyber law and cyber-crime.  8.  (SBU) Gupta requested that DOJ brief on how high-tech crime is pursued, \"from the start, conducting the investigation, through convictions, a complete walk-through\" at the November CSF.  Gupta's deputy, Commander Mukesh Saini, suggested that DOJ's Websnare Operation could be a useful case to profile.  WG2: Research and Development -----------------------------  9.  (SBU) Markoff asked that India's Working Group 2 delegation report how New Delhi is poised for and can foster critical infrastructure protection research and development, outreach to industry and academia on CIP, and what cybersecurity issues the GOI sought to underline.  She told Gupta that the InfoSec Research Council prepared a \"Hard Problems List\" of the technical hurdles in cybersecurity that need to be overcome (NOTE: Embassy later delivered a copy of the \"Hard Problems List\" to Saini).  Markoff suggested that the USG and the GOI might partner in resolving some of these problems.  10.  (SBU) In response, Gupta asked if the India-US Science and Technology Forum, which began in March 2000, might be a more appropriate venue for new R&D workshops in cybersecurity.  In such an eventuality, the S&TF could provide POCs for science collaboration in several research areas, such as systems-oriented research architecture for dependability and survivability, systems management/monitoring/control, human monitoring, authentication, communications protocols, network security, accountability, and foundational research (logical languages and tools to develop systems).  The most promising areas, Gupta said, were in applying cryptography for authentication and privacy, language-based security (i.e. voice recognition), diverse redundancy, and catastrophe-resistant architecture.  11.  (SBU) Department of Information Technology Senior Director S. Basu said that working-level GOI R&D interests are focused on cryptography and crypto-analysis, network systems security, security architecture, operating system security, vulnerability detection and monitoring, and cyber-forensics.  He expressed interest in reviewing the \"Hard Problems List.\"  Basu added that proposed topics for collaboration could include cyber forensic tools, authentication, speaker (voice) recognition, cryptography, and quantum cryptography.  12.  (SBU) Dr. G. Athithan of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)/Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics said that DRDO and DIT had been working on IT security for 3-4 years.  They have access to software developers in Bangalore through the marriage of \"government money and private sector brains,\" while critical tasks are handled by government-funded laboratories, which also conduct field-testing.  Athithan underlined the GOI desire for tools to help monitor network traffic and capture keywords.  He remarked that intercepting and reading Internet-based e-mail (webmail) was a difficult problem, and that webmail was developed by an Indian programmer to sidestep firewalls because it was more difficult to detect. After Athithan expressed his interest in \"carnivore\" software (to allow law enforcement agencies to read intercepted e-mails) Markoff and Bloechl -- as well as Gupta and Saini -- steered the conversation toward possible cooperation on cracking packet header data and session information, and away from reading intercepted text.  Athithan proffered additional GOI R&D priorities: intrusion detection, modeling statistically normal network behavior to create a baseline, hacker tracing, and, again, viewing electronic content, \"to help infer the origin and identity of an attacker.\"  13.  (SBU) Gupta suggested Internet traffic monitoring and database analysis as areas for possible cooperation, noting that the GOI wishes to be able to profile and summarize data and databases, as well as profiling online user sessions (e-mail traffic and clustered browsing) over multi-day periods.  Gupta then asked how the US monitors Internet traffic.  Markoff said that US law does not permit general monitoring of Internet traffic; instead, if there is evidence of a crime, a court order can permit law enforcement to investigate relevant e-mail traffic.  14.  (SBU) Bloechl suggested that the defense cooperation working group could discuss the issue in a military context, and echoed Markoff's statement that the USG does not monitor content, instead focusing on analysis, such as the case of worms or viruses indicated by packet header data.  He explained that there is a great need to avoid violating US law by collecting information on US persons outside of a sanctioned law enforcement investigation.  15.  (SBU) Gupta shared that the GOI,s interest was not in reading the data itself, but in technology to warehouse and analyze it.  The GOI was interested in unclassified technology, as classified data is handled under separate procedures.  Athithan interjected that he was interested in R&D, not law enforcement, and that the technology would be deployed toward a watch and warning function that would be in place prior to any legal permissions being sought for attempted intrusion or attack.  He restated his interests as summarizing and profiling data, traffic analysis, and cluster analysis; Gupta added that the Indo-US Counterterrorism Joint Working Group was the appropriate forum for tools that would support actionable intelligence, while Athithan pushed for the technology to implement watch, warning and emergency response functions, as well as handling and storing digital evidence.  WG3: Critical Infrastructure Protection ---------------------------------------  16.  (SBU) Markoff told Gupta that the Acting Director of DHS's National Cyber Security Division, Andy Purdy, will co-chair the Third Working Group, and will lead on watch and warning issues.  Its presentation will include an overview of the capabilities and activities of the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT, which NCSD oversees), its mandated mission, its watch-and-warning capabilities, and a review of its public/private/academic/international outreach and partnerships.  The USG sought a reciprocal briefing on the capabilities and activities of India's CERT-In.  The working group will also explore collaboration opportunities, and welcomed a discussion on the following issues:  -- How was CERT-In created? -- What is its mandate? -- What alert and advisory systems are in place? -- Is CERT-In operating in a 24/7 capacity for emergency responses?  If not, will it do so in the future? -- What kinds of international outreach does CERT-In pursue?  17.  (SBU) Markoff then listed some potential avenues for collaboration between the two CERTs:  -- Designating POCs for bilateral communications; -- Coordinating on cybersecurity incident responses; -- Partnering on hard issues such as attribution and software assurance; -- Sharing watch and warning information; -- Fostering international cooperation beyond the bilateral relationship; and -- Technical training assistance.  Other possibilities include exchanges of periodic reports on global Internet status, including trends, vulnerabilities, and incidents.  18.  (SBU) Markoff reported that the USG has been considering architecture for an incident alert and management system, and is consulting with other allies in this regard.  The system would need to have real-time warning capabilities.  Because CERT-In is India's designated national CERT, the two teams could begin sharing basic cyber watch and warning information almost immediately, she added.  Markoff explained that CERT-In must be the government's authorized CERT and be able to share reciprocal information with US-CERT on a 24/7 basis, to qualify for this level of partnership.  19.  (SBU) CERT-In Operations Manager Anil Sagar briefly presented on CERT-In's capabilities.  He stated that CERT-In is GOI funded, 24/7 capable, and provides both pull (website: http://www.cert-in.org.in) and push (e-mail) alert services. He confirmed that it is the GOI-designated national CERT for all computer security incidents, government and private-sector, and has been operating since January.  In response to Markoff's query as to CERT-In's membership in any regional agreements, Sagar said that CERT-In Director Dr. KK Bajaj was at that time engaged in membership consultations for the Asia-Pacific CERT (APCERT).  CERT-In,s \"wish list,\" according to Sagar, includes:  -- Knowledge-sharing with US-CERT of any discovered operating systems or applications vulnerabilities, -- Updates on viruses and worms in circulation; -- Assistance in vulnerability analysis; -- Capabilities of incident handling; -- Traffic monitoring; -- Intrusion trends and warnings; -- Hacker profiling; and -- Assistance in testing patches for upcoming software vulnerabilities (NOTE: Sagar explained that CERT-In tests commercially-available patches before posting them on their website, because, he explained, they are very careful about preserving CERT-In,s reputation and do not wish to be associated with faulty patches.)  20.  (SBU) In exchange, Sagar said that CERT-In could share the following with US-CERT: best practices on systems hardening; co-development of security applications; and information-sharing on systems vulnerabilities information.  WG4: Defense Cooperation ------------------------  21.  (SBU) Bloechl explained that robust cybersecurity for the US Defense Department and the military is already in place, under the auspices of a four-star general at US Strategic Command.  A Joint Task Force (JTF) was created in 1998 as the primary computer network defense organization for the Defense Department.  Other agency and military CERTs report to it, and it works in parallel with the US-CERT under the Department of Homeland Security as its defense sector counterpart.  Bloechl invited the Working Group 4 delegation to visit the CSF early and tour the JTF/Global Network Operations Center in Washington, at which time the two delegations could discuss common goals and objectives for bilateral cooperation.  Of key importance, he stressed, is that any organization the DOD partners with must be able to protect the information on its own networks.  22.  (SBU) Bloechl then asked about the status of India's military CERT -- whether it has 24/7 intrusion detection, an R&D budget, details about its network security and if the military uses simulation modeling to test the security, indicators and warning capability, and pre-attack warning capability.  Saini responded that each service (Army, Navy, Air Force) currently maintains its own independent computer networks, each overseen by its own \"semblance of a CERT.\" Over time Saini planned to \"grow the existing CERTs until they are fully functioning,\" primarily by enlarging and training their staffs, a goal he hopes to reach by 2007.  Not even the Integrated Defense Staff yet possesses an integrated network -- the stress is to have adequate security in place before linking networks even at the IDS level.  Furthermore, beyond the three service networks, the military has only a relatively small number of separate, Internet-accessible workstations.  Despite pressure from within the military to expand Internet access, especially leading to broadband access, Saini's preference was to do so only after the military CERTs are fully functioning.  23.  (SBU) Commodore J Jena of India's Integrated Defense Staff, who introduced himself by saying that \"cybersecurity is my main activity,\" said the need for an expanded awareness of cybersecurity within the Indian military's Intranets remained acute.  He asked whether USG networks were secured with commercially-available products or were manufactured within the government.  Bloechl responded that classified systems are secured by USG agencies, including the NSA.  Jena then asked what algorithms US classified networks use, and how reliable they are considered to be.  Bloechl took the question and will pass to appropriate US offices for potential future action.  24.  (SBU) In exchange for US-funded cybersecurity training, Jena said the Indian military was prepared to share the following with the US:  -- Counterterrorism/low intensity conflict training and expertise; -- A mode to tap into India's pool of IT talent; and -- Its share in a bilateral cyberwarning function.  25.  (SBU) Jena asked about adding additional areas to the discussion agenda, such as using endochromatic radioactive material-embedded hardware and software for security, cyber deterrence, and how to test for and sanitize malicious code. Markoff and Bloechl answered that the key to deterrence is cracking the attribution problem.  After Jena asked about hardening systems to withstand an electro-magnetic pulse and how to reconstitute after such an attack, Markoff advised that such issues might be better addressed in the CTJWG. Bloechl added that some elements in DOD might be looking at such problems, but not his office.  Bloechl and Jena agreed that data in languages other than English posed a hard problem, one that Markoff said was recognized at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).  WG5: Standards and Software Assurance -------------------------------------  26.  (SBU) Markoff opened discussion on Working Group 5 by stating that Dr. Ron Ross of NIST would provide the CSF with a high-level overview of NIST's guidelines on security standards; show how the standards have international applicability; and outline the benefits of ongoing collaboration.  Dr. SL Sarnot (Director General, Standards/Testing/Quality Certification Directorate, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology) stated that he had held a prior discussion with Dr. Ross, on common criteria for software assurance, and that both sides of the working group should be able to work well together.  The GOI would seek cooperation in implementing NIST assurance protocols, and Sarnot said the US document is more \"elaborate\" than India's current program.  He also asked for assistance in assurance frameworks and training to implement the common framework.  A Role for Private Industry ---------------------------  27.  (SBU) Markoff and Gupta agreed that if the private sector and industry associations participate in the CSF, they would be included in the plenaries and could make their own presentations in that venue.  Markoff suggested that in addition to IT industry representation, IT clients and firms involved in critical infrastructure (banking, telecommunications, utilities, and transportation, for example) should be invited.  The delegation need not be huge, but American firms want to engage with their Indian counterparts, to foster deeper relations, but with a government component as the framework to facilitate an industry-to-industry dialogue, she stated.  Gupta replied that the 2004 NASSCOM-ITAA conference had set the stage, and cybersecurity awareness has risen dramatically since the 2002 CSF.  Markoff observed that the private sector must be part of the solution, as states cannot legislate strong cybersecurity protections into existence.  28.  (SBU) Gupta observed that once private firms realize how much business will be tied to firms that work in a secure environment, they might end up pressuring governments into action.  A few years ago there was marked resistance to adopting the common criteria for software assurance, he said, but now \"all objections are gone.\"  Many firms are only now beginning to understand the difference between information technology and information security.  Markoff replied that as more firms lose productivity and business through cyber-attacks, worms, viruses, etc., fewer will require convincing.  29.  (SBU) Markoff said that US industry participation would be based in part on the Indian list.  She also offered that there could be sector-based break-out sessions for the commercial delegates.  Specifically, Markoff said US firms would like to have Indian companies like TATA, WIPRO, and InfoSys represented, as well as national universities and research laboratories.  Gupta promised to forward an Indian private-sector list, but cautioned that if they were unable to form a good delegation, they may rely on CII or NASSCOM representatives who could then report back to their members.  30.  (SBU) Markoff suggested a list of possible issues and topics that would interest private industry, and that private sector participants could brief on:  -- E-signatures; -- Bilateral certification authority; -- Security procedures; -- Technical and language skills; -- Outsourcing; -- Business activity disruption/disaster recovery; -- Help desk/call center operations; -- E-security with handheld devices; -- Cybercrime laws; -- Enforcement of privacy laws/standards; -- Data privacy (including why India does not need to adopt the EU Privacy Law); -- Need to enforce IPR; -- Data protection laws; -- Online database protection; -- Physical security, including biometrics and closed circuit monitoring; -- GPS issues; -- Public safety concerns; -- Outreach to small and mid-sized firms; and -- Protecting financial data.  Site Visits -----------  31.  (SBU) Markoff, Bloechl and Gupta agreed that appropriate site visits would be of great value.  Bloechl suggested that the defense WG could visit the Joint Task Force on November 8, before the plenary.  Markoff added that a visit to US-CERT could also be planned for some of the other working groups. Both parties agreed that site visits would take place on November 8, on the basis of a list of sites the Indian delegation would like to visit.  Training Requests and Funding -----------------------------  32.  (SBU) The most important item on New Delhi's training agenda is capacity building, Gupta reported.  He emphasized the desire for expert exchanges and hands-on, side-by-side training.  Admitting that funding, scheduling, and logistics for sending Indian cybersecurity professionals to the US were issues that needed to be worked out, Gupta offered to host American cybersecurity experts \"for three days, or two months, or more\" at Indian cybersecurity facilities and classes.  Markoff and Gupta agreed that this would be a good issue for the CSF working groups to firm up.  When Gupta pressed for working exchanges and hands-on training for CERT-In personnel at US-CERT, or vice versa, Bloechl cautioned him that most of the military CERTs, operations are at the top secret level, though there might be opportunities to observe operations at lower classifications.   33.  (SBU) The US and Indian delegations briefly reviewed the September 3 GOI request for cyber forensics training (Ref A). When Gupta asked about funding, Markoff responded that there were few options due to budget constraints.  She remarked that there may be opportunities, however, and noted that INL had funded training in Mumbai in 2003, but there is no clear answer yet on USG funding for non-military cybersecurity training.  Markoff, Bloechl, Saini and Jena discussed the possibilities and limitations of funding via IMET, FMS and the DOD CT Fellowship Program.  Markoff reported that several military training facilities that offer the kinds of courses the GOI sought now qualify for IMET.  Markoff also suggested that the Monterey Naval Postgraduate School could customize senior-level courses for GOI groups.  ODC Maj. Greg Winston added that Mobile Training Teams were another option, which could be brought to India under defense cooperation programs.  He added that some IT-related courses are now covered under IMET.  Two important hurdles, however, were that India's total IMET allocation for 2005 will be $1.4 million, and that courses must be at least five weeks in duration.  Both delegations agreed to continue the discussion in Washington.  Lobbying for 24/7 Cybercrime POC Resolution -------------------------------------------  34.  (SBU) Markoff asked Gupta for GOI support for a US-drafted UNGA resolution calling for all UN Member States to join the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network originally created by the G-8.  She said it would be the fifth resolution on cybersecurity.  Gupta reacted positively and asked for a copy of the draft resolution.  (NOTE: Embassy forwarded the draft resolution via the MEA.)  GOI's Cybersecurity Vision --------------------------  35.  (SBU) Gupta's short-term vision for GOI,s cybersecurity posture is to have dedicated cybersecurity officers in all government sectors capable of handling all ministry-related aspects of cybersecurity, whether a cyber attack occurs within a ministry or in the private sector areas the ministry oversees.  This platform would then grow to include a fully functioning CERT for each sector, with all reporting to and deriving training from CERT-In.  Gupta acknowledged that a dearth of trained personnel was slowing progress, which was the impetus behind what he called \"inculcating a culture of cybersecurity into the private sector,\" first by mandating a cybersecurity requirement in engineering college curricula. Saini elaborated that he would like to see cybersecurity training represent 5 percent of education within the IT sector, up from his estimate of 0.01 percent, by 2008. Eventually, he hoped that every IT professional would consider cybersecurity to be part of his bailiwick.  Saini acknowledged that this would represent a massive investment by both the government and private industry, and that it would have to be a joint effort and not two parallel tracks.  High-Level Policy Support -------------------------  36.  (SBU) Noting that cybersecurity enjoys high-level support from NSA Dixit, chairman of the National Information Board (NIB) which keeps cybersecurity as a top-level policy interest, Gupta described the NIB as \"very big,\" comprising MEA, MHA, Finance, MOD, DIT, the economic sectoral ministries, and law enforcement agencies.  It meets every three months.  Other Cybersecurity Relationships Pale In Comparison --------------------------------------------- -------  37.  (SBU) Gupta said that although cybersecurity is clearly an issue of international importance, the Indo-US CSF is New Delhi's only substantial bilateral cybersecurity relationship.  There had been some efforts at cooperation with Canada and Israel, \"but they never took off.\"  He also dismissed GOI efforts to foment cybersecurity cooperation with Russia without elaborating on them.  CSF Framework -------------  38.  (SBU) Markoff and Gupta agreed on the following structure for the five working groups and their co-chairs as follows:  Working Group 1: Legal Cooperation and Law Enforcement.  USG co-chair Anthony Teelucksingh (Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, DOJ), GOI co-chair Ms. Renuka Muttoo, Joint Director, Ministry of Home Affairs.  Working Group 2: Research and Development.  USG co-chair Stan Riveles (Office of the S&T Advisor to the Secretary), GOI co-chair Dr. AK Chakravarti (Advisor, Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology) (NOTE: The GOI co-chair was later changed to Dr. N Sitaram, Director Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)/Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR)  END NOTE.).  Working Group 3: Critical Infrastructure Protection, Watch, Warning, and Emergency Response.  USG co-chair Andy Purdy (DHS National Cyber Security Division), GOI co-chair Dr. KK Bajaj (Director/CERT-In). (NOTE: \"Emergency Response\" was added to working group name to facilitate Bajaj's participation.  END NOTE.)  Working Group 4: Defense Cooperation.  USG co-chair Tim Bloechl (DOD Director of International Information Assurance Programs), GOI co-chair Mr. SK Sharma (Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defense).  Working Group 5: Standards.  USG co-chair Dr. Ron Ross (NIST), GOI co-chair Dr. SL Sarnot (Director General, Standards/Testing/Quality Certification Directorate, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology).  39.  (SBU) The two-day government-to-government forum was tentatively agreed to be structured as follows:  -- 11/9 morning: A comprehensive plenary session with all delegates attending.  Working groups give short presentations of key challenges and accomplishments in their fields. -- 11/9 afternoon: Plenary continues.  Working groups continue their briefings. -- 11/10 morning: Working groups break out into separate meetings. -- 11/10 afternoon: Plenary reconvenes for lunch.  Working groups report progress and road maps outlining next steps. Prepare joint statement.  USG Participants ----------------  40.  (SBU) The following USG personnel participated in the preparatory consultations:  Michele Markoff, Senior Coordinator for International Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy, State/PM Tim Bloechl, Director of International Information Assurance Programs, DOD Linda Hall, US Embassy New Delhi, ORA Howard Madnick, US Embassy New Delhi, POL Maj. Greg Winston, US Embassy New Delhi, ODC  GOI Participants ----------------  41.  (SBU) The following GOI officials participated in the preparatory consultations:  Arvind Gupta, Joint Secretary, NSCS (Ref B) Commander Mukesh Saini, Deputy Director (Information Security), NSCS (Ref B) Rajesh Mohan, Joint Director, National Security Council Secretariat  SIPDIS Commodore J Jena, HQ Integrated Defense Staff/DACIDS (Information Warfare/Information Technology) Renuka Muttoo, Joint Director, Ministry of Home Affairs Dr. G Athithan, Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)/Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Dr. SL Sarnot, Director General Standards/Testing/Quality Certification Directorate, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Department of Information Technology S Basu, Senior Director, DIT ASA Krishnan, Director R&D, DIT Anil Sagar, Operations Manager, CERT-In Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Scientist B, CERT-In, DIT  42.

NEWDELHI 6983      B. NEWDELHI 6472  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: The GOI has engaged actively with East Asian capitals prior to the November 30 ASEAN Plus One Summit in Laos.  India's two-track approach to these states--multilaterally through organizations like ASEAN, and bilaterally--exemplifies New Delhi's strategy of expanding economic and geographic horizons, with a wary eye on China. Heading to Laos with Plus One status, India's Prime Minister Singh will look to assert India's significance beyond South Asia.  We see competition with China as a growing factor in India's ASEAN calculus.  End Summary.  Two-Pronged Approach --------------------  2.  (C) India's approach towards East Asia is \"two-pronged\" with both multilateral and bilateral tracks, according to Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses researcher Deba Mohanty.  While pursuing bilateral cooperation such as preferential trade agreements (PTA), India works multilaterally through organizations such as BIMSTEC and ASEAN, he explained.  The GOI is proceeding \"incrementally,\" he said, courting only select countries, at first economically, and then politically.  Recent Bilaterals: Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, Japan --------------------------------------------- ------------  3.  (C) In October, senior GOI officials visited and hosted officials from a number of East Asian countries.  South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun traveled to New Delhi October 4-6, at the conclusion of which, the two countries signed a joint statement detailing cooperation in security, trade, and UNSC reform (Ref B).  Earning a second Bangkok stamp in his passport in less than six months, FM Natwar Singh stopped in Thailand on October 14, enroute to Hanoi.  While India has deepening economic ties with Thailand, such as the nascent PTA, there are also geostrategic components to India's interests in that country.  According to JNU Professor of South East Asian studies Manmohini Kaul, Thailand encouraged the GOI to engage Burma ahead of Than Shwe's Delhi trip.  4.  (C) FM Singh's trip to Vietnam October 15-18 was less significant in strategic terms, Kaul continued, describing that relationship as more \"historical.\"  The FM also made an effort to secure one more handshake in support of India's bid for permanent membership in the UNSC.  The IDSA's Mohanty noted that India sees Vietnam as a big market, but also as a \"strategic balance between China and East Asia,\" which has resulted in \"low level discomfort\" in Beijing.  5.  (C) Burmese military leader Than Shwe's October 24-29 visit to India was important in the context of Burma's position as India's gateway to East Asia (Ref A).  Mohanty observed that \"Look East\" began with Burma.  India will also follow a \"two track policy,\" there of not alienating the government for economic reasons, but will attempt to \"create space for democracy.\"  Following the Japanese Foreign Minister's visit to New Delhi this summer, a Parliamentary delegation lead by Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee traveled to Japan from October 31 to November 6 and met with Japanese officials including PM Junichiro Koizumi.  The Japanese Embassy called the visit an attempt to \"resuscitate Parliamentary exchanges,\" supporting Mohanty's observation that India is trying to \"renew ties with Japan in a big way,\" after the relationship flatlined following India's 1998 nuclear tests.  Multilateral Prong: ASEAN -------------------------  6.  (C) The GOI's recent bilateral exchanges with East Asia complement its outreach to ASEAN as an institution.  Prior to Natwar Singh's departure for Bangkok and Hanoi, the MEA observed that Vietnam is part of ASEAN and India-Vietnam relations \"have coincided with developments in India-ASEAN relations.\"  Looking ahead to November's ASEAN Plus One Summit in Laos, Kaul said that despite India's early reservations about the organization because of conflicts with its historical non-aligned orientation, India appreciates its ASEAN Plus One designation as recognition of New Delhi's importance on par with the ASEAN Plus Three countries (South Korea, Japan, and China).  Professor Kaul noted that the Plus One designation may be an attempt to stave off India, as few ASEAN members support India's fuller membership in the grouping.  China vs. India: Heavyweight Matchup ------------------------------------  7.  (C) Our interlocutors stress the growing importance of China in India's calculations with respect to East Asia. Professor Kaul observed that East Asian leaders encourage India's greater involvement as a \"balance\" to China's growing influence: \"other countries know that only India can stand up to China.\"  The IDSA's Mohanty put it more simply: \"the reason for \"Look East\" is China,\" even though it is a two-way exchange.  India, concerned about Chinese encroachment into neighboring countries, such as Burma, is eager to insert itself into East Asia.  While the dominant view here is of the two Asian giants butting heads strategically, Mohanty commented that CT interests could bring India and China together.  Asked why India has not been invited to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a CT grouping of China's creating, Mohanty said India is still unsure of Beijing's intentions with the SCO.  8.  (C) Professor Kaul noted that India was welcome in East Asia because New Delhi \"has not given any indication of having big brotherly or hegemonistic intentions.\"  The difference between China and India in East Asia, she added, is that while \"India makes announcements, China is striding ahead.\"  As an example she offered the much touted but as yet non-existent Thailand, Burma, India highway, and asked rhetorically, \"who will travel on it?\"  Mohanty observed that India will downplay the China factor in its \"Look East\" policy in favor of plugging economic initiatives.  The UPA's Eastern Impetus -------------------------  9.  (C) Professor Kaul observed that the GOI has a Look Easter in the PMO's office in the form of Media Adviser Sanjay Baru who is known to be a strong proponent of BIMSTEC (the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Economic Cooperation).  She argued that Baru would help to reinforce the government's East Asia emphasis.  Comment -------  10.  (C) Strengthening India's relations with East Asia presents New Delhi with an opportunity to assert its interests both economically and strategically, in a region where its motivations are not yet perceived as \"big brotherly.\"  This contrasts with the sense among India's immediate South Asian neighbors that New Delhi's intentions are over-bearing, if not hegemonistic.  As India is already recognized as the big player in South Asia, strategic concerns vis-a-vis China are less salient.  PM Manmohan Singh's immediate thrust at the ASEAN Plus One Summit is likely to be economic, as India beefs up its regional profile, but this will also be an opportunity for the little-traveled PM to engage with a broader cross-section of East and Southeast Asian leaders as he continues to define the Congress vision for international relations.

NEW DELHI 7013       B. NEW DELHI 6500      C. NEW DELHI 6733      D. NEW DELHI 6599  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  After reviewing achievements made under Phase One (Ref A), the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) Implementation Group discussed the way forward on Phase Two, including legislation, enforcement, outreach, and training to strengthen export controls; adherence to MCTR and NSG Guidelines; nuclear safety; space cooperation; and missile defense.  The Indians commented that work is already well-advanced on issues such as developing a framework for stronger export controls.  Considerable effort, however, must be sustained to ensure effective implementation such as introducing legislation that adequately covers \"intangible\" technology transfers and provides for \"catch-all\" controls. Other issues, such as formulation of an Indian missile defense doctrine, remain in the beginning stage.  The Indian side agreed to a further discussion of Phase Two issues in connection with the November 18-19 High-Tech Cooperation Group (HTCG) meeting.  See para 21 for a GOI-drafted list of issues for follow-up by the GOI and USG.  End Summary.  2.  (U) A/S Rocca led the USG delegation comprised of Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, DCM, PolCouns, and representatives from the State Department's Bureaus for South Asia, Non-Proliferation, and Arms Control, the Department of Defense, as well as the Science and Customs offices at Embassy New Delhi.  With similarly broad representation, the GOI delegation was led by MEA Additional Secretary for International Security Meera Shankar, with  SIPDIS participation from MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar, other MEA officials from the Americas and Disarmament Divisions as well as representatives from the Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Space, and the Defense Ministry's Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO).  Because of scheduling constraints, not all participants were able to attend all sessions. Participant list follows in para 21.  Ongoing End-User Verification -----------------------------  3.  (C) In the October 21 session of the Implementation Group meeting, Joint Secretary Jaishankar expressed the GOI desire to respond in a timely manner to the end-user verification requests which Commerce U/S Juster gave the GOI on October 11 (Reftel B), but requested better information on the following issues:  -- Better contact information for the companies, e.g., name of specific subsidiary, location, etc.  (He noted the GOI used to receive this information regularly in the past);  -- Purchase reference numbers to allow cases to be cross-checked between the Indian and US sytems;  -- An indicative list of what information the US requires for post-shipment verification;  -- Information about Indian license requests that have been denied in order to have a better understanding of what is acceptable;  -- A contact person for export issues.  (Note: New MEA/Americas Under Secretary Raj Srivastava will be the GOI POC and Embassy New Delhi expects a DOC export attache to arrive shortly.)  --  Amendment of the footnote to Commerce's missile catch-all regulation, citing India's missile program as an entity of concern.  4.  (C) Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration Matthew Borman responded that a number of these requests can be accommodated and some, such as the request for purchase numbers, will need review.  On amending the missile catch-all footnote, Borman said the amendment has not yet been published, but said he expected the rule, including removal of the missile footnote, to be published the week of October 25.  Phase 2: GOI Steps on Legislation, Enforcement, Outreach, Training -------- ------------------------ ------------- ------------------  5.  (C) On strengthening the legislative framework for export controls, Russell noted that UNSCR 1540 calls on all countries to adopt the same kind of export control laws and practices that are outlined in the NSSP.   Shankar expressed confidence in the GOI system of export controls, but stressed that the resources India devotes to controls for high-tech goods should be proportional to its trade in that area, which she described as \"infinitesimal.\"  She noted that the GOI has other government priorities and that steps taken need to be reasonable given resource constraints.  Shankar presented a non-paper on \"India's System of Controls Over Exports of Dual-Use Materials, Equipment and Technology\" (Reftel C).  6.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar outlined the ongoing process of strengthening GOI export controls through legislative, policy, and administrative modifications. Legislative amendments include revising the Customs and Finance Acts to make violations punishable by imprisonment. Shankar offered to share GOI draft legislation, pending appropriate internal clearances.  Policy changes include mandatory licensing for export, re-export, and transit of all \"Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technologies\" (SCOMET) items, including damaged, defective, or used items; controls on intangible technology related to SCOMET items; and a \"catch all\" provision which affords the GOI latitude in interpreting which dual-use items may be used for suspect activities.  Administrative controls include better inter-ministerial coordination through high-level and working-level groups.  7.  (C) As the GOI strengthens export controls, Shankar relayed private sector concern that new regulations would obstruct business, not proliferation.  Russell noted that all countries face this concern but offered that governments such as Hong Kong, which have tightened controls, have found that high tech trade has flourished, boosted by confidence that only legitimate businesses would be willing to operate in a regulated business environment.  Preventive Enforcement ----------------------  8.  (C) Acknowledging India's basic legal framework governing export controls, A/S Rocca also suggested four areas in need of enhanced legislation and enforcement:  intangible technology transfers, brokering, transit and re-export, and \"catch-all\" controls.  DAS Borman gave the GOI a non-paper with suggestions for ways to strengthen GOI preventive enforcement capabilities.  9.  (C) Under Secretary for Disarmament and International Security Affairs Nutan Kapoor listed GOI efforts to enhance their enforcement capabilities:  some pre-license checks on end-users, risk assessments, post-shipment/installation verification, and random inspections, all of which may result in confiscation or other penalties.  These measures also apply to brokering activities of authorized customs house agents.  To prevent the unauthorized transfer of intangible technology, Indian scientists going abroad for training must get GOI clearance, as do scholars, while visa applications for visiting scientists and scholars are subject to inter-ministerial approval.  On re-exports, Kapoor said that under all circumstances, SCOMET items can only be exported with a license and that the GOI undertakes pre-license checks.  Finally, training for Customs officials is ongoing. For example, India and the US have had 16 exchanges of export control experts since 2000, four in the past year.  Russell underscored the value of EXBS exchanges, and offered to provide more training as India increases its staffing in this area.  As this is an evolving process, Shankar also suggested examining best practices from other countries and regimes.  Outreach Initiatives Complicated by Visa Problems -------------------- ----------------------------  10.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar reported that relevant GOI departments, including the MEA, are in the process of conducting outreach to industry and related associations.  She also suggested that industry-to-industry outreach would be constructive.  However, the GOI is awaiting a response from the USG on several proposals for industry-to-industry exchanges, according to Jaishankar, complicated by the \"hangover effect\" of difficulties Indian scientists face in obtaining visas.  He recalled cases where individual scientists were granted visas but were then barred from visiting the labs that had invited them.  He said he spoke to A/S for Consular Affairs Maura Harty about the matter during her recent visit to New Delhi.  \"The ongoing problem of visas poses a serious operational constraint on what we're trying to do,\" he said.  A/S Rocca assured him that the US is aware of these problems and is trying to streamline this process, which requires clearances from several agencies before a visa is issued.  Adherence to MTCR and NSG Guidelines ------------------------------------  11.  (C) An important step required of India in Phase Two is agreeing to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines and Annex and the NSG Guidelines, and its associated trigger list and dual-use list.  Russell described the MTCR as a non-treaty political understanding among 34 states sharing common interests in the non-proliferation of missiles, rocket and unmanned air vehicle systems and technology.  Other countries can \"adhere\" to the MTCR unilaterally without being a member of the regime, as have Israel and Romania, she said.  12.  (C) Drawing from prepared points, Russell went on to explain that Part 1 of the NSG Guidelines requires that for transfers of Trigger List items or technology, the recipient state must have IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear facilities (\"full-scope safeguards\").  Part 2 of the Guidelines governs exports of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, technology and materials.  Actual adherence is not required in Phase Two, but rather, India should provide a firm commitment in Phase Two to adhere to these regimes in Phase Three.  Such a commitment would be in writing, similar to the policy statements that India provided in Phase One.  Actual adherence would come in Phase Three, and would involve the related actions by India in that phase, including: harmonization of its national control list with the export control lists of the regimes; and enactment of relevant legislation to conform to the accepted standard among regime members and adherents, including on intangible technology transfers and catch-all.  13.  (C) In response, GOI Department of Atomic Energy representative noted that the India already has stringent mechanisms in place that are analogous to the NSG guidelines, such as the Proscribed Equipment List, Proscribed Substances List, and Radioactive Items List.  US Steps on License Requirements, Nuke Safety, Space, MD ----------- --------------------- ----------------------  14.  (C) DAS Borman listed what the US has committed to do under Phase Two:  Remove license requirements for EAR 999/99 items to all safeguarded facilities in India; expand NRC dialogue to cover topics in Phase Two; and suggested a US-India cooperation on satellite development, production, marketing and operating.  Jaishankar asked for a paper clarifying what removal of EAR 99 license requirements entails, rather than \"having to interpret US law for ourselves.\"  Removal of EAR 99 license requirements was the subject of a separate meeting between Borman, NP representative, and GOI officials (septel).  Request for Flexibility on Nuclear Safety -----------------------------------------  15.  (C) In the October 20 session, Shankar expressed strong interest in examining how some US controls can be relaxed in Phase Two, specifically for NSG controlled safety-related equipment, perhaps under the NSG safety exemption. \"Flexibility on this would make it easier to demonstrate progress to our constituency, so that they see that we are getting something in exchange for revising our laws,\" she argued.  The Department of Atomic Energy representative expressed hope that cooperation will be expanded beyond the nuclear island and include training related to fourth generation nuclear reactors. Russell noted that the trend in the NSG has been to strengthen the safety exemption rather than be more lenient.  Jaishankar added that he wanted to explore training opportunities for Indian scientists in nuclear safety and hopes to expand the dialogue on this issue to include the US Department of Energy.  Expanded Cooperation on Civil Space Programs ----------------------------------- --------  16.  (C) On expanding cooperation on civil space programs, DAS Borman said that Phase Three will involve the signing of a Space Launch Agreement, similar to that which the US signed with Russia and Ukraine.  Jaishankar expressed interest in this agreement, which in Phase Three would allow the launch of US satellites as well as indigenous satellites with US components.  Department of Space representative reaffirmed GOI intention to revise ISRO's Request for Proposals to require disclosure of US content and compliance with US licensing conditions (Reftel D).  Responding to ISRO questions about the US commitment to space cooperation, PolCouns underscored the end-state we seek for full scope US-Indian civilian space cooperation, including ability to launch US satellites and satellites with US components.  17.  (C) Demonstrating the societal benefits of India's space program, Space Department representative said that the GOI recently initiated a program to link village council members around the country via satellite and communication equipment provided by ISRO.  ISRO representative also detailed several pending requests in the area of space cooperation.  DAS Borman suggested the GOI provide a list of the sort of specific cooperation that ISRO would like to see in Phase Two as well as a list of the pending requests mentioned. Finally, when asked when all ISRO subsidiaries would be removed from the Entity List, Borman responded that such an issue could not be reviewed until after Phase Three.  Missile Defense ---------------  18.  (C) On continuing the missile defense dialogue, in the October 20 session, Shankar said the GOI will first undertake an internal exploratory meeting with its agencies. Responding to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) proposal (made at the June 2004 Defense Policy Group meeting) to conduct a series of planning events leading to a command post exercise in January 2006, Jaishankar said the GOI agrees with the proposal and would like to conduct the first planning meeting in the first quarter of CY 2005.  Regarding the US offer to sell India PAC-2 missile defense capability, Jaishankar said the GOI wants to \"telescope\" (combine) briefings on PAC-2 and PAC-3, so the &right set of people8 can look at the issue in its entirety. OSD India Country Director Alverson replied that he would convey the GOI requests to DOD officials in Washington.  Alverson noted that the MDA activities would be useful to India in helping India determine for itself what are its missile defense requirements, which should be the first element of conversation between our experts on the sale of a missile defense system.

(C) Summary: Following two relatively rocky summits, and the postponement of this year's meeting, New Delhi hopes the November 8 India-EU Summit will yield tangible progress, MEA Director (Europe - I) Dammu Ravi told Poloff on November 2. The GOI priority is to kickoff a new \"strategic partnership\" with Europe, although the parties have yet to fill it with much substance.  Collaboration on climate change, science and technology, and cultural cooperation are likely to be the major emphases of the Indian delegation.  New Delhi is much more interested in engaging bilaterally with major EU players like the UK, France, and Germany, and is frustrated when smaller EU members hold the Presidency, not only because of their perceived lack of gravitas, but also because they are prone to sermonizing on human rights and nuclear proliferation.  The MEA is skeptical of the EU's ability to present a coherent foreign policy, and privately describes the conglomerate as naive, overly pro-active, and short-sighted, particularly when it comes to developments in South Asia.  Despite the rhetoric on strategic partnership, New Delhi will continue to emphasize bilateral relations with London, Paris, and Berlin at the expense of the EU, as evidenced by the October 27-28 visit of French FM Barnier. End Summary.  Towards \"Strategic Partnership\" -------------------------------  2.  (C) India and the EU are \"slowly broadening our areas of interaction,\" from primarily an economic focus to a greater political dialogue, MEA Director (Europe - I) Dammu Ravi told Poloff on November 2.  As India's largest trading block, with USD 28 billion per year in two-way trade (compared to USD 18 billion with the US), economic issues have traditionally served as the driving force behind India's relations with EU member states.  While finance and trade will continue to dominate New Delhi's ties with Europe, India has responded positively to EU overtures to move toward a \"strategic partnership.\"  This strategic partnership will strengthen collaboration in five key areas, including: multilateral conflict prevention; the fight against terrorism; non-proliferation and human rights; strengthened economic partnerships; development policies to help India meet the millennium development goals; and intellectual and cultural exchanges.  3.  (C) According to local media, the goal is eventually to pattern the strategic relationship after the US-India Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP), including the transfer of non-military technology and joint research in the civilian nuclear field, although there is no endorsement of anything approaching the level of US-India engagement in this area. MEA's Ravi asserted the GOI hope for greater interaction in the areas of science and technology, specifically mentioning biotechnology and nanotechnology.  Underlining on-going Indo-European cooperation on Galileo, and satellite launches, Ravi commented that India's large pool of scientifically literate manpower offers many \"natural opportunities for collaboration.\"  Expectations for the Summit ---------------------------  4.  (C) Given the disappointing results from the 2002 and 2003 summits, India views the November 8 Hague meeting as an opportunity to get the process back on track.  The postponement of this year's gathering due to the illness of Dutch PM Jan Peter Balkanende created anxieties about a reprise of the 2003 summit which then-EU President Silvio Berlusconi failed to attend due to stomach ailments, despite high-level attendance on the Indian side.  (Note: The 2002 Summit was overshadowed by strong public differences between India and the EU over Kashmir, dialogue in South Asia, and cross-border terrorism, a situation reflected by the absence of any mention of these subjects in the joint statement.)  In view of the past problems, India is hoping for a successful event this year, Ravi told us, explaining that New Delhi plans to arrive there \"at full strength,\"  despite the fact that \"these events are largely symbolic anyway.\"  The GOI delegation will include the PM, FM Natwar Singh, NSA JN Dixit, Commerce Minister Nath, and Foreign Secretary Saran.  5.  (C) In a soon-to-be-published interview with the \"Financial Times,\" PM Manmohan Singh identified a variety of economic and social issues for which he would like to see a stronger partnership between the EU and India, and specifically mentioned climate change.  Ravi noted New Delhi's satisfaction with the EU's recognition of India as an influential actor in the global war against terrorism, WMD, and climate change, and said the EU's desire for a strategic partnership with New Delhi indicates Brussels' recognition that India is a rising global power.  Big Powers and Small States ---------------------------  6.  (C) While emphasizing that \"India does not discriminate\" between the larger and smaller EU states, Ravi observed that India draws a distinction between those with more influence and power, such as the two permanent Security Council and multiple G-8 members.  In India's experience, smaller countries (such as Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Greece) tend to focus more on sensitive issues such as human rights and non-proliferation, while the larger countries such as France, Germany, and the UK emphasize economic issues, defense, and military cooperation.  The GOI also discusses human rights and non-proliferation with these countries, but such subjects are more palatable in a larger strategic context.  He added that India views many of the small EU member countries as \"intrusive and preachy.\"  7.  (C) The difference between the large and small European states' approach to India becomes a problem when countries like Ireland and Denmark assume the EU presidency, Ravi commented, explaining that they bring human rights and non-proliferation issues to the top of the agenda.  While Brussels' institutions are broadly supportive of ties with India, and will not hold them \"hostage\" to certain issues, New Delhi looks forward to the UK's assumption of the Presidency in January, Ravi stated.  8.  (C) As the world's most populous democracy and an aspiring global power, India views criticism from smaller European countries as an indication that they do not take New Delhi seriously as a global player.  Jawaharlal Nehru University European Studies Professor Salma Bava characterized the July 2003 GOI decision to refuse aid from countries other than the US, UK, Germany, Japan, the EU, and Russia as an attempt to demonstrate New Delhi's rising power status.  Although the decision has since been partially reversed, the GOI hoped to remove financial leverage from those countries prone to sermonizing about human rights, she surmised.  A \"Difference in Perception\" on South Asia ------------------------------------------  9.  (C) Indo-European differences of opinion on political matters are most pronounced over developments in India's backyard.  Whether regarding Burma, Nepal, Bhutan, or Kashmir, MEA officials have expressed annoyance with the EU approach to South Asia, describing the EU as too \"obvious, shabby, shortsighted and full of contradictions,\" naive, overly pro-active, and possessing a \"tendency to go overboard\" when it comes to delicate issues (Refs A and C).  10.  (C) According to MEA Director Ravi, the EU has supported or pursued policies \"which will not help South Asia in the long run.\"  The EU instinct is to internationalize issues, such as Nepal and Kashmir, that India believes are better located in the bilateral realm.  The EU has not yet realized that when it comes to South Asia, \"India understands the issues best,\" he opined.  11.  (C) Ravi echoed Joint Secretary (Nepal and Bhutan) Ranjit Rae's recent assessment that the EU has illustrated its naivete on Nepal by pursuing an interventionist, UN-tinged approach.  He underlined the lack of unity within the EU on Nepal, observing that some member states believe the best approach is to support the Monarchy, while others argue for military intervention.  Europe should carefully choose its words \"because what they say could have extreme consequences.\"  He also emphasized the Indian perception that the EU is unbalanced when dealing with Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. \"Encouraging the sides to talk is one thing,\" but the EU has a reputation for being \"partisan\" in favor of the refugees, he stated.  Clumsy on Kashmir -----------------  12.  (C) According to JNU's Bava, the clumsy EU positions on Kashmir have fed Indian skepticism of the EU as a political entity.  EU Ambassador Francisco da Camara Gomes' June comment that Kashmir is \"an integral part of India,\" not only created an uproar among Kashmiri separatist groups but served to illustrate Europe's lumbering approach to one of India's most sensitive subjects.  An EU parliamentary group that traveled to Kashmir shortly after the remarks described Kashmir as a \"nuclear flashpoint,\" and termed the Kashmir Valley as \"the world's most beautiful prison,\" while encouraging tripartite talks involving India, Pakistan, and the Kashmiris, seriously annoying New Delhi (Ref B).  Bilateral Engagement at EU Expense ----------------------------------  13.  (C) As the EU has yet to formulate a common foreign policy, it is a difficult entity to deal with politically, the MEA's Ravi observed.  According to Professor Bava, the lack of political consensus within the EU, on Iraq for example, prevents New Delhi from viewing Brussels as a serious interlocutor on political affairs.  The EU does not present a unified front on these issues, encouraging the GOI to cultivate bilateral political relationships, often at the expense of the EU as an institution.  Bava agreed that India benefits from the political differences among EU member states, speculating that the GOI will continue engaging the Europeans bilaterally, despite plans for an India-EU strategic partnership.  14.  (C) Although a new development in India's relations with the EU, \"strategic partnerships\" between New Delhi and individual European countries are already well underway.  The MEA has described the GOI's bilateral relations with the UK, Germany, France and Italy as \"strategic partnerships,\" always emphasizing the bilateral aspect of relations during high-level visits to New Delhi.  (See Ref E for information on the latest Indo-German interaction.)  Barnier's Visit ---------------  15.  (C) During French FM Michel Barnier's October 27-28 visit to New Delhi, strategic issues, including defense, civilian nuclear cooperation, and the GOF's project to sell six Scorpene submarines were high on the agenda.  Offering an upbeat assessment of the visit, which followed the February visit of former FM de Villepin (Ref D), the MEA's Ravi described Paris as \"largely supportive\" of India's initiatives.  France never criticizes New Delhi's nuclear ambitions, and acknowledges that the GOI non-proliferation record is as \"clean as can be,\" he stated.  Expressing New Delhi's disappointment that the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) \"bottlenecks the way France wants to cooperate\" on nuclear issues, Ravi said Indian officials had encouraged France to be more forthright in engagement with other NSG members, and to convey the message that \"India is different.\"  16.  (C) Prior to Barnier's visit, Indian officials in Paris and Foreign Secretary Saran in Delhi conveyed a strong message on India's desire to cooperate with France in the nuclear arena, pointing to an increase in Indian impatience for the NSG to accommodate India on fuel supplies and other nuclear technology.  During the visit, FM Natwar Singh and NSA JN Dixit repeatedly offered a less pointed message. According to the French Embassy, Barnier indicated in response that Paris was sympathetic to India's concerns, but that the NPT and NSG created substantial obstacles that would not easily be overcome.  The French Embassy said after the fact that, if there was a move within the NSG to find accommodation for India, Paris would be sympathetic, but that France (\"unlike Russia\") would not be willing to breach the NSG unilaterally for India's benefit.  Press reports focused on the French invitation for India to participate in the International Thermonuclear Reactor project (ITER), noting that it would bracket India with key international players, including all five nuclear powers.  However, the MEA has not confirmed these reports.  Comment -------  17.  (C) The November 8 India-EU summit will provide the first concrete indications of just how much weight the GOI is willing to give to the EU as a serious political partner. Despite New Delhi's positive noises about a \"strategic partnership\" and hopes for a successful summit, political relations with the European Union will likely continue to take a back seat to New Delhi's bilateral relations with the larger EU member states.  Over the long term, significant differences of opinion about the approach to conflicts in South Asia, as well as New Delhi's strategy of cultivating relationships primarily with those countries the GOI believes to be of major power status, will constrain the India-EU political relationship.

(C) Summary:  Since losing the May elections, the BJP leadership has failed to resolve internal disputes between its moderate and Hindutva wings over the reasons for its defeat.  The Sangh (family of Hindu groups) is urging the party to return to its Hindutva roots, but the leadership is unwilling to endorse this course.  Party President and former DPM Advani is leaning towards \"moderate Hindutva\" as a means to placate the Sangh and keep secular parties in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  Although determined to confront the UPA both inside and outside of Parliament, the BJP cannot return to power over the medium term, and poses no serious threat to the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.  Both the NDA and UPA are concentrating on three state elections slated for February 2005, which could consolidate Congress momentum according to early predictions.  Should the BJP do badly in these contests, the UPA could remain in power for years to come.  End Summary.  Confusion Still Reigns ----------------------  2.  (U) On October 18, the BJP sacked party President Venkaiah Naidu, and replaced him with former DPM L.K. Advani (Ref B).  Press reports indicate that the BJP hopes Advani will provide strong leadership, overcome deep rifts in the party leadership, and lead it back to power.  In an early indication as to which direction he wants to take the party, Advani committed the BJP to building a Ram temple in Ayodhya on October 26, met RSS leaders for two hours on October 31, and pledged to attend a hard-line RSS leadership conference on November 5 and 6 in Hardwar.  3.  (U) Indications are that the party's internal rifts remain as deep as ever.  On November 1, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Ashok Singal criticized Advani as a \"stop-gap\" president who lacked mass appeal, and the Sangh Parivar leadership said it would accept nothing less than a return to Hindutva ideology.  Despite its unhappiness with the BJP's failure to return to Hindutva, the Sangh Parivar gave no indication that it would follow through on earlier threats to form a purely Hindu party.  On October 31, a disaffected RSS activist revived the old Jan Sangh as a new Hindu nationalist grouping, but no BJP leaders joined him.  Limited Options ---------------  4.  (C) On November 4, well-connected television journalist Harish Gupta told Poloff that the RSS wants Advani to give up aspirations of a quick return to power, to allow the UPA government to complete a full five-year term, and to use that period to rebuild the party from the ground up.  According to Gupta, Advani is reluctant to accept this plan, as it would prevent him from becoming PM.  If the party adopted this approach, it would have to select an heir apparent from its second tier leadership.  The two most likely candidates are Murli Manohar Joshi and Sushma Swaraj, both of whom are hard-liners who enjoy the confidence of the Sangh Parivar  5.  (C) Gupta claimed that Joshi was the Sangh Parivar's first choice to become party president and Advani was happy to remain leader of the parliamentary opposition, taking the job only to prevent Joshi's rise to power.  Gupta predicted that Advani would fare badly in the post, as the BJP's current options are extremely limited, and that he would take the blame for a situation in which there is little prospect for a positive outcome.  6.  (C) Gupta pointed out that Bihar and Jharkhand go to the polls in February 2005, and because the BJP has no presence there, it must rely on its ally the Janata Dal(U), headed by former Defense Minister George Fernandes to carry the NDA's water.  The strongly secular Fernandes objected to Advani's pro Hindutva tilt and comments regarding the Ram temple, setting off speculation that his party could leave the NDA. This leaves Advani trapped between the Sangh Parivar and the NDA's secular allies, with no easy choice between the two. Deep Divisions --------------  7.  (C) The BJP itself remains deeply divided and in no shape to present a serious challenge to the UPA government. Advani's public stance indicates that he hopes to unite the party around a \"moderate Hindutva\" orientation aimed at pleasing the Sangh Parivar while not alienating moderates led by Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan, and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi. Advani is counting on the help of Joshi and Sushma Swaraj, who are ascendant.  However, both Joshi and Swaraj want to become PM.  Until the party agrees on its next PM candidate, it will be plagued by continued distrust and rivalry within its top leadership.  But Determined to Confront the UPA ----------------------------------  8.  (C) Despite its weaknesses and string of electoral defeats, the BJP remains determined to confront the UPA, even on economic reform where there is no substantive disagreement.  In a November 1 meeting with the Ambassador (Ref A), BJP Rajya Sabha leader Jaswant Singh bristled at the personal attacks by the UPA has been leveling against the BJP leadership and what it views as UPA efforts to purge the bureaucracy of civil servants with BJP sympathies.  Singh also disparaged PM Manmohan Singh's abilities and described the cabinet as a \"disaster.\"  9.  (SBU) Advani and other BJP parliamentary leaders confirmed this private stance, telling the press that the party will confront the UPA on the floor of parliament on a long laundry list of issues including:  \"tainted ministers,\" the UPA's handling of terrorism in J&K, and the government's handling of domestic security, which Party spokesman Naqvi characterized as \"the worst since Independence.\"  10.  (U) Although the BJP will confront the UPA in Parliament, it is also planning to change its tactics. Advani told the party leadership that the previous disruptions were \"counterproductive,\" and that the party was determined to conduct no more walkouts and boycotts.  Advani characterized these as \"mistakes,\" saying \"I don't think it will happen again.\"  However, speaking at a November 5 conference, party leader and former Law Minister Arun Jaitley made clear that the BJP would not apologize for introducing parliamentary gridlock that makes it difficult for the UPA to pursue a substantive agenda.  No Good Options ---------------  11.  (C) Although the BJP will continue to lock horns with Congress, there is little to indicate that this will benefit the party, as there is no clear option under which the BJP could quickly return to power.  The BJP and its NDA allies do not currently have the numbers to bring down the government through defection, or a vote of no-confidence, and are not strong enough to defeat the UPA in an election.  12.  (C) The Left/Communists can bring down the government by withdrawing their support, but this would not benefit the BJP, because it does not have enough allies to put together an alternative.  The Communists would only leave the UPA after forging a third front with other Left-oriented parties such as the Janata Dal(U) of Bihar and the Samajwadi Party(SP) of Uttar Pradesh (UP), led by Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.  As a sworn enemy of the Left, the BJP could never join or support such a grouping.  13.  (C) The Sangh Parivar leadership argues that the BJP should stop attempting to strengthen the NDA by pandering to secular parties, and instead ally only with the Shiv Sena and those parties willing to accept its Hindutva agenda.  Should Advani accept this proposal, it would further weaken the NDA by causing most secular parties to leave the alliance, postponing the day when it can return to power.  Should he reject it, the increasingly disaffected Sangh Parivar could withdraw its support, which is crucial to the BJP's grass roots organization.  The Importance of State Elections ---------------------------------  14.  (C) The NDA and the UPA are now focused on the February elections in Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana, as they will be indicative of which grouping is generating political momentum.  Congress sees these state victories as a crucial step towards its goal of gaining sufficient strength to call new elections, win a Parliamentary majority and form a government without the Communists.  Most political observers agree that as soon as Congress is strong enough, it will call new elections.  15.  (C) In order to blunt UPA momentum, the BJP/NDA needs to demonstrate to the Indian voter that it is gathering strength and can present a serious electoral challenge to Congress. Should the NDA fare badly in these state elections, it will lose momentum, leading to more divisions, increasing criticism of Advani and more calls by the Sangh Parivar to embrace a Hindu nationalist ideology and agenda.  Comment -------  16.  (C) India's key political players -- the BJP/NDA, the Congress/UPA and the Communists -- are all vying for position, with trends favoring Congress.  However, none of the three groupings has sufficient strength to rule on its own, and the BJP cannot bring down the government or bring on a new election.  Although the BJP will engage in noisy disputes with the UPA on a number of issues in the coming months, they are unlikely to have much impact, aside from slowing legislation.  With the BJP distracted by deep divisions and immersed in its internal affairs, Congress has an opportunity to convince the electorate that it has the ability to rule effectively.  Facing no serious short-term political challenge from the BJP, Congress could only provide its BJP rivals an opening by failing to perform up to expectations. MULFORD " }

Jaishankar called DCM November 5, to inform the USG about the specifics of Indian assistance to Iraq to help prepare for the upcoming Iraqi elections.  Jaishankar said India is offering a 3-part assistance program:  -- The Indian Election Commission will provide training for thirty Iraqi election officials for a period of two weeks.  -- India will commit five million dollars to the International Democracy Fund under the aegis of the UN.  -- The Indian Election Commission also will offer to assist Iraq to draft regulations for the conduct of the Iraqi Elections.  Jaishankar said India is prepared to invite Iraqi Election Commission officials to India to consult on the draft regulations, if that would be helpful.  2. (C) DCM welcomed news of the Indian offer and asked whether India had communicated the specifics of its program to the Iraqis.  Jaishankar responded that thus far India had only communicated with the United States and the UN on this matter.  DCM urged Jaishankar to have the appropriate MEA officials contact the Iraqi's directly.  3. (C) DCM also asked whether India intended to make its offer public.  Jaishankar responded that an oblique reference to the assistance had appeared for the first time publicly in Prime Minister's Monmohan Singh's congratulatory letter to President Bush.  Given the continued sensitivities in India about Iraq, Jaishankar indicated that it would be best from India's domestic political perspective to keep news of India's program in a UN context.  He requested that the United States not make public news of India's electoral program, so that India could manage how and when to do so.  4. (C) Comment: India has undertaken this Electoral Assistance Program primarily as a gesture to the United States.  As Jaishankar's comments reflect, any kind of assistance by India to Iraq is likely to be sensitive here and subject to criticism by Left and others.  Mission requests that all addressees respect the GOI's request that the U.S. not publicize news of this offer until the GOI itself has done so.  5. (U) Minimize considered. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 7001       B. NEW DELHI 5569      C. NEW DELHI 7090  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: Indian Communist Party leaders have criticized PM Manmohan Singh's warm welcome of President Bush's re-election, calling this \"an attempt to please American imperialism.\"  Interestingly, however, party spokesperson D. Raja welcomed the PM's commitment to train Iraqi election officials in India enunciated in the same letter.  Other Left parties refused to comment on the US election outcome, saying they are more concerned about Indian domestic issues such as the November 4 petrol price hike and foreign direct investment.  End Summary.  Reaction to US Election -----------------------  2.  (C) In contrast to the ruling United Progressive Alliance, India's Communists have reacted ambivalently to negatively to the re-election of President Bush.  On November 4 Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) Politburo member MK Pandhe dismissed the congratulatory letter of PM Manmohan Singh to President Bush as \"an attempt to please American imperialism.\"  CPI spokesman D. Raja stated to Laboff on November 5 that \"Bush was not positive for India in the past,\" and he \"could not comment on how Bush will behave in his second term.\"  Concerns over Petrol Hike -------------------------  3.  (C) Rather than focusing on the US election results, our Left contacts emphasized domestic issues, asserting that they will continue to oppose UPA economic liberalization proposals, arguing that these overshadow foreign policy concerns for Indians.  They pointed out that the UPA and the Left have been discussing a petrol price hike for months, and finally reached a reluctant agreement.  Raja expressed concern about the increase, claiming it would further exacerbate inflation and worsen conditions for the poor. Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP Abani Roy reiterated to Laboff that the Left parties will keep close tabs on price increases of petroleum, diesel fuel, kerosene, and LPG (liquefied natural gas), and speak out if they become too egregious.  FDI ---  4.  (SBU) The Left Front leaders also repeated that they remain adamantly opposed to FDI hikes in the insurance and telecom sectors.  They pointed out that they agreed to an increase in civil aviation FDI from 40- 49% only because they believe it will benefit domestic airlines, and exclude foreign carriers.  Iraq ----  5.  (C) D. Raja emphasized that the GOI should send no Indians whatsoever to Iraq, even for election monitoring. However, the CPI welcomed the Prime Minister's proposal to train Iraqi election officials in India (ref C).  RSP MP Roy stated that a democratic Iraq is better for the world, adding that they would embrace training Iraqi election officials only under the auspices of the United Nations.  (Comment: the GOI has not publicized the specifics of its proposal yet as explained in ref C.)  Left Front leaders refused to comment on other aspects of the Bush administration's Iraq policy.  Comment -------  6.  (C) The Left Front's discontent with the UPA's pro-US and pro-economic liberalization policies continues to grow, and its dissent from the GOI's warm welcome of another Bush Presidency comes as no surprise.  As BJP leader Arun Jaitley recently pointed out, the Left increasingly behaves more like an opposition, than a supporter of the government.  But, as the Prime Minister's effusive letter to President Bush demonstrates, the government is willing to ignore the Left on many issues of importance to us. MULFORD " }

STATE 226012       B. NEW DELHI 7013      C. NEW DELHI 7061  Classified By: Charge Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  As instructed in Ref A, in a separate meeting at the conclusion of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) Implementation Group on October 21 (Refs B and C), Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Borman, and State Acting Office Director for Regional Affairs, Bureau of Non-Proliferation Russell delivered orally to MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar and other GOI officials  SIPDIS from MEA and the Departments of Space and Atomic Energy, language about specific activities that would contravene US export laws and our understandings under the Phase One assurances.  Jaishankar acknowledged the language, adding, \"We're all on board with that.\"  GOI officials also sought clarification about the implications of lifting various licensing requirements from the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and its subsidiaries, and asked for more information about items that may be available to India over the course of the next phases of the NSSP.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Drawing on points in Ref A, DAS Borman briefly outlined the crafting of the NSSP Letter of Assurances signed by Commerce U/S Juster and Foreign Secretary Saran on September 17.  Because the GOI found certain language about prohibited activities to be redundant, both USG and GOI experts agreed not to include the language in the final letter.  Seeking formal acknowledgement that the GOI understands what activities would contravene US export laws, Borman identified certain specific activities that U.S. and Indian experts had acknowledged would contravene U.S. export control laws and regulations, unless specifically authorized by the USG. These include the use of US-origin licensable items in: nuclear weapons or unsafeguarded nuclear activities or in ballistic missile programs, including any rocket or unmanned air vehicle system capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms to a range of at least 300 kilometers or any ballistic missile systems. In addition, U.S. export control laws and regulations impose certain limitations on re-exports or retransfers of such items. Admitting that US export regulations can be complicated, Russell added that the US could provide experts to clarify any issues that may arise regarding potential restrictions. After Borman presented points in Ref A, Jaishankar responded, \"We're all on board with that.\"  3.  (C) In response to Jaishankar's questions about the implications of easing Export Administration Regulation (EAR) 99 restrictions, Borman stated that in the case of space cooperation, for example, some 250 exports of EAR 99 items that previously required licenses would now be available to the seven subsidiaries of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) without a license, except if an item will be used for prohibited activities.  Such license-free items would include dual-use items for satellites, e.g., electronic equipment such as sensors.  Borman offered to provide a list of items that previously required licenses and to highlight the items for which license requirements would be lifted under the remaining Phases of the NSSP.  4.  (C) Dr. S.D. Misra of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) asked about the implications for licensing requirements, using oscilloscopes as an example.  Because oscilloscopes are used in televisions and are available on the local market, Misra questioned what would be the effect of lifting the licensing requirements for this item.  Borman replied that the US had approved 223 license applications for oscilloscopes in FY 04 and the license requirement for them would be lifted entirely in Phase Three.  5.  (C) GOI officials pressed further regarding items that may be licensable in Phases Two and Three of the NSSP. Jaishankar asked about the difference between EAR 99 items, Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), Commerce Control List (CCL) items, and Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) items.  Borman explained that EAR 99 is for items not specifically controlled by ECCNs, and that if an item is not on the CCL, it can generally be exported without a license, provided it is not used for banned activities. All items on the MCTR list, however, must have licenses, he stressed.  In response to Misra's query about why some items that are only used for safety purposes are controlled by EAR, Borman responded that such items may have a dual-use beyond safety measures.  6.  (C) Turning to the time limitations of controls, Misra asked if end-user verification would expire when an item reached the end of its practical working life.  Jaishankar concurred that it would be useful to have an agreement on an expiration date for end-user verification on applicable items.  Borman replied that the US would  require documentation to show that the item had been properly disposed of.  7.  (C) At the conclusion of the meeting, Jaishankar gave Borman a GOI-drafted list of items for follow-up from the NSSP Implementation Group meetings (Ref C).  Jaishankar reiterated the request for a non-paper or list clarifying which items may now be considered for export to India.  8.

Some Indian companies that buy high tech goods are asking potential U.S. exporters to agree to additional requirements regarding U.S. export controls, in some cases limiting the exporters' ability to sell in the Indian market.  The buyers require clauses in sales contracts that state: 1) that U.S. export licenses will be obtained by a prescribed date, or the exporter and agent will be liable for damages to the buyer for late delivery; 2) that the exporter will take full financial and legal responsibility in the event that the exporter does not comply with relevant export licensing regulations; or 3) that licensing for all phases of a project be complete on submission of the bid. End Summary.  2. (U) Embassy recently received indications that U.S. high tech exporters were being subject to unusual contract clauses by Indian public entity importers, requiring the U.S. firms to guarantee delivery times regardless of the status of export license applications.  At Embassy's request, the American Chamber of Commerce in India (AmCham) took a survey of its members to determine the extent of the time constraints and export control clauses.  Some companies reported problems that affected their ability to do business in India.  Specified Date Clause ---------------------  3. (SBU) Some U.S. companies have reported clauses in purchase agreements that require the delivery of goods within a specified period of time, and impose potential penalties for delays.  These delivery dates reportedly are based on the assumption that export licenses will be obtained by the exporter and do not allow for flexibility due to delay or denial of these licenses.  For example:  -- Oracle reported that it could not respond to a recent tender from Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL).  BEL required the bidder to guarantee that it will continue their supply/support even in the event that BEL or India comes under sanctions from the U.S. Government.  Oracle could not make that commitment and so did not bid, and the sale went to SAP of Germany.  -- Agilent representatives claim that they volunteer time commitments in their bids, and factor in wait times due to licensing requirements.  They claim that these commitments do not seriously affect their business.  -- IBM claims that it encountered one such request, though it did not bid on the tender.  It provided no details of this tender.  -- Codem Systems was not a respondent to AmCham's survey, but it has reported to the Commercial Service's Advocacy Center that it was penalized by Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) Telemetry Tracking & Command Network (ISTRAC) for a licensing delay (Ref A).  In this instance, Codem Systems had obtained a TAA 90 days before the contract signing, but the DSP-5 license took longer than expected.  ISTRAC would not begin technical discussions of the product until the license was obtained, and ISTRAC nullified the contract due to the delay.  -- Beachcraft, also not a respondent to AmCham's survey, has reported through other sources that the delivery date clause has made it impossible for them to bid successfully (Ref B).  4. (SBU) Other companies have reported clauses that put the legal responsibility for obtaining all applicable export licenses on the exporter and seem to absolve the Indian buyer from legal or financial obligations of not obtaining the license.  -- Sun Microsystems noted a clause in a contract with ISRO which states:  \"Procedures as required by Law of the Country of Export has been followed and necessary export license has been obtained wherever required as and when the Exporter indemnifies the consignee against any loss or expense he may incur due to any fault of the Exporter in the above matter.\" (Comment:  The Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR) recently faced legal action from the U.S. government for buying a product for which the exporter, Technology Option, did not obtain necessary export licenses (Ref C). This clause may be to protect ISRO from legal or financial liability should a similar problem arise in the future.  End Comment.)  -- Pratt & Whitney has also reported bid tender clauses specifying that export licenses by the bidder's country of origin are the bidder's responsibility, though the tenders acknowledge that Indian licenses are then the buyer's responsibility.  A Pratt & Whitney representative states that this requirement forces them to apply for licenses well in advance of potential bids.  Other Issues ------------  5. (SBU) Though Honeywell Defense has not had any specific problems with licensing deadlines, they report that they face tenders that require three phases be complete on submission: 1) Buy; 2) Buy and assemble; and 3) Build locally with technology transfer.  Because Honeywell is unable to obtain licenses to build locally until a formal contract is in place, they report that they lose business when faced with these tender requirements.  Comment -------  6. (SBU) India has made no international commitments on the openness of government contracts, and most of the examples given above are for contracts involving Indian public sector undertakings (PSU).  However, contractual requirements that penalize U.S. companies for adhering to export control regulations seem to run counter to the spirit of the HTCG and NSSP goals.  The insertion of these clauses may indicate the confusion that many Indian firms are experiencing in negotiating the complexity of U.S. export control requirements.  Greater outreach to Indian buyers might be an effective way to deal with some of the problems that U.S. exporters are experiencing. BLAKE " }

NEW DELHI 6924      B. NEW DELHI 5796  Classified By: Charge Robert O. Blake Jr, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: India remains upbeat on relations with Pakistan as the pair look toward Round Two of the Composite Dialogue (CD) beginning in late November and extending through early 2005, but is seeking to dampen expectations for breakthroughs on tough bilateral issues such as Kashmir.  The decline in terrorist infiltration over the last few months enabled PM Singh to announce a troop reduction in J&K on November 11, paving the way for his November 17-18 trip to the Valley.  There is curiosity about a possible Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, although the economic case is questionable.  There is also increasing speculation that the December 7-8 meeting to discuss the mechanics of a Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route will yield a deal both sides can live with.  However, senior GOI officials, led by Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, have cautioned about \"expecting miracles.\"  New Delhi will look for forward movement on the 70 plus outstanding CBMs it has proposed.  Earlier hopes for a formula to demilitarize the Siachen Glacier have subsided. Although GOI reacted mildly to President Musharraf's October 25 \"Iftar musings\" on the future of Kashmir, the Indian establishment will not entertain any substantial territorial changes in J&K.  End Summary.  Atmospherics Continue to Improve --------------------------------  2.  (C) Since the end of CD Round One in September, Indian public and private views on ties with Pakistan have continued on a positive trajectory.  Pakistan-bashing in the press is much reduced, and there is a widespread sense that incremental progress on some bilateral issues will be possible in the coming months.  Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies (IPCS) director Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Dipankar Banerjee called the dialogue \"sustainable at the national level, absent a crisis\" such as the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament.  Commodore Uday Bhaskar of the MOD-linked Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA) predicted that the upcoming series of talks (see expanded schedule para 18) would produce some results because many of the issues on the table are \"pragmatic, not political,\" and do not involve territory.  Trade, people-to-people exchanges, and law enforcement cooperation make \"win-win scenarios possible.\"  3.  (C) The most important improvements in the Indo-Pak relationship have been the decline in terrorist infiltration across the LOC and the ceasefire, which will complete its first anniversary on November 25.  Although most Indian commentators credit the LOC fence for this decline, South Block officials stress that the fencing would not have been possible without the ceasefire.  A senior security official recently told \"The Hindu\" that \"The evidence on the ground shows that Pakistan is cooperating.  Whether such cooperation is long-term or episodic remains to be seen.\"  Troop Reductions in J&K -----------------------  4.  (C) PM Manmohan Singh's November 11 announcement to redeploy an as-yet unspecified number of troops -- press speculation puts the number at some 10-15,000 -- from J&K or within the state has increased expectations that the GOI may have more in store on Kashmir than it has revealed to date. Kashmiri separatists from the moderate faction of the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) have welcomed the move, even signaling their willingness to meet with the PM during his November 17-18 visit to the state (as of November 16 no meeting has been confirmed, most likely for security reasons).  Couching the redeployment as a response to the decline in infiltration and the success of the LOC fence, GOI officials have also cited the onset of winter as an argument that now is the right time to get the dialogue process with the Hurriyat back on track.  This move also addresses one of the APHC's three pre-conditions for dialogue with the GOI (the other two being travel to Pakistan and a reduction in human rights abuses in the state).  Pushing The Pipeline --------------------  5.  (SBU) While some GOI officials have been making the case in the press that an Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is in both countries' national interests, the MEA continues to link the pipeline to freeing cross-border trade and/or facilitating transit trade from India to Afghanistan, Iran, and beyond. Lahore-born Indian Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar -- who served as India's Consul General in Karachi (1978-82) -- has been personally spearheading the project, aided by his former classmate and friend from Cambridge, Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri.  Aiyar recently got the nod from the MEA to hold talks with his GOP counterpart at the end of November, and he is planning to bring together industry professionals and bureaucrats from all three countries to a December 15-16 conference in New Delhi.  In the meantime, he has been reaching out to others in Delhi to try to increase the momentum for this mega-project.  6.  (C) General Banerjee singled out the gas pipeline as a key element in improving Indo-Pakistan relations, because of the magnitude and long-term nature of the endeavor.  The generally hawkish Director of the Observer Research Foundation's (ORF) Pakistan Centre, Sushant Sareen, claimed to Poloff that the political constraints on a gas pipeline through Pakistan no longer exist, and that it is now \"just a matter of economics.\"  The proposed pipeline would service no more than 10 percent of India's current energy needs.  A decade ago, when Pakistan opposed a pipeline proposal, it could have met as much as 60 percent of India's requirement -- which would have involved intolerable risks to India's energy independence.  Sareen listed two additional hurdles to the project getting off the ground: 1) shipped LNG benefits from the sunk costs of port facilities already built or being built over the as-yet unpaid costs of the pipeline; and 2) Iran and Pakistan will try to maintain high originating prices and transit fees, which could add to the high financial costs, thus forcing the project into unprofitability.  These industry concerns will have to be addressed if the project is to succeed.  Mission also has flagged possible ILSA concerns.  7.  (C) Sareen dismissed concerns about pipeline security, commenting that insurance, monitoring, redundancy, and gas reserves could easily ensure that any short-term disruption in supply through Pakistan would not interrupt India's energy picture.  ORF's Wilson John, a skeptic on rapprochement with Pakistan, told Poloff recently that if the pipeline is built, it would be \"as important as the Indus Waters Treaty, or more.\"  Pressure to Drop Trade Barriers -------------------------------  8.  (C) A growing number of India-Pakistan private sector conferences dot the calendar, highlighting the growing interest by industry in both countries in opening commercial links and demonstrating readiness to capitalize on potential lower trade barriers.  IDSA's Bhaskar predicted that the pipeline deal would likely lead to a large increase in other goods across the border in both directions, whether or not they are formally linked.  He held out hope that bilateral trade would be liberalized and normalized, and ticked off several sectors where he thought Pakistani firms could do well in the Indian market: cotton and textiles, buffalo meat (\"Pakistan has one of the most advanced animal husbandry industries in Asia\"), and selling excess electricity to the states of Punjab and Haryana.  Bus Service Looking More Certain --------------------------------  9.  (C) Progress may also be possible on the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service when the two sides meet on December 7-8 in New Delhi, according to a number of well-informed local Pakistan watchers.  Star TV Diplomatic Editor Jyoti Malhotra, who accompanied PM Singh to New York, recently told Poloff to expect movement on the bus service \"sooner rather than later....Manmohan wants it to happen.\" ORF's Sareen also thought that progress on the bus service was likely, especially because it would further fuel the \"people-to-people successes\" that have yielded political benefits to both Islamabad and New Delhi.  10.  (C) During a recent visit to New Delhi, UK High Commissioner in Islamabad Mark Lyall Grant told us that Islamabad has all but accepted the use of a \"special residency document\" that would be used in conjunction with a passport for travel across the LOC.  The document, but not the passport, would be stamped upon transit.  This construct is similar to several that have been favorably aired in the Indian press in recent weeks, which has raised expectations that a deal may ripen for the December 7-8 meeting on the bus service to be held in New Delhi.  Speculation Outrunning Reality on Territorial Issues --------------------------------------------- -------  11.  (C) Senior GOI officials have gone to some length to dampen expectations of a significant breakthrough on Kashmir during PM Singh's upcoming visit to the Valley and the CD Round Two.  Despite the positive atmospherics, in recent days Foreign Minister Natwar Singh has repeated the mantra that \"There will be no miracle, (but) we are trying our best\" in order to control the anticipation of swift and substantial progress on the Composite Dialogue's toughest issues.  The Indian establishment's position that any changes on Kashmir's status must be centered on formalizing the LOC as the border remains firm, as summed up by IPCS's PR Chari: \"Are the two leaderships preparing their people to accept the inevitability of the LOC being converted into an international border to resolve the Kashmir dispute?\"  Talk of independence, joint sovereignty or condominium, division among communal lines, or a role for the UN remain non-starters for New Delhi, as \"Hindustan Times\" Diplomatic Correspondent Saurabh Shukla (who often serves as an MEA mouthpiece) wrote on November 15.  Siachen Likely to Remain Frozen -------------------------------  12.  (C) Recent Indian press commentary suggests that an early deal to demilitarize the Siachen Glacier is less likely.  ORF's Sareen opined that progress would only be possible if, as the GOI has publicly insisted, the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) of the current deployment were demarcated in advance, suggesting that New Delhi was prepared to wait until Islamabad agrees to concessions on this issue.  Kashmir \"Food for Thought\" Viewed as Leftovers --------------------------------------------- -  13.  (C) Relatively few Indian analysts have publicly dismissed President Musharraf's October 25 \"Iftar musings\" on moving forward on Kashmir (Ref A), although private comments have been more skeptical.  Pakistani High Commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan recently reiterated to an audience at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University that Musharraf's goal was to \"generate discussion and explore possible options.\"  Home Minister Shivraj Patil left Musharraf a face-saving out, telling journalists that New Delhi would consider the idea as a proposal if Islamabad \"forwarded it to us formally.\"  PM Singh declined to speculate on how such a proposal would be received, referring to it as an \"off-the-cuff remark\" while maintaining that \"J&K is an integral part of India and not a matter for discussion with outside agencies.\"  14.  (SBU) In a November 16 report, well-connected \"Times of India\" Foreign Affairs correspondent Indrani Bagchi noted that if the substance of Musharraf's \"musings\" should arise in formal bilateral discussions, \"they will not fly.\"  Bagchi held that the MEA's \"remarkable quiet\" on the matter suggests that South Block is expecting Islamabad to float fresh positions on J&K soon.  15.  (SBU) Indian analysts have predictably praised Musharraf for backing off from Islamabad's perennial call for a plebiscite among Kashmiris to determine the fate of the region.  \"Hindu\" strategic commentator Siddharth Varadarajan used Musharraf's trial balloon to examine past and present territorial disputes (Andorra, Northern Ireland, the Aland Islands, South Tyrol, Gibraltar, the Basque region, New Caledonia, and the Sami region in Scandinavia), concluding that although \"none of these examples offers a complete set of principles for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, many individual elements are attractive.\"  Even as Kashmir specialist AG Noorani belittled this proposal, he strongly supported Musharraf's efforts to replace a plebiscite with new and creative proposals for resolving the Kashmir issue.  16.  (C) Describing Musharraf's trial balloon \"a mish-mash of the Kashmir Study Group, the JKLF's proposal, the Owen-Dixon plan, and a handful of other ideas all rolled together,\" Sareen reasoned that such a plan might be possible in a few decades, if both sides can get away from the old baggage, but not now.  He stressed that the GOI had not criticized the ideas publicly, to avoid putting Musharraf in an awkward position.  The real issue for India is cross-border terrorism, he stated.  The UK's Lyall Grant observed to us that from Islamabad's perspective, PM Singh had not dismissed the concept of making an adjusted LOC into a permanent border.  Lyall Grant also conveyed his impression that Singh \"wants to fix Indo-Pak relations,\" which will remain as a GOI policy priority.  17.  (SBU) Some New Delhi-based Pakistan watchers have been more hesitant to give Musharraf the benefit of the doubt. Institute for Conflict Management's anti-terrorist hawk Ajay Sahni brushed the proposal aside, calling it \"both arbitrary and nonsensical.\"  This degree of dismissal, however, appears to be the minority viewpoint at the moment.  The Schedule Keeps Filling Up -----------------------------  18.  (U) Official and unofficial Indo-Pakistan meetings through the end of the year, including Round Two of the Composite Dialogue (CD), are as follows:  November 23-24 (New Delhi): Pakistani PM Aziz to visit in his capacity as outgoing SAARC Chairman.  This will be the first meeting between the PMs of India and Pakistan since the 1999 Lahore Summit.  Aziz will also likely meet Kashmiri separatist leaders, President Kalam, and UPA President Sonia Gandhi.  November 29-30 (New Delhi): Meetings between narcotics control authorities (CD).  Late November (dates and venue TBD): Petroleum ministers to discuss Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.  December 2-3 (Islamabad): Meeting between railways authorities on the Munnabao-Khokhrapar rail link (CD).  December 3-4 (New Delhi): Meeting between the Indian Coast Guard and the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency.  Agenda includes discussing an MOU for establishing a communications link (CD).  December 5-11: (Patiala, India): Indo-Pakistan Punjab Games.  December 7-8 (New Delhi): Discussion of \"all issues\" relating to beginning a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, including presumably what documentation will be required for Kashmiris crossing the LOC (Ref B)(CD).  December 9-10 (New Delhi): Meeting of the Committee of Experts regarding trade issues (CD).  December 14-15 (Karachi): Joint survey of the boundary pillars in the horizontal section of the Sir Creek area (CD).  December 14-15 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on nuclear confidence-building measures, including discussion on a draft agreement for prior notification of missile tests (CD).  December 15-16 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on conventional CBMs (CD).  December 15-16 (New Delhi): Conference on \"Iranian Gas Export to Pakistan and India,\" to include officials from the petroleum ministries of all three countries.  January 9-11 (Dhaka): SAARC Summit.  Proposed but not scheduled: Convening a Joint Working Group to combat music and video piracy.  Comment -------  19.  (C) The upbeat mood in India is based on continuing low infiltration levels, increased people-to-people exchanges, good atmospherics at recent high-level meetings, and restrained Pakistani public statements.  From the New Delhi perspective, ties with Islamabad are beginning to acquire the semblance of normality, with sparring at a minimum. Productive engagement appears to be possible in a number of areas, although difficult decisions remain.  Both New Delhi and Islamabad need to continue to work for incremental progress and increased mutual trust, while managing expectations to prevent a blowout if the sides do not achieve as much as the optimists seek.  We have seen nothing to suggest that any element of the Indian establishment is prepared to consider the sort of territorial compromise -- or dual control -- that is suggested in President Musharraf's recent remarks.

(U) India's Cabinet on November 11 gave its approval to establish a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the last formal hurdle for setting up this long-delayed office. Several years have elapsed as the GOI sorted out the intramural wrangling over the unit's composition and responsibilities.  Last May's national election, which brought the Congress Party into power, was the most recent delay as the new Cabinet has spent its first six months in office contending with a host of pressing issues.  2. (U) The FIU will be organized as an independent body within the Finance Ministry's Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), located in New Delhi.  The press reports that the FIU will have an intelligence and an investigative wing.  3.  (SBU) Sharmila Chavaly, our Finance Ministry contact for anti-terrorist financing, told us today that the next step \"is to identify the people,\" who will serve in the FIU, and hoped that the new director would be named \"in the next week or so.\"  Chavaly looked forward to pinning down a convenient date for a visit to New Delhi by representatives of the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Comment -------  4.  (SBU) India has long signaled its desire to boost bilateral cooperation with the US on anti-terrorist financing as well as in multi-lateral forums.  However, its membership in the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force has been pending, with the lack of an FIU as one of several hurdles that need to cleared (reftel).  Even though the FIU is not yet up and running, the Embassy will move forward with plans for an exchange visit with FinCEN.  Blake " }

(SBU) Summary:  A visit to India's premier atomic energy establishments by Alain Bugat, Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission, suggests that France is willing to engage in discussions with India on nuclear matters to a degree that is inconceivable within the current NSSP framework. The visa denial of Baldev Raj ironically made it possible for Raj to host Bugat at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) in a very high profile visit.  The three to four week delay required by the Mantis Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) process, together with an apparent increase in technology transfer related visa denials, gives heart to critics in India's scientific establishment who claim the NSSP is void of content.  Mission recommends Washington establish a process that allows all stakeholders to review recommended Mantis SAO denials.  End summary.  Director IGCAR Deemed \"Inadmissible\" to Travel to the US --------------------------------------------- -----------  2.  (SBU) On November 5, 2004 Dr. Baldev Raj (DOB 09 April 1947), distinguished Scientist and Director of IGCAR, which PM Singh has just visited in conjunction with the inauguration of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (Ref.), was categorized through the SAO Mantis process as \"inadmissible\" under Section 212a3A(i)(II).  3.  (SBU) Dr. Raj was to represent IGCAR at the Eighth Information Exchange Meeting on Actinide and Fission Product Partitioning and Transmutations that took place in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 9 to 11, 2004.  This information exchange meeting was the eighth in a series that began in 1990.  According to the organizers, the meeting was an open scientific meeting and not subject to any CFR810 controls for export of information.  4.  (SBU) Dr. Raj had been quite insistent about obtaining information on the status of his visa.  Requests, however, ceased about two weeks prior to Raj's proposed travel.  On November 5, Dr. Raj's office told SciCouns that Dr. Raj was traveling and would not be back in the office until November 8.  Chairman Atomic Energy Commission France Visits IGCAR --------------------------------------------- --------  5.  (SBU) Dr. Raj's silence did not last long.  Mission found out that Alain Bugat, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of France, had visited the Atomic Energy Commission's Kalpakkam site, 60 kilometers from Chennai, on November 9.   Kalpakkam hosts the IGCAR, which is the headquarters for the Indian Fast Breeder Reactor program, the Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) and the Nuclear De- salination Demonstration Plant.  At Kalpakkam, in addition to discussions with Raj, Bugat met T.S. Rajendran, Director of MAPS and Prabhat Kumar, the Director of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR).  Renewal of Indo-French Nuclear Links ------------------------------------  6.  (SBU) In an interview with T.S. Subramanayan, a reliable reporter for \"The Hindu,\" Chairman Bugat said that one of the purposes of this visit to India \"is to renew our links for cooperation in the field of fast nuclear reactors\" and to forge cooperation at the R&D level in scientific topics, such as fundamental physics, live sciences, reactor safety in thermal reactors and fast breeder reactors.  Bugat ducked the question on whether France was prepared to sell India Pressurized Light Water Reactors (PLWRs) without insisting that India sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or implement full scope safeguards as demanded by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  Bugat's response was that this was the topic on which he could not speak, as \"we are not diplomats.  We're technicians, physicists and managers. So what I want to say is that cooperation between India and France is perfectly respectful of all international agreements that India and France have signed.\"  Are India and France Ready to Hop Into The Sack? --------------------------------------------- ---  7.  (SBU) During his visit, Bugat was reminded that Betram Goldschmidt, the late pioneer of the French nuclear program, had remarked in 1992 at Kovalan, near Chennai, that \"France and India were prepared to flirt with each other but not really go to bed\" in nuclear matters.  Bugat was asked whether the time was now ripe for the two countries to \"go to bed\" in nuclear matters, especially light water reactors. The Hindu quotes Bugat as saying, \"I cannot say.  We can go to bed if diplomats and politicians come to a new round of agreements.  There are certain ways in which nuclear science R&D is closer to political affairs than industrial affairs but we will not decide in the place of politicians.\"  Bugat concluded by saying that France appreciates the fact that India's nuclear energy program is \"comprehensive and coherent\" as it includes nuclear power reactors, research reactors and nuclear applications in other fields.  Bugat also said he appreciates that India has not been involved in any nuclear controversies concluding that, in his assessment, only India, France and Japan have comprehensive nuclear programs (to include breeding, reprocessing and a closed nuclear fuel cycle).  Bugat Visits the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) --------------------------------------------- --------  8.  (SBU) During his trip, on November 10, Chairman Bugat visited BARC at Trombay holding discussions with Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. S. Banerjee, Director of BARC, and Dr. R. B. Grover, the Director of Strategic Planning for the Department of Atomic Energy.  The Visa Mantis SAO Program ---------------------------  9.  (SBU) The three to four week wait required to obtain Mantis SAO response for executives in Indian nuclear and space organizations together with the fact that approvals often come at the last minute or too late for Indian travelers to accomplish their missions in the United States is having an adverse impact on our relations with the Indian scientific community.  Specific examples are the visas for Kasturirangan KRISHNASWAMY (DOB 24 October 1940) and for Prem Shanker GOEL (DOB 20 April 1947) who were granted approval to travel to the U.S. on the very same day they planned to hold a meeting at Boeing Satellite System Divisions, and the visa for Sridhara Murthi Kuppam RAMAIYER (DOB 7 September 1950) which was approved on the day when traveler was already supposed to be in the United States.  10. (SBU) There have been cases when travelers proposing to attend open meetings in the U.S. related to nuclear power were found \"inadmissible.\"  In particular, Atal Kumar GUPTA (DOB 27 AUG 1953), the Technical Service Superintendent in charge of Engineering Support at the Kakrapar Atomic Power Station and Pramod Kumar SHARDA (DOB 7 JAN 1951), the Chief Superintendent at the Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant were supposed to attend peer review training at the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) in Atlanta in preparation for an annual WANO experts visit to nuclear power stations in India.  The goal of such visits is to promote nuclear power station operational safety.  Gupta and Sharda were categorized as \"inadmissible\" under Section 212a3A(i)(II) on 8 October 2004.  11. (SBU) As WANO training in nuclear safety is not subject to CFR810 controls for export of information, and relates to a USG policy objective to promote bi-lateral cooperation in safe operation of nuclear power plants, prima facie it would appear that this denial runs counter to USG policy objectives.  The Cupboard is Not Entirely Bare --------------------------------- 12.  (SBU) Mission acknowledges and appreciates the Department's support in expediting some Mantis SAO processing.  We also understand that in some cases the problem of delays is due to late applications by Indian scientists, a problem we are seeking to address with the GOI.  The fast approval for Dr. Prem Shanker GOEL (DOB 20 April 1947) and Janardhana EDDYA (DOB 1 November 1945) to attend a NASA workshop on \"Creating New and Sustainable Space Exploration\" is one example.  Another is the approval for Nuclear Power Corporation of India Chairman Shreyans Kumar JAIN (DOB 8 May 1948) to attend a WANO conference in Atlanta on November 2 and 3, 2004.  In Mission's view, the rapid processing of this Mantis SAO is a solid demonstration of USG good will in light of the recent determination of Section 212a3A(i)(II) inadmissibility for Gupta and Sharda above.  Comment:  Giving Ammunition to NSSP Doubters --------------------------------------------  13.  (SBU) It is ironic that Raj held such discussions with the Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission, at the time he was denied access to the United States to participate in an open conference which is not subject to export controls.  Such denials give ammunition to Indian nuclear and space scientists who firmly believe that the NSSP is nothing but a sham, and therefore oppose efforts by political players like NSA Dixit to move ahead on our export control benchmarks and the NSSP process as a whole.  14.  (SBU) A high profile case of ineligibility such as the Raj case points to the need for an inter-agency process that allows the SA bureau and other stakeholders to participate in the Mantis SAO process and review any recommended Mantis SAO denials before the decision is communicated to post.  It is also important that the Embassy fully understand the reasons for any denials and has a mechanism to provide additional input if a decision appears to impact other established policy objectives, such as the NSSP process or nuclear safety cooperation.  15.  (SBU) We recognize that it will be necessary to deny visits, even for high-profile applicants, when serious technology transfer concerns exist.  When this happens, we need to be in a position to fully understand the reasons for the decision and to be able to put it in context for our Indian interlocutors.  Mission appreciates Washington consideration of this issue.  BLAKE " }

(U) Summary:  The GOI used a recent visit by IAEA Director General Dr. Mohammed El Baradei to press its case for reform of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) requirements to facilitate India's cooperation with others in the international community in using nuclear power to fill the country's growing energy needs.  In Delhi, El Baradei met with NSA Dixit, FS Saran and other MEA officials with whom he also discussed Iran, and proliferation.  In Mumbai, he met with India's civilian nuclear establishment.  According to our MEA contacts, the IAEA DG indicated that India's engagement with the US is crucial to its hopes for enhanced international nuclear cooperation, and in this context welcomed recent progress on the NSSP.  End Summary.  Full-Scope Safeguards: US in the Driver's Seat --------------------------------------------- -  2.  (C) In a November 18 meeting with PolCouns and PolOff, MEA Deputy Secretary (Disarmament and International Security) Naveen Srivastava reported that in both his keynote speech to Indian scientists and in meetings with GOI officials, El Baradei stressed the role of the IAEA in promoting access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, an objective that is especially critical for rapidly expanding economies such as India and China.  In meetings with the IAEA DG, GOI officials pressed for \"positive discrimination\" to enable India to safely develop its nuclear power program in order to meet its energy requirements while addressing global concern about greenhouse gases.  El Baradei agreed that nuclear power should be a larger percentage of India's energy mix, i.e., increasing from 3.4% to 25% of India's energy sources. PolCouns queried whether GOI officials asked El Baradei about options for reconciling this goal with the NSG's full-scope safeguards requirement.  Srivastava confirmed that they had, but El Baradei referred them back to the USG.  The Indian media note on the visit said the GOI \"emphasized that while there is a need to address the emerging concerns about proliferation...this should not impede the fullest use of nuclear energy by states with a proven record of safety and responsibility, such as India whose record in this regard was second to none.\"  El Baradei Believes Security Drives the Iran Program --------------------------------------------- -------  3.  (C) On Iran, El Baradei told GOI officials that he believes security is best addressed \"by partnerships (between countries), not dominance.\"  He prefers to continue to engage Iran rather than refer the matter to the UN Security Council.  Because Iran is surrounded by hostile neighbors, the IAEA chief said that he believes Iran's nuclear objectives are based primarily on its security concerns and that its energy requirements are secondary.  The Indians reaffirmed their view that Iran should comply with its NPT obligations, adding that Iranian nuclear weaponization would be a threat to the region.  State Support for Proliferators -------------------------------  4.  (C) Regarding proliferation, GOI officials raised their concern about \"the receiving side, not the supply side\" of the AQ Khan network.  El Baradei outlined a network reaching more than 20 states, including some Western countries. According to Srivastava, the IAEA chief said he believed that Libya's involvement in the network may have been limited to one person, but contacts with the DPRK and Iran were more extensive than that and would have required state support. Adding his own comment, Srivastava stated that although El Baradei was careful not to say that Pakistani, DPRK or Iranian state structures were involved, \"that is clearly what he implied.\"  US Engagement Crucial to India's Civilian Nuclear Goals --------------------------------------------- ----------  5.  (C) El Baradei also told GOI officials that India's engagement with the US was crucial to its hopes for enhanced international nuclear cooperation.  In this context, he was pleased with the progress on the NSSP, according to Srivastava.  The Indians used the occasion to reaffirm their strong commitment to maintaining \"a pristine onward proliferation record.\"  In follow-up with PolCouns, MEA Director (Disarmament and International Security) Venu Rajamony confirmed New Delhi's recognition that Indo-US cooperation on the reactor island would not be possible as part of the first three phases of the NSSP, but would be a GOI priority for later phases.  PolCouns remarked that the NSSP is moving rapidly, noting that Indian Ambassador Sen optimistically hopes to conclude Phase Two by the end of the year (reftel).  PolCouns reiterated Washington's suggestion that India look to Israel as an example of a country that has benefited from stricter export controls because greater trust in their business environment has resulted in more high-tech trade.  \"But you haven't sanctioned them,\" Rajamony countered, adding that the NSSP will help to build an atmosphere of mutual trust between the US and India.  He remarked that NSSP issues will likely be addressed in the upcoming India-Israel non-proliferation dialogue. BLAKE " }

(C) Summary:  Former DPM LK Advani has failed to quell the powerful centrifugal forces that threaten to tear apart the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the party is continuing a downward spiral that threatens to doom its immediate electoral chances.  The Sangh Parivar (family of Hindu organizations) insists that the BJP return to Hindutva, while party pragmatists argue for a development-oriented election strategy.  The BJP's secular NDA allies, who want no part of Hindutva, are increasingly disaffected, contributing to growing rumors of future defections to the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA). Former PM Vajpayee is in poor health and has faded from active politics, and the aging Advani is no longer the \"iron man.\"  The lack of a clear successor to these two BJP standard-bearers has set off growing battles between the party's second tier leadership, personified by the flamboyant and erratic behavior of the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh (MP) Uma Bharti.  The BJP needs electoral success to revive, but the prospects are not good.  Continued defeats will tempt the party to increasingly resort to a hard line and irresponsible rhetoric, including on issues of US/India relations.  End Summary.  Back to the Future ------------------  2.  (C) The past six months have seen the unremitting decline of the BJP.  Prior to the May parliamentary contest, Party standard-bearer and then Deputy PM LK Advani staked his reputation on a nationwide tour aimed at invigorating grass-roots support.  Not only did it fail to inspire, but the BJP lost power, falling to only 10 Lok Sabha seats from its previous 32 in the key Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh (UP).  Party morale plummeted and BJP front organizations, such as the Youth Wing became moribund.  When the party failed to knock the Congress/Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) combine from power in the Maharashtra state election in early October, it replaced Party President Venkaiah Naidu with Advani, in hopes that he would reverse the trend.  3.  (C) Advani assumed the leadership of a deeply divided party.  Factionalism became rampant after the electoral defeats.  Advani has waited six years to become PM, but with his party in the political wilderness, there is little prospect for a quick return to power.  This has invigorated the party's second tier leadership, who began to openly fight over the top spots.  Tasked with ending the squabbling, restoring party discipline, and working with the secular parties in the NDA to win upcoming state elections in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Haryana, Advani has made little progress, despite his best efforts.  Uma as Figurehead -----------------  4.  (C) The BJP's problems are personified in the behavior and fortunes of Uma Bharti, the former Chief Minister of MP. Bharti, an OBC (other backward caste), is renowned for her ability to rouse the masses.  In a party dominated by upper castes, she is largely distrusted by the leadership, both for her low caste background and erratic personality.  Advani has long patronized Bharti in the hope that she could increase popular support and broaden the BJP's narrow caste base, but she remains notoriously unstable and unpredictable.  5.  (C) Bharti resigned as MP Chief Minister following her indictment in an old public order case in October.  Although the BJP rallied around her and openly supported her subsequent \"flag march\" around India, press reports and BJP contacts confirm that she had made a mess of the state administration and the party was happy to see her depart. Upon taking over the party presidency, Advani continued to patronize Bharti, making her one of the six BJP general secretaries.  On November 10, the newly-selected BJP  SIPDIS leadership met for the first time in front of television cameras.  Advani began to complain of \"indiscipline\" in the party ranks, chiding Bharti for her public criticism of senior leader Pramod Mahajan, and other BJP leaders.  6.  (U) In one of India's more sensational \"tabloid TV style\" rows, Bharti then told Advani that she was the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by unnamed BJP leaders in the Rajya Sabha, who \"did not have to face the voters,\" and that she was forced to \"defend my reputation.\"  When Advani said the matter was \"closed,\" Bharti refused to yield the floor and marched out, daring Advani to discipline her.  The publicly humiliated BJP triumvirate of Advani, Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh then dropped Bharti from the leadership and suspended her party membership.  Hindutva Losing its Luster --------------------------  7.  (C) Since the BJP/NDA has been out of power, the hard-line wing of the Sangh Parivar has been reasserting itself, making repeated calls for a return to Hindutva. Advani, who is well-aware that the RSS supplies the disciplined base for what is an increasingly undisciplined party, has attempted to mollify the hard-liners.  Upon being named to the presidency, Advani assured party workers that a Ram temple would be built in Ayodhya, and attended the hard-line RSS leadership meeting in Hardwar on November 6. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togodia told the press that he was not happy with Advani's actions and that the party must return to Hindutva not in \"months, but days.\" Togodia, other VHP leaders, and RSS leader KS Sudarshan showed their displeasure with Advani by staying away from the Hardwar meeting.  8.  (C) Advani has not only failed to reassure the Sangh Parivar, but has alienated the BJP's secular NDA allies, who are increasingly alarmed at a possible Hindutva revival. Sections of the Bihar-based Janata Dal United (JD-U), headed by George Fernandes, are calling for it to leave the NDA and join the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) before the February 2005 elections.  Such a move could set off an exodus from the NDA, as other secular partners decide to switch sides.  On November 8, the JD-U passed a resolution reminding the BJP that it had joined the NDA only after its Hindutva planks were removed from the alliance platform.  Saying that it would \"never compromise with religious bigotry,\" the JD-U said it was fully prepared to \"take another road\" if the BJP rekindled Hindutva.  Advani met with the NDA leadership on November 15 and, in what most analysts saw as a BJP retreat from Hindutva, issued a joint statement that there should be a \"negotiated settlement\" of the Ayodhya dispute.  9.  (SBU) In another indicator of the ongoing decline of Hindutva, on November 12, the Tamil Nadu state government indicted Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, a powerful Hindu religious leader, on murder charges (Reftel D).  Although the governing party in Tamil Nadu, the AIDMK, is part of the NDA, Chief Minister Jayalalitha told reporters on November 17 that \"all are equal before the law,\" and assured them she would proceed with the case.  Although the Sangh Parivar decried the arrest as an \"assault against Hinduism,\" its efforts to organize public protests have largely been ignored and public reaction muted.  A Potential Split -----------------  10.  (C) The Sangh Parivar has long threatened to leave the BJP and create a Bharatiya Hindutva Party (BHP).  Hard-liners within the Sangh Parivar are the principal proponents of such a split, arguing that a secularized BJP could then pursue a pragmatic development-oriented agenda based on the \"water, roads, power\" slogan, leaving the BHP with the Hindutva agenda.  The BHP would then join the NDA and work out seat adjustments and cooperative arrangements with the BJP.  These theorists contend that when the two vastly disparate ideologies are freed of the constant tension of belonging to the same party, they will be able to work together in harmony and create a broad-based coalition to bring the NDA back to power in New Delhi.  The Sangh Parivar has repeatedly paraded the BHP idea whenever it does not get its way on BJP decisions, and few take the idea seriously.  Should the BJP's electoral fortunes continue to decline, however, prospects of a schism will increase.  Views of a BJP Insider ----------------------  11.  (C) On November 17, BJP National Executive Member and RSS leader Seshadri Chari told Poloff that he was not worried about these seemingly ominous developments.  Chari claimed that the NDA was far more united and effective than the UPA, pointing out that the Left/Communists claim to support the UPA but act more like an opposition.  He observed that Congress and the BJP essentially agree on economic liberalization and most foreign policy issues, including the need for closer ties with the US, while the Left opposes practically everything the UPA stands for.  Chari argued that this arrangement is inherently unstable, could come apart at any time, and that Congress should be worried about the UPA's survival.  According to Chari, these problems are far more serious than those plaguing the BJP/NDA.  12.  (C) Chari confided that the RSS wanted Naidu to remain as BJP President and was opposed to Advani's accession.  He contended that Advani, along with Vajpayee, is the most prestigious and powerful BJP leader and the party's \"trump card.\"  The RSS argued that pushing him into the top slot was premature and unwarranted, as it makes the party's problems seem more severe than they actually are.  In Chari's view, Advani has restored discipline, and convinced the BJP's second tier leaders that he is \"the first among equals.\"  He dismissed press reporting about Bharti, saying that the party never issued a formal suspension order, she had sent a letter of apology to Advani, and that she would be quietly reintegrated into the hierarchy.  Chari also denied that Hindutva was an issue, claiming that Indian nationalism and Hindutva are one and the same, and that the \"time for Ram temple politics has passed.\"  He predicted that with these problems resolved, the BJP would assume the role of an active and vigorous opposition party.  13.  (C) Chari was less sanguine about BJP electoral prospects, admitting that it would be \"difficult\" for the party to do well in the upcoming state elections in Haryana, Bihar, and Jharkhand.  Admitting that UPA ally Laloo Prasad Yadav was well-entrenched in his state, Chari noted that the \"anti-incumbency factor\" could hand Bihar to the BJP and its JD-U allies.  In Jharkhand, the BJP is the incumbent and fighting alone against a powerful combination of Congress and the tribal-based JMM party.  In Haryana, Chari hoped that the BJP could entice the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) back into the NDA to recapture the state.  He conceded that should the BJP lose Jharkhand and fail to recapture the other two states, it would be a clean sweep for the Congress/UPA, and a crushing blow to the BJP, with long-term political implications.  Chari's hopes for a revived BJP/INLD alliance seem to have come to naught, as the BJP announced on November 17 that it would contest the Haryana elections alone.  Comment -------  14.  (C) The BJP is in trouble.  The party's principal figurehead, former PM Vajpayee, is rapidly aging and will soon leave active politics.  Advani has long waited for his chance to become PM, but his age is also catching up with him.  The Party has not groomed a successor to these two stalwarts, and it is not clear that any BJP second tier leader has the gravitas and popular appeal of Vajpayee and Advani, and can supply the necessary counterweight to the growing popularity of Sonia Gandhi and her children. Personality clashes between ambitious second tier aspirants have only been contained for the time being, and the Sangh Parivar's determination to pursue Hindutva is contributing to growing disaffection among the NDA allies.  Advani, once the \"iron man\" of Indian politics, might earlier have resolved these problems.  Now, however he has only papered over the centrifugal forces that threaten to break apart the BJP and the NDA.  If the BJP/NDA does badly in upcoming elections, all bets are off, and the chances will grow that the BJP will stake out an increasingly hard line and irresponsible positions on issues of importance to the US, like economic reform, Indo-Pak relations, and the US-India partnership.

CALCUTTA 449       B. NEW DELHI 6983      C. DHAKA 1697  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh Foreign Minister Morshed Khan's November 1 stop in New Delhi was officially scheduled to deliver India's invitation to January's SAARC Summit in Dhaka, but also provided an opportunity for bilateral discussions on festering cross-border issues.  The GOI resisted the temptation to use the visit to beat up on Khan, and this latest round did not yield any breakthroughs, but with a PM level meeting coming during the January SAARC Summit in Dhaka, it may have paved the way for a lowering of tensions then.  New Delhi has shown an increased willingness to share information with us about developments in Bangladesh, but like us is struggling to find a recipe for reversing the crisis of governance there.  End Summary.  Only the Messenger ------------------  2. (C) Morshed Khan came to New Delhi as the special envoy of PM Khaleda Zia to deliver India's January SAARC Summit invitation, and although the visit included the full complement of bilateral interactions, the GOI did not take him to task over allegations that Bangladesh is becoming a safehaven to Indian separatists and Islamic terrorists. Rather, according to MEA Director (Bangladesh) TS Sandhu, the GOI \"kept it positive.\"  Sandhu cautioned that Khan's forthcoming attitude would still have to be \"matched on the ground.\"  Border issues, including resolution of the undemarcated portions and coordinated patrols, figured in the discussions, but without resolution.  In India, Khan also met with leaders of the Left parties, whose main power base is West Bengal, bordering Bangladesh.  Sandhu thought this was an important exchange because that state's connection with Bangladesh could act as a buffer in the Delhi-Dhaka relationship.  \"Growing Intolerance\" ---------------------  3. (C) Although he claimed to agree with PolCouns' assertion of the US point of view that the overriding issue in Bangladesh is one of governance, Sandhu focused on \"growing intolerance\" as the most important concern.  He added that Dhaka is creating a \"breeding ground\" for forces inimical to the BDG and potentially India and the US.  Sandhu noted that the GOI would like to see the BDG at a minimum apply \"positive pressure\" against these groups and thought the US could be effective in helping Bangladesh \"see reality and not become boxed-in.\"  Like others in the GOI he was seized with the presence in Dhaka of ULFA leader Paresh Barua who he suggested had escaped from prison in Bangladesh by exploiting local political connections.  GOI and UK Share Their Assessments ----------------------------------  4. (S/NF) Indian intelligence officials recently provided DIA a classified briefing on \"Terrorism in Bangladesh\" which offered some insights into Indian allegations.  The report indicated that the number of Jamaat Islami (JI) affiliated madrassas in Bangladesh has grown to 6,024 and reiterated a point the GOI had made to PDAS Don Camp in June that the jetty used in April's Chittagong arms haul was under the control of JI Amir Matiur Rahman Nizami.  The Indians also noted that Dhaka has called for the arrest of Bangla Bhai, the Islamist vigilante leader of the anti-BDG Jagrata Muslim Janat Bangladesh (JMJB) (ref C), but he remains at large with the aid of leaders of the governing Four Party Alliance. Intelligence officials cited a Saudi-based NGO, Al Harmain Islamic Foundation and Studies Institute, with offices in Dhaka operating in the capital and Cox's Bazaar.  The report concluded that democracy in Bangladesh has been \"jeopardized by fundamentalist elements\" and because of the JI's role in the governing coalition, the BDG cannot eradicate the extremists.  5. (S) A report passed to us by the UK High Commission (strictly protect) corroborated concerns about the Cox's Bazaar region and foreign funding.  The GOI also asserted that the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) area is a base for Islamic extremist groups, including Al Qaeda, whereas the UK paper highlighted the CHT for not being home to such groups, although Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar are.  Rather than JI madrassas in these areas, the UK report continued, it is those linked to the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ, also part of the governing coalition) in which the problem is most acute.  The British report also noted the presence of Southeast Asian students in these areas.  Comment -------  6. (C) It will be interesting to watch how, if at all, the BDG response to Indian allegations of harboring militants changes in light of Burma's commitment to quashing cross-border insurgent activity during Than Shwe's New Delhi visit (ref B) and the seemingly connected crackdown in Manipur during the last few weeks (ref A).  The GOI's willingness to combine their allegations with specific information shared with us is an important move towards greater India-US CT cooperation in this area.  The inconsistencies with the British report, however, highlight the need for more ongoing dialogue with our various Indian interlocutors.  7. (C) Khan's visit was his second to New Delhi since the UPA came to power in May, and in early January, Manmohan will meet PM Zia for the second time at the SAARC Summit.  If the PM continues his record of making last minute policy moves, as he did with the troop drawdown in Kashmir before his visit there, and the preferential trade agreement with Thailand when he reached Bangkok in July, continues, there is a possibility of a step forward in India-Bangladesh relations when the PMs sit down in Dhaka.  But for now, we have yet to see evidence that India and Bangladesh have found a recipe for reversing the downturn in their bilateral relations. BLAKE " }

(C) Summary: As India and Pakistan mark the one year anniversary of their Line of Control (LOC) cease-fire in Kashmir, more Indian troop redeployments and other Indo-Pak progress are \"only natural\" if cross-border terrorism and infiltration by Pakistan remain low, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K. Singh told PolCouns and Poloff on November 19.  Singh remarked that the ongoing redeployment provided President Musharraf with a clear example of progress on Kashmir to cite to his domestic critics.  He insisted that PM Manmohan Singh's recent public statements precluding redrawing borders or religious partition defined the parameters for progress in Kashmir. Singh also indicated a more flexible position on an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline as part of a \"wide trade context\" for energy relations by declaring that Pakistani MFN status for India would be welcome but not mandatory. End Summary.  Kashmir -------  2.  (C) The PM's recent statements precluding redrawing Kashmir's borders or partitioning along religious lines authoritatively enunciated India's parameters for any future progress on Kashmir, according to Singh.  He characterized the recent troop redeployment as an example of progress on Kashmir that Musharraf can cite to domestic critics. Although the recent troop redeployment announced prior to the PM's visit to Kashmir was a one time plan, Singh said it was \"only natural\" to expect more such progress down the line. If infiltration remains low, he suggested, the logic of the PM's declaration suggests that India can withdraw more troops.  He said the onus was on Pakistan now to continue the process of ultimately ending infiltration, without which there would be \"no reason\" for troops to remain.  Singh agreed that the one-year anniversary of the LOC cease-fire was significant, commenting that the Composite Dialogue could continue \"indefinitely\" provided there is no increase in infiltration or major terrorist event.  3.  (C) Responding to our characterization of Pakistani Ambassador Aziz is an \"ally\" in the Indo-Pak process, Singh said he was not confident in Aziz or the GOP MFA generally, labeling it as \"more conservative\" than the army.  Regarding the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Singh said Pakistan \"overplayed its hand just like they did with the Taliban.\" The Joint Secretary remarked that the GOI had given the Hurriyat \"a long rope which has now reached the tension point\" and \"one more tug will break\" it.  4.  (C) Singh shared with PolCouns (septel) a list of 98 suggestions India put forward for Indo-Pak cooperation, which also indicates areas of Pakistani inaction or delay.  He stated that 13 CBMs were agreed, India has enacted 20 unilaterally, 20 are under discussion, and that Islamabad has not responded to the rest.  Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus -------------------------  5.  (C) Singh argued that the wrangling over permissible documents to enable travel across the LOC was a convenient excuse used by Pakistan to delay the opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route.  He cited various groups, including Kashmiri journalists, who already travel across the border with standard passports and visas to argue that nothing else was necessary.  He denied plans for any alternative document.  Pipeline --------  6.  (C) Singh indicated new flexibility in the GOI position on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, specifically stating that the GOI no longer will require that Islamabad grant New Delhi MFN status in exchange for a pipeline deal.  He reiterated India's requirements that the pipeline be part of a wider trade agreement, must be secure, and that Pakistan must give assurances of reliable gas supplies to India.  The GOI would welcome MFN status but would be satisfied if Pakistan makes adequate trade concessions elsewhere, such as additional products on the positive list for import from India.  Baglihar Dam ------------  7.  (C) Characterizing a \"Dawn\" article stating that India would complete the Baglihar Dam by April 2005 as \"hype\", Singh said he expected the dam to be completed no earlier than 2008.  In response to Pakistan's opposition of the project, Singh said the GOI had asked for \"substantive objections\" and had not received any response. BLAKE " }

Singh shared  SIPDIS with us four papers outlining progress in the Indo-Pak relationship since 2003, pending bilateral proposals, unilateral Indian actions, and areas where India perceives Pakistan to be dragging its feet.  In the following paper, the GOI highlights areas in which they are making overtures and believe the GOP is not responding.  These claims focus in particular on the GOI perception that Islamabad has put the brakes on people to people contacts.  2.  (SBU) Begin Text GOI paper:  Release of Indian civilian prisoners in Pak jails  1. India has granted consular access to 50 Pak prisoners in Indian custody and released 55 such prisoners in the period October 2003-0ctober 2004. The release of 16 more Pakistani civilian prisoners is being scheduled for November 9, 2004. In comparison, Pakistan has granted consular access to only 18 Indian civilian prisoners and has released 38 prisoners in the corresponding period. Consular access to a few more Pakistani prisoners (around 30) is being planned in November 2004.  Visits by Indian pilgrims to religious shrines in Pakistan  1.

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Summary: The GOI is heading into the January SAARC Summit in Dhaka upbeat about having maintained an ambitious SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area) negotiating schedule that aims to have a document ready for member ratification by mid 2005.  This optimism has prevailed despite apprehension in New Delhi over Bangladesh's SAARC chairmanship and modest expectations for immediate deliverables.  As a side effect of progress on SAFTA, New Delhi is taking a low key approach to the question of most-favored nation (MFN) status with Pakistan on the assumption that a SAARC-wide FTA will \"finesse\" the problem away.  In a November 22 meeting with PolCouns, the MEA welcomed the prospect of a USAID funded SAFTA technical assessment while emphasizing the need for outside parties to work directly with the SAARC Secretariat to avoid giving the impression of meddling.  End Summary.  Running With SAFTA ------------------  2. (C) In a November 22 meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, MEA Joint Secretary (SAARC) V. Ashok laid out the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) ambitious calendar for getting SAFTA up and running by January 2006. Pleased with the Association's \"untypical progress\" so far, Ashok outlined the timeframe for SAFTA noting that the sixth ministerial meeting will be held in New Delhi December 2-4 after which, with two more sessions in Kathmandu and Male, the members expect to have a document ready for the July ministers' meeting in Dhaka.  Ashok said this would leave six months for SAFTA's ratification and cabinet approval before the January 2006 target.  Compensation Only a Speed Bump ------------------------------  3. (C) While acknowledging that there are some conceptual problems associated with Dhaka's requirement that SAFTA provide compensation for revenue lost to LDCs due to freer trade, Ashok concluded that the GOI does not see this as a major \"stumbling block.\"  He noted that New Delhi came away from Bangladesh FM Morshed Khan's November 1 visit here with the impression that when Dhaka wants to move forward \"technicalities will be swept under the carpet.\"  MFN Through the Back Door -------------------------  4. (C) Ashok confirmed PolCouns' suggestion that the GOI appears to have become more flexible in its preference that MFN status with Pakistan be a part of any Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline deal (reftel).  He explained that the view in New Delhi is that if the members agree to SAFTA as it is on paper now, \"MFN will come automatically.\"  MFN has become symbolically significant in the Indo-Pak relationship, he suggested, while noting that during the course of SAFTA discussions, he has not heard any indication that Islamabad will try to withhold most favored nation status.  Negative List Won't Trip Up, Either -----------------------------------  5. (C) His optimism unflagging, Ashok was confident that the question of negative lists would also be successfully resolved.  He explained that SAARC members have divided into two groups, one of larger economies (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) for which the Negative List must be around 20 percent, and the second for which it can be slightly larger (in the 23-24%) in the final SAFTA framework.  In keeping with his upbeat theme, Ashok commented that the trend of regional integration was irreversible, and  noted wistfully that his position used to be considered a relaxing job.  Further to his point, the Joint Secretary added that his office will be moved out of its current crumbling annex location to the Ministry's main building, as indication of SAARC's upgraded status within the MEA bureaucracy. Deliverables in Dhaka ---------------------  6. (C) While Ashok did not expect any significant SAARC developments during the Dhaka Summit, he noted a number of pending agreements, one of which will likely be signed in January.  SAARC members have nearly completed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, Ashok said, but have had some difficulty reconciling the draft SAARC document with the more comprehensive model provided by the World Customs Organization, of which all are signatories.  Also in the works are SAARC Arbitration Rules, a Multilateral Double Taxation Treaty, and a Promotion and Protection of Investment Agreement.  Ashok expressed confidence that the BDG would be successful in the chairmanship, noting that during Khan's visit, he conveyed that Dhaka was eager to perform well as SAARC president. Room For One More? 7. (C) PolCouns noted the USG's discreet support for Afghanistan's inclusion in SAARC and asked if there had been any movement in that direction.  Ashok explained that the GOI would welcome the addition if Kabul applies for membership, and there is consensus in favor of it.  He noted that Pakistan had adopted a similar position, and suggested this would be a fruitful area for further work by SAARC members.  SAFTA Support -------------  8. (C) PolCouns shared with the MEA USAID/Washington's Scope of Work on technical assistance for SAFTA implementation, noting that this project reflects broad US support for South Asian regional integration.  Ashok accepted the paper and noted, as he recently told a World Bank representative who visited him on the same subject, that the GOI \"would be delighted\" to have such support, but outside parties ought to work with the SAARC Secretariat to avoid giving the impression of \"dictating to\" the members.  He advised that it would be best for the USAID team to first approach the SAARC Secretariat to get ideas from them, thereby making it a SAARC  SIPDIS initiative.  In Tatas We Trust -----------------  9. (C) Pinning his bilateral hopes on the Tata Corporation's proposed USD 2 billion investment in Bangladesh, Ashok commented that it is a \"way to short-circuit governmental shortcomings\" in the India-Bangladesh relationship.  He noted that a company like Tata could be more effective there, as opposed to the \"bossy government of India,\" and predicted that SAFTA would compel the BDG to implement measures it has been unwilling to embrace bilaterally.

NEW DELHI 7395       B. NEW DELHI 7393  Classified By: Charge Robert O. Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: India received Shaukat Aziz warmly and at the highest levels, on the first visit of a Pakistani PM to New Delhi since 1991.  The GOI went out of its way to project a welcoming message, because of the importance it places on reconciliation with Islamabad and because it sees Aziz as the kind of modernizing, pragmatic Pakistani politician India should bolster.  That the two sides were able to restore a positive atmosphere so soon after PM Manmohan Singh established clear GOI redlines on Kashmir on November 18 is important, and is viewed here as a Pakistani climbdown from the \"maximalist\" position that President Musharraf projected in his October 25 \"Iftar Musings\" proposal.  Speaking to the press after his lunch with the PM, Aziz declared that \"progress on other issues will be made in tandem with (Kashmir),\" implicitly validating the Indian claim that Islambad had put the brakes on people-to-people ties with a view to focusing attention on Kashmir.  The Pakistani PM spent more than five hours with four different Kashmiri separatist groups, separately, and did not succeed in unifying them, indicating that speculation about their impending reunification was premature.  Like Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, we expect no miracles from this visit, but it sets a positive stage for an intense three-week period of Indo-Pak engagement in December, Round Two of the Composite Dialogue (CD), culminating in an Indo-Pak meeting at the SAARC Summit in January.  End Summary.  Warm Welcome; Berlin Wall Theme -------------------------------  2.  (C) After Shaukat Aziz went to considerable lengths in recent days to downplay General Musharraf's criticism of the GOI redlines on Kashmir that PM Manmohan Singh set out in Srinagar on November 18 (Ref B), official New Delhi went out of its way to ensure that Aziz will have a good trip to India on this, the first visit of a Pakistani PM to New Delhi since Nawaz Sharif attended Rajiv Gandhi's funeral in 1991.  The PM telephoned Aziz upon his arrival at the New Delhi airport to welcome him, commenting \"who could say some 20 years ago that the Berlin Wall would be a thing of the past.\"  Singh added that he \"hoped and prayed that we can set in motion a similar process in this subcontinent,\" and that he would \"sincerely work to that end.\"  Aziz reciprocated, offering special gifts to each of his senior hosts.  Most Except Sonia -----------------  3.  (C) The Pakistani PM met, or planned to meet, India's most important politicians and officials, with the exception of Sonia Gandhi, who became \"indisposed\" after initial indications that she would see him, according to a well-informed Indian journalist.  (Comment: Sonia has consistently declined to meet US and all other high-level foreign visitors to underline that PM Singh is in charge of the GOI.  End Comment)  He saw ex-PM Vajpayee, Leader of the Opposition LK Advani (who confirmed that he would visit Pakistan in January), Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to discuss the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, Commerce Minister Kamal Nath, and industrialists from FICCI and CII. The large size of the Pakistani delegation, which included six ministers representing many of the substantive areas of Indo-Pak discord, several Senators, and several top businessmen, attracted major media attention.  Natwar Singh ------------  4.  (C) The MEA spokesman characterized Aziz's November 23 45-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Natwar Singh as \"friendly, positive and forward looking,\" and indicated that the discussion centered around SAARC issues, inasmuch as the Pakistani PM was in Delhi in his capacity as outgoing SAARC Chairman, and the importance of showing results in Round Two of the CD process in December.  Aziz Strikes out with the Hurriyat ----------------------------------  5.  (C) As part of Islamabad's continuing efforts to reunite the warring APHC factions, the Pakistani PM devoted the entire evening of his first day in Delhi to the separatists, spending more than five hours with them.  Aziz first met with the moderate group, then JKLF leader Yasin Malik, then JKDFP leader Shabir Shah, and finally pro-Pakistan hardliner SAS Geelani.  A 30-45 minute dinner followed, at which the moderate, pro-Pakistan, and pro-independence factions met together for the first time in more than one year.  While privately annoyed at the meeting and the image of Pakistani meddling with \"India's Kashmiris,\" GOI officials maintained public silence on it.  6.  (C) APHC leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who had expressed optimism to D/Polcouns on November 22 about the prospects of reunification, expressed disappointment that Islamabad had acceded to Geelani's demand to remain above and separate from the rest, and laid the blame for a lack of unity on his doorstep.  The Mirwaiz complained that Aziz had also not assured them that the Kashmiris would have an immediate role in the Kashmir-related aspects of the Indo-Pak dialogue, saying that this would have to come at a later stage.  Aziz also reportedly told them that the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus would become a reality \"soon,\" that there would be three bus lines, two from the Valley and one from Jammu, and invited them to visit Pakistan.  None of our interlocutors believed another Hurriyat meeting with Aziz would take place during this visit, as some media had reported.  Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus -------------------------  7.  (C) Aziz arrived as the Indian media reported additional steps the GOI has taken recently to set the stage for an opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, should the two sides reach agreement on modalities at the political level and at technical level discussions on December 7-8 in New Delhi.  India has been resurfacing a 12 km stretch of road near the LOC which has not been used for several decades, according to the Indian Express.  The GOI has also identified LOC crossing posts.  While the status of a bridge over the Jhelum River remains unresolved, the GOI has made preparations to erect a temporary bridge and to remove mines from the area in the event an agreement is reached.  One newspaper report speculated that India may not insist on visas for Pakistani visitors, but this contradicts what we heard from MEA on November 19 (Ref A).  8.  (C) Speaking to the press after his lunch with the PM, Aziz declared that \"as regards to Jammu and Kashmir, we believe this is an issue and we all need to discuss and adddress (it).  Progress on other issues will be made in tandem with (Kashmir),\" implicitly validating the Indian claim that Islambad had put the brakes on people-to-people ties with a view to focusing attention on Kashmir.  Pipeline --------  9.  (C) Although our industry contacts remain skeptical about a Pakistan gas pipeline, Aziz' meeting with Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar sparked speculation about a breakthrough there.  Pakistani Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokar was forward leaning, declaring that \"we see the gas pipeline as a major CBM, not just for India and Pakistan, but for the whole region including Iran.\"  Aiyar, however, pressed for broader economic rapproachement.  Meeting with journalists over breakfast on November 24, Aziz insisted that granting MFN status to India was linked to the solution of the Kashmir issue.  MFN status would open up the Pakistan market for Indian exporters, and would not be considered in isolation, he stated. Pakistan Watchers -----------------  10.  (SBU) During a November 24 Charge-hosted lunch for visiting CODEL Bayh, the mood around Indo-Pak relations and the Aziz visit was generally upbeat, reflecting broader Delhi atmospherics.  However, this sense of cautious optimism was premised on the assumption that the Pakistani establishment had now abandoned the \"maximalist\" position reflected in Musharraf's October 25 \"Iftar musings.\"  Against this background, the Pakistan experts in attendance counseled against any talk of final solutions on Kashmir.  Under current circumstances, they argued, the two sides need to focus on \"process, not solutions.\"  Senator Bayh heard a general consensus that a final breakthrough on Indo-Pak relations will be possible only when a civilian government is installed in Islamabad, and on this basis advised a slow but steady approach.  Comment -------  11.  (C) Like Natwar Singh, we also expect no miracles from this visit.  That the two sides were able to restore a positive, purposeful atmosphere so soon after PM Manmohan Singh established clear GOI redlines on Kashmir on November 18 is important.  Significantly, Manmohan Singh's insistence that there can be no territorial changes on Kashmir was echoed in a November 24 op-ed piece by Prem Shankar Jha, one of India's most devoted advocates of Indo-Pak rapproachement.  As Jha argued, \"Islamabad's treatment of the LOC as Delhi's maximum position exemplifies everything that Delhi distrusts most about Pakistan's way of doing business.  The only way to bring lasting peace is to eschew final goals and concentrate on the process.\"  12.  (C) Aziz spent an unusual amount of time with the Hurriyat, but his attempts to unify them failed, indicating that speculation about impending reunification was premature, and that the divide between the various factions still runs deep.  We expect most observers to judge the Aziz visit a success, as it launches an intense three-week period of Indo-Pak engagement in December, Round Two of the Composite Dialogue (CD), followed by another Indo-Pak meeting at the January SAARC Summit.  Septel will report CODEL Bayh meetings wiht senior GOI officials. BLAKE " }

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Summary: Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga's November 3-7 New Delhi visit highlighted that Sri Lanka has become a model neighbor for India.  The President's stay included an address to a high-level conference during which she dismissed the notion that \"nothing was happening\" in her country's peace process.  The MEA announced the long-pending Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) was ready for signature, but did not indicate when that would be signed.  Officially, New Delhi has kept its hands off of GOSL-LTTE relations but the DCA will reverse that stance, Indian Tamils argue.  In attempting to restrict third party use of Sri Lanka's Palaly airfield that the GOI has agreed to refurbish, India is pursuing its objective of being the dominant South Asian power.  End Summary.  2. (SBU) Despite keeping her VIP audience waiting nearly 30 minutes, Kumaratunga's November 5 speech to the high-powered \"Hindustan Times\" leadership conference was well received by the Delhi elite.  Kumaratunga avoided any mention of the conflict in her own country, focusing instead on her vision for SAARC which she said could unify South Asia into an \"economic powerhouse.\"  Following the talk, the President dismissed the suggestion that \"nothing was happening\" in the peace process, and instead highlighted recent developments that gave her cause for optimism.  Model Relationship ------------------  3. (C) The MEA told us that \"nothing new\" came up during Kumaratunga's GOI discussions.  In a November 17 conversation with Poloff, Deputy Secretary (Sri Lanka) Anupam Rai called India-Sri Lanka \"one relationship in the neighborhood that is really moving,\" adding that \"politically, we are closer than ever.\"  Rai remarked that \"the Sri Lanka relationship could serve as a model for our other relationships in the neighborhood.\"  Emphasizing the contrast between Colombo and India's other neighbors, he noted that \"as opposed to building barriers, like Bangladesh and Pakistan, Sri Lankans are the only guys who are walking the talk of building strong ties.\"  In a statement after the Kumaratunga visit, the MEA also expressed pleasure at \"Sri Lanka's endorsement of India's candidature for permanent membership of the UNSC.\"  Defense Agreement -----------------  4. (C) Describing the long-awaited India-Sri Lanka Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) as an \"international safety net,\" Rai remarked simply that its purpose was to \"institutionalize defense cooperation.\"  Indo-Asian News Service News Editor (and Prabhakaran biographer) Narayan Swamy explained that the agreement provided the only surprise of Kumaratunga's visit, as she was expected to sign it while in New Delhi.  Swamy explained that the LTTE opposes such a formalization between India and Sri Lanka because it would \"redistribute the equilibrium between the Tigers and the GOSL.\"  Freelance commentator Maj. Gen. Ashok Mehta (Ret) agreed, noting that the LTTE have said such an agreement will go against the peace process.  He added that the DCA will be a \"deterrent\" to the LTTE from continuing to pursue a military course.  5. (C) As to the status of the DCA, Sri Lankan High Commission First Secretary Saj Mendis (protect) told Poloff that the documents are being prepared for signature.  General Mehta gave us a different view, observing that the agreement still had to be approved by the Indian cabinet, and predicting that the process may not go smoothly due to resistance from South Indian Tamil parties in the governing coalition.  Institute for Conflict Management (ICM) researcher Saji Cherian noted recently that the leader of the pro-LTTE MDMK party, Vaiko, had met with PM Manmohan Singh to \"express his disapproval.\"  Journalist Swamy asserted that the LTTE position would not dissuade the GOI from finalizing the process.  Hands Off, Eyes Open --------------------  6. (C) The GOI maintains that \"any request for Indian participation in the peace process would have to be considered carefully.\"  According to the MEA's Rai, Kumaratunga described the process as \"neither going forward, or backward.\"  The GOI has concluded that the President is \"serious\" about moving ahead, and that India is willing to finance rehabilitation projects in Sri Lanka, Rai added.  7. (C) Among India's development projects in Sri Lanka, Swamy listed the GOI offer to refurbish the Palaly airstrip (reftel), but noted that New Delhi has conditioned its offer by requiring that only India and Sri Lanka be allowed to use it.  Although the LTTE is concerned that the DCA will bring Colombo and New Delhi into a military relationship against them, Prabhakaran biographer Swamy insisted that the GOI would not contemplate a repeat of its 1987 military intervention in Sri Lanka.  In a November 23 essay, General Mehta came to the same conclusion, writing that \"India is still once bitten twice shy.\"  Nonetheless, the ICM's Cherian noted that since September both the head of India's Navy Admiral Arun Prakash, and the Chief of Army Staff N.C. Vij have traveled to Sri Lanka.  Comment -------  8. (C) Sri Lanka has become a \"feel good\" relationship for India and the gushing public embrace Delhi gave Kumaratunga stands out among visits from the other neighbors.  The DCA demonstrates that India is not entirely content to stand by quietly on GOSL-LTTE relations.  The Palaly airfield agreement is a GOI attempt to wield even greater influence in Colombo.  Undergirding this rapidly thickening security/political agenda is a thriving commercial relationship that both sides see as beneficial.  As much as anything, it is this mutually advantageous economic arrangement that distinguishes India's relationship with Sri Lanka from its other South Asian ties. BLAKE " }

Blake, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Summary:  In a series of senior level GOI meetings on November 23-24 during a private visit to India, Senator Evan Bayh (D-Indiana) heard a strong Indian commitment to move ahead with our bilateral partnership, coupled with concern about the potential disruptive effect of US F-16 sales to Pakistan.  Citing India's \"impeccable\" record of preventing onward proliferation, Foreign Secretary Saran advised that the US needs to bear in mind our shared interest in stopping the spread of WMD and to clarify whether India is part of the problem or the solution.  NSA Dixit made a similar point, urging America not to look at India as another Libya or Iraq, but as a democracy and responsible nuclear power.  Dixit characterized the \"theology\" of non-proliferation as the only difference between our two countries.  Echoing points made during his recent visit to Washington, Saran also flagged the Indian need to expand the use of clean nuclear energy, and sought flexibility on civilian nuclear supplies.  Senator Bayh praised the progress in Indo-U.S. relations on many fronts, but noted that U.S. intelligence experts would like to deepen operational cooperation.  The Senator also made a strong pitch for enhanced IPR protection.  End Summary.  F.M. NATWAR SINGH -----------------  2. (C) Indo-US Relations: After welcoming Senator Bayh, Foreign Minister Singh hailed the good momentum in Indo-Pak relations.  Infiltration rates from Pakistan have dropped, partly due to the winter weather and defensive steps taken by India, but also because the GOP has made \"some\" effort.  On Indo-U.S. relations Singh laughingly apologized to the Senator and said India was glad President Bush had won re-election.  He praised the President's vision for Indo-U.S. relations and said they have been moving forward since day one of the Bush presidency.  He recalled with satisfaction that the President had told the PM in September that India would be one of the first countries he visits if re-elected. The FM predicted Indo-U.S. relations will continue to improve.  But he told the Senator he wanted to flag one concern.  He predicted any sale of F-16s to Pakistan would be a \"fly in the ointment of Indo-U.S. relations\".  The key point for India is that F-16s can be fitted with nuclear weapons.  3.  (C) NRIs:  Singh praised the success of non-resident Indians in the United States.  He recounted how Indian steel tycoon Lakhsmi Mittal is now the largest steel magnate in the world.  Senator Bayh responded that Indiana manufactures more steel than any state in America, and that Mittal owns four of the state's five steel mills.  4.  (C) No Clash of Civilizations: In response to a question from Senator Bayh about radical Islam, the FM noted proudly that India had proved Sam Huntington's Clash of Civilizations theory wrong.  India's Islam differed substantially from the Islam of Saudi Arabia or Indonesia.  Although India has the second largest population of Muslims, not a single one had joined Al-Qaida or the Taliban.  The Minister noted with concern, however, that the Madrassah \"movement\" is catching fire, so the issue of radical Islam affects all of us, including the United States where Islam is the fastest growing religion. Senator Bayh concluded by expressing his hope that the United States and India can work to enhance our long term mutual strategic interests, which he said are many.  F.S. SHYAM SARAN ----------------  5. (C)  Indo-US Relations:  Saran welcomed the Senator by noting that he had just returned from a productive visit in the United States, during which he had been pleased to see SecState designate Rice and enjoyed good meetings of the working groups on High Technology Cooperation (HTCG) and the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP). He expressed his satisfaction with the higher than expected turnout of American and Indian business to the HTCG private sector meeting, which he characterized as \"on track\" to get tangible results.  Overall, he thought there is a strong commitment on both sides to carry  relations forward.  Now that landmarks like NSSP Phase 1 have been achieved, both sides need to make important decisions and turn words into action.  Given that India has had an \"impeccable\" record on proliferation and given our shared interest in stopping the spread of WMD, the US needs to clarify whether India is part of the problem or part of the solution.  Another challenge for India is to maintain economic growth rates of 7 to 8 percent per annum, for which its energy needs will be enormous.  Given constraints on conventional energy supplies and the global need to ensure environmental and climate sustainability, India has no choice but to resort to greater use of clean nuclear energy.  This could be an area for closer economic cooperation between the United States and India and the FS expressed hope that India's US partners could be flexible. The FS also recounted the potential for technology cooperation and co-production in the areas of information, defense, and bio-technology.  6. (C) IPR: Senator Bayh noted that India's emphasis on innovation would require a strong IPR regime, which would find favor among potential US business partners.  Saran confirmed that many IT contracts already include IPR provisions and India was working on more comprehensive legislation that would be in place before the January 1, 2005 deadline. He elaborated that India is one of the few developing countries where services contribute 50% of GDP, underlining the importance of IPR to Indian companies.  7. (C) Indo-Pak Relations:  In response to Senator Bayh's question about Pakistan PM Aziz's visit, Saran began by noting while infiltration attempts had stopped, this was more due to Indian efforts to beef up the border fencing in key areas, improve its surveillance technology, and winter weather.  He said Pakistan had cracked down on some of the Jihadi groups inside Pakistan in part to satisfy American requests, in part because several had turned against Musharraf.  He cautioned, however, that the LET is still active, has no restraints imposed on them, and are \"more or less in the arms of ISI.\"  The FS also noted India's concern that the infrastructure to support cross border infiltration remains.  Nonetheless, India remains committed to take the peace process with Pakistan forward, according to Saran.  He reviewed PM Singh's recent visit to Kashmir and his reduction in the number of troops there which had played well in Pakistan, despite Musharraf's dismissal of the action as a \"cosmetic\" measure.  He expressed hope that India's action would help create \"a virtuous cycle\" in Indo-Pak relations. In response to the Senator's question about the internal situation in Pakistan, Saran said Pakistan should have faith in its people and that democracy was worth fostering to strengthen the fight against the Taliban and Jihadis.  NSA J.N. DIXIT ----------------  8. (C) Indo-US Relations: Dixit characterized Indo-US relations as on the right track. On the economic and technological side, he said India accepts that it must address U.S. concerns and provide the necessary incentives for U.S. businesses to come to India.  But India needs the U.S. to trust India a little more.  He urged America not to look at India as another Libya or Iraq, but as a democracy and responsible nuclear power.  Senator Bayh praised the progress in Indo-U.S. relations on many fronts, but noted that deeper operational intelligence cooperation would be desirable.  Dixit acknowledged that operational cooperation is \"not there yet,\" but he predicted great potential for such cooperation as the campaign against terror and organized crime proceeds, and as the need for greater maritime security cooperation grows.  He pledged that as long as the current Congress government is in place, it will work toward greater cooperation with the U.S. in these areas.  He told the Senator that the FBI and CIA already have good interaction with their Indian counterparts and expressed appreciation for recent CIA information and security advice regarding potential security threats to the PM during his trip to Kashmir.  He observed there is no conflict between U.S. and India in any field; the only difference is in the \"theology\" of nonproliferation. Senator Bayh saw India's rise as an economic and strategic power as inevitable and said U.S. wants to help India emerge as a great and responsible world power, and in helping to resolve the Kashmir problem.  Dixit responded that the U.S. has a role as a friend and facilitator and that the U.S. has emerged as a high priority in India's foreign, economic and security policies.  9. (C) Iran: Dixit took the opportunity to urge that the United States not pursue too punitive a policy with Iran as that would only strengthen hard-liners there.  Recalling his visit to Tehran in October, Dixit recounted that the Iranian President and Foreign Minister had told him Iran will sign additional safeguard agreements if deliberations continue within the IAEA.  However, if the matter is referred to the UN Security Council, Iran may reject all cooperation with the IAEA.  The NSA averred that the international community should not be blackmailed, but does need to encourage the forces of reason and moderation in Iran.  Senator Bayh responded that there is strong bipartisan support for sanctions against Iran and skepticism that Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons.  10. (U) Senator Bayh's staff cleared this cable.

(SBU) On November 26 PM Singh announced a mini-cabinet shuffle, the first since the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government took office over six months ago.  Looking ahead to state elections early next year Shibu Soren, the controversial chief of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party, returned as Minister of Coal.  The Minister of Labor and Employment, Sis Ram Ola, was named to head the newly-created Ministry of Mines.  Minister without portfolio and head of the regional Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) K. Chandrasekhara Rao was given the Labor portfolio.  The President swore in the three new ministers on November 27. Notably missing from the long anticipated cabinet reshuffle was the controversial Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who remains in place.  2.  (U)  Soren was originally named to the cabinet as Minister of Coal when the UPA assumed power six months ago. However, he was forced to resign on July 24 after a court in his home state of Jharkhand issued a warrant for his arrest in a 20 year old murder case.  Soren then dropped from sight for several months before surrendering, spending a month in jail and being granted bail.  His case is still pending.  On November 27, BJP spokesman and General Secretary Arun Jaitley told reporters that his party would raise the issue of Soren's reinduction when Parliament convenes on December 6, but would not disrupt the session as it had done previously.   Comment -------  3.  (C) Soren is accused of masterminding a \"massacre\" of his political opponents in Jharkhand twenty years ago, and many say he is guilty.  Even if he escapes prosecution in that case, he is also accused of ordering the murder of his personal assistant and could be arrested in that case soon. PM Singh has a reputation for probity and reportedly opposed bringing Soren into the cabinet, but felt compelled to do so by the pressures of coalition politics.  With Soren back on board, the JMM and Congress can now form an alliance in Jharkhand that will likely defeat the BJP government there and give the state to the UPA in the February 2005 elections.  Likewise, Rao's TRS had threatened to withdraw from the UPA if it did not separate Telangana from Karnataka and create a new state.  Rather than give in to the TRS, Congress agreed to set up a sub-committee to look into the issue and placated Rao by giving him a Cabinet portfolio.  4.  (SBU) Although the Labor Ministry has oversight of our $20 million child labor elimination project, we do not expect the change of ministers to have any impact on that effort or other US interests in India.  The Coal Mine Safety and Health bilateral project will be ending in January and this shake-up will likely not affect its success either. BLAKE " }

Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (U) In its recent national meeting in Ranchi, Jharkhand, the BJP National Executive for the first time attacked the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government's foreign policy, assailing in particular the Congress' mismanagement of the Pakistan F-16's issue.  In its November 29 \"Resolution on Some Current Issues in Foreign Policy,\" the BJP takes aim at India's relationship with Pakistan and criticizes both the UPA government and the USG.  The document describes the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's 1998 nuclear test as a \"sterling achievement,\" as well as India's ability to meet \"the challenge of economic sanctions,\" and establish \"healthy and fruitful relations with \"the USA, the EU, Russia, Japan, ASEAN and other countries.\"  2.  (U) The Resolution lists the NDA's Pakistan policy as its greatest foreign policy achievement.  Citing the joint press conference by PM Vajpayee and President Musharraf in Islamabad on January 6, 2004 as a moment of \"historic significance,\" the document claims that it served as the \"basis of further dialogue between India and Pakistan.\"  It contrasts this achievement against what it describes as the UPA government's \"inept handling\" of India/Pakistan relations.  The BJP claims that the UPA has done nothing to stop Pakistani infiltration of terrorists into India, and that \"the infrastructure of terrorism remains intact in Pakistan and PAK Occupied Kashmir,\" while the India/Pakistan dialogue has \"become wholly Jammu and Kashmir-centric.\"  3.  (U) The Resolution reminds the USG that it must \"ensure that it does nothing to derail the delicate peace process between the two countries,\" and condemns the \"decision of the US Government to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan in the name of fighting terrorism.\"  Alleging that the US has agreed to supply F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, the BJP describes it as a matter \"of greatest concern,\" that will \"have the most adverse impact on the current India-Pakistan peace process.\" Noting that \"when the Vajpayee government was in office we had effectively persuaded the US Government to desist from such moves,\" the resolution condemns the UPA for failing \"to persuade the US Administration to desist from taking such a dangerous step.\"  The resolution hopes that the Bush Administration will \"not jeopardize the peace process between India and Pakistan, and the bilateral relationship between India and the USA, by helping Pakistan augment its offensive capacity.\"  Comment -------  4.  (C) The resolution focuses primarily on the UPA and to a much lesser extent on the USG, largely to placate BJP extremists who have repeatedly called for the party to return to \"Hindu nationalism.\"  The conflict between the Sangh Parivar (family of Hindu groups) and BJP moderates has grown increasingly virulent and is threatening to tear the party apart (Reftel).  The BJP leadership is reluctant to return to the Hindutva agenda, fearing that it would destroy the NDA coalition and pave the way for electoral disaster.  A nationalist attack on Pakistan, the UPA and the USG is a low-cost way for them to assuage the hurt feelings of their right wing.  5.  (C) As our GOI contacts have warned, the F-16's issue is taking on the same kind of symbolic importance here that it has in Pakistan.  Regardless of the merits of the case, a US decision to provide Pakistan with F-16's will be used by the BJP to assail the Congress' management of India's foreign policy -- and in that regard will be a blow to those in the GOI who are trying to deepen our partnership.

Blake, Jr.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: Participants returning from a November 19-December 1 trip by 26 Indian journalists to Pakistan have reported overwhelming popular support in Pakistani Kashmir for opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road.  The media representatives were generally surprised by what they saw, and noted widely diverging notions on the shape of a final settlement of Kashmir, including strong pro-independence views in Mirpur (less in Muzaffarabad), and a much-reduced terrorist presence.  We summarize the main observations of several of the participants, as related to us and reported in the press, for their insight on what the Indian political class is hearing from the other side of the LOC.  If travelers are correct about the strong sentiment in Pakistani Kashmir for roads to open, this mirrors the views of their cousins in the Valley, and endows the December 7-8 Indo-Pak talks on Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus links with special significance.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Organized by the South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA), this was a return visit after a group of Pakistani journalists came to J&K in October under SAFMA auspices (Reftel).  Indian participants (including several Kashmiris who traveled with Indian passports) reported that the Lahore and Islamabad legs were useful for their opportunities to interact with senior GOP officials, including President Musharraf, and politicians, but were most enthusiastic about their travel in Pakistani Kashmir (Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, and Gilgit), which most had never seen before (a few had traveled to the state in past years, but none more recently than four years ago).  They were able to travel where they wished, but lamented that their full program allowed less time to explore their special interests.  3.  (C) In conversations following their return, the Indian journalists praised the warm reception and hospitality they received almost across the board, and the access they were given -- to most of those they wanted to see except Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) supremo Syed Salahuddin (one visitor claimed he was axed from the program because Islamabad did not wish to admit that he was living openly in Pakistan).  Another traveler said the President of the Muzaffarabad Press Club praised the group for \"doing a great job to heal the wounds of a battered humanity.\"  India and Pakistan: Open This Road! -----------------------------------  4.  (C) Kashmiri reporters told us their strongest impression was the yearning in POK for an opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road, hopefully to be followed by the Jammu/Suchetgarh-Sialkot, Poonch-Kotli, and Kargil-Skardu crossings.  An overwhelming majority of interlocutors in POK reportedly saw this as the most important CBM India and Pakistan could adopt.  There was no interest in using a visa and passport system, on the grounds that the LOC would take on characteristics of an international border.  Yusuf Jameel from the \"Asian Age\" said a large number of Kashmiris he met who had crossed the LOC since 1989 wanted to return to the Valley, regardless of the consequences, but claimed that the Fence was making it more difficult to do so.  Other Observations ------------------  5.  (C) Trip participants also made other observations on their experiences in POK, the most interesting of which we summarize below:  -- Tahir Mohiuddin (Chattan/Srinagar) was impressed that he no longer saw militants traveling openly on the roads, as he had four years ago, an indication that Musharraf and the ISI were \"at least doing something against terrorism.\"  -- V Sudarshan (Outlook) reported that nostalgia, hate, metaphor, reality greeted the journalists in Mirpur. Interlocutors reportedly told him residents of POK were \"not even allowed to go to Gilgit.\"  Other POK residents considered the governments in both POK and J&K \"puppets,\" and opined that the only way to determine the views of the people of pre-1947 J&K was to allow travel.  The Mirpur Bar Association President reportedly told him \"(we) are prepared to fight for 2000 years,\" to deafening applause.  -- Shujaat Bukhari (Hindu) was struck by the size of the migration from J&K to POK since the insurgency began in 1989, observing that 35,000 Kashmiris from the Valley were \"eagerly waiting to board the first peace bus.\"  Migrants in POK complained about dreary lives, and thought of themselves as \"kings at home but dependents\" in POK.  The cease-fire has allowed them to travel up to the LOC to wave at their relatives in J&K, but go no further.  He reported \"hardly a voice of dissent\" over free movement between POK and the Valley, although there was no consensus on a final solution to Kashmir. -- Sushant Sareen (Observer Research Foundation, Delhi) reported widely diverging views on the shape of a final settlement of Kashmir.  He was particularly interested in the views of former Azad Kashmir PM Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan, who had changed his mind over time and now argued that \"given ground realities in J&K, there does not appear to be a permanent solution to the Kashmir dispute in sight.  Maybe we should only look for a series of interim solutions.\"  Sareen considered Qayoom the most realistic of all the politicians the group had met during their stay in POK, in that he was willing to consider other steps to improve Kashmiris' lives before settling their final status.  Other politicians were \"caught in a time warp,\" or (in the case of the Amir of Jamaat in POK) were \"consumed by hatred of India,\" and strongly supported the jihadis, he stated.  -- Other journalists reported a session they had at Azad Kashmir University in Muzaffarabad, where they heard strong pro-independence and pro-accession (to Pakistan) views (as well as complaints of large numbers of ISI agents in the auditorium, impeding free speech).  Advocates of an independent Kashmir told the Hindu's Bukhari that there were at least 16 cases of student expulsions there for these views.  -- Indrajit Hazra (Hindustan Times) was amazed to see Tarun Vijay, Editor of the RSS weekly Panchajanya, \"barely able to hold himself back from launching forth on India-Pakistan amity.\"  -- Hazra also reported that \"azadi\" (\"freedom\") is \"on all minds\" in POK, more so in Mirpur than in Muzaffarabad, where she noted a radically different tone, \"almost as if independence was an abstract afterthought.\"  Sareen commented that the pro-independence lobby is well aware that there is \"no question of Pakistan ever allowing control over Azad Kashmir or the Northern Areas to slip out of its hands.\" This prompted some to ask why India does not call Islamabad's bluff by conceding the plebiscite principle.  He reported that local journalists had described \"a change in mindset in POK in favor of independence,\" primarily as a result of their treatment at the hands of the Pakistani establishment.  -- Several found significant improvements since previous visits 4-10 years ago.  They were impressed with infrastructure improvements in Gilgit.  A Jammu-based editor was amazed at the excellent roads and uninterrupted power supply (in sharp contrast to what Indians are used to).  Comment -------  6.  (C) As with the October visit by Pakistani journalists to J&K, this visit was unusually successful in exposing influential Indian and Kashmiri opinion leaders to realities in Pakistani Kashmir, areas most know only from reading and hearsay.  A couple of the travelers considered the trip one of their most important foreign trips ever.  If participants' dominant conclusion -- that there is strong sentiment among Kashmiris in POK for roads to open -- accurately reflects local views, it mirrors those of their cousins in the Valley.  New Delhi and Islamabad can ignore this popular opinion as they bicker over travelers' documentation, but from the Delhi perspective the desire for people-to-people contact on both sides of the LOC seems strong.  This endows the December 7-8 Indo-Pak talks on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus links with all the more significance. MULFORD " }

(C) SA/INS Director Blake and Polcouns used a December 2 meeting with MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar to convey our disappointment at the recent GOI vote at the UN in favor of \"no action\" on the resolution concerning the plight of refugees in Darfur. Polcouns also urged further efforts to synchronize our approaches to multilateral human rights issues.  2.  (C) Jaishankar was unapologetic about the vote, but agreed that more intensive consultations between New Delhi and Washington on such issues would be beneficial, suggesting that this dialogue be included in the next meeting of the U.S.-India Global Issues Forum in early 2005.  Jaishankar then warned that on some issues, such as Burma, Sudan and Iran, diverging strategic interests would lead New Delhi to dissent from Washington's approach.  He commented that \"sometimes principles must be tempered when larger issues are at stake,\" referring to the large capital investment the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Videsh (OVL) has in Sudan and India's fast rising demand for energy.  3.  (C) Jaishankar described Burma, Sudan and Iran as the \"three problem children\" in our relationship, and agreed that the GOI and USG should clearly communicate their respective interests and policies concerning these countries.  For instance, he noted that New Delhi has a clear idea of U.S. \"redlines\" in these countries, but the same might not be true of Washington.  He added, that if the U.S. knew the stakes the GOI has in Sudan the U.S. might better understand India's approach.  Although the U.S. and India often have different objectives when conducting bilateral relations with these three countries, both would benefit by sharing views and ideas.  Jaishankar and Blake agreed that it would be a good idea to have DAS/Joint Secretary level trips to each capital to discuss these issues.  4.  (C) Reflecting on our increasingly substantive regional dialogue, he noted that sometimes regional bureaus in both bureaucracies appear reluctant to add a bilateral U.S.-India dimension to discussions that could complicate Indian or U.S. diplomacy.  He cited the example of the U.S. presentation on China at the recent Foreign Office Consultations, which the GOI found unrealistically sanguine about the Washington/Beijing relationship and Chinese intentions.  5.

(C) Summary:  The report of the High-Level Panel on UN Reform represents the beginning of a long-term process in which India has significant stakes, MEA Joint Secretary (UN Political) BS Prakash told PolCouns on December 3. Downplaying FM Natwar Singh's apparent rejection of a permanent Security Council seat without a veto during December 2 remarks before Parliament, Prakash took a more nuanced view, saying India would deliberate carefully over the range of issues addressed in the report before reaching any conclusions.  While a permanent seat is broadly supported by all facets of the Indian political establishment, Opposition parties could use a veto-less Security Council seat as a means of attacking the UPA-government.  The Congress-led government will also likely have to contend with public concerns about \"second-class status\" should a permanent seat without a veto become an option.  Still, given the symbolic importance India attaches to a Security Council seat, New Delhi would probably in the end be content with permanent membership with or without veto authority. End Summary.  Panel Report Just the Beginning -------------------------------  2.  (C) The report of the High-Level Panel on UN Reform represents the beginning of a long-term process in which India has significant stakes, MEA Joint Secretary (UN Political) BS Prakash told PolCouns on December 3.  Prakash downplayed FM Natwar Singh's December 2 comments before Parliament in which he said that a Security Council Seat without a veto \"would not be acceptable to the country,\" emphasizing that the GOI plans to take a deliberative approach to the report and UN reform.  Despite some initial press reports and political criticism of what is being described as the \"second-class status\" of veto-less permanent membership, Prakash noted that Security Council reform is only one aspect of the report, and noted that the panel's mandate included a review of the entire UN system.  3.  (C) Prakash said that India would probably release a statement on the overall work of the panel within the next few days, but did not feel obliged to respond collaboratively with the G-4 (Brazil, Germany, Indian, and Japan) on specific panel recommendations.  The G-4 did release a very general coordinated statement on December 3 urging the international community \"to embrace this opportunity wholeheartedly to bring about the needed change\" in the UN, and reiterating the need for Security Council expansion.  MEA Director (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma underlined to Poloff New Delhi's commitment to solidarity with the other candidate countries, saying that India would reject any outcome that excludes Brazil, Germany, or Japan from permanent membership.  \"By Any Objective Measure, India Deserves a Seat\" --------------------------------------------- ----  4.  (C) Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, speaking before the release of the report, noted that \"in terms of demography, contributions to peacekeeping or abilities at furtherance of the objectives of the UN, India more than fulfills the criterion\" for permanent membership on the UN Security Council.  MEA Director (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma echoed this view, stating that while the GOI views UN Security Council (UNSC) reform as one component of UN reform, and \"not an end in itself,\" New Delhi clearly believes that the time has come for India to join the ranks of the Security Council as a permanent member.  India has the will and capacity to contribute to the UN, he said, describing the current Security Council configuration as lacking the ability to respond to the realities of today's post Cold War world.  The Council is \"frozen in time,\" Sharma complained, emphasizing that the UN must evolve in order to retain its relevance and effectiveness. What India Wants ----------------  5.  (C) Despite GOI insistence on Security Council reform, India has yet to elaborate on the details behind its vision for permanent membership in the Security Council, or on UN reform more generally.  New Delhi has clearly stated its support for greater representation of the developing world, and its opposition to rotational or semi-permanent seats, arguing instead for the addition of both permanent and non-permanent members.  The MEA's Sharma claimed that the idea of a rotational seat for regional groupings like the EU \"would not translate in South Asia,\" as neither SAARC nor ASEAN qualify as a \"union.\"  He argued that Security Council members should have a global focus, taking into consideration \"the interests of the entire world,\" and observed that a regional seat does not \"pass this test.\"  Beyond this, however, the GOI position is vague.  Mixed Messages on the Veto --------------------------  6.  (C) Responding to questions in Parliament on December 2, FM Natwar Singh stated that a Security Council Seat without a veto \"would not be acceptable to the country,\" but tempered his comments by observing that Security Council expansion was an \"extremely complicated issue with wide ramifications.\" According to J/S Prakash, Natwar's comments came in response to questions unrelated to the predetermined topic (PM Manmohan Singh's September trip to the US) for which the Foreign Minister had been prepared.  The Foreign Minister's comments were not the last word on India's view of the Panel report, he emphasized.  7.  (C) Other MEA officials and GOI foreign policy advisors expressed surprise at Natwar's comments, and offered a more pragmatic approach to the veto.  Ambassador KV Rajan, former Additional Secretary (East), described a general Indian consensus that there is \"not a snowball's chance in hell\" that India will gain a veto in addition to permanent membership.   He commented that most GOI officials believe that permanent membership would be \"fantastic, even without the veto.\"  MEA Director (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma (protect) echoed this view, asserting (before Natwar's comments in Parliament) that India would not make veto power \"a point in our case for membership,\" given the \"ticklish\" nature of the subject.  He emphasized that New Delhi has no official position on whether veto authority should be extended beyond the P-5, but added, \"When the time comes, India will be prepared to discuss this.\"  The Campaign ------------  8.  (C) Illustrating the importance the GOI places on UN reform, particularly Security Council membership, the Congress-led UPA government has undertaken a systematic and largely successful campaign to garner international support for a permanent seat.  As part of this campaign, New Delhi spearheaded a coordinated effort among the G-4 contenders, and lobbied aggressively at the bilateral level. (refs A-C) With the notable exception of the US, India has requested support for its Security Council bid during nearly every high-level bilateral interaction, with countries ranging from Nigeria to Burma, Vietnam to China.  The GOI has also sought support from regional organizations, such as the EU.  The campaign has been largely successful, with dozens of countries expressing support for an Indian seat.  During a joint press conference with PM Manmohan Singh during a December 3 visit to New Delhi, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that veto power should not be expanded beyond the P-5.  \"We believe it would be absolutely unacceptable to erode such tools of the UN,\" he said. 9.  (C) To solidify its claims to the Security Council, the GOI has also begun to assert itself more visibly within the UN, particularly after suffering a humiliating defeat in the October 1996 election for a rotating UNSC membership. Viewing election to ECOSOC as a pre-cursor to Security Council membership, New Delhi lobbied hard for an ECOSOC seat.  GOI officials, including Natwar Singh, have interpreted India's wide margin of victory there (174 votes -- \"the highest number earned by any country\") as recognition of New Delhi's ability to mobilize a majority of UN members.  Approaching the US ------------------  10.  (C) According to Ambassador Rajan, the GOI remains unsure about the US position on Security Council reform, viewing Washington as uninterested in genuine reform.  For this reason, India has so far been hesitant to push the issue of UNSC expansion in a US-India context.  He said that some sectors of the GOI view US support for a Security Council seat as \"a litmus test of the strategic partnership,\" though most recognize the complex issues surrounding Security Council reform.  Former Indian Ambassador to the US Lalit Mansingh acknowledged that US support for India will be \"the deciding factor,\" observing that without US support an Indian seat will not become reality.  11.  (C) In discussions with Poloff, MEA's Sharma sought to downplay the sometimes marked differences between the US and India at the UN, particularly on human rights issues, commenting that New Delhi and Washington agree on the need for an effective, credible, and efficient council.  India does not work in contradiction with US values, he emphasized, adding that New Delhi had often served as a moderating voice among the NAM and G-77 countries on resolutions targeting Israel.  What About Pakistan? --------------------  12.  (C) Asked whether the GOI worried about Pakistani opposition to permanent Indian membership on the Security Council, Sharma stated bluntly that \"India is not worried about opposition, by Pakistan or any other country,\" adding that each of the G-4 candidates have some opposition.  He offered no strategy for overcoming opposition that could come from Pakistan, or from other Islamic countries, but said India was confident of receiving the two-thirds vote necessary to join the Security Council.  Comment -------  13.  (C) For India, permanent UN Security Council membership has come to symbolize India's arrival as a global power, and for this reason has become a high-profile issue for the government and foreign policy elite.  Debate among the wider public is just beginning, and in this context Natwar's comments to Parliament further complicated the already vague Indian position on a desirable outcome for UNSC reform. However, it is probable that Natwar's remarks were made off-the-cuff and do not represent the official GOI stand.  As one of our contacts put it, \"By now we should all know that Natwar does not have the last word.\"  The Indian Government is likely to be satisfied with a permanent Security Council seat sans veto, but whether the public and Opposition parties will accept this outcome remains another matter.

(U) Action request for OVP.  Please see para 4.  2. (C) Reflecting significant Indian interests in Afghanistan and GOI support for Karzai's re-election, New Delhi has designated Minister of State in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan to lead the official delegation for the December 7 Afghan inauguration.  As Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Chavan serves as a go-between for Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, providing some of the political screen that Brajeh Mishra offered in the Vajpayee PMO.  A founding member of the Indo-US Parliamentary Forum, Chavan is a US-educated contemporary of Rajiv Gandhi who was a supporter of our bilateral relationship long before it became fashionable.  3. (C) MEA contacts intimated several weeks ago that the timing of the Afghan inauguration, which coincides with a short and intensive session of Parliament, would complicate efforts to identify a suitably high-level leader of the Indian delegation.  The decision to designate Chavan (who will be sent as a personal emissary of the Prime Minister) reflects a typically Indian effort to split the difference, while avoiding the political problems that could result if Foreign Minister Natwar Singh was out of the country while Parliament was in session.  4. (SBU) Action Request: As detailed septel, the GOI has just issued a Request for Proposal for 50 widebody aircraft for Air India.  US success in this major tender will require sustained high-level advocacy to balance pressures from European capitals, including from Chancellor Schroeder PM Blair and President Chirac, all of whom have weighed in to support Airbus.  In this context, Mission asks that OVP seek an opportunity for the Vice President to engage personally with Minister Chavan on behalf of Boeing.  All indications are that this tender is on a fast track.  The Vice-President's visit is an opportunity to convey a high level message that will go straight to the decision-making levels of the Indian government.  5. (U) Minimize considered. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: As India and Pakistan move into Round II of their Composite Dialogue (CD), people-to-people exchanges continue at an accelerating pace, building goodwill, expanding non-official ties, and keeping up a positive atmosphere for formal talks.  The recent visit by Pakistani Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi to inaugurate the first-ever Punjab Games generated enormous good feeling, according to the Pakistani DCM, although Elahi possibly linked normalization of trade to progress on Kashmir.  During a December 2-7 visit to Delhi by retired senior Pakistani military officers organized by the India-Pakistan Soldiers' Initiative for Peace, participants from both sides agreed to use their influence to further rapprochement.  Track II activists are slowly becoming conscious of the soft power they wield, and are eager to build support for the official dialogue.  Kashmir remains the dark cloud over these people-to-people exchanges.  End Summary.  Progress in Punjab ------------------  2.  (C) Punjab, the one Indian state where anti-Pakistan sentiments have traditionally been the most intense, recently witnessed unusual cross-border interaction, including the most important visit by a Pakistani Punjabi politician in memory.  Pakistani High Deputy Commissioner Munawar Saeed (protect) told Polcouns on December 3 that Chief Minister Elahi had an unprecedented reception from the moment he arrived in Amritsar, commenting \"I've never seen anything like it.\"  He said the mood in Chandigarh was also very positive -- \"nearly euphoric\" -- an assessment echoed in the Indian press.  Elahi's later comment that trade between the two Punjabs will not take off until core issues such as Kashmir were resolved doused enthusiasm somewhat.  Even so, Elahi predicted that overall relations would improve, adding that PM Manmohan Singh's anticipated visit to Pakistan in 2005 to go a long way in this effort.  3.  (SBU) Continuing the successful series of Indo-Pak sporting events, particularly cricket and hockey, the first-ever Punjab Games (December 5-10) united more than 750 athletes from the two countries.  Traditional Punjabi sports -- wrestling, field hockey and kabaddi (a team sport combining elements of rugby, wrestling and tag) -- and Olympic sports such as basketball, cycling, and marksmanship are on the program.  Although over 100 of the Pakistani athletes submitted their visa applications late, Indian immigration officials garnered goodwill by allowing them special entry through the Wagah border after its scheduled closing.  The Games are to be an annual event, with Lahore hosting in 2005.  Old Soldiers Never Die -- They Join Track II Groups --------------------------------------------- ------  4.  (SBU) Another recent Track II event passed with less fanfare, but was reflective of broadening dialogue between the two countries.  Seventeen retired senior Pakistani military officers -- including lieutenant generals, admirals, and an air marshal -- were in India December 2-7 for meetings with Indian counterparts under the auspices of the India-Pakistan Soldier's Initiative for Peace.  At a closed-door roundtable that Poloff attended, speakers from both sides agreed that the peace process under the Composite Dialogue was critical to refocusing budgets from defense to human development.  Poloff was struck by participants' comments that especially in Pakistan \"retired officers can impact policy.\"  The only stumbling point during the day was disagreement over whether Kashmir should be the first order of business between New Delhi and Islamabad, with representatives from both sides reverting to their governments' traditional positions and one Pakistani brigadier asking rhetorically, \"If your Kashmiris are so happy, why not hold a plebiscite?\"  That brief flare-up soon died down, however, after both delegations agreed that they had more commonalties than differences.  5.  (SBU) Former Indian Chief of Naval Staff Admiral L Ramdas, who brought retired senior Indian officers to Pakistan in 2001, headed the Indian side.  The Pakistani group included retired Corps Commanders LTG Nasir Akhtar (Karachi), LTG Humayun Khan Bangash (Lahore and later Ambassador to Turkey), and MG Nawaz Chaudhry, Defense Attache to the US in the mid-1980s.  After the roundtable, which was organized by the MOD think-tank Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, the Pakistani delegation met with New Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, and a small group later saw Home Minister Shivraj Patil.  Their other stops in India included Amritsar, Agra, and Jaipur.  Comment -------  6.  (SBU) These two events are the most recent examples of the proliferation of cross-border exchanges that are connecting Indian and Pakistani businesspeople, professionals, students, journalists, athletes, and others. We are struck by participants' sense of the soft power they wield, which vests both countries in their ongoing dialogue, even as friction over the Kashmir dispute remains.  These events are also important in the Indian context as a reflection of the shifting politics of Indo-Pak relations. In contrast to past eras, when \"Pak bashing\" was a reliable vote getter, friendship with Pakistan has now begun to resonate politically, which provides an element of ballast in the recast peace process that was lacking before.

(C) Summary:  The BJP is not taking advantage of the Winter session of Parliament (December 1-23) to demonstrate its effectiveness as India's leading opposition party.  Our conversations with senior BJP leaders in recent weeks indicate that the party is not addressing its internal problems and has no strategy to return to power.  It confronts the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) on the streets and in Parliament, but has yet to develop a positive vision for India.  Privately its leaders express optimism about the party's prospects, but concede that the UPA is likely to remain in power for some time to come.  The UPA record to date has not without problems and has provided openings for opposition attacks, but the BJP will not present a serious challenge to the government until it resolves the many internal problems it is sweeping under the rug.  End Summary.  Parliament Gets Off to a Rocky Start ------------------------------------  2.  (C) The winter session of Parliament (December 1-23) provides an opportunity for the BJP to demonstrate its effectiveness as an opposition party.  Its actions in the first few days of the session, however, revealed a party in disarray and searching for a coherent strategy to counter the UPA government.  3.  (U) During the current session, Parliament is scheduled to address up to 46 bills on a wide variety of subjects, including the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) and a high-profile employment guarantee law.  MPs are also scheduled to discuss appropriate responses to increased attacks by Maoist groups, the prospect of talks between the GOI and Kashmiri separatists, ongoing violence in the state of Manipur, and the recent arrest of a prominent Hindu mystic, the Kanchi Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati.  Despite the packed Parliamentary agenda, expectations are low, as BJP disruption has prevented the previous two sessions from enacting much business.  Parliament's first day met expectations, as MPs from rival parties engaged in free-for-alls, forcing the speaker to dismiss the house early.  Democracy: Not a Pretty Picture -------------------------------  4.  (U) During the opening session, members of the Bihar-based Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) made personal attacks against BJP President Advani, alleging that he had mistreated his daughter-in-law.  MPs from the Dalit-based BSP left their seats to loudly protest the recent arrest of one of their delegation in Uttar Pradesh (UP), called for the GOI to dissolve the state government led by Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, and only stopped shouting after the Speaker threatened them with suspension.  The Left/Communist parties accused the UPA of \"not consulting\" prior to increasing the price of petroleum products, implying that the price rise was unjustified.  The BJP accused Congress of betraying its election slogan of \"Congress is with the Common Man,\" before leading an opposition walkout.  5.  (U) The arrest of the Kanchi Sankaracharya dominated the second day of proceedings, with the BJP raising the issue in both houses.  BJP firebrand Sushma Swaraj claimed to be \"anguished\" over the treatment of what she described as \"a 2,500 year old religious institution.\"  Alleging involvement of the GOI and the UPA government in Andhra Pradesh (AP) in the Shankaracharya's arrest, she demanded the transfer of the case out of Tamil Nadu, and GOI intervention \"to ensure proper treatment\" of the Shankaracharya.  The UPA responded that it had nothing to do with the arrest, while the Tamil Nadu government accused Swaraj of \"misleading the house.\" Tempers ran high throughout the session, with MPs frequently interrupting speakers with heckling and catcalls.  The BJP Takes to the Streets ---------------------------- 6.  (U) On December 1 the BJP, decrying UPA economic policies as \"anti-people,\" held a protest march to parliament.  In his speech at the rally, former PM Vajpayee said his government had kept inflation under check, increased the per capita income, achieved robust economic growth and launched major infrastructural development projects.  He contrasted this with the state of the economy under the UPA, which he claimed had \"no control over rising prices.\"  BJP leaders also criticized the UPA for distorting the Indian government by establishing a \"super Prime Minister\" (Sonia Gandhi), filling the Cabinet with corrupt and criminal ministers, and taking a \"soft approach\" to terrorism in J&K and India's Northeast.  Uma's Letter Bomb -----------------  7.  (SBU) Another indication of the deep divisions within the BJP leadership was a letter written by BJP firebrand and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati. Excerpts from the letter were published in the most recent edition of \"Outlook\" magazine.  Bharati implies that Advani who \"used to roar like a lion,\" has lost his charisma, while party General Secretary Pramod Mahajan has \"only one goal,...to come into power and then to make money,\" and former party President Venkaiah Naidu \"made menopause a national issue,\" when he cited his wife's \"illness\" as the reason for his resignation.  BJP leaders have insisted that Bharati is being \"rehabilitated\" and would soon rejoin the ranks following her recent suspension.  But her caustic letter attacks much of the party leadership in terms that would make further cooperation extremely difficult.  8.  (C) Two BJP functionaries confirmed to us that the letter is authentic.  Bharati had written the letter and given it to a confidant to release to the press should her reinduction not take place, but he reportedly leaked it prematurely. According to our informants, Bharati was to be reinducted into the party as early as December 2, but when the letter was leaked, angry second tier leaders demanded that she be kept out, and Advani complied.  The Hindutva MP ---------------  9.  (C) Ramakrishna Kusumaria is a BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh (MP).  Known to be a follower of Uma Bharati, Kusumaria represents the Hindutva wing of the party.  In a conversation with Poloff on December 3, he blamed the BJP's secular-oriented moderates and their National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies for the fall of the BJP government, saying they insisted on calling an early election and failed to present the party's \"values\" (Hindutva) in a compelling manner.  Despite this, he insisted the party would rebuild. He claimed that since the BJP represents Indian nationalism, its leaders reflect the country's religious values and that because \"time is on our side,\" the BJP will return to power stronger than ever.  10.  (C) Pointing to the recent induction of Shibu Soren, who is under indictment for two murder cases, and other \"tainted ministers\" into the cabinet, and the increasingly heated dispute between Railway Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and former Railway Minister Ramvilas Paswan, Kusumaria alleged that the UPA is basically hypocritical and corrupt.  He also accused the UPA of claiming to be \"the party of the common man,\" while dismantling effective NDA programs that extended credit to the rural poor and developed India's infrastructure.  According to Kusumaria, the BJP is best able to tackle corruption and bring economic relief to the poor, and this will become clear to the voter.  11.  (C) Kusumaria conceded that, the UPA will likely remain in power for a full five-year term, as the BJP will need time to \"rebuild.\"  He also acknowledged that Vajpayee will not return as PM and did not mention Advani as his successor. Ruling out the prospect that the next BJP PM will come from the party's secular wing, Kusumaria said it would be a \"holy\" person and the party would make the decision at the appropriate time.  The Youth Leader ----------------  12.  (C) Dharmendra Pradhan is a rising star within the BJP and was recently named to head the party's Youth Wing.  A native of Orissa, he represents a central Orissa constituency.  Speaking with Poloff on December 3, he called the UPA \"inherently unstable,\" predicting that it could fall at any time, and asserting that the BJP is ready to return to power at a moment's notice, with Vajpayee as its standardbearer.  According to Pradhan, the Left/Communists are the UPA's weak link, as they can bring down the government at will.  He claimed that prominent Left leaders told him they were \"disgusted\" with Congress and the UPA, and were only supporting them to keep the BJP out of power.  13.  (C) Pradhan also claimed that Left leaders tell him privately that globalization is inevitable and they want only to ensure that its consequences are distributed fairly. According to Pradhan, the Left leaders are inherently parochial and only want to maintain power in their \"red forts\" -- Tripura, Kerala, West Bengal.  Congress must concede these states to the Left, he said, or they will bring down the UPA.  14.  (C) According to Pradhan, Congress mismanagement is providing the opposition BJP with many issues.  He insisted that BJP would get lots of mileage out of the arrest of the Shankaracharya.  Noting that the BJP was an \"ideological, cadre-based\" party, Pradhan asserted it would find an issue to \"unite the majority community, (Hindus)\" and that once this is accomplished, it will have a lock on government.  He asserted that the BJP will continue to attack the UPA on its economic performance, and contrasted the treatment of the Shankaracharya with that of the \"tainted ministers.\"  How could it be, he asked rhetorically, that Shibu Soren is accused of murder and put on the cabinet, while the Shankaracharya is placed in a jail cell?  15.  (C) Pradhan acknowledged that the BJP has not selected a second tier leader to fill the number three slot behind Vajpayee and Advani.  Like Kusumaria, he downplayed the succession issue, claiming that the party would solve it when the time came.  Pradhan also denied that there is inherent tension within the party between the Hindutva wing and the pro-development wing, claiming that the party supported both objectives.  He conceded that the BJP's behavior in the last two parliamentary sessions was a mistake, and predicted the party would behave in a more responsible manner in Parliament to address issues of government and national policy.  A Response from Congress ------------------------  16.  (C) Speaking with Poloff on December 3, Congress MP Rashid Alvi (a Muslim) laughed off the BJP challenge, saying that the opposition has only one issue and came to power on the public's momentary fascination with the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and the novelty of Hindutva.  In Alvi's view, such emotional appeals quickly fade, the public has lost interest, and the BJP has nothing else to offer.  He predicted that the BJP would continue to decline, and the NDA alliance would eventually break up and disappear.  17.  (C) Alvi revealed that Congress is far more worried about Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP), than the BJP.  According to Alvi, Mulayam has approached DMK Party Chief Muthavel Karunanidhi to convince him to pull his party out of the UPA government and join with the SP to form a new government.  Karunanidhi's departure would leave the UPA without a parliamentary majority.  Alvi claimed that Karunanidhi was not interested in the proposal, which cannot succeed without support from the Communists.  Alvi opined that while some Communists have pro-SP sympathies and would like to sever ties with Congress and the UPA, most have discovered that Mulayam is an unprincipled opportunist and no longer want to work with him.  He predicted that the UPA would remain in power for the next few years and easily brush off BJP challenges.  Comment -------  18.  (C) The BJP's behavior and the private statements of its MPs do little to convince us that the party has overcome its problems or has a strategy to regain power.  Instead, it continues to paper over factional disputes, disrupt Parliament, postpone the leadership/succession issue, avoid a decision on the next Prime Ministerial candidate, and defer any program to win state level elections in February 2005. Many in the BJP appear content to wait for the UPA to self-destruct or make a serious mistake that will provide an opening for attack.  The UPA has presented such opportunities in the form of price increases of basic commodities and nominations to the Cabinet of persons with records of criminality and corruption.  However, Indian voters for now seem unconvinced that the BJP has a better track record or will behave differently should it return to power. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 7675      B. NEW DELHI 6707      C. NEW DELHI 5978  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin's December 3-5 visit to India did little to broaden their ties beyond defense, despite efforts by both sides to infuse the relationship with new momentum.  Both leaders pressed their issues with Russia extracting a promise from India to sign a defense secrecy agreement within five months, and India securing Russia's support for a UNSC seat with full veto powers.  Moscow, however, pushed harder and announced it would not supply another consignment of nuclear fuel for India's Tarapur reactor.  Significantly, Putin spent half his India tour in Bangalore with a view to securing a Russian piece of India's booming IT sector.  The growing US-India partnership showed itself to be a factor in the India-Russia calculus during this visit, and may have inspired Russia's nuclear cold shoulder.  End Summary.  2. (C) Preceding Putin's arrival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov visited New Delhi to preview the visit, leading to speculation that Putin and PM Manmohan Singh would sign a number of far-reaching agreements.  In the end, deliverables from this annual summit were rather modest.  With discussions that ranged from arms to pharmaceuticals to visas, the leaders produced a four-page Joint Declaration and 10 to 14 MOUs (the exact number is unclear).  New Delhi-based Russia-watchers waxed eloquent on the depth and historical strength of India-Russia bonds \"even\" in light of improving relations with the US, but the general tone of the visit was unusually scratchy.  Shoring up the Foundation: Defense ----------------------------------  3. (U) As expected, defense issues dominated the talks with official statements and media reports highlighting GOI concern about reliability of arms sales and support, a strong desire by both sides to pursue defense co-production, Russian concern about leakage of sensitive technology from India, and the increasing role of India's growing energy needs in shaping its foreign policy.  Some observers noted Russian eagerness to conclude long-pending agreements in order to frustrate the US from getting a piece of the large Indian arms market.  Arms: Upgrades, Supply Guarantees, and Joint Ventures --------------------------------------------- --------  4. (U) Just before Putin's arrival, Defense Ministers from the two countries signed a \"Protocol of the Inter-Governmental Commission for Russian-Indian Military-Technical Cooperation\" to expand bilateral military cooperation, specifically in upgrading weapons systems and various joint production and training initiatives.  India is pursuing upgrades of weapons systems and technology as well as guaranteed delivery schedules for contracted weapons systems, uninterrupted supply of spare parts, life-cycle support, and joint production and training ventures. According to media reports, the Ministers agreed to upgrade equipment including T-72 tanks, but negotiations are still underway on upgrading the maritime TU-142 reconnaissance aircraft and MiG 29K for the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov.  They also agreed to establish service centers to repair Russian-made combat hardware.  5. (C) Significantly, Russia offered to make India a partner in producing its new fifth generation multi-role fighter and has offered India a role in developing a multi-functional transport aircraft.  (The US is a potential competitor in both of these categories.)  Russia also reportedly committed to increasing its 50 percent investment in production of the supersonic Brahmos cruise missile to 60 percent, with an optimistic proposal to build 360 per year for sale to third countries.  Finally, both sides agreed to hold military joint exercises in India in 2005, following in the wake of an increasingly sophisticated US-India exercise program.  IPR: Co-Production Carrots and Weapons Stoppage Sticks --------------------------------------------- ---------  6. (C) Intensified Russia-India defense cooperation remains contingent upon the GOI signing a Defense Technology Secrecy Agreement (DTSA) (pending for more than two years), under which India would agree not to transfer products and technology to third parties.  Dangling the carrot of co-production, Russian Defense Minister Ivanov said, \"An early conclusion of an agreement on intellectual property rights would lay the foundation for development of many more hi-tech weapons systems jointly by the two countries.\" However, before coming to India, Ivanov hinted that defense ties could come to a halt if India sought to mix Russian technology with proposed purchases from the US (especially Patriot), according to Russian press reports quoted in the Indian media.  Observer Research Foundation Senior Fellow Nandan Unnikrishnan told Poloff he thought the revived interest in securing a DTSA originated with new Russian Ambassador Vyacheslav Trubnikov, who is \"a man of the Kremlin,\" rather than a diplomat.  (He added that the Ambassador has \"cut the MFA out,\" noting that the senior Russian diplomat responsible for India was not part of the Putin delegation.)  7. (C) Indian MOD officials say the GOI agreed to protect Russian technology, but also wanted Moscow to sign an MOU to provide bank guarantees to ensure future supplies of spares. India has been reluctant to sign a DTSA because it is seeking a more equitable partnership in joint research and production of military hardware, rather than simply importing Russian arms.  At the conclusion of the visit, Indian Defense Minister Mukherjee said that a non-retroactive DTSA should be signed \"in the next five months.\"  A senior MEA official told the UK High Commission that India sees this as an Indian concession, but one without substantial costs. Significantly, the MEA also signaled a general sense of dissatisfaction with recent Russian performance as an arms supplier.  UNSC Veto Flap Blamed on Translators ------------------------------------  8. (C) President Putin defused a flap over a remark he made during a press conference on December 3 in which he was quoted as saying that an increase in the number of veto-holding UNSC members would be \"absolutely unacceptable,\" and would erode the effectiveness of the institution (Ref A).  After the ensuing media uproar, Putin clarified his statement in a December 4 meeting with Indian Vice President Shekhawat, attributing the misunderstanding to a translation error.  Later on December 4, the MEA released a statement that Putin had unambiguously offered Russia's support for India's bid for a permanent UNSC seat, with \"the right of veto.\"  Most of our interlocutors saw this as a Russian flip-flop in the face of the strong GOI reaction.  Energy: Strike out on Nuclear, Green Light on Oil and Gas --------------------------------------------- ------------  9. (C) Russia is currently helping India build two 1,000 MW nuclear reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, but during the visit, the director of Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency gave an interview indicating Moscow would not go against NSG rules by providing several additional reactors.  This echoes the message that FM Lavrov reportedly delivered during a pre-Putin visit (Ref B).  However, it contradicts widespread expectations in the Indian nuclear establishment and media that Moscow was prepared to provide additional reactors for Kudankulam.  The same interview also indicated that Moscow had decided to turn down the Indian request for another batch of fuel for the US-built Tarapur reactors.  Mission will follow-up on these reports, which suggest that Russia may have changed its mind on lobbying India to buy more VVER-1000 reactors.  The ORF's Unnikrishnan suggested to us that Moscow's nuclear cold shoulder may have been a pressure tactic, and may not be the end of the story.  He speculated that the Russians wanted to send a message that if India wants the US to be the \"pole\" of its foreign relations, there will be consequences.  10. (C) The two countries did, however, agree to improve cooperation in non-nuclear energy, calling for joint \"development of new oil and gas fields and the means of their transportation in Russia, India, and other countries.\"  This agreement also reportedly includes welcoming Indian bids for Russian oil giant Yukos.  In one deal, India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Russian Gazprom will work together in the Bay of Bengal.  Putin's visit also produced speculation that India will add to its 20 percent stake in Russia's Sakhalin One oil field with an investment in Sakhalin Three.  In the context of India's expanding energy needs, the GOI was reportedly surprised at the Russians' private declaration that they control all the gas coming out of Turkmenistan.  Eyeing a Piece of the IT Pie ----------------------------  11. (C) Putin spent more than half of his India tour in Bangalore in an effort to open more economic fronts in the India-Russia relationship.  Prior to and throughout the Putin visit, Russian officials cited the woefully low level of bilateral trade (Ref B).  Traveling with a delegation of Russian businesspeople, Putin visited software giant Infosys with an eye to gaining from the booming Indian IT sector. However, after the stop, an Infosys official remarked that his company \"has no plans to expand our operations to Russia,\" underlining Bangalore's remarkably tight economic connection to the US, which leaves little space for late-coming Russian firms.  Although Putin also visited Bangalore's Hindustan Aeronautics, the dominant impression one gets from the city is the who's who of American IT firms that now operate from there.  Blast From the Past -------------------  12. (U) Delivering the 2004 Jawarhalal Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi, Putin cited uptapped potential of the Non-Aligned Movement and decried \"unilateral action in international affairs.\"  In a speech notable for its wooden, Soviet-style language, Putin commented that \"it is extremely dangerous to attempt to rebuild modern civilization...according to the barracks principles of a unipolar world.\"  He condemned \"dictatorship packaged in a pretty wrapping of pseudo-democratic phraseology,\" as exacerbating regional conflicts, and added that terrorism, with respect to which there are \"double-standards...cannot and must not be used in some geo-political games.\"  The audience welcomed and saw Putin off with a standing ovation, but D/PolCouns noted that listeners applauded only after Putin's reiteration of support for India's UNSC membership.  Beyond India-Russia -------------------  13. (C) In addition to public gripes about the US, in his private meetings, Putin expressed his irritation with Western involvement in the Ukraine crisis, according to the MEA readout provided to the UK High Commission (strictly protect).  The British added that Putin and the Indians commiserated over inconsistent handling of proliferation issues, particularly AQ Khan and Iran, and concluded that India and Russia have a basically similar approach towards Tehran, although neither wants to see Iranian nuclear weaponization.  On Iraq, Putin privately expressed his concerns about security there and the danger of the country splitting along religious and clan-based lines.  Comment -------  14. (C) Although Putin's visit saw many of the old India-Russia friendship themes, the two had little success in their attempt to move beyond defense cooperation.  Although we have still to get a complete GOI readout on this visit, we are struck by the generally scratchy atmospherics.  As MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar put it to PolCouns, \"we have dealt with the Russians a long time,\" and know how to handle their pressure (a reference to Ivanov's heavy-handed message that Russia might consider an arms sales relationship with Pakistan).  In courting an IT connection with Bangalore, Russia will have to get in line behind the US, Europe and Japan, who are all more established and more attractive technology partners.  On first examination, this visit reconfirmed the impression that India and Russia still have not figured out how to adjust their partnership to the realities and changing relationships around them.  Emerging tension in the India-Russia relationship is a trend we may see more of as the New Delhi-Moscow power equation continues to shift gradually in India's direction, and the GOI seeks further to shed the dependency that has characterized their relationship for much of India's history.

(C) Summary: Meeting December 7 with the Ambassador, Indian NSA Dixit offered a guardedly optimistic assessment of the Indo-Pak peace process, reaffirming the PM's commitment to \"innovative solutions\" but also cautioning that there will be no territorial concessions by India.  \"Short of that,\" he added, \"many things are possible.\"  Reflecting the continued GOI willingness to climb down from established positions in furtherance of normalization, Dixit described a new GOI approach to the issue of cross border documentation that he hoped would facilitate a bus service between the two sides of Kashmir.  Pointing to the recent expert talks on cross border train service, Dixit expressed suspicion that the Pakistani establishment had decided to put the brakes on Indo-Pak people to people exchanges.  Speaking briefly on Iraq, Dixit said New Delhi was torn between \"our heart and our head\" -- the former argues for assisting the United States at a time of difficulty, although intellectually India is cautious of involvement while the security situation is so unsettled and the domestic Indian politics are difficult.  Dixit looked forward to a further discussion of these issues with Secretary Rumsfeld.  End Summary.  SIPDIS  Iraq: How to Deliver? ---------------------  2. (C) The Ambassador opened this December 7 discussion by expressing puzzlement that India, despite its large interests in the Gulf, has been so reluctant to be involved in the construction of Iraqi democracy.  Dixit confided that he has been discussing with the Prime Minister how India could be more supportive in Iraq.  He recalled that the BJP \"wanted to send troops\" and was prevented from doing so by a Parliamentary resolution pushed by Congress.  That legacy, and the pressure of the left parties, creates \"a major political problem\" for any further Indian involvement.  He added that the PM was \"still cogitating\" on what India can do.  \"The US is important and Iraq is very important,\" Dixit added, noting that \"if we don't contribute to stabilization, Islamic radicalism may go out of control\" in a way that threatens India.  Reflecting the GOI dilemma, Dixit related that \"the heart says join the Americans to help, but the head says to be very careful.\"  He concluded by noting that although the PM was unlikely to convey any specific offers of assistance, the GOI would look forward to an Iraq discussion with Secdef Rumsfeld.  Pakistan: Keeping the Momentum ------------------------------  3. (C) Turning to Indo-Pak relations, Dixit queried about Musharraf's visit to the White House, expressing relief at the US intention to remain engaged on the problem of cross-border terrorist infiltration.  Stepping back, Dixit argued that \"somehow the message has to get to Pakistan that Manmohan Singh is inclined to envisage innovative solutions.\"  However, he continued, there is \"one basic limitation -- jurisdictionally to give up the Valley or other areas in J&K is not on.\"  \"Short of that, many things are possible.\"  \"If Pakistan signals that it is not insistent on disturbing borders or the LOC as it exists,\" the NSA continued, \"then its relevance can be eroded by other devices.\"  Getting Pakistan to recognize this opportunity is the object of Dixit's back-channel dialogue with Tariq Aziz.  However, the NSA concluded, \"I know it will be a long haul.\"  Indian Concession on Bus Documentation --------------------------------------  4. (C) As evidence of India's resolve to keep pushing the Indo-Pak peace process, Dixit cited a new GOI position on documentation for travelers using the proposed bus from Srinagar to Muzaffarabad on the two sides of the LOC. Pakistan has objected to using passports and visas on this route (as is done for Kashmiris traveling by air) since that could imply recognition of Indian jurisdiction on their side of the LOC.  Instead, Dixit recounted, \"India has accommodated 60-70%\" of the GOP position by offering to use a separate \"certificate\" for crossing the LOC which would be stamped by both sides \"without in prejudice to jurisdiction.\"  A passport would be used only to establish identity when procuring this LOC crossing certificate from the relevant High Commission.  5. (C) Dixit lamented that the GOP appeared to have rejected this offer, insisting that no form of national identification could be used for crossing the LOC.  He expressed strong suspicion that \"the Pakistanis don't really want contacts to happen.\"  As evidence, he cited the Pakistani insistence that the proposed rail line between Rajasthan and Sindh would take three years to complete, even though there is meter gauge rail on both sides of the border that could be ready for use in a few months.  Similarly, Dixit complained that Islamabad had quashed a proposal to allow free flow of text books and educational books, fearing that this could \"erode the ideology of Pakistan.\"  6. (C) Despite these frustrations, Dixit underlined that the PM is strongly committed to get the bus service started, and to launch a parallel route between Sialkot and Jammu.  Dixit was also encouraged by the positive meeting between Manmohan Singh and Punjab Chief Minister Choudhary Pervez Elahi.  He insisted that this kind of people-to-people contact will \"make an impact on the broader political environment.\"  He recognized the Pakistani fear that too much connectivity will detract from a focus on Kashmir, and worried that Islamabad would be tempted to claim that India was being obstinate, and then walk away from the Composite Dialogue process.  He was encouraged by the continued decline in infiltration (which he attributed to both Pakistani policy and improved Indian counter-insurgency performance), and placed great importance on the continuation of the LOC cease-fire.  But, he worried that Pakistan still had unrealistic objectives.  Kashmir -------  7. (C) Dixit struck a similar note of conditional optimism regarding the Kashmir internal track.  He said the PM was happy with his visit to Srinagar, but disappointed that the Kashmiri Hurriyat parties were unwilling to speak to him.  He confided that some in the GOI had opposed authorizing travel documents for Hurriyat leaders who planned travel to an early December Pugwash (Track II) dialogue in Kathmandu.  However, the PM had intervened personally to see that they would be allowed to travel with no restrictions on their passports. \"We want them to acknowledge the privileges of being a citizen of a democratic country,\" Dixit declared, underlining New Delhi's view that Hurriyat leaders like the Mirawaiz are subject to Indian authority.

(C) Summary:  Speaking informally at a just-concluded track-II conference on Nepal, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran argued that New Delhi and Kathmandu must work more closely together to defeat the Maoists, that Nepalese mistrust of India is misplaced, and that economic development could help Nepal overcome the insurgency, according to MEA Undersecretary (Nepal) Manu Mahawar.  Mahawar predicted that King Gyanendra would visit New Delhi, probably during the latter part of December, and indicated that the GOI would use that opportunity to encourage the King not to curtail Prime Minister Deuba's authority.  This comes against a growing expectation in Indian non-governmental circles that PM Deuba's days are numbered.  Mahawar noted that 160 Nepalese police officers had just completed training in Hyderabad, and said another 300 officers would enter the pilot program in mid-December under India's new police training initiative. New Delhi remains concerned about the nexus between anti-India insurgent groups and Nepalese Maoists, he emphasized.  End Summary.  Shyam Saran \"Speaks From the Heart\" -----------------------------------  2.  (C) Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran \"spoke from the heart\" on the need to defeat the Maoist insurgency when he inaugurated a December 5-6 track-II conference on Nepal, MEA Undersecretary (Nepal) Manu Mahawar told Poloff on December 7.  Mahawar described the Foreign Secretary's comments as his personal views, but said the remarks were \"completely consistent\" with the official GOI line.  He attributed this consistency to Saran's significant role in the formulation of India's policy toward Nepal.  3.  (C) According to Mahawar, Saran outlined a four point approach to dealing with the Maoists:  -- India and Nepal must coordinate more closely in order to resolve the Maoist problem;  -- The Maoists must understand that they cannot win militarily and that the longer they avoid negotiations, the weaker their bargaining power will become.  This requires sustained military pressure on the Maoists, and concrete military successes by the Royal Nepal Army (RNA);  -- The Palace and the political parties must put aside their differences, and present a united front to the Maoists;  -- Development is one means of overcoming the Maoist threat. Kathmandu should \"hitch itself\" to India's economy in order to promote economic growth.  According to Indian media reports, Saran also argued that Nepalese mistrust of India is misplaced and that Nepal should view India as an ally in the fight against the Maoists.  A December 6 \"Hindustan Times\" article reported that Saran urged the inclusion of \"progressive\" Maoists into the mainstream.  4.  (C) Conference participants included journalists and academics from India, as well as representatives from major Nepalese political parties, including the UML and Nepali Congress Party.  \"Foreign participants\" were not allowed to attend.  King Still Expected in New Delhi --------------------------------  5.  (C) Although the dates have yet to be finalized, the MEA still expects a visit of King Gyanendra to New Delhi, probably sometime in the latter half of December.  Mahawar speculated that the GOI would emphasize the need for unity between the Palace and the political parties, further encourage the King not to undermine the Prime Minister, and highlight the need for Nepalese security forces to be more effective against the Maoists.  It would be \"regressive\" if the King weakened PM Deuba's authority, he observed, arguing that a change in PM would only exacerbate the situation.  6.  (C) The King's expected visit comes against a growing feeling in New Delhi-based non-governmental circles that PM Deuba's days are numbered.  According to Jawaharlal Nehru University Professor SD Muni, Deuba's removal is \"inevitable.\"  He predicted that Deuba would not be removed from office until after the January 13th deadline for the Maoists to come to the negotiating table, and speculated that Deuba set the deadline to buy himself time.  The MEA's Mahawar also noted a high degree of skepticism surrounding the King's intentions toward Deuba by participants in the track-II conference.  Police Training In Progress ---------------------------  7.  (C) Offering an update on Nepal's police training project in Hyderabad (reftel), Mahawar reported that the first batch of 160 officers had graduated from the program on December 2, after ten weeks of training.  The second batch of 300 officers is scheduled to begin training the third week of December, he said.  Once the second batch graduates, the GOI will evaluate the program before deciding whether to continue the project, now in its pilot phase.  Working Together to Strengthen the Border -----------------------------------------  8.  (C) Echoing more senior Indian officials, Mahawar expressed concern about the recent creation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) -- formed from the merger anti-India People's War Group and Maoist Communist Centre -- alleging that Nepalese Maoists had facilitated the merger.  He underlined GOI concerns over organizations such as the Coordinating Committee of Maoists Partners and Organizations in South Asia (CCOMPOSA), that promote links between insurgent factions, and claimed that nearly one-fourth of the country is affected by such groups.  Seventy-five districts are \"severely affected,\" he stated, adding that both India and Nepal were deploying troops to \"sensitive areas\" along the border in an effort to strengthen security there.

Blake, Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1. (C) Following up discussion at the recent US-India Strategic Stability Dialogue (reftel), the GOI has conveyed a December 8 letter (full text para 2) from Foreign Secretary Saran to Undersecretary Grossman formally requesting a classified briefing on the Patriot PAC-2 missile system.  The decision to move ahead on this initiative was clearly timed with a view to the impending visit of SECDEF Rumsfeld. However, it also reflects a prolonged debate within the Congress government over missile defense policy, and the GOI conclusion that deeper US-India collaboration in this area would help to strengthen our new partnership and would advance India's broader security interests.  Against this background, mission requests DTSA assistance in scheduling a classified briefing as early as possible in 2005.  2. (U) Begin text GOI letter:  Dear Mr. Undersecretary,  I refer to your letter dated October 1, 2004 offering India the opportunity to purchase Patriot Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2) missile defense capability as part of the reciprocal steps contemplated in Phase 1 of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership.  In order to evaluate the proposal, concerned Indian experts would be interested in receiving a classified briefing on the PAC-2.  An early US Government response in that regard would allow the ongoing strategic dialogue and NSSP-II discussions to proceed forward.  With assurances of the highest consideration.

(C) Summary: The December 7-8 talks in New Delhi on beginning a bus service between the two parts of Kashmir made no progress after the governments failed to break the impasse over documentation and modalities for crossing the LOC.  Each side offered what they termed compromise solutions, but none were mutually acceptable.  Demonstrating continued political-level commitment to Indo-Pak rapprochement, the GOI embraced a proposal for LOC-crossing certificates that first surfaced in the Track-II \"Neemrana\" dialogue.  Commenting that India favored opening the road largely for economic reasons, a member of the GOI delegation told D/Polcouns that it became evident during the meeting that Islamabad would not agree to any mechanism that could allow the LOC to become a de facto border.  The December 2-3 meeting on the proposed Munnabao-Khokhrapar train connection was only slightly more successful, in that both sides agreed to open links, but not on a timeframe to do so.  New Delhi complains that Islamabad is demanding unnecessary infrastructure changes that will drag out the rail link for at least three years, and cites this as evidence of GOP opposition to people-to-people links.  Five working-level sessions remain before the two Foreign Secretaries meet in Islamabad on December 27-28 to review  SIPDIS Round 2 of Composite Dialogue talks.  End Summary.  Deadlocked by Document Dispute ------------------------------  2.  (C) Despite recent public comments by NSA Dixit and Foreign Ministers Natwar Singh and Kasuri that the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service would start \"soon,\" observers in New Delhi were not surprised when the December 7-8 talks in New Delhi on the technical aspects of such a service failed to yield results over documents required for crossing the LOC (reftel).  The GOI dropped its past insistence for visas, suggesting instead a separate entry certificate issued by the respective High Commissions, but wanted passports as a form of identification for issuance of this document.  New Delhi also conceded that the entry permit, and not the passport, would be stamped at crossing, and also offered that the permits could be issued at stations set up in J&K to remove the hardship of Kashmiris having to journey to New Delhi for documentation.  The Pakistanis responded that the use of passports for identification was inconsistent with their characterization of Kashmir as a \"disputed territory\" and insisted (according to the Indian government) that this service be available only to \"Kashmiris\" (without elaborating how to define this population).  No date was set for resumption of talks on this issue although we expect it to be addressed in the next session of the Dixit-Aziz \"back-channel.\"  3.  (C) J&K Resident Commissioner Parvez Dewan (protect) told D/Polcouns on December 8 that the meeting was cordial and friendly, but observed that Pakistan had made no comparable compromises.  The sides met for about two hours on December 7, and for only a few minutes on December 8, on the grounds that it made no sense to resume talks given the impasse.  He said Islamabad had refused to accept the use of any passports at all, because that would endow the LOC with the legal status of a border, which Pakistan adamantly opposes. Commenting that India was eager to open the road for economic reasons, Dewan called Pakistani proposals to use UN documents as in the case of Cyprus and Red Cross certificates as in the case of Korea \"unacceptable.\"  The Pakistani High Commission confirmed to us that the GOI turned down these two models -- as well as a restoration of the pre-1953 \"Rahdari\" system by which travelers used documents issued by local officials on both sides of the LOC -- as \"not applicable in the context of J&K.\"  All-Parties Hurriyat Conference leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told us December 8 that he was partial to the Rahdari system. 4.  (C) Indian media were quick to claim that the GOP came to New Delhi intending to keep the discussion \"political\" as opposed to \"technical.\"  Journalists noted that three of the four members of the Pakistani delegation were from the Foreign Ministry, while their nine Indian interlocutors were led by a Joint Secretary in the Transport Ministry and included members from the Foreign and Home Ministries and the J&K government, which suggested the GOI was prepared to address specific details.  Who Travels on Which Transport Company --------------------------------------  5.  (C) Discussion further bogged down over who would be permitted to travel on the bus.  New Delhi sought to treat the service as any other public conveyance and allow all Indian citizens access, which would reinforce its position on passports as identity documents.  Islamabad, in contrast, wanted the bus to carry only residents of Kashmir.  The prospect of non-Kashmiris crossing the LOC raised the likelihood that passports, and not documents issued in Kashmir, would be required.  Dewan added that Islamabad called for a national bus company to be the carrier, because it did not wish the J&K Road Transport Company to travel between the two sides, commenting that this was impossible, because all of India's bus companies are state level.  This was only one of the \"red herrings\" the Pakistani delegation introduced into the talks, he stated.  (The current Delhi-Lahore bus is operated by the respective state transport companies.)  Infrastructure Problems Also Remain -----------------------------------  6.  (U) Analysts pointed out that even if an agreement on the political and technical aspects of the bus service were hammered out, it would take months to refurbish the currently unused road that transits the LOC.  Laborers are reportedly working overtime to complete repairs to the Indian side of the road, which even military vehicles cannot currently traverse.  Meanwhile, the bridge that actually crosses the LOC faces at least four months of repair work, and its location straddling the LOC will undoubtedly complicate the process, according to J&K-based journalists.  Other Roads Won't Open ----------------------  7.  (C) The lack of agreement over travel documents continues the impasse over what could become a network of cross-LOC transport connections.  In recent weeks the GOI has proposed buses running Kargil-Skardu, Poonch-Mirpur, and Jammu-Sialkot routes, but the deadlock over documents will hamstring progress on all these CBMs.  Side Proposal for Kashmiris Floated -----------------------------------  8.  (C) Separately, \"Asian Age\" reported on December 7 that the GOI had put forward an idea for designated points along the LOC where divided Kashmiri families could meet on a regular schedule.  This would be a marked improvement over the current practice of families arriving at their respective sides of the LOC and calling to each other from across a river or check-point.  Proposed Train Link Gathering a Little Steam --------------------------------------------  9.  (C) The December 2-3 talks in Islamabad on the proposed Munnabao-Khokhrapar rail link connecting Rajasthan and Sindh were more successful, with the delegations announcing on December 3 that they had agreed to an \"early resumption of the rail link\" and to replace and refurbish the rail infrastructure.  The agreement remained hampered, however, by Islamabad's estimate of \"two to three years\" to lay new gauge track to accommodate such rail service.  This represented a significant delay over Natwar Singh's recent pronouncement that this southern Indo-Pak land crossing could commence business by October 2005 -- which the GOI says would be possible if the two sides stuck to the current meter gauge system.  Remaining Composite Dialogue Discussions ----------------------------------------  10.  (U) The below schedule for the remaining meetings in Round 2 of the Composite Dialogue reflects the rescheduling of the anti-narcotics and Foreign Secretaries meetings:  December 9-10 (New Delhi): Meeting of the Committee of Experts regarding trade issues.  December 13-14 (New Delhi): Meetings between narcotics control authorities.  December 14-15 (Karachi): Joint survey of the boundary pillars in the horizontal section of the Sir Creek area.  December 14-15 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on nuclear CBMs, including discussion on a draft agreement for prior notification of missile tests.  December 15-16 (Islamabad): Expert-level meeting on conventional CBMs.  December 27-28 (Islamabad): Foreign Secretaries meeting to review issues discussed this month and to set a schedule for another round of talks, possibly to begin in February 2005.  Comment -------  11.  (C) As NSA Dixit confirmed to the Ambassador on December 7 (reftel), PM Manmohan Singh remains personally committed to opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, but it will not become a reality until both sides climb down further from their positions.  This will require engagement at the political level on both sides, although there are voices in the GOI that are calling for India now to call Pakistan's bluff and agree to its demands.  The MEA, in particular, is concerned that Islamabad opposes new connections between the two sides of Kashmir because this would tend to deflate the jihadist movement.  The issue of bus and rail service may arise again at the December 27-28 Foreign Secretaries talks in Islamabad or in the Dixit-Aziz back-channel, but the enduring deadlock over documents for cross-LOC travel is inextricably linked to each nation's views on Kashmir, and compromise will be difficult.  This will delay further the large number of Kashmiris who wish to travel across the LOC for family, tourism, and economic reasons.  12.  (C) As the Composite Dialogue continues, it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that Pakistan is holding concrete progress on important CBMs hostage to Indian concessions on Kashmir.  Atmospherics in India remain remarkably positive, but the intrinsically zero-sum nature of Kashmir is preventing the CD from living up to its potential to build new constituencies for peace and reduce the risk of renewed crisis.

NEW DELHI 7348      B. NEW DELHI 981  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: Israeli Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's December 5-10 visit to India was \"extremely positive\" and provided an opportunity to expand the bilateral relationship beyond defense, Israel Embassy DCM Yoed Magen told A/PolCouns and Poloff on December 16.  The visit, the first high-level exchange between India and Israel since the UPA government assumed power in May, was a welcome improvement over the poor foreign office consultations that took place in November. Even FM Natwar Singh emphasized the importance of ties with Jerusalem, a reflection of the growing consensus within the GOI about the utility of good relations with Israel.  Magen said the successful Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group, held just prior to Olmert's visit, highlighted the countries' mutual concerns and helped recover the momentum lost after the foreign office consultations.  Israel raised its concerns about Iran, prompting NSA Dixit to acknowledge that India faces a \"real dilemma,\" given New Delhi's good relations with Iran and Tehran's nuclear ambitions.  If the November India-Israel foreign office consultations demonstrated the sometimes opposing views at work within the GOI on relations with Israel, the Vice PM's visit illustrated solid support for them at the Ministerial level.  End Summary.  Many Ministers But No PM ------------------------  2.  (C) Offering a readout of the first high-level exchange between India and Israel since the UPA government assumed power, Israel Embassy DCM Yoed Magen (protect throughout) told A/PolCouns and Poloff that the December 5-10 visit of Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was a significant improvement over the \"uncomfortable\" foreign office consultations held in November (Ref A).  Signaling New Delhi's intent to strengthen ties with Israel, Olmert received meetings with seven ministers, including FM Natwar Singh, Finance Minister Chidambaram, and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath, as well as the Ministers of Agriculture, Science and Technology, and the Ministers of State for Communications and Information Technology, and the Prime Minister's Office.  3.  (C) PM Manmohan Singh declined to meet with the delegation, despite former PM Vajpayee's meeting with Deputy PM Silvan Shalom (of lower rank than Olmert) in February (Ref B).  Magen opined that a meeting with the PM would have publicly signaled a \"close degree of intimacy\" with Israel, something the GOI may prefer to keep private.  Reflecting the economic focus of the visit, representatives from over 50 Israeli companies also participated in the trip and traveled to Bangalore, Mumbai, and New Delhi, and held hundreds of meetings with Indian business people.  Natwar's Friendly Gesture -------------------------  4.  (C) According to Magen, Olmert had an \"excellent\" discussion with FM Natwar Singh, a stark contrast to the \"disappointing\" foreign office consultations held at the Secretary level in November.  He speculated that the meeting  SIPDIS was the first time Natwar had ever been exposed to Israeli policy directly from a senior Israeli official, calling the conversation an \"extremely important step in building confidence between the two countries.\"  He said that Natwar and Olmert \"had good chemistry\" during the meetings, and the FM unexpectedly appeared at a dinner in honor of the Israeli delegation, \"as a friendly gesture and to reassure Israel of the importance India attaches to relations.\"  Natwar emphasized that Israel was important to him, \"despite what people say,\" Magen stated, adding that he heard Natwar had excused himself from a cabinet meeting in order to attend the dinner.  Commenting on the evolution of Natwar's thinking, Magen noted that the FM did not mention the Non-Aligned Movement once during his November 6 speech at a \"Hindustan Times\" conference or in his recent remarks before Parliament.  5.  (C) As an emerging global power, India does not want to be absent from developments in the Middle East, Magen observed, noting that New Delhi has been demonstrating a greater interest in the region.  In 1991 when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process began, India had no role because New Delhi did not have diplomatic relations with Jerusalem.  The GOI, including NSA Dixit and PM Manmohan Singh, now recognize the \"ground reality\" there, he argued, adding that either Defense Minister Mukherjee or FM Natwar Singh would likely visit Israel in the coming months.  Counter Terrorism: \"On Safe Ground\" -----------------------------------  6.  (C) Offering a readout of the December 1 India-Israel Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group (CTJWG), Magen told us the event \"helped bring the relationship back on course.\" Led by Israeli Deputy Director for Strategic Affairs Jeremy Issacharoff, the CTJWG underlined the two countries similar concerns and approach to terrorism and terrorist financing. The Israelis felt so comfortable discussing counter terrorism with India that \"we felt that we were on safe ground,\" he remarked.  Iran ----  7.  (C) Issacharoff raised Israeli concerns about Iran \"very sharply\" with New Delhi during the CTJWG, Magen remarked, adding that Olmert's delegation also flagged nuclear-related concerns and Iran's negative role in the Middle East peace process.  The Israelis argued that Iran's influence in the occupied territories deters progress, stressing that \"whatever happens in the Middle East will affect India.\"  NSA Dixit reportedly told Issacharoff that India faces a \"real dilemma\" because \"we have good relations with Iran, but the nuclear issue is a problem.\"  Magen said Dixit had said that he was blunt during his mid-October visit to Tehran, telling the Iranians to honor their international commitments (to the Non-Proliferation Treaty) or \"pay the consequences.\"  Beyond Defense --------------  8.  (C) Magen noted that a major objective of Olmert's visit had been to diversify relations beyond defense, to include cooperation in economic, hi-tech, biotechnology, and agricultural areas.  The two countries agreed to establish a joint study group to formulate a comprehensive economic partnership, and signed an agreement with the Ministry of Finance that would set up a mechanism to guarantee Israeli investments (comparable to the USG's OPIC).  He commented that Israel had raised the issue last year, but the GOI had not been interested.  Finance Minister P Chidambaram approved the agreement during the visit, a move that surprised Magen.  Comment -------  9.  (C) If the November India-Israel foreign office consultations demonstrated the sometimes opposing views at work within the GOI on relations with Israel, the Vice Prime Minister's visit illustrated solid support for them at the Ministerial level.  While India may not want to publicize its ties with Jerusalem (evidenced by the PM's refusal to meet with the delegation), neither does it want to slow the pace of bilateral engagement.  India will likely continue to enhance its ties to Israel, while maintaining a low public profile. MULFORD " }

Summary:  This is another of our periodic messages summarizing public statements by MEA Spokesman Navtej Sarna and other MEA officials.  Here we report Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi's and Slovak President Gasparovic's visits to India, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's trip to South Korea and the December 21 meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on External Affairs.  End Summary  Premier Badawi visits India ---------------------------  2.  From December 20-25 Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi visited India.  The trip resulted in business agreements on IT, biotechnology and satellite systems.  On December 21, the GOI announced a deal between the Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) Antrix Corporation and MEASAT Global to form a joint venture.  The two companies plan to pool their capacity to create a \"satellite neighborhood.\"  PM Badawi also traveled to Bangalore, which included a stop at Hindustan Aeronautics, Ltd. (HAL).  The MEA emphasized Malaysia's ASEAN membership, noting that the country is India's largest trading partner in the association.  Slovak President Visits India -----------------------------  3.  President Ivan Gasparovic paid a five-day visit to India from December 11, during which the two countries signed an Economic Cooperation Agreement.  While not explicitly indicating Slovakian support for India's objective of obtaining a permanent seat on the UNSC, the MEA announced that Gasparovic was \"of the view that India's permanent presence.in an expanded UN Security Council would give it greater legitimacy and enhance its effectiveness.\"  Neighborhood Review -------------------  4.  On December 21 FM Singh met the Parliament's External Affairs Consultative Committee to review India's relations with the SAARC member countries and Burma.  According to MEA Spokesman Sarna, the discussion also addressed New Delhi's plan for the January 2005 SAARC Summit in Dhaka.  --Nepal: there is a need to improve infrastructure along the border, including an integrated system of checkposts, the Maoists are a \"shared security concern,\" and discussions are ongoing for extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties.  --Bhutan: the Chukha and Kurichu power projects and the 1020 MW Tala Hydron project should be completed shortly, and the Bhutanese King will be the Chief Guest for Republic Day on January 26, 2005.  --Bangladesh: the GOI would like the BDG to address New Delhi's security concerns, and increasingly, Indian businesses are interested in investing in Bangladesh.  --Burma: the country has \"direct bearing\" on security and development in India's Northeast, and the GOI will pursue \"constructive engagement\" with Rangoon.  Burma is an important link between India and ASEAN.  --Sri Lanka: the economic relationship is a \"model\" among India's neighbors and Colombo supports India for a permanent UNSC seat.  --Pakistan: the atmosphere has improved and New Delhi will follow a \"conscious people-centric\" policy which will lead to an improved understanding of India's position.  FM Singh in Seoul -----------------  5. December 13-16 FM Singh traveled to Korea to discuss the bilateral security dialogue, which will begin in January 2005, and to finalize an MOU on defense cooperation. According to the MEA, Korean officials \"commended the Indian initiative on the vision of an Asian Economic Community.\"  6.  The MEA's Sarna noted that media reports suggesting that while in Seoul the Foreign Minister had called India's 1998 nuclear test \"regrettable,\" were a distortion of the facts. The Spokesman emphasized that FM Singh had said that the 1998 test was the previous government's decision and that although India is not a party to the NPT, which is discriminatory, those countries that are should honor their commitments.

(C) Summary:  MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar reiterated GOI desire to assist in Iraq's elections, but expressed uncertainty about India's role in light of their own political constraints in a meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff on December 29.  Regarding the proposed role of the International Mission for Iraq Elections (IMIE), he was uncertain that was the niche India should fill and was concerned that some of the other states involved in the IMIE (especially Canada) did not share India's sympathetic view of US efforts in Iraq.  He promised to raise the issue with Foreign Secretary Saran upon Saran's return from Pakistan.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Jaishankar (who has played a leading role on Iraqi elections as part of his Americas portfolio) indicated that India was concerned about tying its role in Iraq to that of other governments.  In this context, he noted considerable skepticism about the January elections during New Delhi's consultations in Ottawa recently, commenting that India found itself in the ironic role of \"defending the US position\" to Ottawa.  3.  (C) He went on to reiterate the GOI's strong desire to play a useful role in the elections in a manner that their domestic constituency would support in the aftermath of the kidnapping of three Indian truck drivers in Iraq in the summer.  He also expressed frustration that there has been no UN response to India's previous proposals for assisting in the elections, lamenting that \"our proposals are being sat on in New York.\"  4.  (C) Regarding PolCouns' description of the role of the IMIE to observe the polling process from Jordan (reftel), however, Jaishankar was doubtful that India would participate, saying, \"We're not sure that is the niche we should be filling.\"  \"We're looking for middle ground between what is acceptable here and what is realistic and useful there,\" he added.   He promised to raise the issue with FS Saran upon Saran's return from travel, and reiterated India's intention to re-engage in Iraq.  5.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. MULFORD " }

(U) In what was billed by the MEA as an important policy speech, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran set forth India's \"preliminary\" views of the High Level Panel Report on UN Reform in a December 30 address.  Prior to Saran's speech, MEA Joint Secretary (UN Political) BS Prakash advised us to pay close attention to the remarks as they would offer the \"authoritative\" GOI view on the Panel Report.  During his speech to prominent members of the New Delhi foreign policy community, including former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey, MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar, and High-Level Panel member General Satish Nambiar, Saran emphasized:  -- The UN must realign its priorities with those of the developing world if it is to retain its relevance.  It should safeguard the interests of developing countries instead of taking punitive actions against them.  -- The international order is not democratic enough because it does not adequately reflect the views of developing countries, which constitute most of the world's population.  -- Multilateralism is the mechanism through which democracies can function.  Citing the recent tsunami as an example, he said that today's collective challenges require a collective response.  -- The UN needs its own budget so that it can act independently.  Most UN activities are funded by donors, rather than from the UN budget, giving donor countries a disproportionate influence over UN priorities.  -- The Panel Report did not focus enough on disarmament.  The Chemical Weapons Convention could be used as a model to eliminate nuclear weapons.  -- The UN is not the only vehicle to deal with issues of international security.  The international community can also use bilateral and regional mechanisms (where appropriate) to resolve problems.  -- The international community should deal with crises in a democratic way, \"without intervention.\"  -- Criticizing \"political expediency,\" Saran said the current international system is too focused on punishing the recipients of nuclear proliferation and not focused enough on the sources of proliferation.  2.  (U) Saran downplayed the issue of Security Council expansion, never once even mentioning the word \"veto.\"  He reiterated previous GOI comments that India views Security Council expansion as only one part of broader UN reform.  Comment -------  3.  (C) Saran's reticence on the mechanics of Security Council expansion, along with conflicting signals from other GOI officials on the subject (reftel), suggest a continued lack of consensus in New Delhi on whether India would be prepared to accept a Security Council seat without a veto. The internal GOI line is highly pragmatic, but Indian public opinion is unprepared to accept what many would see as second-class status.  Saran's emphasis on the need to deal with the sources of nuclear proliferation, echoes comments in our recent non-proliferation dialogue and reflects the GOI view that the international community has not satisfactorily dealt with A Q Khan or Islamabad's alleged support for the network.

(C) Summary: Foreign Minister Natwar Singh publicly acknowledged during a December 22 Parliamentary debate with former FM Yashwant Sinha that India had agreed to non-diversion and end-use verification of US high technology imports, even when they come from a third country.  This is a clear sign that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government is serious about the India/US strategic partnership and the export control understandings attached to the Next Steps in the Strategic Partnership (NSSP).  The exchange received almost no press coverage in India, illustrating that interest in the NSSP process is largely confined to Indian elites.  End Summary.  2.  (U) On December 22, in the waning days of the Winter Session of Parliament, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh made a lengthy statement on India's foreign policy.  Singh noted that Indo/US relations \"have expanded across the board,\" and in this context observed that \"It was the UPA Government which concluded the long pending first phase of the NSSP.\" He detailed that \"the agreement makes US Licensing Policy and procedures both transparent and predictable.  End-use verification is a consultative process to be undertaken by mutual consent.  This is an agreement between equals.  It is reflective of the strategic partnership that the two countries wish to promote.  It is the first in a series of steps to build mutual confidence and trust, leading to progressively higher levels of interaction in high technology areas.\"  Former Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha jumped on this exchange regarding the NSSP to press the issue of third countries, leading FM Singh to acknowledge publicly for the first time that India was committed to end-use verification for American high technology items, whether imported directly from the US or from other countries.  3.  (U) Sinha noted to FM Singh that, \"I had raised a very specific issue about NSSP when I talked about end-use verification.  I am giving him an opportunity to contradict me that US origin items of dual use coming from third countries will not be subjected to end-use verification as US origin items coming directly from the US will.  This is not part of the agreement which had been reached in December, 2003.  There was no agreement with regard to end-use verification.\"  4.  (U) The Foreign Minister replied that, \"Under the NSSP, the US-origin items, whether directly supplied to us from the US or from any other source, will always be the basis of negotiations.  It would not have been tenable to exclude US-origin goods or technology merely because they were obtained from non-US sources.  We ourselves would not accept such a distinction with respect to Indian-made technology or sensitive goods such as our software.\"  5.  (C) MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar flagged this exchange in his meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff on December 30.  Jaishankar noted that FM Singh's line on end-use verification of US origin items imported from third countries was essentially the same as the policy of the previous NDA government, e.g., protection of US dual-use items is an extension of protection that the GOI seeks for Indian produced dual-use items.  This argument, however, seemed to \"thoroughly confound\" Sinha and effectively ended further discussion of the matter.  Jaishankar went on to recall that during his visit to the US in November, Commerce U/S Juster had inquired what the GOI response would be should this issue of non-diversion for goods from third countries become a matter of public debate.  Noting that his is the first time this issue has been raised in a public forum, Jaishankar reiterated that the GOI stands by its private commitment to respect end-use restrictions even for US origin dual-use items from third countries.  \"Our treatment of US items is the same as our treatment of Indian items,\" he concluded.  Comment -------  6.  (C) FM Singh's statement was the first time that the GOI publicly revealed the concessions it had made regarding end-use verification under the NSSP, and indicates that the UPA government is serious in upholding its NSSP obligations and pushing the India/US relationship to a new level.  It came as no surprise that former FM Sinha, who was privy to earlier rounds of NSSP negotiations, sought to use the non-diversion agreement to charge the UPA government with caving in to US demands.  Singh's statement received almost no press coverage in India, as public interest in the NSSP is largely confined to Indian elites and technical specialists, many of whom are still trying to understand the commitments attached to the NSSP.

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (U) Reflecting the very positive Indian reaction to the US initiative to create a Core Group for tsunami relief, and New Delhi's resolve to do even more to assist India's neighbors, on December 30 the MEA provided us with a further update on GOI support for Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Indonesia.  2.  (U) Sri Lanka  --The GOI has already supplied 35 tons of dry provisions, relief and medical supplies along with communications equipment, and several medical teams, including specialists, who have been attending to patients.  Indian aircraft have provided airlift capability to people and supplies, while crews have offered salvage support in clearing harbors, divers, and search and rescue sorties.  --Four Indian Navy vessels and seven helicopters had reached Sri Lanka by December 29.  The helicopters included three Mi-8 and four shipborne Chetaks.  --Two aircraft, one Dornier and one Islander, began operating from Colombo on December 30.  --On December 30, the GOI airlifted 700 kilograms more of medical supplies.  --The INS Sandhayak (reftel), after delivering its supplies, will be converted into a hospital ship.  --Three more Indian Navy vessels, the LCU 33, the INS Ghorpad, and the INS Kirch, are enroute to Sri Lanka with additional supplies of fuel, rice and water.  They are expected to arrive in Trincomalee between December 30 and January 1.  --Two IL 76 aircraft carrying military field hospitals are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on December 30.  3.  (U) Maldives  --Three Avros and one Dornier aircraft delivered six tons of supplies to the Maldives and are now in Male (reftel).  The Indian High Commissioner in Male has indicated that other than specific items such as water canisters, there is no need for further supplies.  --The INS Mysore (destroyer) and the INS Udaygiri (frigate) are in Male.  The ships have been used for transporting people and supplies to outlying islands, damage assessment, and search and rescue.  --The Indian Navy tanker, the INS Aditya, which is equipped with drinking water and a water purification plant, arrived in the Maldives on December 30.  The INS Aditya also has a helicopter.  --The four helicopters from the three ships have flown seven sorties.  4.  (U) Indonesia  --A survey ship, the INS Nirupak, is scheduled to leave shortly for Aceh with relief supplies, medicine and tents. Cruising time to Aceh is about 100 hours.  5.  (C) In a late December 29 conversation with PolCouns, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar said that India fully supports and welcomes the formation of the Core Group for tsunami relief, but reiterated that assistance is not needed within India.  He noted that the GOI has briefed the other Core Group members on aid New Delhi has already provided, adding that India would like to do more, but needs information on specific needs.  Jaishankar asked that when moving US forces into the Indian region, that PACOM recognize that the Indian military is stretched thin, limiting the GOI ability to provide operational support to others.  He said the GOI's foreign relief effort will be run out of the Ministry of External Affairs, and emphasized India's commitment to work closely with the US. MULFORD " }

(C) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary Saran expressed satisfaction at the US-India  SIPDIS partnership in responding to the December 26 Bay of Bengal tsunami, and offered his understanding that the core group --  SIPDIS having effectively triggered a robust response from the UN and others in the international community -- would now move into a different phase with fewer daily teleconferences.  2. (C) Providing some context for his January 1 phone call to Undersecretary Grossman, Saran explained that India was surprised by press reports of comments attributed to the US Ambassador in Colombo referring to the imminent arrival in Sri Lanka of a very large US Marine contingent.  He raised this at the political level only because it was not consistent with information shared in core group channels. \"We are not saying this is our backyard so you need to stay out,\" Saran elaborated.  However, given the large number of Indian forces already in Sri Lanka (which he put at 1,200, plus multiple ships and aircraft), it is important for New Delhi to be aware of US military planning.  In this context, Saran welcomed the US military briefing that DAO provided earlier that day to the Indian armed forces.  3. (C) Contrary to reports appearing in the Sri Lankan press (now repeated in Indian media) Saran did not convey any sense of unease about the US military presence in India's neighborhood.  To the contrary, he expressed great appreciation for India's involvement in the tsunami core group and the recognition that implied of the GOI's contribution to reconstruction and recovery in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  He added that the daily teleconference was \"an extremely useful exercise.\"  He was gracious in acknowledging the United States' early statement of sympathy and support for the Indian victims of the tsunami.  4. (C) The Ambassador flagged the US military interest in developing further channels of US-India information sharing in the Bay of Bengal region.  Saran agreed this would be useful, noted that Indian Ambassadors in the region have been instructed to reach out to US counterparts, and indicated that the Indian defense attache in Bangkok had been tasked to \"look into coordination with the USJTF\" at Utapao.  With USAID efforts now turning to the question of long term reconstruction, the Ambassador suggested that this too would be a mutually beneficial area of US-India information sharing.  Saran did not respond specifically, but did note the GOI expectation that the UN will play an increasingly prominent role as the focus turns from Tsunami relief to long-term reconstruction in the Bay of Bengal region.  5.

(C) Indian readouts track closely with Islamabad's detailed and generally positive assessment of the December 27-28 meeting of Foreign Secretaries that concluded the second round of the Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue (reftel).  In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary Saran remarked on the \"excellent atmosphere\" of the December meeting, adding that the Islamabad talks were \"absolutely free of acrimony\" and \"very friendly.\"  Although Saran sensed continued ambivalence on the Pakistani side about the relative priority of confidence building and Kashmir within the Composite Dialogue, he took encouragement from the fact that the two sides agreed on a series of steps forward.  2. (C) Enumerating specific deliverables from the December meetings, Saran flagged the following:  -- commitment to the immediate consular notification of civilian detainees which will avoid the current situation in which official notification is not provided and citizenship is not confirmed until the indictment phase of criminal proceedings;  -- agreement on the informal \"push back\" of Kashmiris, especially children, who wander across the LOC.  This will be accomplished without any kind of legal delay;  -- an accord for regular meetings of local military commanders along the LOC;  -- conclusion of a calendar for official meetings that will run through August/September 2005;  -- Pakistan's proposal to open up religious shrines (which Saran lauded as \"an important development\");  -- and \"progress\" on pre-notification of missile tests. Saran said the two sides \"narrowed differences considerably\" and should be able to sign a final agreement in \"one or a few\" more rounds.  3. (C) Saran was similarly upbeat about his meetings with Foreign Minister Kasuri and  Prime Minister Aziz.  Asked about transit rights to Afghanistan, Saran reported that the issue came up in the context of the Iran gas pipeline. Responding to Prime Minister Aziz's point about the economic benefits of the pipeline, Saran observed that all these arguments also apply to other goods that could be moved through Pakistan to/from Afghanistan.  Saran also noted Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyer's invitation to his Pakistani counterpart for talks in New Delhi on energy trade, and indicated that he had urged Islamabad to respond favorably to this Indian proposal.  4. (C) Comment: Saran referred briefly to the January 3 death of NSA (and back channel envoy) JN Dixit -- warning this would leave a \"gaping hole\" in India's foreign policy line-up.  Although Indo-Pak relations are too important in Indian domestic politics to be controlled by any single individual, Dixit's passing cannot help the process of rapprochement.  With this fact in mind, septel will offer a more detailed MEA assessment of where the Composite Dialogue process now stands. End Comment. MULFORD " }

(SBU) Summary: Responding to requests for US Congressional travel to tsunami-devastated areas of South India, Foreign Secretary Saran expressed gratitude on January 3 for the many expressions of condolence and support, but asked that US Codels not/not travel to South India.  Saran, who is India's representative in the Tsunami Core Group, noted that PM Manmohan Singh chose not to visit the affected areas directly, opting instead for an overflight of the sites, on the grounds that VIP visits would hinder relief efforts.  The PM has also instructed all Ministers to avoid travel or overflights of the affected regions and to prohibit Indian VIP visits to the impacted areas.  On top of these GOI views, India has emphasized its determination to deal with the effects of the tsunami through its own resources and to lend its resources to its neighboring countries. Transportation to affected areas would also pose major difficulties. If we seek to arrange site visits, we may find an unwillingness on the part of Indian authorities to give clearance and support for foreign VIP visits.  Local press reports have strongly criticized \"disaster tourism\" by Indian government officials, and high-level visits from the US could generate similar headlines.  Should Congressional visitors decide to travel to South India, we would attempt to provide whatever support is required for a successful visit. But our best advice is to avoid such travel in deference to the strong views expressed by the Government of India's leadership.  End Summary.  GOI Strongly Discourages VIP Travel to Tsunami Areas --------------------------------------------- -------  2.  (SBU) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary Saran indicated that the PM had directed all  SIPDIS Ministers and VIPs to avoid the tsunami-affected regions, and suggested that visiting US Codels receive an Indian military/interagency briefing on Indian relief activities in New Delhi, rather than traveling to Southern India.  Saran noted that every time a VIP visits the region, the local bureaucracy and security forces have to shift their focus from relief activities to visitor support.  He noted that VIP overflights would interrupt the airflow at a time when the Indian military is involved in intense operational activities.  In this context, he reiterated, India deeply appreciates the many expressions of condolence and support that it has received, but for now is asking that US Congressional visitors not/not travel to South India.  3.  (SBU) On January 2, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) Jaishankar offered a similar view, telling PolCouns that the GOI was \"strongly discouraging\" US Congressional travel to tsunami-damaged areas in India.  He noted that PM Manmohan  SIPDIS Singh had only flown over devastated areas so as not to hinder relief efforts there.  Jaishankar noted that this was \"non-discriminatory discouragement,\" as New Delhi is requesting that all VIP visitors, not just those from the US, forego travel to disaster areas.  A senior Congress Party MP also expressed GOI disapproval of VIP travel to the region, noting that such visits could fuel the growing political struggle between the UPA coalition at the Center and the NDA-affiliated government of Tamil Nadu (Reftel).  India: We Can Handle This Ourselves -----------------------------------  4.  (SBU) Through press reports and statements, the Indian government has emphasized its intention to deal with the effects of the tsunami through its own resources. Demonstrating this point, India has been providing relief aid to affected neighboring countries, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives, in addition to providing for its own population.  In so doing, the GOI has highlighted its role as an emerging global power, capable of meeting both its domestic needs and those of the region.  Major Logistical Difficulties -----------------------------  5.  (U) Codels Frist, Bingaman, Leach, and a possible Codel led by Senator Brownback, have all expressed an interest in touring disaster sites in South India.  Given the high number of proposed visitors, and the limited number of sites that have been affected, but are still reasonably accessible, the various Codels would probably visit the same areas multiple times.  This could provide a substantial drain on relief operations as government officials turn their attention to coordinating details of official US visits to the region.  6.  (U) South Indian and military airfields are currently operating at over-capacity in an attempt to provide relief to the survivors.  As a result, the government of Tamil Nadu is discouraging all foreign aircraft from landing in the state. While it might be possible to arrange milair transport to Chennai, air travel to the tsunami-affected areas is currently unavailable.  Congressional visitors would therefore have to drive approximately 6 hours (each way), along difficult roads to reach relief sites.  Ensuring that Congressional delegations have proper food, water, and transportation as they tour disaster areas will also pose a logistical challenge.  MULFORD " }

(SBU) Summary: India-wide, consular officers have amassed a database of 500 missing persons inquiries to which they are responding, but still have no reported Amcit casualties in India.  Mission engagement with the GOI on tsunami relief for India and the region continued with the Ambassador's January 3 meeting with Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and USAID's allocation of USD 3.1 million in relief.  The Ambassador will meet with local media on January 4 to highlight USG disaster assistance efforts and our partnership in the Core Group. The GOI has increased its aid to neighbors with two ships scheduled to arrive in Aceh, even as its own casualty figures climb.  End Summary.  Consular Outreach -----------------  2.  (U) There are still no reported Amcit casualties in India, but consular officers are processing about 500 inquiries on people who are possibly missing.  Consular New Delhi has been coordinating the response India-wide, referring calls to ConGen Chennai or ConGen Calcutta as necessary.  The Mission has created a database of Task Force calls as well as emails to ensure that each inquiry receives a response daily.  Consular New Delhi has an officer each in Thailand and Colombo supporting those missions' operations.  US Assistance for India -----------------------  3.  (U) Through January 3, USAID India has provided more than USD 1.5 million in assistance to India.  This includes:  --USD 50,000 for the Prime Minister's Relief Fund to be spent at the GOI's discretion; --USD 50,000 to the Indian Red Cross for non-food and non-medical emergency relief; --USD 650,000 to CARE India for clean water and sanitation services; and --USD 750,000 to Catholic Relief Services for clean water and sanitation services.  An additional USD 1.6 million will soon be programmed following the approval of proposals.  As of January 2, 3 DART members have been dispatched to India.  Ambassador Meets Foreign Secretary Saran ----------------------------------------  4.  (SBU) In a January 3 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran indicated that the PM had directed all  SIPDIS VIPs to avoid the tsunami-affected regions, and suggested that visiting US Codels receive an Indian military/interagency briefing on Indian relief activities in New Delhi, rather than travel into Southern India.  Saran noted that to support a VIP visit, the local bureaucracy has to shift its focus from relief activities, and that even VIP overflights would be disruptive to the Indian military's intense operational activities.  While local media reported alleged Indian \"anger\" over Colombo's decision to accept US troops without consulting New Delhi, Saran expressed appreciation for the January 3 briefing on relief in the region that DAO provided to Indian defense staff.  (Reftel provides fuller details.)  Indian Casualties -----------------  5.  (SBU) The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that through January 2, 9,451 Indians had died while 5,511 were missing, compared to 8,955 and 3,754, respectively, 24 hours earlier. USAID India believes these figures are low, for example, ConGen Calcutta's economics specialist has estimated six to seven thousand are missing in the hard hit Andaman and Nicobar Islands alone.  Relief for the Neighbors ------------------------ 6.  (U) On January 3, Ministry of Defense officials briefed DAO on India's relief operations for Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia.  The GOI expects the survey ship Nirupak, which has been outfitted as a 46 bed hospital, and the stealth frigate Khukri to arrive in Aceh early on January 4.  The Indian Navy now has three ships in the Maldives with the addition of the INS Sagar, and four ships and some 1,200 men in Sri Lanka.  Upcoming: Ambassador's Press Conference ---------------------------------------  7.  (U)  On the afternoon of January 4, the Ambassador will meet with Indian foreign affairs correspondents to discuss the tsunami, its aftermath, and what the USG is doing to assist the affected nations.

Blake, Jr., Reasons 1 .4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  Despite changes in key USG interlocutors, the GOI hopes to preserve momentum on high-tech trade and other cooperation under the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) umbrella and is looking to Washington for similar signals.  In a December 29 meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar outlined an ambitious agenda for the High Tech Cooperation Group (HTCG) focusing on private sector initiatives over the next six months while Commerce U/S Juster's replacement is identified and confirmed.  He also suggested the NSSP Implementation Group meet in early February to take advantage of US officials coming to India for other events.  Jaishankar underscored the need to expand US-India nuclear cooperation in order to build scientific support for the NSSP process and maintain progress on other NSSP benchmarks.  MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar echoed these points on January 4,  SIPDIS suggesting that US-India cooperation in new areas of nuclear research (she mentioned the ITER fusion project) could be an important catalyst to Indian scientific support for the NSSP quid-pro-quos.  End Summary.  High-Level High Tech Events in the Works ----------------------------------------  2.  (C) In an December 29 meeting focused on next steps in the US-India strategic relationship, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar emphasized the GOI intention to sustain the positive momentum created by our agreement on Phase 1 of the NSSP.  Noting the potential convergence of key HTCG and NSSP players in India in February for AeroIndia and an international life sciences conference, PolCouns asked about GOI plans for leveraging these events.  Noting the GOI expectation that it could take several months to nominate and confirm a successor for Commerce Undersecretary Juster, Jaishankar suggested that we should focus the next few months on the private sector side of the HTCG.  He indicated, for instance, that an informal meeting of the HTCG defense subcommittee could happen on the margins of AeroIndia, adding that he had already recommended such an event to the Ministry of Defense, although the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) would host it.  He likewise expressed interest in mobilizing a private sector event in the area of life sciences hosted by the Ministry of Science's Secretary for Biotech.  Need for New Ideas on Nuclear Cooperation to Keep NSSP Moving --------------------------------------------- ----------------  3.  (C) Noting the upcoming visit to India of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Merrifield, PolCouns suggested this would be a good opportunity to rebut concern among the Indian scientific establishment about limited cooperation on nuclear issues under the NSSP.  As the first among equals in the Indian scientific establishment, Jaishankar explained, Department of Atomic Energy chairman Kakodkar has the ability to set the tone for other agencies. If he feels that India's nuclear sector will not benefit from the NSSP, Jaishankar continued, Kakodkar could retard progress in the other areas of NSSP cooperation (export controls, defense research and space).  With this in mind, Jaishankar appealed for a more liberal interpretation of nuclear safety collaboration in Phase II, noting that this issue was also raised in the November meeting between Foreign Secretary Saran and NSA Rice.  SIPDIS  4. (C) Jaishankar remarked on the sense among some in the GOI that India's desires for expanding cooperation with the US on nuclear safety are being \"brushed off\" by the Department, as well as general skepticism that progress on the later phases of the NSSP will be hampered by \"nit-picky\" lawyers.  \"We should be picking up momentum right now, not just cruising along,\" Jaishankar stated.  Echoing U/S Juster, PolCouns argued that \"progress begets progress,\" and urged that the Indian side to avoid creating the impression that New Delhi was trying to renegotiate the NSSP, but rather take tangible steps to implement it.  Jaishanker nodded his head in agreement, but also flagged the political problem he faces from the Indian nuclear establishment.  5. (C) We heard a similar message in a January 4 meeting with our other key NSSP interlocutor, MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar.  Responding to PolCouns' description of the Washington desire to maintain forward momentum on the NSSP, Shankar warned that the Indian nuclear establishment had become a real obstacle to steps such as NSG adherence and stronger export controls.  The scientific community, she claimed, believes that nothing has really changed in our nuclear relationship, and uses this view to argue that India should not change its own policies.  This dynamic, she continued, helps to explain the strong GOI push for a more flexible US interpretation of matters such as the NSG safety exception.  Responding to PolCouns warning that some areas of nuclear cooperation will remain \"a bridge too far,\" she suggested that cooperation in areas not restricted by the NSG lists might help to change the view of NSSP among India's atomic establishment.  For instance, she suggested that US support for India's involvement in the ITER fusion project (as proposed at the recent EU-India summit) would be an important step forward.  Elaborating on this theme, she emphasized the Indian potential to contribute to ITER, and asked whether a letter to this effect from the GOI to DOE would be helpful.  PolCouns undertook to seek guidance on this topic.  Scheduling the Next NSSP Meeting --------------------------------  6. (C) With both Shankar and Jaishankar, PolCouns pressed the Indians for documentation about progress on India's commitments under Phase II of the NSSP.  Since most Phase II steps involve revising laws and regulations, it serves India's interests to get the texts of these to us early. Jaishankar responded that early US identification of a date for the next meeting of the NSSP Implementation Group would enable him to start pressing the GOI bureaucracy to generate the required legislation and related documentation.  He specifically suggested that the next implementation group meeting be set for mid-February in Delhi in conjunction with the AeroIndia and the life sciences conference -- adding that \"with NSSP nothing gets decided until a meeting is fixed.\" MULFORD " }

Mulford,  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) On January 3, the Dalai Lama's Special Representative Lodi Gyari told Ambassador Mulford that he had briefed MEA Joint Secretary (East Asia) Ashok Kantha that same day on Dharamsala's intention to relocate 10,000 Tibetan refugees from India and Nepal to the US.  He emphasized that he had spoken to the GOI \"informally,\" with the understanding that the US wanted to raise this issue with New Delhi separately. He mentioned only Dharamsala's wish to explore the possibility of resettlement to the US, but said he did not discuss US thoughts on the matter.  Gyari indicated that a significant factor in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile's (TGIE's) decision to pursue resettlement was Nepal's recent push back of several Tibetan refugees and the poor economic opportunities for Tibetan refugees in India.  2.  (C) The Ambassador noted his impression that Dharamsala had agreed not to raise the issue with the Indian government until the US had broached the matter.  Gyari said that his intention had been \"quite the opposite,\" remarking that \"our relationship with India is unique, we are like family.\"  To keep Dharamsala's plans from India would therefore be inappropriate, he emphasized, explaining, \"we do not want India to misunderstand what we are trying to do.\"  Gyari told the Ambassador that he had not yet raised the issue with Kathmandu, calling the Nepalese government \"a different matter.\"  3.  (C) Asked how the MEA had received this information, Gyari stated that Kantha had \"taken the information very well,\" acknowledging that several Tibetan settlements in India were facing economic challenges.

(SBU) Summary: India Consular officers have been focusing on unaccounted for American citizens through an ongoing effort to respond to inquiries, and have been successful in resolving about 170 cases.  In a January 4 session with members of the local media, the Ambassador highlighted the US relief effort, and US-India cooperation during the disaster. The USAID/DART team has determined that the situation in India has become less of an immediate emergency.  GOI military assistance for Sri Lanka has reached a considerable level and has now moved beyond short-term relief.  The Ministry of Home Affairs acknowledged on January 3 that the number of Indian deaths is likely to grow with the addition of thousands of individuals currently counted as missing in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  End Summary.  Consular Crunches the Numbers -----------------------------  2.  (U) The consular section continues to search for unaccounted for American citizens in India where specific information is available.  Through a coordinated effort involving the Embassy and the three consulates, calls were made on January 3 and the morning of January 4 to persons in the US who had previously inquired about their loved ones in India.  As a result of this effort, the Mission resolved about 170 cases, bringing the number of open cases under 400.  Consular India will repeat the effort tonight, and hopes to achieve similar results.  Ambassador's Press Conference -----------------------------  3.  (U) In a January 4 meeting with foreign affairs correspondents and editors, the Ambassador highlighted the immediate US response to the tsunami disaster and noted that the improved US-India relationship was evident in our coordinated relief effort.  The Ambassador appreciated New Delhi's lead role in foreign assistance for Sri Lanka and the broad scope of that effort.  He also explained that operational effectiveness based on need is one of the key criteria in allocating the USD 350 million that the USG has committed.  In response to several questions on a tsunami early warning system, the Ambassador emphasized the need for Washington and New Delhi to cooperate on developing one that meets India's needs.  USAID -----  4.  (U) USAID/DART India reports that as of January 4, the situation in the state of Tamil Nadu seems to be moving beyond the immediate emergency phase.  GOI and NGO efforts to provide life-saving water, sanitation, food, and shelter are underway.  USAID/DART is continuing assessments of needs in Tamil Nadu and has been receiving reports from ConGen Calcutta's FSN who is in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  India in Sri Lanka ------------------  5.  (SBU//NOFORN) Indian relief efforts in Sri Lanka have been underway since the day of the tsunami.  The GOI has conducted the initial search and rescue, carried out recovery operations in difficult areas, ferried relief supplies, and continues to work directly with the GOSL to put help where it is needed most.  Six Indian ships, eight helicopters and numerous strategic air assets are working around the clock, and Indian pilots are flying 18-20 hours a day.  The Indian Navy survey ship at Galle took soundings after the tsunami and their divers and engineers have already restored two of three berths.  They will help the Sri Lankan Navy get all berths in Galle open.  The field hospital set up by the GOI in the east has reportedly treated 1300 patients, 500 or more of which were children, and medical teams are established in various provinces providing care on the spot.  6.  (SBU//NOFORN) All these assets are being effectively coordinated from the Indian High Commission in Colombo.  The Ambassador and DAO hope to receive authorization to approach the GOI January 5 with a formal proposal for attaching an Indian coordinating element to US forces in the Bay of Bengal region.  Indian Casualty Numbers -----------------------  7.  (U) The most recent Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) update indicated that on January 3, the total number of Indian deaths was 9,479 compared to 9,451 the day before.  The MHA also reported that the figure was likely to increase pending \"confirmation regarding 5,681 missing/feared dead (as per the preliminary survey) in the Nicobar Group of Islands.\" According to that report, the total figure for missing persons India-wide was 5,796.

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (SBU) Summary: Consular officers in India, through nightly call-backs in response to tsunami-related missing persons inquires, have closed more than 350 cases in the last 48 hours and expect to bring the number below 200 by January 6.  Following the Ambassador's January 4 press conference, reports misquoted SciCouns as having said that formal proposals for US-India collaboration are on the table. Although observers in New Delhi have been enthusiastic about Indian assistance for Sri Lanka, at least one prominent politician has expressed concern over aid making its way to the LTTE.  The military announced that relief operations are \"98 percent complete\" in Andaman and Nicobar, but the number of Indian deaths continues to increase.  End Summary.  Consular: India-Wide Effort to Locate Americans --------------------------------------------- --  2.  (U) All consular officers across India have been engaged in a nightly, after-hours effort to re-contact persons in the US who have inquired about loved ones, making every effort to locate the missing.  As a result of this country-wide approach, consular India has closed more than 350 cases in the last 48 hours, and hopes to have the list of open cases down to less than 200 by Thursday morning, at which point New Delhi will transfer responsibility for all open cases back to ConGen Chennai.  Reconsolidating responsibility should help focus consular's efforts and avoid potentially dropped-balls as officers work to account for the remaining missing.  All New Delhi consular officers lent to other posts in the region (including one who was vacationing in Phuket and stepped in to provide ACS support) are expected back on the visa line by Monday, January 10.  Tsunami Science  SIPDIS ---------------  3.  (U) At the Ambassador's January 4 briefing, the press demonstrated considerable interest in tsunami alert/warning systems and US collaboration with India to develop sea level monitoring systems (reftel).  The \"Times of India\" misquoted SciCouns stating that \"we had a proposal from India to set up a network of tidal ocean level gauges in the Bay of Bengal,\" but in fact we have not yet received any formal Indian proposals for cooperation in this area.  On January 6, the Mission expects to learn more about the team of experts that Department of Science and Technology Secretary VS Ramamurthy plans to call together to advise the GOI on monitoring systems.  Watching Where the Aid Goes in Sri Lanka ----------------------------------------  4.  (U) While GOI disaster relief for Sri Lanka has been a source of pride for Indians, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy has expressed concern over which parts of the country New Delhi's assistance reaches.  On December 30, Swamy reportedly requested the GOI to ensure that its aid does not make its way to the LTTE or the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO), which he considers an LTTE front.  He also urged the US to look into the role of the TRO in the United States as a conduit for aid to the LTTE.  Death Toll in India Climbing ----------------------------  5.  (U) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reported that through January 4, 9,575 Indians had died as a result of the tsunami, an increase of nearly 100 from the previous day.  SIPDIS The MHA also revised the number of missing to 5,918 (from 5,681 on January 3), of which 5,801 are from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Andaman and Nicobar: \"98% Done\" -------------------------------  6.  (U) Despite the number of individuals still missing, Vice Admiral Raman Puri, Chief of the Integrated Defense Staff (IDS), was quoted in local press reports as having announced that 98 percent of immediate relief work in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had been completed.  The GOI noted that search and rescue and relief operations are coming to an end and the next phase of recovery and reconstruction operations are underway.  International NGOs are still prohibited from operating in the Nicobar Islands, which are militarily sensitive.  The Neighbors Pitch in For India --------------------------------  7.  (C) On January 4 media reports indicated that Indian helicopters, which cannot fly from the eastern part of the country to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands alone, have flown via Burma.  The GOI confirmed this to DAO, noting that eight MI-17 helicopters stopped for refueling in Rangoon before proceeding to the Islands.  India has also reportedly received similar support from Bangladesh for helicopter operations from Bangladesh.  Only the Beginning in Indonesia ------------------------------  8.  (C) India's relief for Indonesia, Operation Gambhir, is just getting underway, according to the Ministry of Defense. Two Indian Navy vessels, a survey ship, the INS Nirupak, which the GOI converted to a hospital, and the INS Khukri, which left from Chennai on December 31 carrying tents, blankets, emergency rations, and emergency medical supplies, have reached or will soon arrive in Aceh, the MEA reported. Defense officials told DAO that Indian assistance for Indonesia will be expanded. MULFORD " }

In a sign of the GOI's strong commitment to our tsunami partnership, the Foreign Secretary on January 5 held a rare joint briefing with the  SIPDIS chief of the integrated military command to refute media reports that India was disturbed by the US presence in the region, particularly Sri Lanka.  USAID furthered cooperation on tsunami relief during a coordination meeting chaired by the UN in which US officials agreed to share information and assessments.  As Indian casualty figures continue to increase, press reports indicate the Prime Minister will travel to the hard-hit Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  End Summary.  Ambassador Meets Defense Secretary ----------------------------------  2.  (C) The Ambassador met with Defense Secretary Ajai Vikram Singh, and spoke with acting National Security Adviser MK Narayanan and Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran on January 6 to propose Indian military participation in the combined Multi-National Planning and Augmentation Team (MPAT).  The Ambassador and DATT requested that MOD designate two MPAT planners along with an Indian liaison officer to the Combined Support Force in Utapao, Thailand, and also one to PACOM headquarters.  Details of the meeting will follow septel.  Foreign Secretary: No Stress with the US in Sri Lanka --------------------------------------------- --------  3.  (U) Reflecting the GOI's resolve to maintain a positive tone around US-India collaboration on tsunami relief, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran called in the press corps on January 5.  SIPDIS  Press reports emphasized that the GOI is not concerned about US presence \"in the neighborhood.\"  Saran reportedly underlined that while India was \"spearheading\" relief in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, US assistance was significant and welcome.  Foreign Minister in Jakarta ---------------------------  4.  (U) In a January 6 briefing on the Foreign Minister's participation in the Jakarta Summit, the MEA spokesman reported that the FM emphasized to Kofi Annan that \"India as well as other countries present there supported the UN in its efforts to bring relief to the affected people in the region.\"  The MEA noted that the Minister and Annan \"also discussed regional issues, including Iraq.\"  USAID: Increasing Multilateral Cooperation ------------------------------------------  5.  (U) On January 6, representatives of the USAID/DART team and USAID/India attended a coordination meeting in New Delhi chaired by the UN.  USAID agreed to share information on assessments and activities with the UN, the UK's Department for International Development (DIFD) and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).  On January 5 and 6, USAID/DART conducted assessments of villages near Pondicherry in Tamil Nadu.  The USAID/DART team reports that water/sanitation is not an emergency need but the restoration of livelihoods is emerging as a key concern.  In some villages, residents have begun repairing their homes.  Indian Casualties -----------------  6.  (U) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reported on January 6 that the tsunami was responsible for 9,862 deaths in India, compared to 9,575 through January 4.  The MHA still considers approximately 6,000 individuals missing, although they have indicated the likelihood that the unaccounted for figure will be added to death total.  According the January 6 MHA report, seven Indian nationals died in Sri Lanka, one in the Maldives, three in Thailand, and two in Indonesia.  PM to Visit Andaman and Nicobar -------------------------------  7.  (U) Amid press complaints that the GOI is not doing enough for the isolated archipelago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will reportedly travel to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on January 8.  After the PM's trip, an all-party meeting to discuss the disaster will be held on January 9, two days later than originally scheduled. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C)  This message responds to State action request: ref 060115Z Jan 05 SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR COUNTRY LIAISON OFFICERS FOR TSUNAMI ASSISTANCE AND PACOM REQUEST.  2.  (C)  Based on directions in cable (ref para 1), and communications between USPACOM J-5, OSD, and USDAO New Delhi, Ambassador today delivered a formal letter of request to India's Defense Secretary, India's Foreign Secretary, and National Security Advisor as follows:  A.  That India send two military officers to work within CSF-536's Multi-National Planning and Augmentation Team (MPAT) in Utapao, Thailand, and that these MPAT planners be selected from a list of Indian officers who have been participants in TEMPEST Express and other PACOM sponsored MPAT exercises and conferences.  B.  That India sends a Liaison officer to CSF-536 in Utapao. This officer will be involved in coordinating information about current Indian military operations in support of regional relief efforts and receiving the same information concerning US and other militaries regional relief operations.  C.  That India sends a liaison officer to PACOM Headquarters at Camp Smith, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  This individual will be involved in strategic level coordination of international military relief operations for the affected region, and interact with the Joint Operations Center cell at PACOM and with other foreign liaison officers.  D.  Letter specifies that this request takes effect immediately and requests the MPAT planners and the LNO to Utapao arrive no later than 10 Jan 2005.   The LNO to PACOM should arrive as soon as possible.  Currently, transportation to both locations would be on a self-funded/arranged basis. Letter stated that PACOM is working on providing administrative support, subsistence, and transportation for international liaison officers to Camp Smith.  Indian personnel to Utapao should be administratively self-sufficient, deploying with field gear and laptop computer.  E. Ambassador's letter mentions US force lay down for Tsunami relief operations, CSF-536 organizational structure and subordinate elements, to include the Combined Support Groups on the ground in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. Ambassador pointed out that US and Indian military attaches and relief support personnel are already communicating and effectively sharing information on the ground in Sri Lanka.  3.  (C)  Ambassador first mentioned this proposal today via phonecon with National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan, and followed up with hard copy of letter delivered to Narayanan's office.  Narayanan said he would brief the Prime Minister. Ambassador sent a copy of the request to India's Foreign Secretary Saran.  (Foreign Minister Natwar Singh is in  SIPDIS Indonesia).  4.  (C)  Because of a medical appointment, Defense Minister Mukherjee was unavailable.  Instead, Ambassador and DATT met with India's Defense Secretary A.V. Singh and handed him the letter of request, in additional to background information on the MPAT program, and MPAT Tempest Express 7 which India co-hosted in July-Aug 2004. Also present were MEA Joint Secretary (Canada and US) S. Jaishankar, and MOD Joint  SIPDIS Secretary G. Mukhopadhaya (International Cooperation).  SIPDIS  5.  (C)  Singh politely accepted the Ambassador's letter and told the Ambassador he would study the proposal, brief Defense Minister Mukherjee, and would soon get back with the Ambassador.  Singh said that perhaps we all could meet again to discuss it after they studied it.  Singh then asked several questions about the CSF-536 organization.  Singh asked how this set up interacts with the UN in the relief efforts and how and if the UN was in the picture. Mukhopadhaya asked what is the relationship between the CSF-536 effort involving multinationals and the ASEAN Special Summit convened to deal with relief efforts?  Singh wondered aloud whether or not the best level to deal with the requirements for recovery-reconstruction efforts, would be at the local level, and whether having planners so far removed from the scene would be more effective.  Singh also raised a concern that we should take care that the local government of affected states not feel that they are being dictated to by planners removed from the sc ene. Mukhopadhaya asked for a list of countries that are participating in the CSF, LNOs, and MPAT planners.  Singh asked how long this effort was envisaged to last and what is the time scale that the planners would be planning for.  6.  (C)  DATT reviewed the success of MPAT Tempest Express 7 and reiterated that the MPAT exercise effort had trained military planners for exactly the kind of scenario that has unfolded and that India has a ready trained cadre of planners.  DATT review the rationale for LNOs at CSF-536 and PACOM Headquarters.  Ambassador reiterated that with the success of Indo-US military cooperation programs, we now have a great opportunity to operationalize the military-to-military relationship.  Singh thanked the Ambassador for having presented the letter and looked forward to further discussion on the proposal.  Ambassador and DATT departed Singh's office approximately 30 minutes prior the scheduled phone call to Singh from USD(P) on the same subjects. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary:  In a January 7 meeting with MEA Director (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives) Taranjit Singh Sandhu, PolCouns explained the USG position on tsunami disaster relief for Tiger controlled areas in Sri Lanka, including the US intention not to deploy military forces to LTTE areas. Sandhu responded that the GOI had taken a similar track, and expressed surprise at the contrast between the reality of US involvement in Sri Lanka and what had been reported in the Indian media.  On the future of GOSL-LTTE relations, Sandhu was optimistic that some good could come of the disaster in that it might force the two sides to cooperate.  PolCouns reiterated the need for greater information sharing on Bangladesh.  End Summary.  Tigers? -------  2.  (C) Sandhu remarked that his sense after sifting through all the speculation surrounding the damage the LTTE may have sustained from the tsunami, was that the Tigers did receive a blow, but not so much to their Sea Tigers headquarters.  He thought that probably one or two bases had been wiped out, adding that casualty figures have been kept very quiet, but the figure of two to three hundred LTTE deaths is \"nonsense.\"   GOI Aid to the LTTE -------------------  3.  (C) The GOI has \"no problem\" with Indian assistance flowing through the GOSL to LTTE areas, Sandhu explained, adding that suggesting New Delhi's help should be cut off from the Tamil insurgents would be to acknowledge a separate Tamil Eelam.  He noted, however, that New Delhi found \"unacceptable\" the LTTE statement that aid should be given directly to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization.  PolCouns explained that the USG approach was similar, adding that we have conveyed the message that US relief could be channeled through others, but that no US military deployments or military relief projects would take place in Tiger controlled areas.  4.  (C) PolCouns also clarified the extent of the US military presence in Sri Lanka which has attracted considerable media attention in India, including suggestions that the GOI needs to check US intrusion in India's \"backyard.\"  Sandhu seemed surprised to learn that the widely reported figure of 1,500 US troops in the country was incorrect, and that the USG was going to refocus some military assets on Indonesia because India was doing a very good job of providing assistance to Sri Lanka.  (Note: We have heard from others that the Indian Embassy in Colombo has been a source of some of these alarmist reports about US military plans for Sri Lanka.) Sandhu responded that it was \"wishful thinking\" on the part of the LTTE that a disaster relief turf war would drive a wedge between the US and India.  Sandhu was also unaware that conversations between Washington and New Delhi had taken place through the core group before any US military movement into Sri Lanka.  Characterizing NSA JN Dixit's death as a set back to Indian diplomacy, Sandhu commented that this was especially true of policy towards Colombo, because Dixit (who had been Ambassador there) knew the country so well.  In the Long Term ----------------  5.  (C) Sandhu predicted that the tsunami could have long term political implications in Sri Lanka.  What at one time seemed like critical issues in the conflict seem irrelevant in light of the much larger issue of surviving the disaster, he explained.  Neither the GOSL or the Tigers are in any position to resume armed conflict, he observed, and they may be \"forced\" to cooperate.  If both sides see the current situation as an opportunity, he continued, that could be the \"silver lining\" in this tragedy.  He added, parenthetically, that Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had canceled his scheduled mid-January trip to Sri Lanka. The Other Neighbor ------------------  6.  (C) With a meeting between PM Manmohan Singh and Bangladeshi PM Khaleda Zia postponed until the SAARC Summit is rescheduled, Sandhu told PolCouns he has not yet seen \"the light at the end of the tunnel\" in New Delhi-Dhaka relations.  He remarked that New Delhi has yet to concur with the proposed February 7 date for the SAARC meeting, and expressed puzzlement at Dhaka's insistence on pushing ahead with the Summit at a time when three of the region's governments were reeling from the tsunami.  PolCouns used the opportunity to further encourage more GOI information sharing on the issue through any channel, including the CTJWG.  Sandhu agreed \"in principle\" and offered to take the suggestion higher. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: The unprecedented scale of the Tsunami disaster has compelled India's usually contentious political coalitions to bury their differences and cooperate to relieve the suffering.  Likewise, elements of the Left which strongly oppose the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government's economic reform efforts have let up somewhat in their criticism.  This has not prevented individual parties, especially within Tamil Nadu (reftel) from attempting to use the Tsunami for political reasons.  This is likely to backfire, however. as the Indian public is in no mood for partisanship on the issue.  The Tsunami has also focused the GOI inward, which may slow progress on Indo-Pak relations, the postponed SAARC Summit and other pressing foreign policy issues for the time being.  End Summary.  Burying Hostility for Now -------------------------  2.  (SBU) India's two main coalitions, the UPA and the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), have agreed to downplay their political differences to meet the national emergency resulting from the Tsunami.  On December 31, opposition leaders Atal Behari Vajpayee and LK Advani met with PM Manmohan Singh to discuss how the two alliances could work together to alleviate the suffering of Tsunami victims. the UPA and BJP also agreed to go ahead with India's annual Republic Day parade scheduled for later in January.  After the meeting, the PM's spokesman noted that the opposition and the government believe that \"this is a national calamity and together we should face it.\"  3.  (SBU) This new spirit of cooperation was evident in the January 9 editorial in the pro-BJP \"Pioneer,\" which is a harsh critic of the UPA.  Saying that this \"is not an occasion to score debating points,\" columnist Swapan Dasgupta praised the UPA government for its \"clarity and focus,\" noting that \"discordant notes have been overwhelmed by a burst of generosity, energy and far-sightedness,\" and urged Indians to overcome partisan politics.  Left Tones Down Criticism -------------------------  4.  (SBU) The Left Parties, which have been sparring for months with the UPA over economic policy, also appear more cooperative.  Gurudas Dasgupta the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) labor federation (AITUC) told reporters on January 3 that \"we are dedicating the whole of January to Tsunami and cooperation with the government.  We differ with the government on important policies.  But we have told the PM there is no question of us expressing these views this entire one month.\"  5.  (SBU) The CPI did not publicly back Dasgupta's statement, however, with CPI Secretary D. Raja denying any plans to call-off confrontation.  A January 3 article in the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) newspaper \"People's Democracy\" pledged CPM \"support for the government in relief and rehabilitation.\"  Some Residual Partisanship --------------------------  6.  (SBU) While the two alliances have forsworn confrontation, some individual parties have used the Tsunami for political purposes.  The CPM reacted with scorn to a BJP claim that Goa was not hurt by the Tsunami because it had a BJP government, with CMP leader Nilotpal Basu arguing that \"the people experienced a Tsunami of hatred for five years under the NDA regime,\" and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury noting that, \"contrary to what the BJP people are saying, the Tsunami is no ominous signal.\"  SIPDIS  7.  (SBU) It appears that the Tsunami has become a divisive issue only in Tamil Nadu.  Janata Party President Subramaniam Swamy demanded that UPA Ministers from Tamil Nadu resign, as the UPA government had \"betrayed the state in the allocation of funds from the PM's relief fund.\"  He claimed that all money raised for the fund was being diverted to UPA coffers. The opposition DMK party also attacked the ruling AIDMK government headed by Chief Minister Jayalalitha, accusing it of nonperformance (reftel).  Comment -------  8.  (C) The Tsunami has brought about a period of relative quiet from the normally harsh partisanship and mudslinging that characterizes Indian politics.  Politicians have largely refrained from conflict and embraced cooperation, although a minority has tried to use the disaster for partisan purposes.  Political campaigning for the February elections in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Haryana has been more restrained than usual. If this period of amity persists, the elections could be relatively quiet affairs. 9.  (C) The massive relief effort has also shifted the GOI focus inward, and may delay decision making on regional issues like the India Pakistan Composite Dialogue and determining a new date for the postponed SAARC Summit.

Mulford, Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary: Senators Frist, McConnell, DeWine and Coleman discussed a broad range of issues with PM Manmohan Singh during their January 10 meeting, including US-India ties, Tsunami disaster relief, democratization in Burma, HIV/AIDS, trade and the WTO, Iraq, NSSP, Indo-Pak relations, and UNSC reform.  The PM remained non-committal regarding expanding Indian involvement in Iraq beyond providing election assistance.  End Summary.  Close Bilateral Ties --------------------  2.  (C) Emphasizing the importance India places on the US/India relationship, the PM referred to the NSSP, investment, growing trade, and India's desire for FDI from the US, emphasizing specifically bilateral cooperation in counterterrorism, halting WMD proliferation, and working with the US within the WTO to establish a non-discriminatory trading system.  Noting that India's relations with the US were \"of the highest priority,\" he expressed his desire to \"deepen and broaden\" ties, especially in the high-tech and defense areas.  The PM pointed out that he had met with President Bush in New York on the margins of the UNGA last fall, and was looking forward to seeing him again this year. Stating that there was a growing convergence between Indian and US interests, based in part on our strong democratic traditions, PM Singh called the US and India \"partners.\"  He hoped that Indian expertise in IT and biotech would further bilateral cooperation, and explained that the GOI wants to create an \"environment for entrepreneurship in India,\" so that its citizens would no longer have to emigrate.  Senator Frist responded by underlining his wish to build on growing US-India ties, which now include a strong Indian-American dimension. Disaster Relief ---------------  3.  (C) After extending condolences regarding the Tsunami disaster, Senator Frist referred to his previous stop in Sri Lanka, where the Sri Lankan President had expressed gratitude to India for its support, noting that New Delhi had gained in respect internationally both as a victim and a donor.  The PM thanked the US for its support and assistance to the GOI Tsunami relief effort, adding that he deeply appreciated the  SIPDIS Secretary's visit to the Indian Embassy in Washington.  The  SIPDIS PM characterized the establishment of the \"core group\" as a \"good and timely\" step.  Noting that for India the suffering was restricted to its South and Eastern islands, the PM hoped that future Indian economic development would take such potential disasters into account.  Democratization in Burma ------------------------  4.  (C) Senator McConnell asked the PM whether he was troubled by India's ties with the Burmese junta, and how he felt about hosting General Than Shwe last October.  PM Singh replied that he holds ASSK in very high regard for the values she promotes, but pointed out that India has a 1400 kilometer land border with Burma, as well as 850 kilometers of shared coastline along the Bay of Bengal, and that the insurgents in some of India's northeastern states take shelter in Burma. These factors compel India and Burma to talk, he said, and recalled that he had told both General Than Shwe and the Indian Parliament that Burma must do everything possible to honor its own previously stated commitment to restore democracy.  HIV/AIDS --------  5.  (C) In response to Senator DeWine's question about how India was dealing with HIV/AIDS and the role the international community could play in these efforts, the PM pointed out that there were now five million AIDS sufferers in India.  Characterizing AIDS as a \"major national problem,\" he said that it could affect India's economic development, especially because of its impact on the young.  Stressing that the GOI takes the problem \"very seriously,\" he noted his engagement with youth in his fight against AIDS.  While culture often prevents open discussion of this issue, he had met with the media to enlist their support.  The PM expressed appreciation for the support of American and international donor organizations in this battle, and noted that the GOI would commit more resources. Trade and the WTO -----------------  6.  (C) Senator Coleman then asked how the US and India could work better together on trade/WTO issues, and Senator Frist pointed out that the USG would like to see more GOI action on economic reform, including lower tariffs and improved IPR protection.  In response, the PM said that both countries want to improve the WTO, and he wants to ensure that it will provide a rule-based, non-discriminatory framework for international trade.  He was pleased with the last round of WTO talks, in which he said the US and India had worked closely together.  The PM reiterated that the GOI is committed to moving forward together with the US, has already introduced an ordinance to prevent copyright infringement, and expects to introduce legislation to enshrine these measures into law.  Iraq ----  7.  (C) Senator Frist noted that it is clear there will be an election in Iraq on January 30, and bringing democracy and stability to Iraq must be a real international effort, given that the outcome there effects everyone, including India. Responding, PM Singh expressed his support for US efforts in Iraq and agreed that it was crucial that the election be held as scheduled.  It was vital, the PM said, that the US succeed in Iraq as it has in Afghanistan, although Iraq is a more complex and dangerous situation.  He reiterated India's offer to train election officials for Iraq in India.  Senator McConnell pointed out that there are two more elections scheduled in Iraq for 2005, one to ratify the new constitution, and one to elect a new government at the end of the year, and encouraged the PM to help with Iraqi elections running into the future.  NSSP ----  8.  (C) Emphasizing that the USG would like to reinforce and support the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) and expand talks on Missile Defense, Senator Frist commented that the US and India need to improve export control implementation and enforcement to achieve their joint NSSP goals.  The PM replied that India takes its nonproliferation obligations seriously, has strong export controls, and wants to halt the spread of WMD.  India/Pakistan Relations ------------------------  9.  (C) Commenting that US relations with India and Pakistan were not a \"zero-sum\" game and that they should develop independently, Senator Frist noted that the US fully supports a bilateral Indo-Pak approach to Kashmir.  PM Singh responded that India is committed to solving all outstanding issues with Islamabad, although any settlement must be based on ground realities, as India cannot support changes of boundaries, especially when based on religion, as this would undermine India's secular character, and be unacceptable to the public at large.  Instead, he noted, people on both sides of the LOC should have greater opportunities to travel and trade.  Since India is a \"status quo power,\" it wishes Pakistan well and hopes it can bring its problems with terrorism and extremism under control.  United Nations Reform ---------------------  10.  (C) Senator Coleman ended the meeting by pointing out that both India and the US want a \"credible, effective, transparent UN,\" and hoped that both countries could work together on UN reform.  The PM replied that India agrees that the UN is in need of reform and seeks a permanent seat on the UNSC.  11.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. MULFORD " }

Mulford, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  1.  (C) Summary: On January 7, India and Iran strengthened significantly their oil and gas relationship when they reached an agreement in which India will purchase a total of 7.5 million tons per year (MMTA) of LNG for 25 years beginning in 2009.  Iran will reportedly  allow Indian state-controlled companies to participate in at least three upstream oil and gas projects (South Pars, Yadavaran, and Jufeyr).  Although the deal has not been formalized and the contracts have not been signed, the LNG and upstream investment elements of the deal appear to be quite firm.  If the deal goes through, it could have ILSA implications.  We will continue to raise our concerns with both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with the oil companies, all of which are aware of our ILSA concerns.  The deal also included proposals for an Indian and Iran state-controlled companies to cooperate in petrochemical manufacturing and CNG development. The package represents still further evidence that the Indian oil companies, cheered on by the GOI, are vigorously seeking properties abroad.  The two governments also decided to discuss in February issues relating to an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.  With the GOI's decision to enter into large and long-term LNG purchase agreements, Embassy believes that the commerical prospects of an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline recede further even as the idea remains a topic of Iran-India diplomacy.  End Summary.  2.  (C) India took some significant steps in intensifying its oil and gas relationship with Iran and strengthening its energy security during the first weekend of January.  After more than a year of negotiations, the two countries reached a wide-ranging oil and gas package agreement on the sidelines of January 6-7 Asian Oil Ministers meeting in New Delhi.  The announcement was made on January 7 by India Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mani Shanker Aiyar and Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanghneh.  The deal has not been formally signed and has some ways to go before the various elements are concluded.  Some parts of the deal such as proposed participation by Indian state-controlled companies in Iran's oil and gas sector could be ILSA-sanctionable depending on the nature of the participation and how the contracts are structured.  The GOI and the Indian oil companies, none of which have any significant U.S. interests or presence, are well aware of our ILSA concerns.  We will continue to raise our concerns with both the Ministry of External Affairs and with the oil companies.  Large LNG Deal --------------  3.  (U) For India, the most significant and firm element of the package deal is the commitment to buy 7.5 million metric tons of LNG per year for 25 years beginning in 2009.  The state-controlled Indian companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and GAIL India Limited will purchase the LNG from the National Iranian Gas Export Corporation (NIGEC).  It is not clear which Iranian field will supply this gas.  4.  (SBU) Much of the delay in reaching the LNG agreement was over pricing.  An official of GAIL told Econoff that the Indian companies will buy the gas at a price that is capped at $3.21 per million british thermal unit (MBTU).  The price will be fixed at $2.97 per unit for three years, after which it will be allowed to float at a formula that comprises a fixed price of $1.2 per unit plus 6.25 percent of the Brent crude price.  The Indian companies had resisted the link to crude prices but conceded after the maximum allowable Brent crude price was fixed at $31 per barrel.  5.  (SBU) The India companies are not getting as good a price as they have in place for ExxonMobil's RasGas from Qatar. The price for this gas is fixed at $2.53 per unit until 2008, after which it will be linked to crude in the $16-24 range. Nonetheless, GAIL Chairman Proshonto Banerjee said \"In the present circumstances, it is a good deal.\" A Second LNG Deal -----------------  6.  (SBU) The two government's also endorsed a December agreement between IOC and the Iranian oil company Petropars for a 40 percent IOC share in the development of one of the blocks in South Pars gas field (Ref A).  IOC would also get 60 percent stake in a 9 MMTPA LNG liquefaction plant related to this development.  The 25-year agreement would provide IOC about 4.5 MMTPA of LNG.  Total development costs of this project are estimated at $3.2 billion.  GAIL had loudly complained about being left out of the deal in December, claiming that GOI policy has been to allow Indian state-controlled energy companies to invest overseas only in a consortium.  GAIL removed its opposition after it was brought into the overall package.  The LNG imported in the two deals -- the 4.5 MMPTA from South Pars and the 7.5 MMPTA (para 2) will be marketed in India by GAIL, IOC, ONGC, and Oil India Limited in the 40:25:25:10 proportions.  Other Parts of the Package --------------------------  7.  (U) Yadavaran: ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the overseas arm of the Indian state-run oil exploration company Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, will get a 20 percent share in the development of Iran's on-shore Yadavaran oil field.  This equity stake is equivalent to about 60,000 barrels per day.  8.  (U) Jufeyr:  OVL will get a 100 percent stake in the Iran's Jufeyr field.  This field is expected to yield 30,000 per day when developed.  9.  (U) Bandar Assaluyeh:  Iran offered IOC participation in a petrochemical complex under development at Bandar Assaluyeh.  The proposed terms for taking part in the project were not disclosed.  10.  (U) CNG: GAIL proposed investing in development of CNG for Teheran and Esfahan and signed an agreement with the Iran Fuel Conservation Organization for cooperation on CNG development.  11. (SBU) Pipeline:  An Iranian team will visit India in February to discuss issues relating to trans-Pakistan gas pipeline.  The Indian official who backgrounded the overall agreement for the media downplayed the importance of these discussions by emphasizing that security of gas supplies remained a key issue.  Comment -------  12.  (C) Although some parts of the deal are merely commitments for further discussion, India's agreement to buy Iranian gas and invest in Iranian upstream oil and gas developments appear to be quite firm.  The deal is huge for India -- its 12 MMTPA of LNG represents about half of India's current natural gas production.  Together with the 5 MMTPA imported from ExxonMobil's RasGas development, India is becoming a major player in the Asian LNG markets.  The deal represents still further evidence that the Indian oil companies, cheered on by the GOI, are vigorously seeking properties abroad.  The GOI's goal is to enhance Indian energy security.  The oil companies, especially IOC, aspire to become international players who can compete with the majors.  13.  (C) With the GOI's decision to enter into such large and long-term LNG purchase agreements, Embassy believes that the commerical prospects of an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline recede further.  Mani Shanker Aiyar stirred up a flurry of excitement about such a project soon after he assumed office last summer.  The excitement appears to have abated now as conditions -- first MFN, then transit rights through Pakistan -- have been appended at the insistence of MEA's Pakistan hands.  MEA Joint Secretary Jaishanker told Ambassador that he believes, despite Aiyar's enthusiasm, the obstacles to a trans-Pakistan pipeline are enormous.  He characterized Aiyar's public statements in support of a pipeline as \"more smoke than fire.\"  14.  (C) Embassy notes that large and expensive projects such as a 3,000 kilometer pipeline generally require a private sector backer and promoter.  We are not aware that any international oil and gas company has shown an interest in becoming involved.  Our contacts in the Indian oil and gas industry are not enthusiastic, saying that the pipeline is probably not economically viable given the extra risk management costs involved and the projections of alternative sources of supply.  In any case, to our knowledge no serious cost-benefit analysis has been done. MULFORD " }

Blake,  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: Two questions now swirl around India's National Security Advisor position: will it lose its major role in the Indian foreign policy establishment, and who will land the job permanently?  JN Dixit's death has prompted media speculation that PM Manmohan Singh is reassessing what he wants from his next NSA and how the NSA system should function.  This has led Indian strategic commentators to posit that the NSC structure may be reinvigorated as the Congress Party pledged during last year's election campaign. That structural issue notwithstanding, Special Adviser to PM Singh and Acting NSA MK Narayanan clearly has the inside track to succeed Dixit, based on proximity and personal relations with Mrs. Gandhi, but there are also other serious contenders.  This cable provides biographic information on Narayanan.  End Summary.  2.  (C) JN Dixit's untimely death on January 3 has set the stage for changes in the NSA position and the NSC system that were predicted but never came to fruition after last May's change of government.  According to numerous well informed press accounts and non-government contacts, the PMO is treating Dixit's death as an opportunity to re-evaluate and perhaps re-engineer the national security architecture at a time of relative quiet in India-Pakistan relations and Indian foreign policy generally.  The loss of the incumbent NSA, and his interim replacement with a seasoned bureaucrat who already has a good working relationship with the PM, gives the GOI breathing space to tweak the NSA/NSC system, and Indian strategic thinkers have been quick to suggest changes.  The Next NSA: Less Adviser, More Chairman? ------------------------------------------  3.  (C) The buzz surrounding PM Singh's decision to rethink what the NSA and NSC should do -- irrespective of who holds the post -- is based on the 2004 Congress Party election platform pledge to make the NSC \"a professional and effective institution.\"  This in turn was a dig at Brajesh Mishra's role as the power behind Vajpayee on a broad range of political and foreign policy matters.  Structural changes were predicted after Congress came to power last May, but faded quickly from the agenda following Dixit's rapid occupation of the same \"super minister\" role played by his predecessor.  Speculation lingers around a partial shift in the NSA's work balance away from its current advisory role toward greater management of the NSC as an organization.  Any substantial redefinition of the position would probably take some time (and a measure of conscious self-restraint by the incumbent).  However, the current calm in Indo-Pak relations and the presence of an experienced hand as Acting NSA will provide breathing space to do so.  4.  (C) The eminence grise of Indian strategic thinkers, K Subramanyam, has been arguing that India needs an NSA at the helm of a fully functioning NSC dedicated to addressing India's strategic needs, as originally mandated.  In a series of essays, he has argued for the NSA to play this role, rather than being the PM's point-man on the foreign affairs issues of the day, as the position became when Mishra and Dixit held it.  \"Indian Express\" strategic affairs editor Jasjit Singh has observed that much of Mishra's authority grew out of his other role as Principal Secretary to the PM, which removed the impetus to create a durable NSC that remains absent to this day.  \"Hindustan Times\" foreign affairs correspondent and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Manoj Joshi wrote recently that PM Singh's reassessment would provide an opportunity to split the NSA away from dealing with Islamabad, most notably through the back-channel with Pakistan's NSA Tariq Aziz, and to put this issue \"back where it belongs\" -- in the Foreign Ministry.  A January 6 \"Times of India\" news report speculated that the internal and external security elements of the NSA position might be bifurcated. 5.  (C) Redefining the NSA as the active NSC chair also poses a geographical problem if it is to remain in the forefront of GOI policymaking.  Mishra and Dixit sat in the PMO, down the hall from the MEA, which kept them firmly in the loop on foreign policy decisionmaking.  The NSC staff, in contrast, works out of a decrepit building on the other side of town, far from the corridors of influence.  For now, this location symbolizes the NSC's marginal role in Indian foreign policymaking.  Narayanan Has the Edge ----------------------  6.  (C) By most accounts, PM Singh,s Special Advisor MK (\"Mike\") Narayanan, who became Acting National Security Advisor on January 4 after Dixit's death, has the inside track to become his permanent replacement.  Narayanan brings over four decades of experience in the Indian intelligence community, and as a long-time Gandhi family loyalist is seen as part of the traditional \"coterie\" around Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi.  7.  (C) That said, the Indian media has been awash with the names of other NSA aspirants, many of whom possess far stronger foreign policy credentials than Narayanan.  This list includes (based on diplomatic and media gossip): -- Former Cabinet and Defense Secretary and Ambassador to Washington Naresh Chandra -- Gandhi family confidant and Ambassador to the US Ronen Sen -- Former High Commissioner to Pakistan and Rajiv Gandhi PMO veteran G Parthasarthy -- Former Foreign Secretary and recently-appointed Arunachal Pradesh Governor SK Singh -- Former Foreign Secretary and Indo-Pak Track II activist Salman Haidar -- Former Ambassador, Afghan Coordinator and National Security Advisory Board Convenor SK Lambah -- Former Ambassador to China Chandrashekhar Dasgupta -- Former Foreign Secretary MK Rasgotra -- Former Foreign Secretary K Ragunath -- Former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey -- Former Defense and Home Secretary and Kashmir Interlocutor NN Vohra -- Former Ambassador Lalit Mansingh  The Indian press has been quick to handicap the \"contenders,\" many of whom have been promoting their own suitability.  For example, Sen arrived recently in Washington; Haider is considered too dovish for this post; and Lambah and Dasgupta are seen as political \"light-weights.\"  He's No Dixit -------------  8.  (C) Unlike Dixit and Mishra, Narayanan is not a former Foreign Service Officer, and has not served overseas in any capacity; he thus does not enjoy a network of loyalists within the MEA bureaucracy, a break with tradition if the NSA position becomes more inter-ministerial in nature.  Unlike Dixit, who served as MEA spokesman earlier in his career, Narayanan also has not cultivated the Delhi press corps. When Narayanan took the position of Special Adviser to the PM, he made it clear that he had no interest in challenging Dixit for his \"executive duties,\" and had no interest in the \"glamorous part of the (NSA) job,\" an attitude that may dovetail with whatever NSA/NSC restructuring emerges.  Early Tests Likely ------------------  9.  (C) If Narayanan continues as NSA, he will face an early test as both Intelligence Bureau head AK Doval and Research and Analysis Wing chief CD Sahay are due to retire on or about January 30.  The IB succession will probably be straightforward, but some Indian press accounts suggest that RAW officers are concerned that Narayanan, whose IB background makes him by definition and institutionally skeptical of RAW, would look outside the organization for Sahay's successor, and might bring in a senior IB officer for the job.  10.  (C) Narayanan -- or whoever becomes NSA on a permanent basis -- will also have his hands full with other intelligence issues, not the least of which is the ongoing review of RAW operations that began with last spring's revelation that RAW Joint Secretary Rabinder Singh had been spiriting away classified information before he spirited himself out of the country.  Media reports of his supposed whereabouts surface from time to time, most recently suggesting he was spotted in Virginia in December.  If Narayanan does become NSA, long-serving RAW officers may try to obstruct reforms initiated by a former IB head.  11.  (C) If he inherits Dixit's diplomatic role with Pakistan, China, and the US, Narayanan will suffer several disadvantages, the most important of which is a lack of practical negotiating experience.  As demonstrated in his effective dialogue with Tariq Aziz and with the US over NSSP, Dixit was one of India's most respected diplomatic practitioners -- well versed in the arts of listening, compromise, and working to a bottom line.  As a former Ambassador to all of India's neighbors, and an Urdu speaker as well, Dixit was uniquely equipped to manage India's regional relationships.  An Intelligence Professional ----------------------------  12.  (C) Narayanan joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1955 and spent his first four years with the IPS in Tamil Nadu.  Calm, analytical, discreet, and cosmopolitan, he comes across as a classic intelligence analyst type.  It is not unusual for a conversation with Narayanan to consist largely of questions.  Although his writings have occasionally been critical of \"the West,\" he has not shown visceral anti-US attitudes.  His many years of service to the Gandhi family earned him his post as Special Advisor, where he serves as a behind-the-scenes coordinator for intelligence activity -- including India's Northeast and Nepal, areas of concern to New Delhi on a daily basis.  His position as Special Advisor carries with it the rank of Minister of State.  As Special Advisor, Narayanan was open, accessible, and friendly to Embassy officials, but usually in a listening mode.  13.  (C) He became one of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's confidants after moving to the IB, India's primary internal intelligence service, in 1960.  Narayanan's experience in Tamil Nadu made him an effective figure in intelligence activities involving Sri Lankan Tamil issues after Rajiv Gandhi appointed him IB Director in 1987.  US Consulate General Chennai officials recall his repeatedly expressed and profound distaste for the LTTE.  He is also known as an expert on the Indian Left and communism.  14.  (C) In 1990, Prime Minister VP Singh moved Narayanan from the IB to become Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and Secretary of the National Security Council. Less than a year later, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, whose government was supported by the Congress Party, reappointed him as IB head, and Narayanan retired from that post in 1992.  After retirement, he served as Senior Advisor on National Security Affairs to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and as a member of Prime Minister Vajpayee's NSAB from 1998-2001.  He also served on two task forces on intelligence and internal security set up in the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil War. Narayanan is also a founding, but now inactive, member of the Center for Security Analysis, a Chennai-based think tank. 15.  (C) Narayanan once related to CG/Chennai an anecdote from his days as Senior Advisor to PM Rao: Narayanan outlined how he had written a report and gave it to an aide to deliver to the PM.  After reading the report, the aide commented that he could not deliver such information, at which Narayanan said that he responded, \"I am not here to please, but rather to inform the PM.\"  Need for \"Holistic Synergy\" on Kashmir, Pakistan --------------------------------------------- ---  16.  (C) During his retirement years, Narayanan revealed particular interest in Pakistan and Kashmir through weekly columns he contributed to \"Asian Age\" (expanded excerpts reftel).  In them, he argued that only a small minority of Kashmiris supported the militancy, and most were angered that the 2002 elections did not lead to a drop in violence.  An \"early solution appears difficult,\" he wrote in January 2004, and in March he expanded that \"Neither 'cleverness' nor 'shortcuts' can help.  Creating a holistic synergy is necessary, (but) each side is more intent on blaming the other of being obstructive ... than in progressing the dialogue.  Neither side has been able to rise above narrow interpretations and preoccupations.\"  Personal Data -------------  17.  (C) Born on March 10, 1934 to a Kerala Nair (non-Brahmin, upper caste) family, Narayanan completed his bachelor's degree at Madras Christian College.  He and his wife Vijaya, also a Keralite, have a son, Vijay, and a daughter, Meena.  Their son-in-law Ajit Nambiar is Chairman and Managing Director of BPL Ltd, a consumer-durable manufacturing company, on whose board of directors Narayanan has served.  After retirement, Narayanan made Chennai his permanent home, and his wife remains there, as does his mother.  When he became Special Adviser to PM Singh, he often spent weekends in Chennai, which will probably cease if he becomes NSA on a permanent basis.  18.  (C) According to a January 17 \"Outlook\" weekly profile by its foreign affairs correspondent V Sudarshan, Narayanan is a teetotaler and a fitness buff.  He also travels to Kerala every winter to visit the Hindu temple in Sabarimala, South India's largest pilgrimage site.  Narayanan has visited the US several times, and has delivered speeches and lectures in excellent English.  He is an honorary member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a rare distinction.  19.  (C) Along with Principal Secretary TKA Nair, Narayanan constitutes what is now a Keralite \"mafia\" in the PMO.  In a bureaucratic culture dominated by North Indian Hindi speakers, this Keralite lock on the PM's inner bureaucratic circle represents something of an anomaly, which could in the long term create new faultlines around the Prime Minister.

(C) Summary: In a January 12 meeting with PolCouns, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K Singh was brimming with confidence that India was in the right on the Baglihar Dam issue.  If Pakistan went forward with arbitration, as it has suggested, India is ready, and will be vindicated, he stated.  New Delhi believes the dispute has little to do with water, and is primarily a political issue raised by Islamabad to prevent India from completing projects that benefit Kashmiris, as the hydroelectric project is designed to do.  Singh did not see the dispute as derailing the Composite Dialogue.  The World Bank tells us arbitration is terra incognita for them, suggesting that this case could easily continue for a long time, given the many hypotheticals.  End Summary.  2.  (C) J/S Arun Singh was unusually confident about India's position on Baglihar in a January 12 conversation with PolCouns and Poloffs (other topics septels).  \"We have looked at the dam several times, and our technical and legal experts say it is treaty compliant,\" he stressed.  After the most recent round of discussions January 4-7 yielded no results, India had proposed fresh technical talks, on the grounds that they could lead to a further convergence of views.  MEA Spokesman Navtej Sarna told the press on January 11 that the GOI had provided volumes of data beyond treaty requirements, which \"should convince (Pakistan) that the technical parameters of the project do not violate Indus Waters Treaty provision.\"  Singh found it unfortunate that Islamabad seems prepared to go forward with arbitration, but predicted that \"they will be disappointed.\"  3.  (C) Singh attributed the Pakistani position on arbitration to politics, which he saw as outweighing the technical issues.  Pakistan wants to prevent water projects in J&K, he continued, in order to block anything that benefits Kashmiris.  He asserted that the Baglihar Dam would have a major positive impact on electricity supplies in the state, which suffer from chronic power shortages.  This would have major political benefits for New Delhi, which it would not forego, especially after investing so much in the project.  The Pakistani position was a signal to Kashmiris that Islamabad has a veto on development in J&K, he stated, which India could not accept.  4.  (C) Looking back historically, the Joint Secretary saw the Dam as analagous in some respects to the Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project, which the GOI delayed for several months as a favor to Benazir Bhutto, not as a treaty provision.  Once the GOI stopped it, he continued, Islamabad \"had what it wanted,\" and refused to engage substantively after that.  India will not make the same mistake again. Singh recalled that the Indus Waters Treaty had worked very well so far, and even held up during the 2002 Indo-Pak crisis, when the Baglihar Dam was also a bilateral problem.   World Bank View ---------------  5.  (C) In a January 12 conversation with D/Polcouns, a World Bank New Delhi official who is very familiar with the case observed that Pakistan is very serious about seeking arbitration because it sees the bilateral process as going nowhere.  The arbitration process would have to follow a strict series of steps, which could drag on for a year or longer, but inasmuch as the two sides have never gone this route in the past, it is terra incognita.  There are hundreds of hypotheticals that could influence the process, and no one could predict its course, he stated.  Comment -------  6.  (C) We have rarely seen Arun Singh more confident on an issue than this one.  He was beyond comfortable, indicating clearly that the GOI has done its homework and is prepared for arbitration, should it come to that.  The MEA attitude that the dispute is \"not about water,\" however, but about Kashmir politics, is simplistic because whatever the merits of this case, water is a factor in Pakistan.  In contrast to Pakistan, where the dispute is reportedly regularly a front page item, in India the story is buried deeply in the papers, and has little public resonance.  7.  (C) While it may be preferable for the case to be resolved bilaterally, several years of talks and much posturing on both sides have shown few results.  It is encouraging for Indo-Pak normalization that the parties have a neutral mechanism to decide the outcome, but the hypothetical World Bank timeline for arbitration suggests that the dispute could hang over the Composite Dialogue for quite some time, whether it has a direct effect on it or not.  Given the local World Bank office's lack of independent views on this looming dispute, Mission would appreciate Washington perspectives on the views of IBRD headquarters regarding process, timeline, and the status of the Baglihar project.

The USAID/DART team that conducted assessments in Andhra Pradesh has found that there is not an emergency need for shelter, food and water in the state.  The GOI has not yet been able to assemble a team of scientists to consider the need for a tsunami warning system for India, and SciCouns is working on the possibility of a US participant for the GOI's late January warning system brainstorming session.  New Delhi raised the number of tsunami-related Indian deaths by 345 in the last 24 hours amid criticism in local media of India's refusal to accept outside assistance. End Summary.  Consular: Bringing Down the Numbers -----------------------------------  2. (U) ConGen Chennai is working to clear the fewer than 20 remaining open missing persons inquiries for India.  USAID: Andhra Pradesh May Need Support For Livelihoods --------------------------------------------- ---------  3.  (U) On January 12 and 13, the USAID/DART team conducted assessments of coastal villages in southern Andhra Pradesh. The team reports that in Andhra Pradesh, shelter, food, water and sanitation are not emergency needs, but some livelihoods support may be required.  It is still unclear whether NGOs will be permitted to operate in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  There is little available land for resettlement in the Islands, and displaced residents will likely need to remain in camps until a survey of habitable land is completed and resettlement areas are determined.  Tsunami Warning System for India?  SIPDIS ---------------------------------  4.  (SBU) The sensationalist \"Asian Age,\" in a January 13 report, highlighted that Science and Technology Minister Kapil Sibal continues to promise a tsunami warning system for India.  Meanwhile, India is struggling to assemble a group of scientists to advise the GOI on what tsunami warning systems are like, and what are the benefits likely to accrue to India from such a system (reftel).  SciCouns has been in touch with NOAA and the NSF regarding possible US participants to the January 21-22 Tsunami Warning System Brainstorming Session the Department of Science and Technology is calling in New Delhi.  \"Tsunami Diplomacy:\" Continued ------------------------------  5.  (U) Despite the generally positive take on India's handling of the disaster at home and in neighboring countries, some observers have raised questions about the wisdom of New Delhi's refusal of outside help.  A January 12 editorial in the \"Indian Express\" criticized the GOI's decision to disallow Kofi Annan's visit as demonstrating \"indifferent diplomacy\" and \"misplaced hypersensitivity\" to offers of assistance.  A \"Tribune\" op-ed from the same day called India's position illogical, noting that \"India, more so its government, suffers from a silly notion about nationalism.\"  Highlighting the GOI's \"hypocritical stand,\" the piece noted that NGOs operating in India receive a large amount of foreign funding.  Novelist Amitav Ghosh, in his three-part article published in the \"Hindu,\" remarked that Indians waiting for days for help in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands took little consolation in radio reports that New Delhi's rapid deployment of assistance to Sri Lanka would establish India as a superpower.  Casualty Numbers ----------------  6.  (U) Over the last 24 hours, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) again revised the Indian dead and missing numbers upward.  On January 13, the MHA reported that 10,672 Indians had died as a result of the tsunami, an increase of 345 from January 12.  While the MHA has not yet declared the more than 5,000 missing as presumed dead, the GOI lowered the figure by three to 5,625. MULFORD " }

Mulford, Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1.  (SBU) Summary:  Senators Sam Brownback and John Corzine, and Representatives James Leach, Earl Blumenaur, Scott Garrett, Wayne Gilchrest, Frank Pallone, and Diane Watson discussed a broad range of issues with an Indian parliamentary delegation led by MP Murli Deora, the President of the India/US Parliamentary Forum (IUPF) during their January 13 meeting.  Topics of discussion included Tsunami Disaster Relief, US-India ties, India/Pakistan and US/Pakistan relations, trade, development, and UNSC reform, but it was US arms for Pakistan that most animated the Indian MPs.  Both sides acknowledged that US/India relations are close and getting closer and were enthusiastic about the prospects for further US/India cooperation.  However, several Indian parliamentarians pointed out that \"irritants\" such as the American supply of sophisticated weapons to Pakistan need to be addressed.  End Summary.  Arms to Pakistan ----------------  2.  (SBU) Several Indian MP's described the US supply of sophisticated arms to Pakistan as an \"irritant\" in the bilateral relationship.  BJP legislator Ravi Shankar Prasad emphasized that \"India wishes well for Pakistan,\" and hopes that it can become a stable and prosperous society, and sees no problem should the US provide generous assistance. However, the US \"must ensure\" that Pakistan does not become a base for international terrorism.  For example, he stated, US aid must be used to change Pakistan's outlook so that it does not commit acts like smuggling nuclear technology to other countries.  While clearly opposed to US arms sales to Pakistan, he claimed that India would deal with the challenge this presents.  3.  (C) Senator Brownback noted that there are differing views on the subject, but Pakistan has played a key role in the war on terrorism, which has been very important to the US.  He told the MP's that while there are \"rumors\" that the US will sell F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, he did not think it was going to happen, as Congress would not clear the sale, and the powerful Indian/American community would organize against it.  The administration may offer the planes to Pakistan, he said, but would not find the votes to get it approved by Congress.  He urged the Indian legislators to \"look at the flip side,\" in that if the Indian armed forces integrated American equipment into their inventory and ensured interoperability, it would serve as a powerful counterpoint to Pakistan.  4.  (SBU) Congressman Leach replied that \"there is no monopoly of anger vis a vis Pakistan,\" but it is in India's best interest that the US/Pakistan relationship is amicable. He emphasized that for the US there is no \"zero sum game\" in regards to India and Pakistan.  Pointing out that the US has \"difficulties\" with \"aspects\" of the Muslim world, he noted that the US does not want Pakistan to \"trip into terrorism and instability.\"  While the US would have \"respectful\" relationships with both India and Pakistan, the relationship with India would be \"dominant\" as the two countries share common values and interests, while not being \"discordant\" to the US/Pakistan relationship.  The Role of the Tsunami -----------------------  5.  (SBU) Saying he was happy that the US and India were working together to assist the victims of the Tsunami, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma pointed to the relief effort as an indicator of the growing closeness of India and the US.  Murli Deora asked whether there was too much Tsunami relief money coming in, and whether it could all be utilized.  6.  (SBU) Congressman Leach replied that the delegation has toured the Tsunami stricken region and seen the extraordinary depth of the catastrophe, which he described as \"unprecedented.\"  He called the US/Indian joint response a \"bellwether\" of the other types of cooperation that were possible and an indicator of the convergence of interests. Senator Brownback described the devastation as \"mind boggling,\" saying that in Sri Lanka it was \"numbing.\"  He thanked India for its close cooperation with the US and for extending help to neighboring countries while dealing with its own disaster. The Senator noted that the disaster had \"touched the American people,\" and provided an opportunity for the two countries to work together not just on this immediate issue, but a number of others in the future.  He said the relief money would be spent, but may not be spent wisely.  He hoped that the money could be committed to a ten year effort for major infrastructural improvement in the region.  The Ambassador pointed out that the close cooperation was based on two years of preparation by the militaries of the US and India, who had held joint maneuvers to prepare for disaster response.  This daily contact between our militaries will deepen in the coming days as reconstruction takes off, he noted.  He called the formation of the core group of countries a \"significant signal\" and a positive sign of deepening ties.  Economic Development and Trade ------------------------------  7.  (SBU) Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia urged both countries to make economics the centerpiece of the India/US relationship.  He emphasized that economic opportunities would provide a firmer basis than military equipment sales, and result in a \"win win\" situation.\"  Scindia urged both countries to quickly address economic \"irritants\" such as IPR, outsourcing, and India's need for extensive infrastructural development, and take a good look at the social sector, particularly health and education.  Case studies demonstrate, he said, that it is not the amount of aid or investment that is important but how it is spent. With proper diligence, India could become the heart of a new economic zone.  PK Maheshwari complained that the US had benefited more from outsourcing and IT than India, and urged the US to lift import quotas on Indian products and end limits on the numbers of H visas issued to Indian IT professionals.  Anand Sharma complained of a lack of understanding of the interests of developing countries in new international regimes addressing the environment, trade, and economic development, resulting in discriminatory subsidies and tariffs.  8.  (SBU) Representative Blumenaur replied that there are not only differences between India and the US on these issues, but within Congress itself.  He pointed out that the United States was not in a strong position to address global warming and environmental issues because of its poor record, and this was a major irritant to developing countries.  He paraphrased PM Manmohan Singh, who said that if the rest of the world followed the American example regarding energy consumption, it would destroy the earth.  Congressman Leach emphasized that developing world concerns are \"well understood\" in the US, and the gap between the \"haves and the have nots\" must be addressed for us to have a humane world.  While the world needs a more open and competitive trading system, he noted, the US has a very open market, and its agricultural protectionism is only 1/6 that of the EU.  This does not give the developing world the right to institute protectionist trade barriers which actually put India at a \"disadvantage.\"  United Nations Reform ---------------------  9.  (SBU) \"Pioneer\" Editor and independent MP Chandran Mitra pointed out that there was a new issue that could cause problems between India and the US.  India wants a permanent seat on the UNSC, and the perception in India is that all the G-8 countries are supportive except the United States and China, and that the US is not interested in UN reform. Congressman Leach replied that he was a strong advocate of India and felt that it should be given a permanent seat on the UNSC.  Circumstances had changed, he said, and India now deserved the seat.  Close and Getting Closer ------------------------  10.  (SBU) Despite the open and frank discussion regarding problem issues, there was overall agreement that the US/India relationship is close and getting closer.  Anand Sharma emphasized that promoting US/India cooperation is essential, and that there must be a continuous dialogue on all issues at all levels between the two countries.  Noting that there has been a shift in relations over the past decade, Sharma pointed out that there is now a \"better awareness\" in the US regarding India and its interests.  Although the two countries have their respective and sometimes differing views on a number of issues, they share the same outlook on most things, including terrorism, world security, and the need for economic growth.  Dialog is essential at all levels, he reiterated, to \"further consolidate\" the relationship. Senator Brownback replied that the growth in the India/US relationship over the past five years has been \"phenomenal\" and it was good not only for the two countries, but for the world at large.  He agreed that there are a number of issues that India and the US can work together on to improve the region and the world, including extending freedom and democracy, and encouraging religious tolerance.  11.

REF: A. NEW DELHI 303      B. 04 NEW DELHI 7426  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reason 1.4 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary: The GOI has not yet agreed to the proposed February 7-9 dates for the SAARC Summit, and media reports indicate New Delhi has suggested February 6-7 instead.  The MEA remains tightlipped about the reasons for delay, but some New Delhi foreign policy watchers speculate that the SAARC indecision is connected to the major upcoming elections in the states of Bihar and Jharkhand, or the unsuccessful talks with Pakistan on the Baglihar Dam.  India is likely ultimately to agree to a Summit in February.  Further postponement of the Summit would put off progress on SAFTA negotiations, as well as a first-time meeting between PM Singh and Bangladeshi PM Khaleda Zia.  End Summary.   2.  (C) MEA Deputy Secretary (SAARC) Oscar Kerketta told Poloff on January 12 that there was still \"some haggling\" going on over the proposed dates.  While Kerketta said that the \"majority\" had accepted February 7-9, not all member states were on board (but declined to specify which countries had not yet agreed).  A well informed journalist reported that as of January 13, India was the only member who had not accepted the Summit, but predicted a decision within a few days.  The media reported on January 14 that India has suggested February 6-7 to Islamabad, which currently holds the SAARC chairmanship until Dhaka takes over at the Summit.  Elections No Excuse -------------------  3.  (C) Some commentators have attributed New Delhi's resistance to the February dates to upcoming elections in the battleground states of Bihar and Jharkhand, noting that February 7-9 falls between the first two phases, February 3 and 15.  \"Hindustan Times\" Deputy Editor Pramit Pal Chaudhary, however, dismissed this notion, remarking on January 13 that \"nothing big is on the stake for the Congress party\" in these states.  Raj Chengappa of \"India Today\" came to the same conclusion, as did the \"Business Standard's\" Aditi Phadnis, who said \"Sonia Gandhi, not PM Manmohan Singh, would be required for campaign and other poll exercises,\" and that \"assembly elections were not a potent reason for postponing the Summit.\"  It Wouldn't Be the First Time -----------------------------  4.  (C) Although the Dhaka Summit will mark SAARC's twentieth anniversary, it will only be the thirteenth summit, as seven summits have been nixed because of neighborly animosity. While this meeting does not appear to be in any imminent danger of being called off, observers in India suspect bilateral friction may be at the root of New Delhi's slow response to Dhaka's proposal.  Debunking the explanation that New Delhi wishes to avoid high-level travel during the state elections, political commentator Zafar Agha suggested that poor atmospherics between India and Pakistan following Islamabad's threat of World Bank arbitration to resolve the Baglihar Dam dispute (Ref A), have prompted New Delhi's reluctance to confirm the Summit, which normally includes bilateral meetings on the sidelines.  5.  (C) MEA officials have given other reasons for India's hesitation.  MEA Director (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives) TS Sandhu said it would not be appropriate for the PM and  SIPDIS Foreign Minister to be seen on non-tsunami related travel while parts of the country are still recovering from the disaster.  Kerketta of the SAARC desk ascribed the delay to ongoing discussion among the members as to which documents are to be signed, but he mentioned four agreements (Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, SAARC Arbitration Rules, Multilateral Double Taxation Treaty, Promotion and Protection of Investment Agreement) that the MEA expects to be finalized in Dhaka.  The Problems With Postponing ----------------------------  6.  (C) ORF Senior Fellow Jayshree Sengupta, who takes an admittedly pessimistic view of the organization (\"SAARC does not have a bright future\"), recently told Poloff that if India were to put off the Summit it would delay action on South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) negotiations and also postpone release of the Poverty Commission Report.  Sengupta described the report as useful in highlighting that all the SAARC countries suffer from the same problems.  MEA Joint Secretary (SAARC) V. Ashok had outlined an ambitious schedule  SIPDIS for SAARC implementation in a November 22 conversation with PolCouns (Ref B).  While he did not think the Dhaka Summit would include any significant announcements on SAFTA itself, he noted that the four agreements would be important to facilitate trade and investment in the region. Comment: Baglihar Theory Holds No Water ---------------------------------------  7.  (C) Despite the chatter among some commentators, we do not buy the theory that the GOI is using SAARC as a tool to show its displeasure with Islamabad.  This judgment is reinforced by the MEA's January 13 confirmation that Foreign Minister Natwar Singh will travel to Pakistan (shortly after the Summit) on February 15.  If India were as upset with Islamabad as some suggest (and we have seen little evidence of this), holding Natwar's visit hostage would be more effective with Islamabad than quibbling over SAARC. Postponing the Summit considerably would also put off the PM's first meeting with Bangladeshi PM Khaleda Zia, which provides an opportunity to make inroads into New Delhi's recent difficulties with Dhaka.  On balance, we still expect the GOI to agree to a Summit (and the PM's first trip to any of India's neighbors) in February. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: On January 12, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran) Arun K Singh and newly appointed Ambassador to Afghanistan Rakesh Sood provided an update on Indian projects in Afghanistan, noting proudly that with the exception of the Parliament building and the Pul-i-Khumri to Kabul power transmission line, all projects sponsored by the GOI were either under construction or nearing completion.  India remains committed to finishing the Pul-i-Khumri electric transmission line, and understands its importance for Afghanistan's long-term development, Singh said, promising that he would encourage financial approval for the project with a view to starting construction in April (with a roughly two-three year completion time).  The GOI would be open to new projects in Afghanistan, including those carried out in cooperation with the US.  Transit rights through Pakistan would allow the GOI to do more.  End Summary.  India Committed to Pul-i-Khumri -------------------------------  2.  (C) The Pul-i-Khumri to Kabul transmission line is \"still something India is prepared to do,\" Singh stated, noting that an Indian team had already done a survey of the site and that the project would soon go before the Indian cabinet for financial approval.  He promised to push for approval during the winter months, when construction cannot take place, and speculated that if all goes well, work could begin in April. Singh said he would encourage a planning team to go to Afghanistan, even while New Delhi was deciding on the funding, so that work could proceed as quickly as possible. He estimated that the project would take two-three years to complete, once work begins.  3.  (C) Asked about obstacles to the Pul-i-Khumri project, Singh replied that Taliban and Northern Alliance mines remain in the area, and hoped the US could provide assistance in this area.  The mountainous terrain presents another obstacle, he said.  Newly appointed Ambassador to Afghanistan Rakesh Sood remarked on the lack of transit rights through Pakistan.  If Indian equipment is allowed to transit Pakistan, \"maybe we can get somewhere\" on the Pul-i-Khumri line, he mused, noting the high cost of shipping Indian equipment via Iran.  Pakistan may not be ready for normal transit or trade, but this equipment is for aid, he stated, encouraging the US to raise the issue with Pakistan.  Sood told us that India would also appreciate US airlift assistance as necessary to move equipment through mountainous terrain.  4.  (C) PolCouns underlined the importance of the Pul-i-Khumri project for the immediate and long-term development of Afghanistan, and encouraged Singh to come back to us with ideas to move the project ahead as quickly as possible.  Singh said that India understands the importance of the Pul-i-Khumri line, and noted that the Afghan government had also stressed the significance of the project in bilateral meetings.  \"We understand that this is priority number one,\" because it would bring power to Kabul, he stated.  US-India Collaboration ----------------------  5.  (C) Singh stated that as a non-traditional donor, India is \"certainly stretched\" by providing aid to Afghanistan, but said New Delhi is open to new ideas for projects, as all the current projects are nearing completion.  The GOI hopes to focus on institution building and training programs for the Afghan government, and would like to broaden bilateral interaction to include education and health.  6.  (C) Sood emphasized the need to find projects on which the US and India could collaborate, noting that there are not enough projects where \"India can be seen working closely with the US.\"  PolCouns noted USAID Administrator Natsios' earlier discussion on US-India collaboration in Afghanistan, and stressed the need for greater information sharing on on-going Indian projects there through our missions in Kabul.  Sood also encouraged the idea of direct contacts between Indian consulates in Afghanistan and the relevant US PRTs.  7.  (SBU) Singh provided an update on other on-going projects in Afghanistan, saying that:  -- Construction teams and equipment for the Zaranj-Delaram road have been on the ground since December.  The project is expected to take two years to complete;  -- Work is already underway on the Salma Dam and will be completed within four years;  -- Indian builders have completed construction of cold storage food warehouses in Khandahar;  -- Construction on the Habibia school will be completed in 2005;  -- Renovation of the Indira Gandhi hospital will be completed by March or April;  -- India still plans to construct a new building for the Afghan parliament, but the Afghan government has not yet selected land for the project.  According to Singh, \"the ball is in the Afghan court.\"  Uncomfortable With Taliban Rehabilitation -----------------------------------------  8.  (C) India remains \"very uncomfortable\" with the idea of Taliban rehabilitation, Singh stated, arguing that even if they were not involved in the atrocities of Taliban rule, former Taliban adherents still subscribed to a radical Islamic ideology.  Now is the time to build up moderate leaders, he argued, speculating that rehabilitated Taliban would seek to \"fill the leadership vacuum in Pashtun areas.\"  9.  (U) Minimize considered.

Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) New Delhi has publicly downplayed the January 18 evening incident of artillery fire at the LOC, the first such case since guns fell silent in November 2003, and has assigned its Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to discuss the incident with his Pakistani counterpart via a regularly scheduled weekly hotline call.  Immediately following the incident, a 16th Corps spokesman in J&K gave Pakistan the benefit of the doubt, telling the press \"we will not like to accuse the Pakistan Army, as we have to investigate first whether militants have fired from across the LOC.\"  The message from Delhi was similar, with an Army spokesman emphasizing on January 18 that India was \"exercising full restraint.\"  2.  (C) Media have reported that the two DGMOs spoke on the morning of January 19.  Relating the content of that conversation, Vice Chief of the Army Staff LtG Bhupinder Thakur said Pakistan did not know who had fired the artillery, and had agreed to investigate the incident.  Again not excluding the possibility that militants may have been source of the firing, Thakur said that 82mm shells were \"available with terrorists,\" adding that \"we will take it on a case-by-case basis.\"  The incident, allegedly involving about 15 mortar shells fired into the Poonch area in three salvos of 60mm and 82mm shells during a two hour period in the evening of January 17, reportedly wounded one local girl.  The MEA had no immediate reaction.  3.  (C) The incident, which Indian sources attribute to the Pakistani military, has sparked speculation as to its rationale, given that Indo-Pak relations were otherwise normalizing, and the 2003 ceasefire was one of the most significant bilateral achievements since former PM Vajpayee's \"Hand of Friendship\" speech in April 2003.  --Some Army sources reportedly linked the incident to a failed attempt on January 17 in which the Indian army killed five infiltrators.  According to this theory, Islamabad was seeking to prevent Indian from recovering the bodies and finding out more about their origin and activities.  --Another more bizarre theory suggests that it was an expression of disapproval by Pakistan over the lack of progress in the Baglihar dispute.  --The most unsual hypothesis came from Srinagar, where some journalists speculated that India might be behind the incident, in order to divert attention from the Baglihar case, after Pakistan on January reportedly formally approached the World Bank for mediation.  A well-informed Jammu-based Indian correspondent saw a connection between the incident, the abrupt cancellation of a 400-man unit that was supposed to have been de-inducted (withdrawn) from J&K, and the recent failed infiltration attempt, calling the case \"Indian mischief.\"  Comment -------  4.  (C) The GOI has dealt with this incident as it has following the few minor LOC ceasefire incidents since November 2003 -- by downplaying them publicly, clarifying them with Pakistan at the military level via established channels, and then closing the chapter.  We are also heartened that there has been virtually no public echo in the political arena, including from the opposition BJP which in an earlier phase of Indo-Pak relations would have made much of this occasion for anti-Pakistan rhetoric.  Aside from criticism of the government's handling of the Composite Dialogue, the BJP has been silent, yet another indication that the Indian political class is prepared to subordinate blips like this to the larger interest in reconstructing India's ties with Pakistan.

Mulford, Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary: The poor security situation in Nepal, instability of the government in Kathmandu, and uncertainty over future GON willingness to deliver on any inherited agreements will hinder the refugee repatriation process, Bhutanese Ambassador Lyonpo Dago  Tshering told the Ambassador on January 19.  During the meeting, the Ambassador passed PRM A/S Dewey's letter to King Wangchuck (reftel) to Tshering and reiterated USG interest in helping to restart  SIPDIS the refugee repatriation process.  Tshering related that his government had heard rumors of an upcoming military offensive by Nepalese forces against the Maoists.  The draft constitution is now being reviewed by the Cabinet and the King plans to \"take the document to the people\" in February. End Summary.  Security and Stability ----------------------  2.  (C) Ambassador Tshering reiterated that the RGOB is not willing to restart the work of the Joint Verification Teams (JVT) under the current security situation in Nepal.  He added that if another attack on refugee verification workers occurred similar to the December 22, 2003 incident, there would be \"enormous problems back home.\"  He also expressed reservations about the current political developments in Nepal, questioning whether advancing the repatriation process at this time would not cause additional problems.  \"We want to be part of the solution, but not part of the Nepalese problem,\" he said, implying that resettling the Category 1 refugees at this time might be destabilizing in Nepal.  He had little confidence in the current Nepalese government's ability to remain in power, and noted that the other six opposition factions have already stated they would not abide by agreements made by the Deuba administration.  Letter Diplomacy ----------------  3.  (C) The Ambassador then delivered A/S Dewey's letter (reftel) stressing USG interest in creating momentum in the repatriation process.  The Ambassador highlighted the message that spelling out King Wangchuck's plan clearly to the GON could only be positive, and that a unilateral initiative to repatriate Category 1 refugees immediately could break the ice and get the process moving.  Ambassador Tshering pledged RGOB support to the repatriation process, adding that Thimphu is open to such a repatriation, but that a dialogue with the GON needs to begin and that Kathmandu should draft the next letter.  4.  (C) Tshering described how he had engaged with his Nepalese counterpart shortly after the Dewey/Wangchuck plan was announced in October, but the Nepalese Ambassador told him he did not have a mandate to discuss the issue.  In response to the Ambassador's question as to whether there had been any subsequent contact, and Tshering answered that the only engagement between the two governments was the initial exchange of letters.  He complained that the letter from the GON focused solely on restarting the JVT process and not on the repatriation of Category 1 refugees.  Maoists -------  5.  (C) Tshering postulated that if the security situation in Nepal improved, the JVT process would quickly be back on track.  However, when questioned whether that was likely, he quickly said no, adding that he had heard rumors of an upcoming military offensive by the GON against the Maoists and asked if the USG had heard anything about it.  (Comment: Embassy has no information about such military action.  End Comment)  Constitution ------------ 6.  (SBU) Tshering concluded the meeting by announcing that the draft constitution is ready and is currently being reviewed by the Cabinet.  The King plans to take the document to Bhutan's 20 districts for the people's review in February.  No date has been set for its official release or adoption, and it will need a second review by the Cabinet following the King's \"road show\" and then a vote in the National Assembly. Tshering said that the constitution will not change current  SIPDIS citizenship laws. MULFORD " }

SINGAPORE 148      B. 04 STATE 275091      C. 04 NEW DELHI 8051  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary: Following the November 2004 ASEAN Plus One Summit in Vientiane, the MEA scoffed at the idea of an East Asia Summit, but a recent conversation with MEA Joint Secretary (Southeast Asia Two) Biren Nanda indicates India  SIPDIS has shifted from that position.  It now appears that India, if invited, would welcome the opportunity to participate. The Singapore High Commission has told us that India has not made a concerted effort to secure an invitation, which may reflect what one New Delhi foreign policy expert describes as the GOI's perception that Southeast Asia wants India's presence in the region as a balance to China.  End Summary.  India Changes Its Mind ----------------------  2.  (C) In a January 14 meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, the MEA's Biren Nanda avoided a detailed discussion of the East Asia Summit (EAS), but his quiet insistence that India's participation was up to the ASEAN members was in sharp contrast to his colleague, Joint Secretary (Southeast Asia One) Mitra Vashishta's (protect) vehement dismissal of the Summit in December (ref C).  Whereas Vashishta argued that the EAS would be \"a waste of time,\" telling PolCouns that one of the GOI's objectives in Vientiane was to make New Delhi's position known, Nanda said India was interested in closer ties with ASEAN, and would be happy to participate in an EAS if invited.  Disguising his earlier enthusiasm, later in the conversation Nanda reiterated that India's invitation to the EAS was ASEAN's decision to make, adding that \"we have engagement through ASEAN Plus One.\"  New Delhi's Not Trying Very Hard --------------------------------  3.  (C) Singapore High Commission First Secretary Edmund Chia told Poloff on January 20 that if India is not included in the first EAS, it will not be possible to have New Delhi participate for a long time.  The majority inclination in ASEAN right now, he continued, is not to invite India, adding that Singapore does support bringing in the GOI, as reported in ref A.  Part of the problem, Chia remarked, is that New Delhi is not trying very hard.  He characterized New Delhi's foreign policy attitude as more focused on the larger countries and regions, particularly, the US, the EU, and sometimes China.  Therefore, no one in the GOI really pays attention to Southeast or East Asia until the Foreign Minister is about to take a trip.  While India would probably like to be included in the EAS, Chia observed, he has seen no GOI lobbying for it.  They Really Like Us -------------------  4.  (C) In December, the MEA's Vashishta commented to PolCouns that \"Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are all on our side, because of the magic of the PM.\"  Capturing that attitude, Jawarhalal Nehru University Professor of East Asian Studies Manmohini Kaul remarked to Poloff recently on Southeast Asia's view of New Delhi, \"India is wanted in the region, but the question is, how keen is India?\"  New Delhi is still \"preoccupied\" with South Asia as an area of immediate and ongoing concern, she noted, explaining that India is more comfortable with South Asian groupings where India is \"in the driver's seat\" than it is in the more diverse and competitive ASEAN milieu.  On the GOI's East Asia policy, Kaul, who is also on a kitchen cabinet of advisors to the Indian Foreign Secretary, pointed out that India does want to play a larger role, but is not \"executing\" the way China has.  Comment -------  5.  (C) With the assumption in the Foreign Ministry that the invitation is in the mail, GOI opposition to the EAS seems to have vanished.  As we had suspected, GOI opposition to the EAS was rooted in a fear of being left out, more than concerns about redundancy with ASEAN Plus Three.  In contrast to the MEA attitude at the Laos Summit, Nanda's recent comments (\"it's up to ASEAN\") reflect the non-proactive position Singapore has observed.  India appears unwilling to make the effort to secure a seat at the EAS, but will certainly take notice if not invited, as is the case with the GOI's lingering unhappiness at not being involved with APEC.

(C) The Ambassador used a January 20 meeting with MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar to press for a timely reply to the US requests conveyed via ref A and to underline the importance of India coming to us with draft export control legislation and other outstanding items related to Phase 2 of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP).  Jaishankar acknowledged the importance of our request and promised a reply on the trade-related items connected to the High Technology Cooperation Group.  However, he warned, \"we have a problem\" regarding the NSSP.  Echoing comments we have heard from others in the Indian system, Jaishankar reported that officials of India's nuclear establishment have reached the judgment that there is nothing for them in the NSSP, and as a result have become outspokenly opposed to Indian movement on our quid-pro-quos.  (Indeed, a well connected GOI consultant told us recently that the Atomic Energy Commission - AEC -has been circulating memos within the Indian interagency actively opposing the export control steps associated with the NSSP).  2. (C) Because the AEC plays such an important role in India's technology sector, Jaishankar explained, the MEA cannot move ahead without them.  He expressed concern that if we cannot find some way to bolster the civil nuclear element of our interaction, we may be faced with a period of limited progress in the NSSP.  3. (C) Comment: The GOI has been frustrated from the beginning by the tight constraints that Washington has imposed on our revived civil nuclear relationship, and in this context, we do not rule out the possibility that New Delhi is using the threat of an NSSP impasse to re-open that issue.  However, there was nothing in Jaishankar's presentation to the Ambassador (or other conversations we have had with senior Indians) to suggest that New Delhi is playing that game.  We believe the MEA is resolved to move ahead on the Rice-Mishra export control benchmarks, but has been thwarted by opposition from elsewhere in the Indian interagency.  For instance, during the recent round of Israel-India non-proliferation consultations, the Indians asked all the right questions on issues such as how Jerusalem controls the activities of non-government scientists and the mechanics of MTCR adherence.  The Israelis left with the impression that New Delhi is resolved to modernize its export controls, but is still working through the \"how's.\"  Prime Minister Singh's recent presentations to Codel's Frist and Leach also emphasized the GOI commitment to maintain a clean export control record.  4. (C) Against this background, we should think hard about whether there are steps that we could take (including cooperation on nuclear fusion -- Ref B) that would help to win over the skeptics in India's scientific community who might otherwise stand in the way of our NSSP partnership.  In this regard, we would like to encourage Washington to keep the door open for possible Indian participation in ITER.  We understand that adding members to the ITER consortium is problematic.  However, perhaps we should not deter India from in-kind contributions to the ITER effort.  The upcoming visit by NRC Commissioner Merrifield will provide another opportunity to reach out to India's nuclear establishment, as will the Nuclear Disaster Management Activity proposed by NNSA (Ref D).  But without something additional to sweeten the pot, we may find that slow progress on the nuclear leg of the NSSP becomes an impediment to Indian movement on the export control steps that we have long sought from New Delhi -- and which the Indian foreign ministry now appears ready to deliver.

Mulford.  Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (U) This is an action request for SA.  Please see paragraph 7.  2.  (S) The LOC ceasefire is one of the most important achievements in the slow but steady Indo-Pak rapproachement process that began in mid-2003 with former PM Vajpayee's \"Hand of Friendship\" speech, but without US engagement that accomplishment could soon founder.  Despite shelling of the Indian side of the LOC twice in three days (January 18 and 20), both governments have responded in a measured and serious manner, conscious that the 14 months of silence along the LOC has come to symbolize the de-escalation of the Indo-Pak conflict, while providing tens of thousands of Kashmiris the longest respite from daily shelling since the 1999 Kargil War.  The ceasefire, the first formally observed in peacetime between the two countries since 1947, has fueled hopes for broader progress in military CBMs.  These instances of shelling, if they do not stop, could spill over into the Composite Dialogue and negatively affect the broad sense of goodwill that exists in India for fixing relations with Pakistan.  3.  (S) Thus far, we see no indication that these two incidents were anything more than isolated cases.  Senior GOI officials have played them down, giving Islamabad the benefit of the doubt and accepting for public consumption the explanation put forward by the Pakistani military that their forces had nothing to do with them (although doubt remains regarding the January 18 incident, which reportedly involved 82mm shells, an armament not known to be part of the militants' arsenal).  Local discussion concerns primarily whether the firing originated from \"frustrated elements of the Pakistan army\" or insurgents bent on covering an infiltration attempt or retaliating against the Indian military for interdicting recent crossings.  4.  (C) These ceasefire breaches coincide with renewed speculation about a resumption of cross border terrorist infiltration.  In a front page story, \"The Hindu\" reported on January 24 that Indian troops are on high alert along the LOC following a spurt in infiltration attempts and intercepted radio messages indicating a buildup of terrorists in camps in Pakistani Kashmir.  Author Luv Puri confirmed to us that one such message spoke of a \"passing out parade of 3,000 terrorists under the banner of the United Jihad Council.\"  5.  (S) Speaking January 24 with Polcouns, MEA Joint Secretary AK Singh (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) indicated  SIPDIS that he was not yet ready to blame Islamabad for the resumption of shelling.  However, he argued that at the very least the Pakistan military needs to explain how the firing had been allowed from sites very close to its encampments. Some Indian officials have speculated that the January 20 incident may have been caused by terrorists seeking to provoke India into retaliating and wrecking the ceasefire. Indian advocates of this line of thinking argue that the insurgents and hardline elements of the Pakistani armed forces want the ceasefire to break down.  We leave it to Islamabad to assess the likelihood of this scenario, but Indian media have quoted General Officer Commanding, Northern Command, LtG Hari Prasad as saying that if this theory is accurate, the militants would have to have support from the Pakistani military, as \"shelling is not possible without the Pak army's help.\"  6.  (S)  Regardless of who is responsible, there should be no ambiguity regarding the view of the United States regarding ceasefire breaches.  With the Indian media reporting that Pakistan has agreed to probe these violations, the bilateral process of dealing with these blips is underway, attesting to the two countries' interest in dealing with the matter themselves.  If further investigation should reveal strong evidence that the firing originated from the Pakistani military, or if further such incidents should be recorded, it would have a negative effect on the GOI pro-peace constituency, and undermine the New Delhi consensus to ignore the attacks, which COAS General NC Vij described as \"trivial\" and J&K Governor SK Sinha called \"an aberration\" on January 22.  The GOI is likely to view the January 24 grenade attack against PDP President Mehbooba Mufti (she escaped uninjured) as further evidence that Islamabad is in the process of loosening the reins on terrorist violence.  7.  (S) Action recommendation:  We urge the Department to issue a firm statement: -- supporting the ceasefire; -- reiterating our unequivocal opposition to cross border terrorist infiltration; -- condemning the recent shelling, and; -- reaffirming our support for the Composite Dialogue process.

Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Indian Shias are excited about the prospect of a Shia government in Iraq, revere Ayatollah Sistani and support the January 30 election.  This does not mean, however, that they are pro-American, as they also want US troops to depart Iraq as soon as possible and Iraq and Iran to have close and friendly ties.  A leading Shia cleric reflected the views of the larger community when he asserted that India's Sunnis do not share these views and distrust the Shia assent to power in Iraq, with some harboring quiet sympathy with the insurgency and its call for an election boycott.  Although influential in their stronghold in Lucknow, the Shia are a relatively small and economically disadvantaged community in India (numbering an estimated 14 million), and as a result, their views regarding events in Iraq will not be the last word on Indian reaction to the Iraq elections.  However, we will seek to encourage them to project their support for upcoming elections to wider Indian audiences.  End Summary.  Zahir Iftikhari ---------------  2.  (C) Zahir Iftikhari is an influential Shia cleric from Lucknow.  His grandfather was a famous Shia scholar, who wrote a number of influential books on Islam.  Iftikhari is playing a prominent role in recent Indian Shia moves to leave the current Muslim Personal Law Board and establish a strictly Shia organization.  He spent seventeen years studying Islam in Iraq and is a fluent Arabic speaker, although he does not speak English.  With his sterling reputation and large following, Iftikhari often speaks on behalf of India's Shia community.  Like many Indian Shia, he follows Iraqi politics in minute detail.  He met with Poloff on January 20.  Iraqi Shias' Big Day --------------------  3.  (C) Iftikhari asserted that Indian Shias strongly support the January 30 Iraqi elections, and predicted that there would be a large Shia turnout.  January 30 is a Shia holiday and Iraqi Shias are likely to be out and about and in a festive mood.  Iftikhari expected Iraqi Shias to ignore the Sunni boycott call, and looked forward to a peaceful assumption of power by their community, after having been denied political rights under Sunni rule for so long.  4.  (C) Iftikhari was adamant that Iraqi Shia would not establish an Iranian style theocracy when they assume power in Baghdad.  Pointing out that the Shia had experienced repression, murder and destruction of their holy places under Saddam, he projected that they would be munificent towards the Sunni, not attempt to gain retribution, and make concessions to head off communal violence.  Iftikhari downplayed the likelihood of a Sunni/Shia civil war after the election, asserting that Baathist supporters of Saddam are behind most of the terrorism, and that a quick trial and execution of Saddam and his associates would end the violence and the threat of civil war.  Minority Within a Minority --------------------------  5.  (C) According to Iftikhari, Shias in India tolerate their Sunni brethren, but the Sunnis have no tolerance for Shia Islam, and treat Shias as second class citizens.  He asserted that this difference is reflected in the attitudes of the two communities regarding the Iraqi election, with Indian Sunni supporting a boycott and delay and Shias eager to see the election go forward as planned.  Likewise, he noted, Indian Shia have no sympathy with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and other Sunnis in Iran who are committing acts of terrorism, implying that Indian Sunnis are more equivocal on this score.  6.  (C) Iftikhari asserted that Indian Shias are united behind Ayatollah Sistani and will adhere to his calls to support the Iraq election and to create a secular state. Indian Shia also want strict controls on the power of the Iraqi government to interfere with the personal lives of Iraq's citizens, as the Indian Shia are a minority within the larger Indian Muslim minority, and realize the importance of tolerance.  7.  (C) Although Iran is the leading Shia nation, Iftikari pointed out, that its government has little or no credibility with Indian Shias, who view it as too orthodox and authoritarian.  Despite this, Indian Shia praise Ayatollah Khomeini for fighting only against Iraq's Baathist government and never supporting terrorism against Sunni civilians.  He also claimed that Khomeini only overthrew the Shah after his despotism became unbearable, and with the \"complete support of Iran's population.\"  He predicted that after the election there would be much closer interaction between Iran and Iraq, as \"99 percent of Iranians\" will come to Iraq to visit the holy places.  Comment -------  8.  (C) Iftikhari is only one of many Shia leaders who have told Poloff of their support for the elections in Iraq. However, this does not necessarily translate into backing for continued American involvement there.  Most Shia expect Sistani to be the real power in Iraq after the polls, that he will call for the coalition forces to withdraw, and that the Iraqi government will distance itself from the US after our troops depart.  Sunni contacts confirm Iftikari's assessment, in that they largely oppose American involvement in Iraq and the elections, which they view as a Shia power grab.  India's shia -- especially the clerical hierarchy in Lucknow -- maintain a tight link to Iraq, and were a factor in the GOI's 2002 decision not to deploy military forces.  However, the Shia are a minority within the Muslim community (estimated at 10 percent of 140 million), so their view is not the last word on Indian reaction to the Iraq elections.  9.

Blake, Jr.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D).  1.  (C) Summary: The Pugwash-sponsored conference on Kashmir held in Kathmandu last December has reinforced growing GOI receptivity towards contact between Kashmiris from India and Pakistan, and New Delhi is considering proposals for a follow-on meeting, possibly in Srinagar, according to Kashmir Interlocutor NN Vohra.  Kashmiri separatist participants called the seminar \"very good,\" even \"spectacular\" -- better than other events in Europe or North America in recent years, because its venue allowed for much broader participation and more extensive interaction between Kashmiri activists and those who write about the issue.  While the New Delhi-Hurriyat dialogue remains completely stalled, GOI openness to more cross LOC contact is positive, and meetings like this can serve as placeholders of sorts until conditions improve for restarting a formal dialogue.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Academic and policy conferences on Kashmir tend to be of limited value for several reasons: 1) usually sponsored by a clearly pro-India or pro-Pakistan group, they are perceived as \"biased,\" thus depriving them of credibility with major constituencies; 2) the \"right people\" are not there, usually because they boycott, are prevented from leaving their countries, cannot obtain visas, or do not want to accept travel funds from the organizers or cannot/do not wish to pay their own way; and 3) discussion reviews well-worn positions and does little to advance the thinking of people who matter (GOI, GOP, and major players in J&K).  These weaknesses have been part of the Kashmir seminar landscape for decades, and continue to characterize the vast majority of periodic efforts by academics, politicians, and others to discuss this issue seriously outside India and Pakistan.  Unqualified Success -------------------  3.  (C) Following the December 11-14 seminar, our conversations with a number of the participants (as a supplement to Kathmandu's timely and useful report (reftel)) indicate that this event was unusually successful, because many Kashmiris and other well-informed observers attended, and because they represented most major shades of non-official GOI and Kashmiri opinion.  Perhaps most importantly, the session proved to GOI skeptics that India can benefit from facilitating more contact between Indian and Pakistani Kashmiris, including separatists.  Press reports that this was the first such meeting of Kashmiri leaders from both sides since 1947 were somewhat exaggerated, in that Kashmiris have met at conferences outside the country in the past, but we are unaware of a case in which such a large number of influential Kashmir-related people (ca. 45) met for so many days at one time, and spoke so extensively with each other.  Separatists -----------  4.  (C) Moderate All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leaders were uniformly positive about the event, praising the organizers in particular for bringing Kashmiris from both sides of the LOC together for four days of talks, and expressing appreciation that New Delhi did not block their travel.  Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told D/Polcouns recently that the very fact that the meeting took place was a great achievement.  Until his plane departed, he had expected the GOI to prevent him and other Kashmiris from going, and he was surprised to be able to attend at all.  (We know that NSA Dixit personally intervened to make this travel possible.) Well-organized conferences cannot fix the Kashmir problem, but similar meetings would be useful in bringing people together who would otherwise have little or no opportunity to communicate with each other on this issue, he stated.  5.  (C) The Hurriyat's Prof. AG Bhat was struck by the fact that the Indian authorities had allowed him to travel without an Indian passport or other official GOI-issued document, but on the basis of a piece of paper he had drafted himself.  It was his first ever trip outside India (he is in his 60s), and he clearly relished the opportunity to meet so many people he had only read about.  Some participants came with open minds, others were ideologues, and still others represented official Indian and Pakistani positions, but this produced \"spectacular\" interactions, and a certain \"togetherness,\" he said.  He characterized the general consensus among participants as: 1) there is no military solution to the Kashmir problem; 2) the Kashmiris should not suffer any longer; and 3) Kashmir is a hurdle in the path of progress for the peoples of India and Pakistan.  6. (C) Representing pro-independence views, \"Kashmir Times\" editor Ved Bhasin called the seminar \"a meeting of minds.\" Discussion was open, and there was none of the bitterness he had expected.  The most notable part was a separate dialogue between Kashmiris conducted by Kashmiri-American Farooq Kathwari.  JKLF leader Yasin Malik did not attend, and his representative Ghulam Rasool Dar did not contribute to the discussion, according to participants.  The GOI also permitted a representative of Shabir Shah's pro-independence faction of the Hurriyat to travel, which no one expected. Hardline pro-Pak activist SAS Geelani's did not attend, although he was approached.  Non-Official Indians --------------------  6.  (C) Former Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan G Parthasarathy highlighted the unusual mix of Kashmiris from both sides of the LOC, who discussed their views frankly at great length, focused on ways to make Kashmiris' lives more secure, and agreed to meet again.  He described a consensus among participants that the LOC ceasefire should be made permanent, that violence of all kinds should end, and that all concerned should refrain from actions that incite violence.  A reduction of GOI and GOP security presence would also be welcome.  He was struck by the yearning for more contact between Kashmiris.  He criticized New Delhi's position on documentation for the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus, arguing that as India claims this territory as its own anyway, passports should not be necessary.  He was also skeptical of the argument that more cross LOC travel would increase terrorism, and called for greater interaction between Kargil and Skardu, not just J&K and POK.  Finally, he noted the absence of leaders from the Congress Party, BJP, PDP and National Conference, and from the Northern Areas in Pakistan (some were invited).  Strategist C Raja Mohan added that the conference was not supposed to come up with any solutions, but if the initiative were sustained, it might come up with a \"wee bit of political space\" for Delhi and Islamabad to explore.  GOI Positive ------------  7.  (C) The GOI has also been unusually positive about this event, not because it was \"pro-Indian\" (it was not), but because senior officials have been changing their minds about the utility of such meetings.  In a conversation with D/Polcouns on January 24, Kashmir Interlocutor NN Vohra summarized New Delhi's position as \"not only to allow it to happen, but to ensure that it would.\"  MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan Iran) AK Singh told Polcouns that the conference was a success from the Foreign Ministry's perspective.  The GOI intelligence agencies had reservations about some participants' travel, but Dixit intervened to guarantee that they be able to go.  Several particpants told Vohra of unusually candid exchanges between Kashmiris in particular, whose positions faced scrutiny in a semi-public manner.  Vohra welcomed the fact that the sloganeering that passes for debate on Kashmir was subjected to debate.  Vohra also confirmed a late December \"Hindu\" story which reported that the GOI is keen to allow more contact between Kashmiris, including with APHC leaders.  This receptivity extends to those from Pakistani Kashmir who wish to visit India, he said.  Comment -------  8.  (C) The Pugwash meeting was only a seminar, but it had one important consequence: it reinforced evolving GOI attitudes on the utility of contact between Kashmiris and others who think about the problem.  Interaction between Indian and Pakistani Kashmiris has always been subject to political interference from New Delhi and Islamabad, but we are struck by the event's positive after-effects in official Delhi, which holds the door open for more such meetings in the future.  This kind of event cannot be a substitute for the stalled dialogue between New Delhi and the moderate Hurriyat, but it can serve as a placeholder until conditions for formal talks improve.  APHC leaders noted the greater GOI openness.  In the absence of significant initiatives on the New Delhi-Srinagar axis, more contact of this nature between Kashmiris can only be positive. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary:  The unprecedented meeting with Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi marked the highlight of Canadian PM Paul Martin's January 18 trip to New Delhi, Canadian Embassy PolCouns Adrian Norfolk told PolCouns and Poloff on January 25.  Canadian PM Paul Martin also met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, and President Adbul Kalam.  While the visit did not produce any formal agreements and did not delve into nuclear issues, the two countries discussed possible collaboration on a tsunami early warning system and cooperation in science and technology.  Press coverage of the event focused on the issue of gay marriage, which Canada has just legalized and Sikh spiritual leaders oppose.  The trip, rescheduled to include stops in Thailand and Sri Lanka after the tsunami disaster, also included visits to China and Japan.  End Summary.  Sonia Speaks ------------  2.  (C) The unprecedented meeting with Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi marked the highlight of Canadian PM Paul Martin's January 18 trip to New Delhi, Canadian Embassy PolCouns Adrian Norfolk told PolCouns and Poloff on January 25.  Given Mrs Gandhi's refusal to meet with other visiting Heads of State, including German Chancellor Schroeder and Russian President Putin, the meeting was unusual.  Norfolk said that Gandhi seemed at ease talking about economic development issues, noting that the Congress Party success in the May 2004 elections resulted from the widespread feeling among the rural population that economic growth had proceeded unevenly.  She pointed to the UPA coalition's Common Minimum Program as a blueprint for addressing economic inequities, and stated that caste also remains a problem.  Responding to Martin's emphasis on the need for greater Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, Gandhi reportedly underlined the \"lingering suspicion\" of Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) \"due to Enron\" (a reference to the Maharashtra power dispute).  Peacekeeping ------------  3.  (C) Norfolk characterized Martin's meeting with PM Manmohan Singh as positive, noting that the two had known each other when they both served as Finance Ministers. Martin raised the role of Canada and India in peacekeeping operations and the question of whether to intervene in failed states.  PM Manmohan Singh cautioned against this, arguing that \"filling vacuums in post-colonial societies could lead to neo-colonial systems.\"  FM Natwar Singh expressed concern over the \"embattled\" state of the United Nations and the need for a strengthened peacekeeping system.  Neither side broke new ground of the high profile issue of Security Council reform.  Natwar on Wahhabism -------------------  4.  (C) According to Norfolk, FM Natwar Singh argued that although oil exporting countries had tried to export Wahhabism to India, the networks of Islamic universities based in India had prevented this.  Natwar expressed an interest in strengthening Indian government schools to provide vocational training and counter the influence of madrassas along the border with Bangladesh.  He also emphasized a distinction between \"state-sponsored terrorism in J&K\" and the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people, Norfolk told us.  Cooperation in Science and Technology --------------------------------------  5.  (C) President Abdul Kalam reportedly emphasized the need for greater scientific collaboration between India and Canada, Norfolk said.  He argued that this information sharing should be done \"lab to lab\" and that governments should play a minimal role.  According to a joint press statement and our MEA contacts, the two countries agreed to encourage greater collaboration in selected areas of science and industrial technologies.  They did not, however, engage substantively on the issue of civilian nuclear power -- where Canada's historical involvement provoked periodic hope of re-engagement by Ottawa.  This issue figures in a series of enhanced foreign office consultations the two side committed to undertake.  Gay Marriage ----------------  6.  (U) The issue of gay-marriage also dominated headlines during the PM's visit.  During a joint conference, a reporter asked Manmohan Singh to comment on Canada's law permitting marriage of same-sex couples, in light of its condemnation by the most revered priest in the Sikh religion (to which Manmohan Singh belongs).  Singh declined to comment, but noted that a similar law would probably not have wide support in India. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr., for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (C) The classified briefing on the Patriot PAC-2 missile defense (MD) system, currently scheduled for February 22 or 23, has generated a great deal of interest within the Indian government, with senior GOI officials hopeful that this will be the beginning of a broader MD relationship with the US. GOI officials who are expected to attend the briefing include MEA A/S Meera Shankar, MOD J/S Gautam Mukhopadhaya, as well as senior Army, Air Force, DRDO, and Acquisition reps.  We have also heard expressions of interest from the PMO -- although NSA Narayanan, unlike his predecessor Mani Dixit, has not yet pronounced himself in favor of the US-India MD relationship.  As the GOI is only in the initial stages of formulating its missile defense doctrine, government and military representatives at the meeting may raise policy questions about MD beyond the scope of the technical capabilities of the PAC-2.  Post welcomes the participation of senior USG officials who might be able to address such policy questions should they arise.  2. (C) This PAC-2 briefing comes in the context of an underdeveloped military sales relationship that we are now seeking seriously to energize.  Getting a long sought-after breakthrough military sale -- whether a Patriot or any other major platform -- will be an uphill campaign.  In a recent interview in New Delhi's \"National Review,\" Defense Minister Mukherjee summarized some of India's complaints about military procurements from the US, \"We have problems buying arms from you because your laws are very strict.  At any point you may have to clamp sanctions on us.\"  In this context, we can not afford to be ambivalent in the message we send on the PAC-2 system, since any sign of US wavering will be seized on by those who remain skeptical of US reliability.  Key in this regard will be the US message that the PAC-2 offer is a step toward PAC-3, which is what India ultimately hopes to purchase. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 11.  2.  (C) Summary: MK Narayanan, formally named on January 25 as India's new NSA, will be a different kind of National Security Adviser than his high-profile, powerful predecessors, JN Dixit and Brajesh Mishra.  After several weeks of debate over who and what kind of a NSA the country needs, PM Manmohan Singh has decided on the low-profile Narayanan in a scaled-down role.  The new NSA will reportedly lose key portfolios Dixit and Mishra had, including the backchannel with Pakistan and negotiator for boundary talks with China, and the rest of the job description remains unclear, but Narayanan will apparently be tasked with reinvigorating India's national security institutions, such as its moribund NSC.  The NSA's reduced diplomatic function is a victory for the Foreign Minister, who had fought to regain the dominant role in Indian foreign policy he lost to Mani Dixit.  Narayanan will be joined by a new deputy NSA and new RAW and IB chiefs.  In the weeks ahead, the GOI will define the NSA position further, but for now we do not appear to have with Narayanan the \"one-stop shop\" for all foreign policy issues that we enjoyed with his two predecessors. Mission recommends an early introductory phone call from NSA Hadley to his new counterpart.  End Summary.  Narayanan Gets Dixit's Title; Job is Evolving ---------------------------------------------  3.  (C) The January 25 announcement that acting NSA MK Narayanan would replace JN Dixit on a permanent basis has not ended speculation on what kind of an NSA Narayanan will be. PMO Minister of State Prithviraj Chavan recently told reporters that \"a redefinition of the role of the NSA may be in the cards,\" while PM Singh reportedly sounded out over a dozen people over the past three weeks -- including Mishra, former Defense Secretary K Subrahmanyan, and former High Commissioner to Pakistan SK Lambah -- to that effect. Although no official announcements in this regard have yet been made, press reports citing unnamed GOI officials suggest that Narayanan will retain his internal security portfolio but will not take up the diplomatic roles of his predecessors.  Numerous media commentators have opined that the change will permit Narayanan to address other NSA functions, such as internal and economic security, which Dixit and Mishra neglected.  Giving Diplomacy Back to the MEA --------------------------------  4.  (C) The widely rumored selection of Satish Lambah (septel) to serve as the backchannel with Pakistani NSA Tariq Aziz on Indo-Pak talks reinforces the GOI's transformation of the NSA position, as does FM Natwar Singh's thinly-veiled indication -- reported on January 28 by well-connected \"Times of India\" Foreign Affairs correspondent Indrani Bagchi -- that retired UN PermRep Vijay Nambiar would take up the charge of Special Envoy for the India-China boundary talks. (NOTE: On January 27, Lambah told PolCouns that no decision had yet been made regarding his appointment.  End Note.) Both Lambah and Nambiar are viewed as close to Natwar, which extends the MEA's clear victory in lodging diplomacy firmly \"back where it belongs.\"  Narayanan is expected to accompany PM Singh to the February 6-7 SAARC Summit, where he will have the opportunity to meet the Pakistanis, not as India's point-person on foreign policy, but as an aide to the PM.  Back to the Original Mandate ----------------------------  5.  (C) The PM's decision to redefine the NSA position appears to be the first step in implementing the Congress Party election promise to turn the National Security Council into a \"professional and effective\" institution.  For the last year, but especially since Dixit's death, a number of Indian strategists have argued for restoring the position's original mandate, in which the NSA reports to an NSC comprised of the PM with the Home, Foreign, Finance and Defense Ministers and the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission.  It was envisioned at that time that the NSC would focus on external threats; security issues surrounding atomic energy, space and high technology; security related to global economic trends; domestic \"patterns of alienation\" (i.e. separatist groups); trans-national threats such as narco-trafficking and arms smuggling; and coordination of intelligence collection and activities.  Such a reform would bring the NSA position more in line with that of other senior GOI officials and end the \"super-minister\" status that Narayanan's two predecessors enjoyed.  6.  (C) An NSA focused on security and institution-building and away from personal diplomacy is likely to increase the role of the NSC and its Secretariat.  Brahma Chellany of New Delhi's Centre for Policy Research described the \"twice-established (1990 and 1999), twice-dormant\" NSC as an \"archetypal case of how good intentions can go wrong\" when strong NSAs such as Dixit and Mishra were able to eclipse and ignore the NSC, and turn the National Security Advisory Board into \"a PR shop for the NSA.\"  Noted strategist K Subrahmanyan has also been pushing for a forward-looking NSA and NSC that would \"coordinate and promote integrated thinking among the Home, Defense, External Affairs and Finance Ministries\" toward devising \"long-term policies based on the assessments of long-term problems.\"  \"What is needed is an NSA who will be a team leader with a balanced worldview, able to lead a multi-disciplinary team and committed to building the institution ... and not be considered a threat by any of the Cabinet ministers who are to become members of the NSC.\"  Narayanan has yet to prove that he is a strategic thinker in the mold of his predecessors, or that he can provide that \"balanced worldview.\"  What Narayanan Brings to the Table -------------------------------  7.  (C) Narayanan has a number of the qualities that would be valuable if the NSA is in fact recast as outlined above.  He is a proven manager, having twice served as head of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and will have as one of his first assignments streamlining the national security policymaking process.  He recently told reporters, \"The idea is to cut through the bureaucracy even in the PMO and hasten the pace of decisionmaking.\"  Further, Narayanan has held other senior advisory posts, and is comfortable being the bearer of bad news, which is an inevitable task for an NSA (reftel).  8.  (C) By his own admission, Narayanan is a security and intelligence professional who prefers to work out of the limelight.  Divesting the NSA from diplomacy will allow Narayanan to focus on the internal and external security issues that are his forte, including the anticipated \"emergency overhaul\" of RAW under its newly-named chief, PK Hormis Tharakan, and addressing the rise in domestic Maoist violence and separatism that the new IB director, ESL Narasimhan, will face.  We expect that the low-profile Narayanan will not offer policy pronouncements that later need to be walked back by the PM, such as Dixit's telling journalists that New Delhi would accept a permanent UNSC seat minus veto power.  Narayanan Will Soon Have a New Deputy -------------------------------------  9.  (C) With Narayanan's appointment, PM Singh will need to consider a new Deputy NSA if the incumbent, former diplomat Satish Chandra, retires as expected on January 31.  The individual selected for this post will further define the NSA's role, since he or she will (under the current arrangement) sit at the top of the NSC organization.  The merging of the external and internal security portfolios under the NSA post has not yet been officially announced -- so a new Special Adviser to the PM on Internal Security could also be selected, although Narayanan's IB background makes that unlikely.  Comment -------  10.  (C) The changes the GOI has in store for the NSA position appear to be significant.  Divesting the India-China boundary talks and Indo-Pak back channel from Narayanan's responsibilities downgrades the power and visibility of the office, and represents a victory for the Foreign Minister, who is no doubt pleased that the PM has returned diplomacy \"back where it belongs.\"  Redefining the NSA also reflects the PM's desire to strengthen institutions that have atrophied under Dixit and Mishra, who used the position to pursue larger-than-life foreign policy roles.  These changes will have implications for how the USG deals with Narayanan, as we lose the \"one-stop shop\" on India's foreign policy concerns and the \"go-to\" person with the vision and clout necessary to move initiatives pigeon-holed in the GOI's turf-conscious bureaucracies.  11.  (C) Nonetheless, Narayanan's office just down the hall from the PM, his longstanding relationship with Sonia Gandhi, and his demonstrated intellect will make him a force to be reckoned with in the UPA government.  Narayanan has welcomed contact with Mission interlocutors and remains always accessible.  With all this in mind, Mission recommends an early introductory call from NSA Hadley to his new Indian counterpart. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 4145       B. NEW DELHI 6787  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The January 24 strategic dialogue between China and India \"did not accomplish much,\" but did provide insight into China's view of the world, Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran told the DCM on January 27.  From New  SIPDIS Delhi's perspective, the dialogue illustrated China's willingness to engage with India as a global power, including on issues that traditionally fall into Beijing's orbit, such as North Korea, and underlined China's view (as conveyed to New Delhi) that India is not a rival in Asia.  It also contributed to the overall positive atmosphere of the bilateral relationship, which FM Natwar Singh's January 27 speech at a conference on Asian Security reinforced.  Despite this goodwill, India remains concerned by the PLA military buildup on the Tibetan Plateau and growing Chinese influence in Burma.  End Summary.  2.  (U) During the first-ever strategic talks between India and China, held in New Delhi on January 24, the two sides discussed globalization, democratization of international relations, UNSC reform, energy security, non-proliferation, terrorism and \"the situation in the Korean Peninsula,\" according to an MEA press release.  The dialogue, led by Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei, also included discussions on the March visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to New Delhi, an event the MEA predicted would be a \"major milestone in bilateral relations.\"  An Emphasis on Multilateralism ------------------------------  3.  (C) Offering a readout of the strategic dialogue, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran told the DCM that although the  SIPDIS discussions \"did not accomplish much,\" they provided insight into China's view of the world.  The dialogue also illustrated Beijing's perspective on India-China relations in the context of the \"emerging Asian architecture.\"  According to Saran, Wu emphasized multipolarity and multilateralism as the only legitimate means of addressing regional and global challenges and said that China does \"not, underline not\" see India as a rival in Asia.  They agreed that Asia was large enough to allow both countries to play significant, multilateral roles.  Enough Space for Both ---------------------  4.  (C) FM Natwar Singh continued to promote the feeling of goodwill generated by the strategic dialogue in a January 27 speech at a New Delhi conference on Asian Security.  With comments reminiscent of the June 2004 Panchsheel celebration (Ref A), Natwar emphasized the two countries' shared interests, noting that \"while there are differences between us, there is also an increasingly greater realization that there is enough space and opportunity in the region for both India and China to prosper.\"  However, Natwar also sought to demonstrate India's vested interests in China's neighborhood, emphasizing that \"developments in East Asia are of direct consequence to India's security and development.\"  Focus on Terrorism ------------------  5.  (C)  Although Beijing had not been willing to discuss counterterrorism in the past, during the strategic dialogue Wu displayed a much higher level of concern about the issue, Saran said, remarking that Wu was even willing to exchange information.  Saran speculated that the PRC's changed demeanor resulted from the feeling that global terrorism posed an increasing threat to China, and said he was impressed by Beijing's heightened focus on the subject.  No Direct Endorsement on UNSC Seat ----------------------------------  6.  (C) Although Beijing continued to avoid directly supporting India's bid for a permanent Security Council seat (Ref B), Saran cited \"strong indications\" and \"allusions\" that the PRC would ultimately support a seat for India.  Both countries agreed that India should play a more important role in international affairs, he stated.  Saran Committed to Boundary Talks --------------------------------  7.  (C) Saran said that the two sides had not specifically addressed the boundary question during the strategic dialogue.  He emphasized, however, the GOI's belief that the boundary dispute should be resolved in the context of larger Indo-Chinese strategic and political concerns, and remarked that India was prepared to work with China to find solutions.  Comment -------  8.  (C) The accomplishments of this first-ever strategic dialogue between the two countries were modest but significant.  Conversing with China about problems in the PRC's immediate neighborhood, such as North Korea, reflected India's ever broadening strategic horizon and its desire to project influence in areas in which it has not been active in the past.  It also allowed India to showcase itself as an equal to China, able to engage on issues of global importance, including those in East Asia.  The talks also demonstrated New Delhi's growing comfort level with Beijing. Despite the outward expressions of goodwill, serious reservations remain, including an on-going lack of trust fueled by the PLA's military buildup on the Tibetan Plateau and concern about Chinese influence in Burma.  Such issues will ultimately need to be addressed in order for genuine long-term cooperation between New Delhi and Beijing to occur. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (C) Summary: Consolidating the pattern set in other recent state elections, Kashmiris turned out in large numbers in municipal elections in North Kashmir on January 30, defying terrorist intimidation and a separatist-led boycott campaign, and demonstrating that they want to have a greater say in how they are governed at the grassroots level.  In recognition of these sentiments, All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leaders toned down their opposition slightly in recent days, with even the most hardline opponent SAS Geelani saying \"Civic elections are OK.  It's not a vote for India.  They voted for their civic problems.\"  Held after an interval of 27 years, these polls will elect Mayors and City Councils across the state, and continue on a rolling basis until February 17.  Extrapolating from the first round, these polls reflect Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's attempts to erode Kashmiris' alienation from India by further democratizing the lower levels of state politics.  The next major contests are in Srinagar on February 1, and South Kashmir on February 6, 12, and 17.  Suggested press guidance in para 10.  End Summary.  Strong First Round Showing --------------------------  2.  (U) Preliminary results from the first round of municipal elections held in North Kashmir on January 30 show strong support for the government's continuing efforts to normalize the political process there.  The most important barometer of success in Kashmir elections -- turnout -- indicated higher participation across the board, including in strongholds of separatist sentiment like Sopore and Baramulla.  State election officials reported that percentage turnout figures were as follows, which we contrast to the most recent 2002 Assembly elections:  Town        2005         2002 Baramulla    38           24 Uri          78           66 Sopore       25            8 Bandipora    60           31 Kupawara     83           55 Handwara     89           51  3.  (U) The ruling PDP-Congress coalition appears to have done well, sweeping a majority in seven of nine towns in Baramulla and Kupwara districts.  The opposition National Conference (NC) reportedly did well in several smaller towns.  The surprise was the strong performance of the Awami League, founded by Kukka Parray, a former militant who was assassinated in 2003 after crossing over to the government side, and the success of numerous independent candidates. Finance Minister Muzaffar Beig called the turnout an \"eyeopener for the Hurriyat,\" observing sharply that \"boycotting elections does not contribute to peace and development.\"  Strong Anti-Poll Campaign -------------------------  4.  (U) These elections follow a vigorous boycott campaign for which all major separatist groups weighed in.  Both moderate and hardline factions of the Hurriyat have been outspoken in their opposition.  The pro-independence JKLF leader Yasin Malik and a JKLF spin-off group led by his former ally Javed Mir have been particularly active. Moderate Hurriyat leader Abbas Ansari dismissed reports of high turnouts, commenting that \"lines in front of polling booths do not matter,\" and that \"Mufti is good at renting crowds.\"  Moderate APHC leaders Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Prof AG Bhat denied suggestions that the Hurriyat was under pressure from rank-and-file members to join the elections or to back proxy candidates.  Malik called turnout reports \"bogus,\" arguing that harsh winter weather would keep people away from polling stations and charging the government with inflating the numbers for political reasons. 5.  (C) After several weeks of agitation, however, separatist opposition may be weakening.  The Mirwaiz ignored the issue at Friday prayers in Srinagar on January 28 and did not call for a boycott.  Even the most irroconcilable opponent, pro-Pakistan hardliner SAS Geelani, who earlier trashed the polls as \"eyewash\" and  \"a sham,\" told the press on January 30 that \"Civic elections are OK.  It's not a vote for India. They voted for their civic problems.\"  Targetted Violence Sparks Candidates Withdrawals --------------------------------------------- ---  6.  (U) Since nomination papers were filed, terrorists have attacked candidates from all major political parties, killing at least three.  The worst attack of the campaign came on January 27, when militants attacked an election office outside Srinagar, wounding 26 people.  PDP President Mehbooba Mufti escaped unhurt from an attack on her motorcade on January 24.  The militant group al-Mansourian has been particularly active, spreading leaflets in many towns and villages in an attempt to scare voters and candidates from participating; at least 152 of the latter have withdrawn from the process already, and dozens more followed on January 31, taking out advertisements in local papers announcing their withdrawal to avoid reprisals from the insurgents.  Some politicians complained of a lack of security, but the police responded that they could not provide security to the several thousand candidates statewide.  Election Details ----------------  7.  (U) These polls are to elect Mayors and 3 City Councils and 30 Committees (the latter in smaller towns) across J&K, positions that have been held by appointed officials since the last such exercise in 1977.  Voters will first elect ward members, according to the schedule below, who will elect mayors after the councils have been constituted.  No polling will take place in the Kargil or Leh regions of the state because of severe winter weather.  One-third of the candidates are women, and an unprecedented number of young people and independents have entered the fray, according to journalists in Srinagar.  \"Chattan\" editor Tahir Mohiuddin told us that Mufti chose this time to hold polls bolster his standing vis-a-vis the NC, to fulfill another campaign promise in his Common Minimum Program, and to bolster PDP ranks before it transfers the Chief Ministership to the Congress party in November.  8.  (U) Polling will proceed as follows: Baramulla and Kupwara Municipal Council - January 29 Srinagar Municipal Corporation - February 1 Jammu Municipal Corporation - February 1 Anantnag, Pulwama Municipal Council/Committee - February 6 Jammu, Kathua Municipal Council/Committee - February 7 Srinagar, Badgam Municipal Council/Committee - February 10 Doda, Udhampur Municipal Council/Committee - February 12 Rajouri, Poonch Municipal Council/Committee - February 17  Comment -------  9.  (C) The first round is further evidence that Kashmiris clearly want to influence, if they cannot determine, their own affairs.  As during the 2002 J&K Assembly elections, this heightened interest in grassroots democracy reflects Kashmiris' desire to improve their daily lives, if they cannot settle the larger Kashmir issue now.  As one commentator put it, this is about \"azadi (\"freedom,\" a separatist rallying cry) from garbage, choked drains, potholed roads.\"  The large number of women and young candidates demonstrates that ordinary Kashmiris will engage politically around issues that concern them directly.  The turnout figures also reveal continuing popular resistance to terrorist intimidation and represent a rebuff to separatists who urged a boycott.  The Hurriyat's rejectionist position, on the grounds that these polls \"will not resolve the Kashmir problem\" is disappointing, as they have missed yet another opportunity to shape their political environment, let alone to climb the road to power.  The challenge remains for the state government, and the GOI, to translate Kashmiri interest in improving daily life into enthusiasm for larger India issues.  10.  (C) Given the relatively lower stakes, we did not observe these polls (as we did in 2002 and 2004), and cannot comment on the credibility of the electoral process.  Charges of irregularities from the NC bear watching, although NC President Omar Abdullah has taken the polls rather lightly, spending the weekend in New Delhi rather than campaigning prior to February 1 Srinagar polling.  The government's decision not to use electronic voting machines is a potential weakness in electoral procedures.  Kashmiri Pandits have also complained that 60,000 refugees were left off from voter lists in Jammu, but we understand that they have accepted an as yet vague solution brokered by Mufti that would give Pandits positions in these town bodies once the poll results are known.  Suggested Press Guidance -------------------------  11.  (U) We recommend the following guidance:  We welcome the Indian government's decision to hold Municipal Corporation and Municipal Council/Committee elections in J&K after a hiatus of 27 years.  These polls continue the positive trends that began with the 2002 state Legislative Assembly elections.  We note in particular the large number of women and young candidates.  We have seen initial reports from the first round from January 30 polling in North Kashmir.  These reports indicate strong voter participation in areas where turnout has been low in recent years (e.g. Sopore and Baramulla).  These reports are encouraging, as they demonstrate Kashmiris' continuing desire to participate in the political process and to restore a sense of normalcy to the state.  As in the most recent elections in 2002 and 2004, we salute the Kashmiris' courage and their refusal to yield to terrorists' threats or to follow the heed of those who have called for a boycott.

Ministry Officials response to these Washington-funded proposals was tepid. Mission will follow-up in mid-February to determine status of the proposals.  MEA official also told Morin that India would like to participate in the ITER project.  End summary.  Bio-Terrorism Tabletop Exercise:  Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) --------------------------------------------- ------------- 2.  On January 7, 2005, DAS Lee Morin met with Mr. S.K. Swami, Director, Disaster Management Division, Ministry of Home Affairs, to present to Mr. Swami the CTJWG proposal on a bio-terrorism tabletop exercise.  The meeting took place in the room that had been set up at the Ministry of Home Affairs as a command center for tsunami relief.  DAS Morin managed to engage Mr. Swami's partial attention as aides kept bringing Mr. Swami files for approval.  DAS Morin emphasized to Mr. Swami that this proposed bio-terrorism tabletop exercise was funded and only required Government of India approval to get underway.  Mr. Swami told DAS Morin that MHA would get back to us.  Strengthening Bio-Security:  Ministry of Health (MOH) --------------------------------------------- -------- 3.  DAS Morin also met with Mr. Raj Kumar Gadwal, the Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Ministry of Health  SIPDIS and Family Welfare, to present the proposal for collaborations on \"Strengthening Bio-Security.\"  Mr. Gadwal was responsive to the importance of strengthening bio- security.  DAS Morin emphasized that funding is available for this activity and that the USG only required GOI approval to begin the collaboration.  Gadwal told DAS Morin that such work requires interagency clearance so that India's reply would take some time.  Follow-Up Meeting With Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) --------------------------------------------- ------------ 4.  DAS Morin met with Meera Shankar, Additional Secretary, UN, Ministry of External Affairs, to discuss the two proposals.  While Ms. Shankar well understood that the proposed work would add heft to the CTJWG, she did not evince enthusiasm to push the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Health into engaging in the proposed collaborations.  5.  At the end of the meeting, Shankar said that India would be interested in participating in the ITER project even though she came short of suggesting that India should become a member of the consortium.  6.  Post will re-engage with the Ministries of Health, Home Affairs and External Affairs to seek a positive response to these proposals.  MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr., for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  Despite the GOI's deliberately low-profile public and material support in the run-up to the Iraqi elections, Indian government, media, and commentators welcomed the completion of Iraq's first election.  In a January 31 statement, the Indian MEA called the elections a \"noteworthy development\" and reaffirmed Iraq's strategic importance to New Delhi (full text in para 10).  Circumspect about engaging the interim regime, the GOI will likely engage the new Iraqi government with more conviction, although practical security concerns and continued opposition from India's left parties will present major obstacles to a more visible Indian presence in the near future.  End Summary.  Pre-Election Hesitation -----------------------  2.  (C) As noted in previous reporting, the GOI has expressed a desire to be more active in Iraqi elections, but security concerns in Iraq and opposition by the left at home effectively prevented more direct Indian involvement besides funding for the electoral cluster of the UN Trust Fund.  3.  (C) Despite post's urging the GOI to come forward with a public statement in support of the elections, GOI leaders were largely silent in the weeks and days before the polls. In the inaugural address of the Center for West Asian Studies at Jamia University the day before the elections, PM Manmohan Singh briefly remarked on the long process ahead for Iraq. Singling out sanctions and insecurity over Saddam as causes of Iraqis' suffering, the PM bowed to his left wing with the comment that, \"We cannot but recall the extent of the suffering of the Iraqi people over the past decades, in particular following the imposition of sanctions, and under the present disturbed situation.\"  Despite this, he concluded that, \"India is committed to the prosperity and well-being of the people of Iraq (and) we will do all we can, as Iraq stabilizes, to help with the return of normalcy and in the task of reconstruction that lies ahead.\"  But Shias Enthusiastic ----------------------  4.  (C) India's Shia community, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about the quick conclusion of Iraqi elections. Two days before the polls, the newly launched \"All India Shia Personal Law Board\" in the Shia stronghold of Lucknow expressed its fervent hope for successful elections in Iraq in the first resolution passed by the body.  The resolution expressed concern about the recent calls for violence issued by \"the henchmen of Saddam Hussein\" to disrupt elections, appealed to all Iraqi Shia to participate in the polls, and voiced full support for Ayatollah Sistani.  This message was echoed in Friday sermons and in leaflets distributed throughout the Shia localities of Lucknow.  Noting the US role in helping Iraq reach this historic moment, two Shia leaders, newspaper editor Zaheer Mustafa and High Court advocate Ibne Hasan, however, also cautioned the US not to make statements against Iran at this delicate juncture:  \"The enemies of peace and democracy in Iraq...will cash in on any anti-Iran statement by the US government,\" Hasan warned.  Post-Election Reactions:  Ballots Defeat Bullets --------------------------------------------- ---  5.  (U) Civic elections in Jammu and Kashmir generally got top billing over the Iraqi elections in the Sunday press, but most media on Monday heralded the triumph of ballots over bullets in Iraq, illustrated by Iraqis brandishing peace signs with inked index fingers.  \"The Asian Age\" which had run skeptical articles in the run-up to the elections, carried an upbeat headline, \"Party Spirit as Iraq Votes,\" with a subtitle, \"After we win, no to America.\"  One exception to the congratulatory headlines was \"The Hindu\" which featured the day's death toll of 36 over the reported 76 percent voter turnout.  6.  (C) As expected, reactions to Iraq's elections among India's considerable Muslim population was divided along sectarian lines.  India's Shia population lauded the overall conduct of the elections.  Syed Hamidul Hasan, principal of India's most prestigious Shia madrassa and one of the country's leading Shias, told PolOff by phone that he had just returned from meeting Shia congregations in Gujarat who were unanimously pleased with the polls.  In the weeks leading up to the polls, Hasan said he and other Shia leaders in Lucknow instructed their congregations to contact friends and relatives in Iraq and urge them to participate in the elections.  Moulvi Iftiqar Ansari, State Representative from Srinigar gushed to PolOff, \"Tremendous elections.  We must appreciate President Bush, though the Muslim world does not like him.  (This is) a great step.  Iraqis can now form their own legitimate government.\"  In contrast, Muhammad Jafar, Secretary General of Jamaat-Islami Hind, a hard-line Sunni  SIPDIS organization, dismissed Iraq's elections as \"eye wash,\" saying, \"(the polls) can't be called elections in the real sense.\"  Reevaluating Indian Involvement in Iraq ---------------------------------------  7.  (C) Despite not playing an active role in the January 30 polls, MEA Joint Secretary, Gulf Division R. Dayakar reiterated GOI commitment to Iraq's democratic transition and indicated that the GOI would reevaluate the level of its involvement in a meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff on January 31.  He confirmed that India will participate in the April donors conference and hopes to be more active in subsequent elections later this year.  In addition to ongoing vocational training and educational programs in India, the GOI will also announce a new program to produce high energy biscuits for the World Food Program for distribution in Iraq, as it has done in Afghanistan.  Describing these initiatives as \"the maximum we can do,\" he also repeated his complaint that Baghdad's slow response to GOI offers erodes Indian willingness to offer more.  8.  (C) PolCouns asked about an earlier Indian proposal to train police as a way to enhance Iraqi security and expedite the departure of foreign troops.  Dayakar replied that the elections constituted a fundamental turning point, adding that security force training, like other earlier proposals such as the dispatch of a military hospital to Najaf and training for the Iraqi army would now have to be reevaluated.  Sending Indian troops to Iraq, however, will not be considered.  9.  (C) PolCouns inquired whether the GOI would now consider lifting the travel advisory preventing Indians from traveling to Iraq, even for specific projects in safe areas of Iraqi Kurdistan.  Dayakar said MEA had decided to take \"no decision\" on this issue for now.  As long as there are kidnappings -- he cited the recent case of Chinese workers who had been kidnapped and released -- there would be resistance to changing the GOI travel ban.  10.  (U) Begin text of MEA statement:  The Government of India has been carefully monitoring recent political developments in Iraq.  It has been our view that the restoration of full sovereignty to the Iraqi people is a necessary pre-condition for peace and stability in that country.  In that context, the holding of elections in Iraq on January 30, 2005, is a noteworthy development. Preliminary reports about the turnout of voters are encouraging.  We hope that these events would set in motion a process that would lead the Iraqi people taking full control of their destiny. As is well known, India has traditionally strong ties of friendship with Iraq and its people.  We would, therefore, welcome the return of political stability and economic prosperity to the country, situated in an area of considerable strategic importance to India, in terms of the large population of Indian citizens who live and work in the Gulf, as also a significant source of our energy supplies. We wish the people of Iraq success in their efforts towards nation-building and stand ready to contribute to the country's reconstruction in an environment free from violence.  End text.  11.

Echoing Foreign Secretary Saran's comments (reftel), Kantha described the recent India-China meetings as upbeat but relatively weak on substance.  He reported that Beijing offered private support for India's Security Council bid, and that the countries discussed Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and Taiwan.  More sensitive topics, including Burma, Nepal and Central Asia, were not addressed.  Despite the positive atmospherics ahead of Wen Jiabao's expected March visit, Kantha said \"the gap is still wide\" on the boundary issue, a matter India is not prepared to let go unresolved.  He reiterated Indian interest in an invitation to the East Asia Summit, providing there is consensus within ASEAN.  End Summary.  Willing to Engage -----------------  2.  (C) On January 31, following up our previous discussions with the MEA on the India-China strategic dialogue (reftel), MEA Joint Secretary (East Asia) Ashok Kantha briefed PolCouns and Poloff, remarking that \"if China had proposed a strategic dialogue a few years ago, we would have been wary.\" Underlining the improving ties between New Delhi and Beijing, Kantha said that although the PRC had previously wanted to confine India to South Asia, \"now China seems eager to discuss bigger issues with us.\"  Kantha attributed this change to Beijing's desire that India-US relations not become \"warmer than necessary\" and commented that the Chinese want something more than the current officially recorded \"cooperative, constructive relationship.\"  While India has no objections to simply re-labelling the relationship, \"it should not lead to obligations,\" he said.  3.  (C) Kantha was impressed by the upbeat tone of the meetings, telling PolCouns that Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei made an effort to highlight the positive aspects of India-China ties during his discussions with Foreign Secretary Saran.  It was also useful to understand those  SIPDIS issues where Beijing and New Delhi do not agree, he remarked.  Calling the talks the beginning of a process, Kantha expressed the hope that at later discussions would be more substantive.  UN Security Council -------------------  4.  (C) According to Kantha, China privately supports India's candidature for membership on an expanded Security Council. Publicly, the PRC is not willing to go beyond \"expressing understanding\" for India's bid for a Security Council seat and indicating support for India to play a more important role in international affairs.  Global Review -------------  5.  (C) According to Kantha, Dawei was upbeat on Afghanistan, describing the election of President Karzai as a positive step.  However, Dawei went on to describe US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan as \"the biggest tragedy of our times,\" complaining that the US had overthrown two regimes (the Taliban and the Saddam Hussein regime) that it had created (sic).  Kantha found this part of the Chinese presentation overdrawn.  6.  (C) Kantha described Dawei as upbeat on the US approach to Iran, telling Saran that the US seemed to favor a \"Libya-type solution\" and that there was a good possibility of a \"soft landing\" there. Dawei also provided a readout on North Korea, arguing that six-party talks should resume.  7.  (C) Although India raised the AQ Khan proliferation network as a matter of concern, Kantha commented that China was not prepared to engage substantively on the subject of Pakistan's nuclear program, despite underlining general concerns about non-proliferation.  Boundary Talks --------------  8.  (C) Asked about the status of the boundary discussions, Kantha emphasized that the GOI was not willing to defer resolution of the boundary question indefinitely. Working-level discussions on the boundary dispute would continue, he said, but larger issues would have to wait until India appoints another Special Representative to replace the late NSA JN Dixit.  Noting that \"the gap that separates us is still wide,\" Kantha emphasized that both sides must make tough decisions.  From New Delhi's perspective, territorial concessions in the Eastern sector is \"out of the question, a non-starter,\" and even concessions in the Western sector would be difficult.  He argued that China should accept the territorial status-quo in furtherance of their broader bilateral agenda.  Regional Organizations ----------------------  9.  (C) According to Kantha, despite Beijing's interest in SAARC, Chinese involvement there would be premature because \"SAARC needs to get its act together.\"  China's involvement could detract from the core issues, he added.  10.  (C) Asked about the East Asia Summit, Kantha described two schools of thought within ASEAN regarding India's participation there.  While some would like to see a 10 3 arrangement, with ASEAN nations plus Japan, China and South Korea, others argue that this would be no different from ASEAN plus three.  Beijing has argued that ASEAN should take the lead in the East Asia Summit, he said, but remarked that China has offered to host the second Summit before participants had even decided whether to have another Summit, a move which \"makes us nervous.\"  He reiterated Indian interest in an invitation to the East Asia Summit, providing there is consensus within ASEAN.  11.  (C) Kantha reported that China was \"warming up\" to the idea of an India-Russia-China trilateral meeting, but emphasized that \"relations with the US are so important, we do not want a trilateral dialogue to become a group.\" Discussion would focus instead on economic issues, he stated.  He suggested that the Russians were still the strongest advocate of this trilateral forum.  Taiwan ------  12.  (C) China raised the issue of Taiwan and briefed India on Taiwan's \"secessionist legislation.\"  Kantha noted that Dawei had raised the issue in a \"pro forma\" manner, suggesting that Beijing accepts India's \"low-key\" approach to the issue.  Our interests in Taiwan are economic, he underlined.  Comment and Action Request --------------------------  13.  (C) Kantha repeatedly stressed the convergence of US and Indian interests with respect to China and underlined the need to expand the US-India regional dialogue to include the PRC.  He also reiterated Indian requests for EAP officials at the DAS level or above to come to New Delhi for discussions on our interests and concerns related to China. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (C) MEA Joint Secretary Americas Jaishankar called in DCM and PolCouns on January 31 to reiterate his earlier message (reftel) regarding the likely impasse in our Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) relationship if we are not able to achieve buy-in from key GOI scientific agencies that for now blame MEA for the shortfall between \"the promise and the reality\" of our high tech relationship.  Jaishankar acknowledged real progress under the NSSP, as demonstrated, for instance in the growing volume of licensed trade.  He characterized the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as the most \"clued in\" of the three key NSSP constituencies, but indicated that ISRO (space) and AEC (civil nuclear) were problematic.  Following up on our earlier encouragement for India to produce the draft export control documentation required for Phase 2 of NSSP, Jaishankar warned that he faced increasing opposition from AEC and to a lesser degree ISRO because of \"question marks about commitment (to NSSP) on the US side.\"  2. (C) Echoing earlier comments by the Prime Minister, Jaishankar emphasized that India in some areas could take steps on export control that surpass the US benchmarks. However, he reiterated, he had a sense that AEC in particular was starting to \"disassociate itself\" from the NSSP process, because of a perception that nothing was really changing in their relationship with the US.  3. (C) Elaborating on this point, Jaishankar flagged two major areas of potential cooperation:  -- On civil nuclear issues, India wants to address safety issues within the reactor island.  This will be a GOI focus during the upcoming visit by NRC Commissioner Meserve. Echoing Foreign Secretary Saran's November pitch to NSA Rice, Jaishankar also urged that the US not persist in blocking others (a reference to Russia and France) from their proposals for civil nuclear cooperation with India.  -- On space, Jaishankar passed on a non-paper (full text para 6) seeking a US non-objection for the Indian launch of a Thai earth observation satellite containing US scientific components.  He warned that US opposition to transactions of this sort (\"killing their commercial prospects elsewhere\") made it hard for him to build a constituency in ISRO for US-India space cooperation.  Concluding, Jaishankar asked for an update of US deliberations on these issues, reiterating the GOI hope that Washington will consider steps to maintain momentum in the NSSP.  4. (C) PolCouns noted that the NSSP is a two way street, with several steps outstanding that India could usefully take to maintain momentum behind the process, including the sharing of Indian export control legislation and completion of India's space cooperation wish list.  DCM also warned that a US reply on these issues could be delayed by the transition in Washington.  Jaishankar took these points, but reiterated that without a \"forthcoming attitude on both sides\" progress in the NSSP framework is likely to be slow.  5. (C) Comment: Reftel laid out a series of possible steps to address GOI dissatisfaction with the nuclear leg of the NSSP, including Indian participation in ITER, other cooperation on nuclear fusion, or more robust safety collaboration with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Jaishankar acknowledged that US flexibility in these areas is constrained by US law and our NPT obligations, but also underlined that India wants to find common ground with the US, accepts the basic framework of NSSP quid-pro-quos, and hopes Washington will look again at options for deepening our civil nuclear cooperation.  6. (U) Begin text, MEA non-paper:  Astrium, a 100% subsidiary of EADS, is examining the launch of a Thai earth observation satellite, Theos, on the Indian PSLV.  Technically, the launch platform parameters appear to be appropriate.  However, Theos contains some US components and there appear to be apprehensions, possibly misplaced, that USG may not give requisite clearance for such a launch.  The conclusion of NSSP I and ongoing discussions on NSSP II have created a climate of confidence and understanding between GOI and USG.  It is GOI's expectation that USG would not have reservations on a launch proposal that has only commercial significance.  Accordingly, GOI requests USG confirmation that it would not have objection to the proposed launch. End text. MULFORD " }

Mulford, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (S) Summary: Expressing \"grave concern\" over the King's decision to dissolve the multiparty government in Nepal, and calling the action \"a serious setback to the cause of democracy,\" New Delhi responded swiftly and with unusual firmness to the February 1 developments in Kathmandu.  In a statement issued just hours after the King wrested power from Prime Minister Deuba, the MEA called for the safety and welfare of Nepalese political leaders who are now reportedly under house arrest, and stated that the King had violated the principles of multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy as enshrined in Nepal's Constitution.  In a February 1 phone call to the Ambassador, Foreign Secretary Saran urged that Washington reinforce the GOI line with its own strong statement.  Saran warned that if there is large scale agitation in Kathmandu, and if the RNA overreacts, India may have to \"take some unpopular decisions.\"  In that eventuality, Saran added, he hopes Washington and New Delhi will be on the same page.  End Summary.  Joint Message -------------  2. (C) In a sign of growing GOI commitment to the US-India security partnership, Foreign Secretary Saran called the Ambassador on the afternoon of February 1, just a few minutes after New Delhi had issued its statement on the situation in Nepal (full text para 6).  Saran described the MEA release as \"unusually strong\" and urged the Ambassador to work with Washington to generate a reinforcing message from Washington.  Invoking the RNA's record of poor human rights practices, Saran expressed concern about the likelihood of large scale agitation in Kathmandu.  If the RNA overreacts, India may have to \"take some unpopular decisions\" (no further information) and, Saran added, hopes Washington and New Delhi will be on the same page.  3. (C) Speaking to Polcouns earlier on February 1, a Director in the Prime Minister's office indicated that New Delhi had warning that the King would act late on January 31. Underlining India's concern with the unfolding situation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his foreign affairs team reportedly met early on February 1 to review the situation and craft a response.  MEA Director (Nepal and Bhutan) Achal Kumar Malhotra told Poloff that, given India's keen interest in the long-term stability of Nepal, the MEA would issue further statements if necessary and would continue to closely monitor the situation.  4. (C) MEA Under Secretary (Nepal) Manu Mahawar emphasized that the GOI had not yet decided whether to suspend aid to Nepal, a decision that would come only after India had reviewed the situation in greater detail.  He noted that communication with the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu had been spotty since local land and cell phone service was unavailable following Gyanendra's announcement, a situation that contributed to the uncertainly surrounding the situation.  Predictably, the Indians have already started asking whether the developments in Nepal will trigger Section 508 sanctions from the US.  Comment -------  5. (C) The Indian government has repeatedly expressed an interest in continuing to coordinate with the US as the situation unfolds in Kathmandu.  Saran's call to the Ambassador suggests that New Delhi is gravely concerned about the situation in Nepal, and is likely to ramp up their signals of displeasure with the King's actions in both public and private.  Whether the GOI will suspend military aid remains to be seen.  As one of our contacts noted, Gyanendra's decision to sack the Deuba government was \"a direct snub to New Delhi,\" especially in light of India's repeated requests that the King avoid such a course.  The same contact also speculated that Kathmandu's closure of the Dalai Lama's office in Nepal was intended as a sop to Beijing, aimed at lining up support from Beijing in the event that New Delhi took a hard line on the King's action.  6. (U) Text of the MEA statement follows:  Statement on Developments in Nepal  The King of Nepal has dissolved the multiparty government led by Prime Minister Deuba, and has decided to constitute a Council of Ministers under his own Chairmanship. An emergency has been declared and fundamental rights have been suspended. These developments constitute a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal and cannot but be a cause of grave concern to India.  There are also reports that several political leaders have been confined to their residences. The safety and welfare of the political leaders must be ensured and political parties must be allowed to exercise all the rights enjoyed by them under the Constitution.  India has consistently supported multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy enshrined in Nepal's Constitution as the two pillars of political stability in Nepal. This principle has now been violated with the King forming a government under his Chairmanship.  We have always considered that in Nepal, it is imperative to evolve a broad national consensus, particularly between the monarchy and political parties, to deal with the political and economic challenges facing the country.  The latest developments in Nepal bring the monarchy and the mainstream political parties in direct confrontation with each other. This can only benefit the forces that not only wish to undermine democracy but the institution of monarchy as well.  India has a longstanding and unique relationship with Nepal, with which it shares an open border, a history of strong cultural and spiritual values and wide-ranging economic and commercial links. We will continue to support the restoration of political stability and economic prosperity in Nepal, a process which requires reliance on the forces of democracy and the support of the people of Nepal.

(C) Summary: Pundits, journalists, and politicians agree that Congress will emerge victorious in Haryana's February 3 Legislative Assembly elections, winning from 60 to 80 seats in the 90 member Assembly.  Growing disgust with the misrule and corruption of the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has caused its supporters to abandon it in favor of Congress.  The BJP has no base in Haryana and is expected to win only 5-8 seats.  With the outcome not in doubt, the outstanding questions are the Congress margin of victory and who will become Chief Minister.  The Congress capture of another state will represent the latest in an unbroken string of Congress/United Progressive Alliance (UPA) victories.  If it also wins in Jharkhand and Bihar (septel), the UPA position could be strong enough to ensure a full five-year term.  End Summary.  Press Sees a Congress Wave --------------------------  2.  (U) Haryana State Legislative Assembly elections will take place on February 3, with votes counted and results to be announced on February 27.  On January 25 and 27-28, Poloff traveled throughout the state meeting with local leaders of Congress, the INLD and the BJP, as well as several journalists for a first-hand look at the campaign.  3.  (U) Pundits and the press are unanimous in predicting a Congress victory.  The current INLD government, headed by Haryana Chief Minister Chautala, is locked in a three-way contest against Congress and the BJP.  Formerly allied with the BJP in the NDA, the INLD parted company just before the May 2004 national polls.  In that contest, the INLD lost all five of its Lok Sabha seats to Congress, with Congress winning nine of Haryana's 10 parliamentary seats.  On January 27, BJP Chief L.K. Advani ruled out a future alliance with the INLD, saying that \"We will never tie up with this party\" as it \"has worked against the BJP throughout its term in the state.\"  The BJP, which is running in all 90 constituencies, is telling voters that regional parties cannot deliver and they should only vote for national parties.  4.  (U) Although a Congress victory is all but certain, deep divisions within the state party have come to the fore in this campaign.  There are at least six Congress contenders to become Chief Minister after the election, and four head their own factions in the Legislative Assembly.  Competition for Congress seats was intense and at least 12 disappointed ticket seekers broke ranks with their party and are running as independents.  On January 27, the Congress leadership suspended the \"rebels\" for six years.  The CM contenders have called for party unity, saying that they are leaving the decision of who will become CM to Sonia Gandhi and the party leadership.  5.  (U) Congress released a manifesto on January 23, but most agree that it has no program for Haryana.  There is little dispute that the INLD's poor governance and development record has brought about its downfall.  A \"Hindustan Times\" reporter who accompanied CM Chautala on the campaign trail on January 26 reported that his \"famed oratory skills...seemed to be missing, and the (old) excitement with which the crowds thronged him wherever he went is also not to be seen.\"  Views of Local Journalists --------------------------  6.  (C) Poloff met with four local journalists who agreed that a Congress victory is all but inevitable, and that it is not clear who will become the next CM, or what the margin of victory will be.  The \"India Today\" correspondent opined that if the Congress victory margin is small (60 seats or fewer), it is likely to name former CM and state Congress Chief Bhajan Lal, who is acceptable to the state's dominant Jat (farmer) caste.  However, if the margin is larger than 60 seats, Sonia Gandhi will be tempted to name her own CM.  He noted that Haryana is important to Congress for its proximity to Delhi and as a major site for foreign investment. Congress must demonstrate that it can deliver good governance in this crucial state, he stressed.  7.  (C) A \"Tribune\" correspondent confirmed that there was considerable resentment in Haryana against Chautala and the INLD.  Although he delivered some development, Chautala was arrogant, attempted to concentrate power within his family at the expense of his supporters, and would make no concessions to his BJP partners.  The correspondent predicted that Congress \"rebels\" would have no significant impact on the election outcome, and that Sonia Gandhi would select Haryana Dalit leader and Minister of State for Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation Kumari Selja as CM to solidify the support of non-Jats behind Congress.  He opined that the INLD is likely to be reduced to 15 seats from its present 47.  If it drops below that, he noted, the party risks slipping into irrelevance. Views of Political Leaders --------------------------  8.  (C) Two INLD leaders acknowledged that Congress was ahead, but refused to concede defeat.  While their party has a strong record on development, they insisted, leaving the NDA had been a mistake that has hurt its electoral chances. They noted that Congress was the main enemy, as the BJP poses no threat due to its lack of organization and a local base. They predicted that the BJP will win \"less than eight\" of Haryana's 90 seats.  9.  (C) Two Congress leaders lamented the \"arrogance\" of their party, which they felt would reduce the victory margin.  If it were not for the rampant factionalism and ambition of their leaders, the party could have won 85 seats, they maintained.  Discipline broke down and the party leadership gave seats to their relatives, alienated and angering veteran Congressmen.  They predicted that the BJP rather than the INLD would benefit from Congress infighting, as sentiment in Haryana decidedly favors national parties.  Another Congress leader dismissed stories of \"rebel\" candidates, saying that most of those that won would immediately apply to rejoin Congress in any case.  10.  (C) Both leaders pointed out serious political errors committed by Chautala, including his decision to withdraw subsidies on water and power for farmers, and his subsequent failure to provide either.  Chautala also ordered police to fire on angry farmers, who were protesting that they were being forced to pay for non-existent water and power.  By ordering the police to harass his political opponents, Chautala also allowed crime to go unchecked until the state was under a \"reign of fear,\" as one put it.  Chautala also distributed lucrative state jobs amongst his many relatives and supporters.  11.  (C) A BJP leader made it clear that while his party did not expect to do well in the contest, it had a long-term plan.  The BJP had little or no following in the state, as it had always allowed the INLD to dominate, so the BJP would henceforth operate independently, would seek no allies, and would use this election as an exercise to build up strength and prepare for the next contest.  He predicted that in five years the INLD would be reduced to insignificance, and that future contests would be two-way races between the BJP and Congress.  Comment -------  12.  (C) Congress leaders are clearly elated at the prospect of capturing another state from the NDA, coming closer to regaining its traditional base in North India, and dealing a blow to the BJP in its Hindi heartland.  Congress already has a strong hold on Uttaranchal, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, and is likely to capture Jharkhand and Haryana in this month's elections, while Bihar should remain in the hands of UPA ally Laloo Prasad Yadav (septel).  This would leave only Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in BJP control, and hand the party another in what has become a string of defeats.  An energized Congress is likely to set its sites next on Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, where it sees growing prospects for a return to power.  12.  (C) Haryana has been a bellwether for Indian national politics, as it was among the first states to see large numbers of legislators defect to the opposition, and the rise of regional parties.  This election could indicate the beginning of another trend, as a severe INLD defeat could be an early sign that the Indian electorate has begun to tire of the parochialism and corruption of the regional parties and is beginning to return to the national parties.  Should Congress and its UPA allies win a clean sweep in all three states in this election, as many anticipate, it could also make it much more likely that this government will remain in power for its full five-year term, and should further strengthen Congress' hand within its fractious coalition -- opening space for progress on issues of concern to the US.

NEW DELHI 792      B. AMCONSUL CALCUTTA E-MAILS  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  King Gyanendra's decision to dissolve the government is a \"worst case scenario,\" driving the Maoists and the political parties together, undermining the monarchy, and muzzling politicians rather than the Maoists, MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal and Bhutan) Ranjit Rae told PolCouns and  SIPDIS Poloffs on February 2.  India remains concerned about the situation there, including reports that political leaders outside Kathmandu are being arrested and detained, that the army had assumed responsibility for the security of government leaders, and that Nepalese were fleeing across the border into India.  Rae was pleased with US and Indian cooperation thus far and said India was still considering whether to dispatch a special envoy to the King who would threaten, among other things, to curtail military assistance to Nepal.  He repeatedly asked about section 508 of the Foreign Appropriations Act, and whether it would apply in this case.  Rae said he was unsure of the Chinese role in the developments in Nepal.  The local press and non-government contacts generally praised India's tough stance, but argued that the US and New Delhi should have taken a firmer line with the Palace at an earlier date.  See action request paragraph 8.  End Summary.  The Worst Case Scenario -----------------------  2.  (C) Describing the King's actions as the \"worst case scenario,\" Joint Secretary Ranjit Rae told PolCouns that Gyanendra may have undermined not only multiparty democracy but the monarchy itself.  He worried that the political parties and the Maoists would now unite against the Palace, a move Rae observed was already beginning.  Calling the implications \"pretty serious,\" he hoped the King had not made a \"terrible misjudgment,\" seeking to curtail the Maoists but only muzzling the political parties.  3.  (C) Citing \"worrying\" reports from the Indian Embassy in Nepal, Rae said that the army was not only arresting political leaders in Kathmandu but was also detaining politicians in the Terai, Jhapa, and other areas.  Some of these detainees may have been relocated.  He reported that the army had assumed responsibility for protection of political leaders, a function once reserved for the police.  4.  (C) In a private conversation on February 1, Foreign Secretary Saran expressed concerns to the DCM regarding  SIPDIS reports that many Nepalese, including politicians, had been crossing the border into India.  AmConsul Calcutta followed up with contacts near the Bihar border who noted that although border security had been stepped up in recent weeks because of increased Maoist activity and the February 3 State Assembly elections in Bihar, the communication shutdown and generally porous border made it difficult to determine how many Nepalese had fled to India.  US-India Cooperation --------------------  5.  (C) Rae expressed satisfaction with the convergence of the US and Indian approaches to Nepal thus far, and requested that the two countries continue to cooperate.  Rae told PolCouns that India was privately sending \"very strong\" messages to the King, and was considering appointing a Special Representative for this purpose.  He hoped that the upcoming phone call between NSA Hadley and his Indian counterpart would produce a consensus on additional sources of leverage to use vis-a-vis the Palace, and noted that India was might curtail its considerable assistance to the Royal Nepal Army (RNA), but had not yet reached a decision on the matter.  Rae asked repeatedly about Section 508 of the Foreign Appropriations Act (an issue we had not raised in discussions with the GOI) and whether it would apply in this case.  PolCouns responded that we had not yet received guidance on this topic, but that we would get back to him. The Role of China -----------------  6.  (C) Asked about the role of China, Rae stated that he did not \"know what to make of the Chinese statement\" in which the PRC called developments in Nepal an internal matter.  In an article in \"The Pioneer\" Retired Major General Ashok Mehta speculated that the King may be \"trying to play the China card.\"  Specifically, this theory holds that the King is counting on unstinting support from Beijing to ride out pressure from Delhi, Washington, and London.  US and India Should Have Done More ----------------------------------  7.  (C) Foreign policy commentators, retired diplomats, and academics with no knowledge of our private diplomacy, continue to weigh in on the situation in Nepal, arguing that India and the US should have taken a firmer stance against the Palace before the King acted.  Former Ambassador to Nepal KV Rajan described the US and Indian statements as \"a step in the right direction\" and urged both countries to continue to call publicly for a restoration of democracy.  He also underlined the need for greater track II dialogue, saying it's a little late for that, \"but it would still be a good start.\"  Foreign affairs strategist C Raja Mohan argued in \"The Indian Express\" that India would now need to match its strong words with purposeful actions, and observed that the King had gambled that India would reluctantly support the monarchy when faced with a choice between the Maoists and the Palace.  General Ashok Mehta argued that the King's actions reflect his obsession with power, and said it was unlikely that that the King would ever restore democracy.  Action Request --------------  8.  (C) Given the MEA's interest in the outcome of deliberations on section 508 of the Foreign Appropriations Act, we would appreciate specific guidance on its non-applicability to the situation in Nepal.

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  The MEA announced on February 2 that India will not attend the SAARC Summit scheduled for February 6-7 in Dhaka.  Both publicly and privately, GOI officials cited both King Gyanendra's actions in Nepal on February 1, and the security situation in Dhaka following the violence of January 27, as the reasons for the decision.  Foreign policy commentators noted that Nepal weighed more heavily, but the GOI was also looking to send a message to Dhaka about the political situation there.  Indicative of the extent of the deliberations in calling off India's participation, PM Singh consulted former PM Vajpayee prior to making his final decision -- a rare instance of foreign policy bipartisanship that came in the midst of a bitter state election season. Multilaterally only SAARC trade negotiations are likely to suffer from this further delay, but bilaterally India's decision puts off important air clearing for Manmohan Singh with his Pakistani and Bangladeshi counterparts.  End Summary.  Convergence of Events ---------------------  2.  (C) Explaining that it was the result of a combination of recent developments in Nepal and concern over the security situation in Dhaka, Under Secretary (Bangladesh) Puneet Kundal told Poloff on February 2 that India will not attend the thirteenth SAARC Summit in Dhaka as scheduled.  MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal, Bhutan) Ranjit Rae remarked to PolCouns and  SIPDIS Poloff that Nepal had a lot to do with it, and Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar added that \"Bangladesh has  SIPDIS not made things any easier with their behavior.\"  Kundal added that concerns over the safety of Indian officials traveling to Dhaka following the August 27 attack which killed MP and former Awami League finance minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria and reports of bomb blasts near the hotel in which the Prime Minister was scheduled to stay, factored into the GOI's decision.  No Photos with Gyanendra ------------------------  3.  (C) Foreign affairs commentator, Jyoti Malhotra remarked to Poloff that both Nepal and Bangladesh influenced the GOI's decision, but King Gyanendra's actions in Kathmandu weighed more heavily.  Malhotra observed that the message for Nepal is that \"India will not stand for this kind of behavior,\" adding that when in 1999 Pakistan's President Musharraf came to power through a coup, India did not attend the SAARC Summit for two years.  4.  (U) Following the GOI's strong statement against Gyanendra for disposing with democracy (ref A), some foreign policy watchers had speculated that his attendance at the Summit would put India in \"an embarrassing position.\"  The \"Telegraph's\" Pranay Sharma remarked that India's engagement with Gyanendra at the Summit would grant legitimacy to the King's undemocratic actions.  Foreign Secretary Saran was pushed hard on this question of who India was blaming at a February 2 press briefing, leading one journalist to conclude that Nepal was the \"straw that broke the camel's back.\"  5.  (C) After the GOI's announcement on February 2, Sharma told Poloff that the GOI can point to this decision as supporting both pro-democracy groups in Kathmandu and the opposition Awami League in Dhaka.  Malhotra concurred, noting that \"India stood up for its Awami League friends.\"  Sharma commented that since the August 21, 2004 attack on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, India had been thinking about taking some action with respect to Bangladesh.  After the January 27 violence, some officials were urging a reconsideration of India's attendance at the Summit, and \"Nepal just gave them another reason.\"  Indicative of the extent of the deliberations in calling off India's participation, PM Singh consulted former PM Vajpayee prior to making his final decision.  This encounter represented a rare gesture of foreign policy bipartisanship amid a bitter election season Comment -------  6.  (C) The crisis in Nepal was apparently the prime motivator in New Delhi's decision to not attend the SAARC Summit, but certainly conditions in Dhaka did not help.  Not having the Summit could lead to further delay on the most important SAARC initiative, the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which the members had hoped to roll out in January 2006.  It also means that important air clearing bilateral meetings between PM Singh and Pakistani PM Shaukat Aziz and Bangladeshi PM Zia, and the PM's first trip to one of India's neighbors, are all on the back burner for now.  For India-Pakistan relations there is some consolation in that FM Natwar Singh is scheduled to be in Islamabad later this month, but for ties with Dhaka, the sinking Summit carries more weight.

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) In a February 1 conversation with Poloff, Portuguese DCM Frederico Nascimento confirmed recent Indian press reports stating that his country's Supreme Court had rendered a decision to permit the extradition of Abu Salem to India. He noted that this decision allows the extradition of Salem to India for trial in major offenses, not only minor ones as the court had previously decided.  Nascimento also confirmed that Salem could appeal the decision to the Constitutional Court, but that if he did not take this step, or if it failed, the CBI would be free to formally approach Portugal for extradition.  A CBI spokesperson told the press that the law enforcement agency was awaiting instructions from Portugal before sending a team there to escort Salem to Mumbai.  Nascimento declined to be drawn out on what the next steps in this process might be.  2.  (SBU) Abu Salem is wanted in India for suspected involvement in more than 57 cases, including serial bomb blasts that that killed nearly 300 people in 1993 in Mumbai. Several journalists have commented to us that the Mumbai police is likely to have difficulty proving Salem's involvement in many of the cases registered against him. However, press sources close to the Mumbai police claim that the police is in possession of an audio recording of a conversation between Salem and other individuals discussing the conspiracy.  Mumbai law enforcement officials reportedly believe that an interrogation of Salem could yield new information on links between prominent Indian personalities and the Indian underworld, particularly in Mumbai.  3.  (C) Dr. Ajai Sahni, Director of the Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management, predicted that the extradition of Salem to India would have little effect on GOI efforts in the war on terrorism.  Observing that the record of judicial incompetence over the last several years in cases against other notorious gangsters and terrorists extradited to India has not translated into convictions, Sahni also questioned whether the GOI has the forensic and investigative abilities to effectively try Salem with the evidence they possess. Nonetheless, because of Salem's high profile past, our collaboration with Indian and Portuguese authorities in bringing him to justice is an important bellwether of our CT partnership with the GOI.

Mulford, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D).  1.  (C) Summary: New Delhi's surprisingly angry reaction to developments in Nepal underlines the serious mid to long-term implications the GOI believes King Gyanendra's actions will have on Nepal, India, and the GOI's larger foreign policy objectives.  From New Delhi's perspective, the King has strengthened the Maoists and critically injured legitimate political forces in Nepal, including multiparty democracy and the monarchy itself.  The resulting instability could spill across the border, a scenario that is particularly worrying given indications of growing cooperation between Nepalese Maoists and anti-India insurgents.  The King's dismissal of Indian concerns and his refusal even to communicate with New Delhi also comes as an embarrassment, especially in light of India's aspirations to a growing extra-regional role. Finally, the situation in Nepal raises uncomfortable questions about India's foreign policy strategies, especially better relations with the PRC, which has taken a far different approach to the crisis.  For the GOI, one of the few bright spots in this episode has been the close, collaborative approach that Washington has taken.  Given acute Indian frustration over the King's action and threats to \"take some unpopular decisions,\" it is plausible that India could suspend military assistance or other support.  We should communicate to the GOI our strategy for dealing with the Palace, and the limits on what we are prepared to do. Mission would appreciate overnight guidance for a meeting the Ambassador has with NSA Narayanan on February 4.  See action request paragraph 6.  End Summary.  Undermining Democracy and the Monarchy --------------------------------------  2.  (C) India believes that King Gyanendra's actions have threatened Nepal's long-term political stability by undermining both the monarchy and multiparty democracy, while inadvertently strengthening the Maoists.  According to South Asian Studies Professor and influential GOI advisor SD Muni, the Palace has eroded the democratic advances made in Nepal since 1960, effectively destroying gains in openness and human rights and setting Nepal's political development back by many years.  From India's perspective, the King has also substantially damaged the monarchy, a concern that has grown since Maoist leaders offered to unite with the parties to defeat the Palace.  3.  (C) The waning of democracy and potential increase in Maoist influence could have immediate domestic repercussions for India, particularly in the border areas of West Bengal, Bihar, and Sikkim.  Foreign Secretary Saran noted in a February 2 press conference that the Maoist insurgency has already resulted in a \"very large exodus of ordinary Nepalis\" to India, and the local press is reporting that senior Maoists have crossed the border since the King's February 1 seizure of power.  This is particularly troubling given GOI concerns about the growing nexus between the Maoists and anti-India militants, and is likely to loom especially large for NSA Narayanan, who in the past has expressed to us deep concern about the Maoist phenomenon.  The reported exodus into India of Nepalis -- including some Maoists -- is a particular concern because the border state of Bihar is among the worst affected by \"Naxalite\" violence.  A Snub to India ---------------  4.  (C) Gyanendra's actions were interpreted by many here as a \"snub to India\" given the GOI's repeated insistence that the King work with the political parties to defeat the Maoist insurgency.  During his February 2 press conference, FS Saran reiterated his annoyance with Gyanedra, complaining that India had advised the King on numerous occasions \"against taking the kind of step that he has taken.\"  As an additional insult, the Palace has rebuffed repeated Indian attempts to communicate through diplomatic and military channels, a move viewed by New Delhi as an overt act of defiance.  Commenting on Gyanendra's refusal to speak with Indian officials, Saran noted that \"there is no way in which we are able to engage the Government of Nepal in even making a proper assessment of what is happening.\"  Given that Nepal falls squarely within New Delhi's sphere of influence, the King's refusal to bend to Indian insistence, or even to communicate with New Delhi, is an embarrassment.  Foreign Policy Concerns -----------------------  5.  (C) The on-going crisis in Nepal also raises prickly questions for India's foreign policy agenda, particularly with respect to China.  Beijing's tacit acceptance of the King's actions, and local suspicions that the Palace has tried to ingratiate itself with the PRC by closing the offices of the Dalai Lama, have the potential to create a source of friction in the India-China relationship, especially given the widespread perception that Beijing hopes to \"contain\" and encircle India.  Comment and Action Request --------------------------  6.  (C) Continued cooperation with the GOI on Nepal provides a tangible opportunity to put the US-India strategic partnership to work in furtherance of our shared objectives. Given Indian anger over Gyanendra's actions, we are inclined to take seriously Foreign Secretary Saran's warning to the Ambassador that New Delhi may have to \"take some unpopular decisions.\"  We find it entirely plausible that if the Palace persists in the current course, New Delhi could decide to express its unhappiness by suspending military assistance or other forms of support.  Given that, it will be important to communicate to the GOI our strategy for dealing with the Palace, and the limits on what we are prepared to do in sanctioning the GON.  If we fail to do this upfront and India takes steps we are unable to support, we could find our currently favorable relations severely strained.  Mission requests specific points on this issue that we could convey to Foreign Secretary Saran and NSA Narayanan, for a meeting the Ambassador has with Narayanan on February 4. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary:  The Government of India (GOI) rewarded Bhutanese King Jigme Singye Wangchuck for conducting military operations in December of 2003 against Indian militants hiding out in Southern Bhutan by making him the guest of honor at Republic Day.  During the King's January 24-28 visit, the GOI privately pressed the Bhutanese to find a solution to the ongoing refugee problem with Nepal and announced a significant increase in the GOI's development assistance.  King Wangchuck stated the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) will release a draft constitution in March, highlighted the Kingdom's concerns about Maoist activities in Nepal, announced a plan to build a number of railway links between the two countries, reiterated the RGOB's commitment to the repatriation of Category 1 refugees, discussed Sino-Bhutanese relations and announced that he was trying to cut down smoking cigarettes.  End Summary.  Militants in the North East --------------------------- 2.  (C) King Wangchuck held the position as guest of honor during the January 26 Republic Day celebration, a reflection of the GOI's appreciation for Bhutan's successful military operations against Indian militants in December 2003. According to a number of pundits who follow Bhutan, this decision highlighted the importance of the fight against the insurgents in North-East India and demonstrated New Delhi's gratitude to the RGOB for carrying out the mission.  Category 1 Refugees ------------------- 3.  (C) MEA Joint Secretary Ranjit Rae (Nepal and Bhutan) told Polcouns and poloffs on February 2 that the King reiterated his commitment to the Dewey/Wangchuck framework for repatriation of Category 1 refugees (Reftel) during his visit, but stated that it depends on the security situation in Nepal.  In one of his media interactions, the King reportedly stated a majority of the refugees in the camps are not Bhutanese citizens.  However, in a February 2 meeting with Poloff, Bhutanese First Secretary Karma Rinchhen commented that this was not a policy change.  The RGOB has never considered a majority of the refugees to be citizens and he argued the people in Category 2 gave up citizenship when they left Bhutan.  However, Rinchhen noted that under the terms of the bilateral process, these people will have the option to reapply for citizenship.  4.  (C) Rae commented that he thought the plan to repatriate Category 1's was \"a pretty good initiative\" and wondered why it had not succeeded.  He said the GOI had pressed the King to accept the Category 1's and revive the bilateral process. Rae stressed the need to have the Nepalese and Bhutanese ambassadors meet on the issue in Delhi, arguing that not every aspect of the negotiations should go through formal letters between the two capitols.  India has also made this point to Kathmandu.  Rae inquired about numbers for possible third country resettlement in the U.S., emphasizing the point that other solutions could become clear if this information was available.  Polcouns reiterated our standard line on this issue.  Power to the People ----------------- 5. (U) During a January 30 meeting with journalists, King Wangchuck reiterated his commitment to devolving authority and creating a constitutional monarchy, announcing that the draft constitution would be released in March.  He stated he plans to travel throughout Bhutan holding meetings to promote the new constitution before the document is put up for a referendum later in the year.  King Wangchuck explained that Bhutan is coming to the end of a long transition, which began in 1991, from a monarchy to democracy and will implement a constitution with an amalgamation of ideas from a number of other countries.  He commented that, when implemented, the constitution will clearly define the role of the monarchy. Foreshadowing the Trouble in Nepal ---------------------------------- 6.  (U) Four days prior to King Gyanendra of Nepal's decision to dismiss the Deuba government and take over power, King Wangchuck expressed concern that the situation in Nepal was deteriorating day-by-day and that \"as friends and neighbors, we do not want the situation (to get) out of control.\"  The Maoists hold sway in 69 districts, stated Wangchuck, but he hoped that \"something good, something positive\" would come out of the situation. However, he warned that the Maoists had almost total control over Nepal and the situation could become \"much more serious than it is today,\" having negative implications for both India and Bhutan.  7.  (C) Bhutanese First Secretary Karma Rinchhen told poloff on February 2 that the RGOB did not intend to make any public statement concerning the change in government in Nepal, but that it was not considered \"a good thing.\"  He added that the RGOB is going to take a wait and see approach to the situation.  He argued that if King Gyanendra shows that he can make progress in the fight against the Maoists and bring real security to Nepal \"how can that not be seen as a positive development?\"  Rinchhen added that the Deuba administration had not effectively dealt with the insurgency, but the removal of his government will be problematic if the situation continues to spiral out of control.  Rinchhen was very interested in how the change in regime would effect U.S. aid to the region, specifically in terms of military assistance.  He reiterated RGOB concerns of a Maoist spill-over into Bhutan and links between the Maoists and the United Liberation from of Assam (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and Kamtapur Liberation Organization (KLO).  When questioned if the RGOB believes if these groups were currently operational in Bhutan, he said no, \"but the threat is still there.\"  Increase in Aid --------------- 8.  (U) In connection with the King's visit, India has agreed to increase development assistance to Bhutan from Rs. 430 crore (US $100 million) to Rs. 710 crore (US $165 million) during the current Five Year Plan (2002-2007).  According to the Bhutanese National newspaper (Kuensel), Bhutan and India signed three memorandums of understanding (MoU) during the King's visit focusing on development. The MoU's concerned cooperation on agriculture, continuing the development of the hydropower industry, and a feasibility study for a network of railway lines from five locations in Bhutan to connection points in India. Currently, there are no rail links between the two countries.  China ----- 9.  (U) Numerous media outlets reported that the King's expression of optimism about resolving RGOB differences with China over disputed border areas.  He was quoted as saying that out of the 450 km frontier, only a small portion is under question.  He also de-linked Thimphu's decision not to have full diplomatic ties with China from the boundary dispute, stating that Bhutan does not have full diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent members of the UNSC.  When questioned how this policy could change if India receives a seat on the council (which Bhutan supports), he commented, \"This (policy) can't apply to India. It would be like divorcing your wife.\"  No Smoking in Shangri La ------------------------ 10.  (U) In response to the recent ban on smoking in public places in Bhutan and the announcement of 100 percent sales and imports taxes on cigarettes, King Wangchuck announced that he, as a smoker, would try and cut back on the habit. When asked how many cigarettes he smokes a day, he quipped, \"I don't want to tell you. With four wives, I better stop smoking.\"  Comment ------- 11.  (C) In wake of the decision by King Gyanendra of Nepal to dismiss the coalition government on February 1 and the Bhutanese government's often stated concerns for the security of their Joint Verification Teams, it is unlikely the repatriation of Category 1 refugees according to the Dewey/Wangchuck framework will occur in the near future. While the RGOB maintains they are committed to the Joint Verification Process, the combination of the implementation of the new constitution, the upheaval in Nepal and concerns over Maoist infiltration in the refugee camps will likely result in RGOB delaying the process.  In the meantime, however, GOI support for the Dewey/Wangchuck framework, and New Delhi's willingness to weigh in on this topic with Thimphu is a hopeful signal of India's willingness to join forces with us in pursuit of a long term solution to the refugee problem.

Blake, Jr., for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Despite skepticism from some strategic commentators, the Indian government continues to express interest in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and other maritime security programs, but will not join PSI unless the matter of the Core Group is resolved.  In the latest signal of GOI support for PSI principles, MOD Mukherjee flagged PSI as a necessary response to the threat of global proliferation networks.  On a related issue, negotiations on Indian participation in the Container Security Initiative (CSI) are at an advanced stage, with a delegation scheduled to travel to Washington later in February to formalize GOI involvement.  CSI may be a useful stepping-stone toward engaging with India on maritime security issues, but we will not get India off the fence on PSI until we clarify the status of Indian membership in the Core Group.  End Summary.  Continued Interest -- and Questions -- about PSI --------------------------------------------- ---  2.  (U) In the most positive indication to date that the GOI is interested in expanding its maritime security engagement with the US, DefMin Pranab Mukherjee on January 29 stressed the need for a multilateral mechanism to tackle the threat of WMD proliferation.  In comments at a major Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses' (IDSA) conference, Mukherjee recalled that India had interdicted a North Korean ship carrying missile components in 1999, and how the intercept of a ship carrying uranium enrichment equipment to Libya eventually led to the unraveling of the AQ Khan network. \"The anxiety is that these instances could well be the tip of the iceberg,\" he warned.  \"Some initiatives such as the PSI have been mooted.  These need to be examined in greater detail.  The underlying need for a consensual multilateral effort cannot be denied,\" the DefMin concluded.  3.  (C) In a recent meeting with PolCouns and Pol-MilOff, MEA Additional Secretary (International Security) Meera Shankar reiterated GOI interest in joining PSI, but not in contravention of maritime conventions and not as a \"junior partner.\"  According to Shankar, the GOI will not consider participating in PSI until there is clarification on the status of the Core Group, i.e., whether India will be admitted to the Core Group or whether the Core Group is disbanded altogether.  \"We recognize a convergence of objectives on PSI:  maritime security, preventing proliferation to non-state actors,\" she said, \"but we can't accept discriminatory membership or contravening international law.\"  Skeptics Weigh In -----------------  4.  (C) The GOI's conditional interest in collaborating with the US on maritime security programs such as PSI, the Container Security Initiative (CSI), and the nascent Regional Maritime Security Initiative (RMSI) contrasts with strategists' skepticism about these initiatives.  In a January 31 article for the influential Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Vijay Sakhuja noted that some Asian nations have reacted differently to these initiatives, reflecting concerns about their status vis-a-vis UNCLOS, the legality of consequent interdictions, impact on trade, sovereignty, and about a growing US presence in Asian waters.  \"Although there is broad convergence on issues of common security concerns (which) may even provide the impetus to bring the Indian and US navies closer, India must be conscious about regional security concerns and not get muddled in American strategic moves in the region, particularly with regard to PSI and RMSI,\" he cautioned.  He went on, however, to encourage support for CSI, to the extent that it enables greater trade with the US.  5.  (U) Prominent \"Hindu\" foreign affairs commentator Siddharth Varadarajan has also pointed out that PSI does not distinguish between WMD and missiles.  \"The US may have accepted India's de facto nuclear status, but it remains a vocal critic of the country's missile program.  Unless India's own missile status is formally accepted, it will be difficult for New Delhi to participate in the aggressive pursuit of international ships suspected of carrying missile parts,\" he argued.  Repositioning India as a Nonproliferation Partner --------------------------------------------- ----  6.  (U) Countering these critics, JNU Professor and frequent Indo-US commentator Dr. C. Raja Mohan has argued that participation in PSI and CSI may be an opportunity for India to reposition itself as part of the global nonproliferation solution.  According to Mohan, PM Manmohan Singh wants India to \"negotiate purposefully on the terms under which it could join the new global nonproliferation initiatives, including PSI and CSI.\"  \"Getting on board the new global non-proliferation arrangements should, therefore, be at the top of India's diplomatic agenda.  Meanwhile the Indian nuclear discourse must...focus on the new acronyms like the CSI and PSI, where the real action is,\" he concluded.  CSI as a Stepping Stone -----------------------  7.  (U) On February 1, \"The Economic Times\" reported that the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to join the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a high-level meeting of MEA, port, and customs officials will meet in New Delhi on February 4 to finalize terms and conditions.  A GOI delegation is expected to travel to Washington later in February to formalize Indian participation.  In a February 2 conversation with PolCouns, MEA J/S (Americas) S. Jaishankar expressed satisfaction with progress on CSI, but also cautioned that MEA would need to deal with inevitable Parliamentary questions about a \"give away\" of Indian sovereignty.  In this context, he added, it would be important for India to negotiate a reciprocal CSI agreement that allows the GOI to say its undertakings with Washington are mirrored in Indian rights vis-a-vis US commerce.  Comment -------  8.  (C) India's CSI interest is a useful stepping-stone toward greater engagement on maritime security.  We find GOI concern about the possible conflict between PSI and international maritime conventions something of a red herring, given the extent to which other major maritime trade nations have already considered and disposed of this issue -- and expect the same to happen here when the matter is treated at the political level.  The key to getting India off the fence on PSI remains clarifying the status of Indian membership in the Core Group.  If we can resolve that, we will be pushing on an open door to enlist India as a partner in our global counterproliferation efforts. MULFORD " }

(C) On January 27, MEA Director (Americas) Renu Pall gave us the following non-paper on 2003-04 attacks against Ahmediyas in Bangladesh.  This non-paper was originally referenced by our GOI interlocutors during the August 31-September 1, 2004 US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group (CTJWG) meeting in New Delhi.  2.  (S) Begin lightly-edited text:  Title: \"Attacks on Ahmediyas\"  In November 2003, a mob in Dhaka attacked members of the Ahmediya sect (or \"Kadianis\" as they are called in Bangladesh).  Several hundred people tried to prevent the Ahmediyas from entering a mosque on a Friday after the Imam of the Rehaim Metal Mosque exhorted all \"real Muslims\" to wage a jihad against the \"kafir Kadianis.\"  In January 2004, the Bangladeshi government announced a ban on the publications of the Ahmediya community.  This decision was reportedly taken at the highest levels.  Reports indicate that this anti-Ahmediya campaign is being provoked by the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ), a member of the four-party ruling alliance.  This announcement of the ban came shortly before an ultimatum by the Hifazate Khatme Nabuwat Andolan (HKNA) seeking the excommunication of the Ahmediyas.  The government also announced the withdrawal of cases against some 12,000 anti-Ahmediya activists including dropping charges for assaulting policemen during demonstrations in Dhaka in November-December 2003.  On April 16, 2004 several anti-Ahmediya activists entered the Ahmediya mosque in Dhaka.  Police failed to take action against this.  In late April 2004, the houses of 12 Ahmediyas in Badarganj (Rangpur district) were vandalized.  Subsequently, an attempt to capture the Ahmediya mosque in the same area was prevented by police.  An Islamic outfit \"Aamra Dhaka Bashi\" announced on 23 August, 2004 its plan to besiege the Ahmediya Headquarters complex at Bakshi Bazar, Dhaka, on 27 August, 2004, to demand the declaration of Ahmediyas as \"non-Muslims.\"  Reportedly, Imams and Maulvis at different places throughout Bangladesh have started issuing fatwas calling for social ostracizing and boycotts against Ahmediyas.  The GOB has not shown much concern over the threat.  State Minister for Religious Affairs Musharraf Hussain Shahjahan disclaimed any responsibility in the regard and State Minister for Home Lutfussaman Babar said that he did not have details about the issue.  The human rights organization Amnesty International, in a report posted on its website entitled, \"Bangladesh:  The Ahmediya community - Their Rights Must Be Protected,\" called upon the GOB to lift the ban on Ahmediya publications.  US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Christina Rocca during her visit to Bangladesh in May 2004 was also outspoken about religious intolerance in the country.  She visited the Ahmediya Mosque and in a public statement said, \"religious minorities must be protected, not stigmatized or victimized by book banning and attacks on their places of worship.\"  She also hoped that Bangladesh would continue \"on the road to being a tolerant country.\"  End text.

(C) On January 27, MEA Director (Americas) Renu Pall gave us the following non-paper list of 2003-04 arms seizures in Bangladesh.  This non-paper was originally referenced by our GOI interlocutors during the August 31-September 1, 2004 US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group (CTJWG) meeting in New Delhi.  2.  (S) Begin lightly-edited text:  Title: \"Recent Major Arms seizures in Bangladesh\"  -- June 27, 2003: In Bogra 1,000,000 bullets and 200 kilograms of explosives were seized.  -- November 30, 2003: In Dhaka police recovered four AK-47 rifles, two revolvers, 20 hand grenades, four time bombs, 1,000 AK-47 bullets, 2 kilograms of plastic explosives, and sophisticated walkie-talkies after a gun fight with a criminal outfit.  -- September-October 2003: The Bangladesh Rifles recovered five bombs, 130 kilograms of plastic explosives, 226 hand grenades, 310 grenade launchers, 50 time-delay detonators, and 14 containers of chemicals from the dense forests in Bandarban.  -- April 2, 2004: The biggest arms seizure took place in Chittagong. The weapons consisted of the following:  Submachine guns/AK-47s: 1,290 Magazines for submachine guns (Chinese and South Korean): 6,392 \"Tommy\" guns:     100 Semi-automatic spot rifle/Uzis:     400 Rocket launchers (40 mm), made in China:  150 Rockets (40 mm), made in China:     840 Grenade launchers, made in South Korea:   2,000 Hand grenades, made in South Korea: 25,000 Bullets (Chinese and South Korean) rounds:      1.84 million  -- April 26, 2004: Bangladeshi security agencies intercepted a mini-bus with crates of arms and ammunition camouflaged under cigarettes and watermelons on the Feni-Belonia route close to the Tripura border.  These arms are believed to be a part of the April 2 seizure, which evaded detection.  End Text.  Comment -------  3.  (C)  Pall made no request for USG action on the above matter.

Mulford, Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1.  (S) Summary: With political momentum in its favor, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) expects to solidify its hold on power in 2005.  The Congress-led coalition's pursuit of closer US-India ties will continue unabated, but the exigencies of coalition government will slow progress on issues of importance to the US.  While committed to economic reform, the GOI and the UPA leadership will not move too quickly, so as not to lose support of the Left, which backs the UPA from the outside and opposes most forms of economic liberalization.  Although there have been no dramatic Composite Dialogue breakthroughs, we will encourage Manmohan Singh to inject new momentum into Indo-Pak relations as former PM Vajpayee did on several occasions.  The recent tsunami tragedy resulted in an unprecedented degree of  SIPDIS civilian and military coordination between the USG and India to deliver immediate relief to Sri Lanka and Indonesia.  We hope the successful outcome of the January 30 elections in Iraq will afford us a new chance to push India to expand its thus far disappointing engagement in Iraq. Institutionalizing GOI progress on Trafficking in Persons and encouraging sustained, concrete high level action and funding on HIV/AIDS also will be major Mission priorities. End Summary.  Internal Politics -----------------  2.  (C) In the eight months since his unexpected victory in the May parliamentary elections, former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh steadily consolidated his position as the \"accidental PM.\"  The BJP and its allies have been stuck in a tailspin following a series of electoral defeats, characterized by public spats between BJP leaders, as well as between party moderates and Hindu nationalists.  3.  (C) Domestic politics returned to the fore after the disastrous tsunami that hit India at the end of 2004 momentarily diverted attention away from political affairs. India's response to the tsunami was to deter outside direct assistance and material to demonstrate that it could deal with its own internal tragedy while at the same time making a strong statement of regional leadership by providing assistance to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia.  In early February, India will hold elections in Haryana, Jharkhand, and Bihar, the only state polls scheduled for 2005.  These will be major contests for the BJP and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which must halt if not reverse their string of election defeats to remain viable. We expect the UPA will retain control in Bihar, while likely unseating the BJP in Jharkhand and a regional party in Haryana.  That outcome could exacerbate the rift between the BJP's centrist coalition builders and hard line Hindu nationalists.  The budget session of parliament, which is set to begin on February 25, will demonstrate whether Congress can overcome opposition from its Leftist allies to implement economic reforms, while fulfilling the populist promises of the Common Minimum Program (CMP).   On January 3, India's National Security Advisor JN Dixit died suddenly, and was succeeded by Senior Advisor NK Narayanan.  The process raised questions about the role and relevance of the office of the NSA, which has played a major positive role in the growing US-India relationship.  4.  (C) By the end of 2005 it will become apparent whether Congress and its UPA allies have solidified their hold on power.  If the BJP/NDA does badly in the three state contests in February, Congress could convince some secular parties to leave the NDA alliance and cross over to the UPA.   This could also increase factionalism within the BJP, fueling speculation of a split within the Sangh Parivar.   If the BJP does not resolve its leadership issues and end infighting within its middle-tier leadership, its decline could deepen. As Congress grows more confident, it could demand a greater role within the UPA and in states where it rules in coalition with regional parties -- we have already seen this trend in Maharashtra, where Congress successfully held out for the Chief Ministership.  Congress will continue to build strength in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and could use growing law and order problems to invoke governor's rule and bring on a new election in an attempt to unseat the regional party in power there.  Although some Congress leaders would like to call new parliamentary elections to gain an absolute UPA majority and end its dependence on the troublesome Left parties, this is not likely to happen in 2005.  Local elections in J&K will mark the first time in 27 years that Kashmir residents will choose their neighborhood leaders.  We will continue pressure for New Delhi-Srinagar dialogue; an outcome that may become more likely after Congress takes control of the Chief Ministership in the fall.  Indo-Pak --------  5.  (S/NF) when viewed in comparison to 2002/2003, India's relations with Islamabad have improved significantly.  The LOC cease-fire, which reached its first anniversary on November 26, 2004, has qualitatively improved the lives of Kashmiris.  The Home and Defense Ministries reported drops in infiltration rates and violence from Kashmir-oriented terrorist groups, attributing this progress to the fencing of major sections of the LOC, and the cease-fire that permitted fence construction to proceed.  The two rounds of the Composite Dialogue took place without rancor and recrimination, and there was incremental progress on counter terrorism, nuclear CBMs and counternarcotics cooperation.  On the margins of the UNGA, the PM told Musharraf his views on Kashmir:  India will discuss it, but will not agree to a second partition based on religion or a redrawing of the Indo-Pak boundaries.  We will quietly encourage PM Singh to follow the example of former PM Vajpayee and intervene to propose fresh initiatives when talks between the two bureaucracies bog down, particularly since the politics of Indo-Pak relations have swung in favor of greater rapprochement here.  6.  (C) New Delhi appears content with the current pace of engagement with Islamabad, and is clearly interested in trying to erase the \"trust deficit\" by increasing bilateral trade and people-to-people contacts.  It is unclear how long talks will continue absent deliverables, and observers are divided over how much to credit \"process in the absence of progress.\"  If terrorist violence in Kashmir and infiltration across the LOC continues, even at lower levels, a major attack during the year could compel an Indian response. Growing Indo-Pak goodwill generated over the past year has raised the threshold for military action, but GOI tolerance is not infinite, and the first three weeks of 2005 already saw two suicide attacks on government officers in Srinagar. The GOI has taken a low-key approach to Islamabad's decision to bring the Baglihar dispute to third-party arbitration, believing that the facts and the treaty are on its side. While Baglihar is unlikely to disrupt the bilateral dialog on other issues, it looms over the February 6-7 SAARC summit and FM Natwar Singh's mid-February visit to Islamabad and could sour otherwise cordial Indo-Pak atmospherics.  Musharraf's January 15 statement that the GOP would not move forward on CBMs until differences over the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus have been overcome further complicated Kashmir dialog.  The Pakistan cricket team is scheduled to play a series of test matches in India from February through March, which should result in some of the same goodwill seen in the 2004 test series in Pakistan.  NSSP ----  7.  (S) In completing Phase One of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) in September, the UPA succeeded in doing what the previous NDA government would not, and provided assurances regarding non-diversion of technology to the US that it later reaffirmed on the floor of parliament. Phase Two of the NSSP requires intensive efforts by the GOI to introduce national legislation governing technology transfer, and commit to adhere to MTCR and NSG guidelines. The GOI is especially keen to see some flexibility on the parameters for cooperation on civil nuclear safety issues, warning that without progress on that front, the scientific establishment will hold back advancements on other NSSP. Officials in India's nuclear agencies have become outspokenly opposed to strengthening export controls, in the belief that the NSSP will not benefit them.  The GOI remains supportive of US goals on international non-proliferation, and is frustrated that we have not seen fit either to bring India into the core group of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), or disband the Core Group altogether.  The GOI has also signaled its intention to join the Container Security Initiative and plans to send a team to Washington in late February to agree on a way forward.  Military Relations ------------------  8.  (C) The Indian military has embarked on an ambitious modernization program starting with revising its Army doctrine, procuring cutting-edge equipment and technology to enhance its capabilities, and conducting joint and combined exercises with an expanding number of partners.   The Army also considered changing its counterinsurgency methods, converting more battalions to Special Forces units, and increasing use of precision munitions and information warfare.  An ambitious schedule of US-India joint military exercises, including the largest such event to date off the Indian coast in October, enhanced US-India mil-mil ties and paved the way for better relations in other areas.  These efforts laid the groundwork for unprecedented cooperation between the US and India in tsunami relief.  A US decision to move ahead with an F-16 sale to Pakistan, and the subsequent political fallout, however, would endanger US hopes for a breakthrough arms sale to India in the near future.  9.  (C) The Indian Air Force has extended the deadline for the US to submit a bid on 126 multi-role fighter aircraft to replace India's aging MiG fleet.  This represents the best opportunity we have had in years to cap three years of successful exercises and other military engagement with a decision to seriously compete in India's annual $14 billion defense market and demonstrate our confidence in the 21st century partnership that the President's NSSP initiative embodies.  (Note:  The USG has not yet responded to the Indian offer).  Whether the US participates in this tender or not, it will have a competitive presence at India's annual air show (Aero-India) in mid-February.  Later in February, the GOI is expected to receive a classified briefing on the PAC-2 missile defense system, followed by an initial exploratory meeting for a future missile defense and command post exercise.  Economic Outlook ----------------  10.  (SBU) During his first seven months as PM Manmohan Singh signaled his intention to keep market-oriented reforms moving forward.  He assembled several like-minded reformers around him, including Finance Minister Chidambaram and Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Collectively, they charted the course on future economic policy and were able and knowledgeable interlocutors in our bilateral Economic Dialogue.  This capable team faced significant political obstacles from the Left in its attempts to advance economic reforms outlined in the \"Common Minimum Program (CMP).\"  11.  (C) Finance Minister Chidambaram submitted a Mid-Year Review to Parliament on December 13 concerning the state of the economy after the first six months of the fiscal year (April 1 - September 30).  The document lowers the prediction for GDP growth to \"6 percent-plus\" for the full fiscal year, indicating that the budget deficit target may slip, and flagged higher inflation.  However, the Review addressed several economic reforms that correspond closely with our own mid-term economic and commercial strategy and our ongoing engagement with the GOI.  It envisions the roll out on April 1 of the value-added tax (VAT), calls for reducing federal subsidies, highlights infrastructure development, and urges liberalizing FDI.  The document also hints at opening up the now-closed retail sector to FDI as a means of creating an \"integrated common market\" for agricultural products.  It is not certain, however, that the PM and his team can sell these reforms to Parliament, and especially to the Left.  12.  (SBU) Because of leftist opposition, labor law reform and the privatization of most state-owned companies appear to be off the table, although the GOI may proceed with limited asset sales that do not reduce government ownership below 50 percent of equity.  The Left has historically opposed most forms of FDI; attacking GOI plans to raise FDI caps on telecom companies (74 percent from 49 percent), and insurance (49 percent from 26 percent).  Its posture has put it in conflict with PM Singh's ambitious goal of attracting $150 billion in FDI for infrastructure development in the next 10 years.  Singh has publicly acknowledged that the UPA must still win over the Left on FDI.  With this as a political backdrop, economic reform will likely move forward on an ad-hoc basis.  Issues that have popular support, like reducing bureaucratic red tape and simplifying the tax code, will move forward.   Nonetheless, some observers believe that a general compromise is slowly being forged behind the scenes, with the Left giving tacit assent for liberalizing FDI regulations and proceeding with a new patent law, in exchange for a strong government commitment to rural development and a rural jobs program.  Meanwhile, the GOI has agreed to sign with us its first ever Open Skies Agreement. Mission looks forward to Secretary Mineta's late March visit here to sign the Agreement.  Iraq ----  13.  (C) The GOI expressed high-level interest in providing training and other material assistance for Iraq's January 30 elections.  However, it was hamstrung by its policy barring Indian citizens from going to Iraq and by strong Left party opposition against any involvement until a democratically-elected governments takes the reigns in Baghdad.  GOI support for the January polls was limited to the $10 million it had already committed to the UN Trust Fund.  Although frustrated by lack of access to decision-makers in Baghdad, poor information flow, and absence of response to its offers of assistance, New Delhi says it is committed to playing a larger role in subsequent Iraqi polls scheduled later in 2005.  A very positive GOI statement following the January 30 elections was drafted with Washington in mind, and we will encourage a GOI effort to get back into the game of Iraq reconstruction and political reform.  Regional Engagement -------------------  14.  (C) India's \"Look East\" policy and PM Singh's personal interest in pursuing close economic ties with Southeast Asia, as well as India's vision of itself as a balance to China, ensures that New Delhi will continue to pay close attention to ASEAN for economic as well as strategic reasons.  At the 2004 ASEAN Plus One Summit, the PM committed India to free trade with parts of the organization by the distant deadline of 2011, with no indication of concrete steps towards that goal in 2005.   Initially opposed to an East Asia Summit on the grounds that there already exists an ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN plus Japan, Korea, China), the MEA has recently indicated that if invited, India will participate.  15.  (C) Progress on SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area) negotiations leading up to the planned January 2006 implementation date will be a principal focus for SAARC in 2005.  Although the MEA has outlined an ambitious plan for SAFTA negotiations, aimed at having an agreement for member ratification by July 2005, India has generally preferred bilateral tracks for liberalized trade.  Within South Asia India has an FTA with Sri Lanka, a de facto one with both Nepal and Bhutan, and is in the very early stages of discussion with Bangladesh, leaving out only Pakistan. Uncertainty about the PM's attendance at the February SAARC Summit in Dhaka reflected continued difficulty in the GOI-GOB relationship, and genuine Indian concerns about the security situation there.  16.  (C) Bangladesh:  Press reports indicate that PM Singh may not attend the SAARC summit in Dhaka, which was to be the site of the first bilateral meeting between PM Singh and Bangladeshi PM Khaleda Zia.  Should such a meeting take place, it would give a much-needed goodwill boost to India-Bangladesh relations early in the year.  However, one meeting is unlikely to resolve continuing New Delhi's frustration over what it sees as Dhaka's complicit support for Northeastern insurgent groups.  Economics may provide some positive impetus to the relationship.  In early January the petroleum and natural resources ministers of India, Bangladesh and Burma met in Rangoon and agreed to proceed with an oil and gas pipeline from Burma through Bangladesh. New Delhi's response to Dhaka's request for access through India for hydroelectricity and goods from Nepal and Bhutan will set the tone for progress on the pipeline.  In late 2004, the MEA expressed to us some optimism regarding the Tata Corporation's proposed USD two billion investment in Bangladesh.  However, without Bangladeshi acknowledgment of Indian concerns about support for Northeastern militants, the relationship will likely remain uneasy.  Mission will continue to encourage real information sharing towards US-India CT cooperation on the India-Bangladesh border.  17.  (C) China: India's engagement with China is likely to maintain its upward trajectory in 2005.  China will continue to figure prominently in New Delhi's foreign policy calculus, as India continues its ascent to regional and global power status, and seeks opportunities in rapidly expanding Sino-Indian trade.  Both countries conducted a first-ever strategic dialogue on January 24, further broadening the scope of India-China diplomatic interaction.  The discussions, led by Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei, included an exchange of views on terrorism, non-proliferation, energy security, UN reform, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea.  Border talks are also likely to continue, although four rounds of discussions have yielded few concrete results, and the demise of NSA Dixit -- India's China negotiator -- reduces the prospects of diplomatic innovation.  Lingering suspicions and lack of trust will remain obstacles to the bilateral relationship on the Indian side, especially as New Delhi views with concern the PLA's military build-up on the Tibetan plateau and in Burma, and Beijing's strong relationship with Pakistan.  18.  (C) Nepal: The February 1 dismissal of the government by King Gyanendra complicated the India-Nepal relationship. While the GOI described the incident as a \"serious setback\" to the cause of democracy and reaffirmed its support for Nepal's political parties, early indications are that it will take a cautious approach, so as to not to encourage Nepal's on-going Maoist insurgency.  The GOI remains committed to do \"whatever is necessary\" to help Nepal defeat the Maoists, and does not want the security situation there to deteriorate further.  The king's actions will further strain his already testy relationship with New Delhi.  Shared concerns about the political crisis and the Maoist insurgency will continue to provide opportunities for greater US-India dialogue and collaboration, taking advantage of New Delhi's influence and insight into political dynamics in Kathmandu.  19.  (C) Afghanistan: India welcomed President Karzai's re-election and expressed a desire for successful Afghan Parliamentary elections.  With India's policy towards Afghanistan moving to the post-Bonn phase, the GOI is currently looking at the next phase of reconstruction projects, which represent India's largest aid program anywhere.  Trafficking in Persons ----------------------  20. (C) Initially placed on Tier II in the 2002 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) certification baseline survey, India slipped to the Tier II Special Watch List in 2004 for failing to demonstrate increased central government law enforcement response to its huge trafficking problem and inadequate local prosecutions in Mumbai and Calcutta.  The US subsequently presented the GOI with a list of suggested actions, including: A) creating and empowering a national anti-TIP coordinator; B) designating and empowering a national anti-trafficking law enforcement agency; C) encouraging state governments, particularly Maharashtra and West Bengal, to increase significantly the number of trafficking-related prosecutions and convictions; D) implementing the 1998 National Plan of Action; E) strengthening national anti-trafficking law and F) increasing public awareness of trafficking.  Failure to demonstrate progress on this agenda could result in India slipping to Tier III in the 2005 TIP certification process, and the imposition of sanctions.  GOI, NGO and private sector contacts admit that India is deficient in TIP law enforcement, but argue that Tier III placement could be highly counterproductive to USG/GOI relations, particularly to anti-TIP cooperation.  21.  (C) While the previous government virtually refused to discuss the TIP issue, the UPA administration has been open to exploring greater anti-TIP cooperation. The MEA Joint Secretary (Americas), and the Secretary of the Department of  SIPDIS Women and Child Development (DWCD) have been very pro-active.  Strong Embassy efforts at the highest levels are bearing fruit.  The GOI has made significant movement on virtually every issue except designating and empowering a national anti-trafficking law enforcement agency.  The GOI argues that since India's constitution enshrines law enforcement as a state issue, it cannot directly enforce national laws (including anti-TIP laws) at the state level.  22. (C) We understand that the DWDC Secretary will be appointed as the nodal interagency TIP coordinator and that she will chair an interagency meeting on February 4 to agree on a forward strategy that is expected to include acceptance of U.S. training to improve law enforcement, particularly in areas the U.S. has identified as weak, i.e., Goa and Mumbai. In any case, USG/GOI anti-TIP cooperation will continue to be a high Mission priority.  Social Issues -------------  23.  (U) HIV/AIDS in India is at a critical stage.  With at least 5.1 million people infected, the number of people living with the disease is second only to South Africa.  The epidemic initially surfaced in urban areas, but is showing clear signs of spreading to the countryside.  In response, the GOI has increased its HIV/AIDS activities, especially in advocacy and awareness creation.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will head the GOI's National Council on AIDS and play a critical role in expanding HIV/AIDS activities in India.  The GOI is also reviewing its HIV/AIDS program including current prevalence estimates.  These are encouraging signs but more needs to be done, especially to reduce the stigma associated with the disease.  In addition, the GOI needs to increase significantly its own committment of resources to make HIV/AIDS treatment more affordable.  Expanding USG assistance to India on HIV/AIDS and encouraging increased GOI financing will be major focuses of the Mission this coming year.  Comment -------  24.  (C) US-India relations are increasingly dynamic, firmly on track and further improvement is all but inevitable. There are few major impediments that could change or halt this trajectory, although a clash over Iran sanctions or a US decision to sell F-16's to Pakistan would inevitably detract from the pace.  As Congress solidifies its hold on power, it will come closer to its goal of forming the government without Left/Communist support, will grow more confident, and we could see more scope for progress on issues we care deeply about, such as economic reform, and possibly Iraq.  A perception of slackening US pressure on the issue of terrorist infiltration from Pakistan could diminish India's confidence in the US as a neutral observer in the Indo-Pak equation.  The GOI would like normal relations with Pakistan, so that New Delhi can better focus its attention outside the region and on economic growth, but we do not expect a dramatic improvement in ties with Islamabad in the coming year, or dramatic innovation in the Indian approach to Kashmir.  Although this process will likely continue into the future, regardless of who is in power in New Delhi, its speed and the scope of its development will be influenced by the political quality of our relationship. Minimize considered. MULFORD " }

(C) With NSA Narayanan unavailable until February 7, the Ambassador used a February 4 meeting with Foreign Secretary Saran to convey reftel points detailing our goals and strategy in Nepal.  He also addressed these issues in broad brush during a pull aside with Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.  Saran was grateful for the US approach, stating again his appreciation for the fact that Washington and New Delhi have stayed in synch since the crisis broke.  Speaking in confidence, Saran described several new steps the GOI has taken to signal displeasure with the King's action, including suspension of military \"supplies in the pipeline,\" postponement of a planned visit to Kathmandu by Army chief J.J. Singh, and a review of military training activities (although students currently in India will not be sent back).  \"We are trying to build pressure,\" the Foreign Secretary explained.  2. (C) Saran was highly concerned that China or Russia would exploit this opportunity to make up for any shortfall in military supplies from India, and sought US assistance to prevent that from happening.  He was particularly worried about reports that the RNA chief had contacted Russia to provide MI-17 helicopters.  \"We just cannot accept that,\" Saran underlined, adding that the mere fact of the request was worrisome.  Saran was also concerned by rumors that President Musharraf was reaching out to the King, fearing that this too could be part of an effort to take advantage of India's firm policy in order to cultivate influence with the Palace.  The Ambassador noted that we have already weighed in with the Chinese, and promised to convey the Foreign Secretary's worries about other players.  SIPDIS  3. (C) Saran offered a brief update on reporting from the Indian team in Kathmandu, noting that the RNA has taken over patrols outside homes of detained politicians, and has confiscated cell phones from some.  He concluded by asking that the US weigh in with Moscow and use its contacts with the RNA to reinforce India's message to the Army that \"they need to lay off.\" MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 756      B. NEW DELHI 594  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The reaction of India's political parties and major newspapers to the January 30 election in Iraq predictably reflected their political orientations.  The UPA government saw the election as a step forward, but unveiled no new initiatives or specific plans for greater engagement. The opposition BJP expressed wholehearted support for the election, hinted that the GOI should quickly increase its involvement and urged tough military measures against the insurgents.  The Communist parties dismissed the election as flawed, downplayed its significance, and opposed any greater GOI involvement in Iraq until American forces depart.  The UPA is divided, with many on its left wing sympathetic to the Communist view, which will induce continued caution. Capitalizing on the positive results of the elections, the Ambassador arranged a join press conference with Iraqi Charge Muyad Hussain on February 4 to provide a forum for the under-exposed Charge to make observations about the conduct of the polls, offer insights about how India can assist Iraq in the future, and answer questions from the press.  Embassy also plans to explore with Embassy Baghdad ways in which we might encourage India to expand its engagement in Iraq.  End Summary.  Two Insider Comments --------------------  2.  (U) Reacting to the GOI's January 31 statement that described the voter turnout as \"encouraging,\" and a \"noteworthy development,\" the \"Times of India\" diplomatic correspondent Indrani Bagchi claimed that the MEA has realized that the election has put \"a stamp of legitimacy on the exercise, that will be recognized by the UN, the EU and Iraq's neighbors,\" and quoted a senior MEA official as saying, \"the Americans have pulled it off, first in Afghanistan and now in Iraq,\" and \"India will have to recalibrate its stance towards Iraq.\"  Pointing out that India's Ambassador in Iraq has not been replaced following his retirement several months ago, several editorials urged the MEA to show its commitment to Iraq by filling the post. In the interim, the GOI's newly-appointed Special Envoy to West Asia, Chinmaya Gharekhan will travel throughout the region and submit a detailed report on the election's impact (septel).  3.  (U) Leading strategic thinker K. Subrahmanyam argued that \"it would be a mistake to treat the events in Iraq as peripheral to our national interests,\" in that India could reap benefits from a short-term alliance with the US that will far outweigh any costs thereafter.  Pointing out that India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, Subrahmanyam maintained that \"India cannot afford to commit a mistake when democratization of Islamic regimes is the issue.\"  He concluded, however, that \"we should protect ourselves from any major disruptive developments to our national security and interests caused by religious fundamentalist forces.\"  The UPA View ------------  4.  (C) In a February 3 meeting with Poloff, Congress MP Rashid Alvi, who is close to the Gandhi family and coterie and has an insider's view of party thinking, maintained that the Congress and the UPA would stick to the official GOI statement welcoming the election as a sign of progress.  He confided, however, that many in Congress remain opposed to US Iraq policy and share the views of the Communists that India should not become too deeply involved too quickly.  Communist Views ---------------  5.  (U) India's Communists predictably dismissed the election.  Leninist CPI leader A.B. Bardhan cast doubt on the initial estimates of voter participation, and called on Iraqis to continue resistance to the \"US occupation.\" Pro-Beijing CPI(M) Politburo member Prakash Karat struck a slightly different tone, suggesting that the Left Front \"would not oppose a decision to establish relations with the new government and some level of humanitarian aid,.\" but urged the GOI not to intervene further until \"peace is restored, and US troops are pulled out.\"  6.  (U) Left-oriented newspapers echoed these views.  The \"Hindu\" derided US efforts to depict the election as a \"turning point,\" saying \"Washington cannot wish away the disturbing trends in the pattern of the voting,\" in which \"a majority of Sunni voters apparently obeyed the insurgents' call for a poll boycott.\"  The paper warned that the election could \"sharpen the sectarian divide and push the country to the brink of civil war.\"  The \"Asian Age\" stated that \"no election held under a foreign military occupation has any legitimacy under international law.\"  7.  (U) Hamid Ansari, former Indian Ambassador and prominent commentator on Islam, agreed that the GOI should \"cooperate with Iraq in its reconstruction in every possible way,\" but that this does not mean that India should accept the \"ideological predilections\" of the US, which he described as: \"the doctrines of pre-emption, regime change, coercive democratization, cartographic engineering and 'Islamic threat.\"  8.  (U) The mass-circulation Bengali daily \"Anandabazar Patrika,\" respected in the \"Red Fort\" of Calcutta, claimed that the election has \"actually neutered the Leftists to a great extent,\" as they must now admit that an \"imperialist force\" has completed a successful \"experiment in democracy.\" The paper argued that the Communists cannot continue to denounce the election without being seen to \"deny the democratic process.\"  The BJP View ------------  9.  (C) The pro-BJP \"Pioneer\" was effusive in its praise for the election, claiming that \"it clearly indicates that the over-whelming majority of Iraq's population wants not terrorism and violence but peace, democracy and the restoration of normal conditions.\"  The newspaper urged that the best way for the US to ensure the success of Iraqi democracy is to crush \"terrorism with a mailed fist,\" and not to remove its troops \"until the job is done.\"  10.  (C) In a February 4 meeting with Poloff, Retired LTG. N.S. Malik, BJP Convenor of Defense Affairs, and Vijay Vir of the BJP National Council congratulated the US for a \"job well done\" in Iraq, and expressed support for the US troops for \"undertaking a difficult job under trying circumstances.\" Malik maintained that while BJP sympathies are with the US in Iraq, it cannot support increased Indian involvement until the UN takes over from the US.  He predicted that a fully democratic and sovereign democratic government will be in place in Iraq \"within the year,\" and suggested that the UN should be invited in shortly thereafter.  11.  (C) General Malik pointed out that Iraq has long been \"India's greatest friend in the Middle East,\" that the Indian armed forces trained the Iraqis for many years, and that Indian companies built much of Iraq's infrastructure. According to Malik, Indian firms are eager to get back into Iraq.  Vir pointed out that the vast majority of Indian Muslims are Sunni, and the UPA wants their backing, and will not antagonize them by backing US actions in Iraq which they view as \"anti-Islamic.\"  Will the Left Come Around? --------------------------  12.  (U) Some insiders have predicted that the Left will soften its resistance and quietly acquiesce to greater GOI involvement in Iraq.  Quoting \"top government sources,\" the \"Times of India\" Bagchi claimed that the UPA would soon initiate a dialogue on Iraq and that the Left parties will \"be more pragmatic and take reality into consideration,\"  and claimed that \"the first steps on the realistic road have already been taken.\"  13.  (C) Congress MP Alvi dismissed Communist opposition to increased Indian involvement in Iraq, stating that \"they oppose any US policy and are not important.\"  Alvi claimed that both PM Singh and Sonia Gandhi had stated to him that the Communists could not change Indian foreign policy. According to Alvi, the Congress leadership has determined that the Left's principal concern is acquiring and maintaining power in its three \"red forts (West Bengal, Tripura, Kerala),\" and that critical statements were meant primarily to appease its supporters there.  Alvi maintained that rhetoric aside, the Left would not withdraw support from the UPA government on any foreign policy issue as long as the only alternative is the BJP's return to power.  Enthusiastic Shia Support -------------------------  14.  (U) Indian Shias continue to express strong public support for the elections (Ref B).  Leading Shia organizations held a public meeting in Lucknow on February 2 to \"rejoice on the occasion of the first peaceful elections in Iraq in five decades,\" and to \"thank all those countries who have contributed significantly to ensure the safety and security of Shia religious shrines in Iraq from terrorists.\" At the meeting, Shia leader Hasan Mehdi compared Sunni terrorists in Iraq to those in J&K, noting that they are opposed to democracy and want to prevent people from voting.  15.  (C) Shia Leader Zaheer Zaidi told Poloff February 3 that Indian Shias welcomed the election and anticipate that conditions will soon stabilize in Iraq enough for large numbers of them to begin visiting the Iraqi holy places in peace.  Zaidi praised Ayatollah Sistani for his role in the elections, confirmed that Indian Shias acknowledge him as their leader and would take direction from him regarding democratization.  He noted that Indian Shia leaders regularly travel to Iraq to meet with Sistani and his aides.  Some Shia Skepticism --------------------  16.  (U) Leading Shia journalist Saeed Naqvi took a more skeptical view, arguing that \"the voter turnout should be seen for what it is: a means to get the Americans out.  Under Grand Ayatollah Sistani's leadership, the Shias decided on \"tactics of patience,\" but \"the dangerous trek to the polling booths was their way of demonstrating that they would go to any lengths to ensure than occupation of their ends.  If the Americans read the meaning of the turnout in any other way, they will face Iraq's 60 percent population turning upon them the way the 20 percent has over the last two years,\" he commented.  And Sunni Disdain -----------------  17.  (C) India's dominant Sunni press has been almost uniformly negative, condemning the election as \"a sham exercise aimed at serving colonial interests and nothing else,\" and describing the elections as \"neither free, nor fair, nor democratic,\" as \"they took place under the state of emergency and the threat to use force,\" with candidates \"hand-picked by an occupying power with a monopoly on TV reporting.\"  One Urdu daily described the elections as a a \"stage-managed show with no credibility,\" claiming that the Iraqis have \"rejected the Americans, their stooges and their policies in Iraq.\" in that both \"those who voted and those who boycotted\" want to \"get rid of their common enemy.\"  Embassy Outreach ----------------  18.  (SBU)  The Ambassador and Iraqi Charge Muyad Hussain held a joint press conference on February 4.  In his opening statement, Hussain highlighted the prospects that successful elections presented to the Indo-Iraq relationship.  \"There are lots of opportunities for the Indian business community to re-establish its old position....Indians have long experience in working in the region and Iraq can benefit from their expertise in various fields: construction, engineering, oil exploration, and information technology,\" he stated. Responding to a question from a reporter, Hussain went on to say that Iraq needs more assistance from the international community and was also looking to India to provide more help, but stopped short of saying what specific assistance Iraq sought from the GOI.  The event generated generally favorable coverage, with most local press focusing on whether the GOI will see the polls as the impetus to step up its engagement in Iraq.  19.  (C) Behind the scenes, post will continue to encourage the GOI toward greater involvement in Iraq, recognizing, however, that in order to do this, the GOI will have to proceed cautiously with incremental steps that do not require Parliamentary approval, so as not to raise the ire of those that oppose such moves within its own coalition.  Comment -------  20.  (C) The election results caught the UPA and the Indian political class by surprise, but opposition to US Iraq policy remains deep-rooted, and one successful election was not enough to swing Indian popular opinion decisively in favor of greater GOI engagement in Iraq.  Although the January 30 election had a positive impact on popular political sentiments, and may yet influence GOI policy, the UPA leadership appears determined to move very cautiously so as not to get too far out front of the population.  Embassy plans to consult Embassy Baghdad on specific ways that we might encourage India to expand its engagement within the political parameters outlined above.  BAGHDAD Minimize Considered.

NEW DELHI 940      B. 04 NEW DELHI 8053  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: On February 2, the MEA announced the appointment of retired career diplomat Chinmaya Gharekhan as Special Envoy for West Asia and the Middle East Peace Process.  In creating this position, the GOI signaled its hope to raise New Delhi's profile in the Gulf, where India has an underdeveloped policy, and hinted at more attention to Iraq following interest in the country's recent elections (ref A).  India's energy security is a major GOI focus in the Gulf, but it may be too big an issue for Gharekhan, who has spent much of his diplomatic career in the UN system, and faces competition from Energy Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who himself is a former Foreign Service Officer, and has been unusually active in projecting India's energy diplomacy. Gharekhan's major expertise in the Middle East stems from having served as UN Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories.  End Summary.  Wanted: A More Active Middle East Policy ----------------------------------------  2.  (C) In designating Chinmaya R. Gharekhan Special Envoy for West Asia and the Middle East Peace Process, the GOI signaled its recognition of the need for a \"big picture view\" of the region, former Ambassador Hamid Ansari of the Observer Research Foundation told Poloff.  This is the first time in memory, he remarked, that India had appointed such a regional envoy, adding that New Delhi felt the need for someone who can look at the \"larger issues that go beyond individual ambassadors.\"  The GOI announced Gharekhan's appointment less than a week after PM Manmohan Singh, in a major address at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University, asserted that India will pursue a \"proactive strategy\" with the Middle East and highlighted the \"long-standing tragedy of the Palestinian people.\"  Iraq will also likely be one of the issues in Gharekhan's portfolio, Ambassador Ansari predicted, but he thought the Envoy's primary function will be to monitor the Middle East peace process, \"now that it is moving again.\" Having served as UN Special Coordinator for the Occupied Territories, Gharekhan was well-qualified to do that, Ansari added.  3.  (C) The cool reception Foreign Minister Natwar Singh received when he traveled to Egypt in December for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's funeral (in large part because India decided not to be represented at the head of state level) highlighted the disconnect between India's professed affinity for the region and the reality of underdeveloped relations between New Delhi and Gulf and other Arab states (ref B).  \"Times of India\" Foreign Affairs Editor Indrani Bagchi told Poloff on February 4 that the new position reflects New Delhi's effort to develop a more coherent policy towards the region, and a special envoy will flag issues that \"could become big, before they do.\"  Bagchi observed that Gharekhan's appointment represents a further attempt by the MEA to wrest control of Indian foreign policy back from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) following Dixit's death.  Under Dixit and NSA Mishra, for instance, relations with Iran and Israel were firmly ensconced in the Prime Minster's Office.  She added, however, that although Gharekhan and Natwar are friends, the envoy will report to the PMO. 4.  (C) The Gharekhan appointment also suggests a desire to rationalize Indian policy towards the NEA region.  In a Foreign Ministry bureaucracy dominated by regional joint secretaries, the Middle East is currently dispersed among  SIPDIS three Joint Secretaries -- Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran (PAI), Gulf, and West Asia/North Africa (WANA).  The Gulf portfolio is also responsible for the politically sensitive Haj account, leaving little time for that official to engage in policy innovation.  Iraq in the Envoy's Portfolio? ------------------------------  5.  (C) Following the January 30 elections in Iraq, India's role and lack of presence there has come under scrutiny in New Delhi (ref A).  After his appointment, local media quoted Gharekhan as having said that \"the Indian government is very conscious about taking the close and friendly relations with Iraq forward,\" citing Iraq's exceptional (among Arab countries) support for India on Kashmir.  While Ambassador Ansari insisted that the peace process will dominate Gharekhan's job description, journalist Saeed Naqvi was doubtful, dismissing official suggestions to that end as \"clever leaks,\" and arguing instead that the Envoy will focus on Iraq, beginning with his reaction to the recent elections there.  Energy Security ---------------  6.  (C) India's overriding interest in the Middle East is energy security, with 70 percent of domestic petroleum consumption imported from the region and a growing appetite for fuel.  Gharekhan as Envoy, however, is not likely to pursue this issue as part of his responsibilities, according to Bagchi, on the grounds that the issue is too big for the MEA.  It may even be too big for Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, a former FSO, who has made energy diplomacy a major part of his priorities.  Pulling these bureaucratic fiefdoms together ultimately will require involvement by the Prime Minister himself.  Bio Note: More a UN Man -----------------------  7.  (C) A friend of FM Natwar Singh, Gharekhan is a career diplomat who has served as India's Permanent Representative to the UN in New York (1986-1992) and Geneva (1977-1980).  He was MEA Joint Secretary for the Pakistan and UN divisions (1980-1983), and an Additional Secretary in Rajiv Gandhi's PMO from 1984 to 1986.  After his retirement in 1992, Gharekhan was appointed the UN Secretary General's Personal Representative to the Security Council, and later as Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories from October 1996 to September 1999.  In October 2004, Natwar made Gharekhan part of his six-member Policy Advisory Group.  After retirement, he also lived for an extended period in Sharon, Connecticut, where his daughter was a doctor.  Since returning to Delhi, he has been a regular on the retired Ambassador's circuit, and has been open and accessible to the Embassy.  Comment ------- 8.  (C) As we work to capitalize on the coincidence of our shared interests with India in the Middle East, Gharekhan's appointment provides another high-level point of interaction in the GOI.  We will continue to monitor how the position develops as the MEA and PMO jockey for foreign policy leadership in the aftermath of NSA Dixit's death.  An early indicator should be a regional trip that Gharekhan will reportedly take to assess the aftermath of the Iraq elections.  In creating Gharekhan's position, New Delhi may be bolstering its ability to engage more substantively in Iraq, but evidence for such a GOI course change is not yet clear.  9.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (C) Summary: In his first meeting with the Ambassador since his elevation as National Security Adviser, MK Narayanan identified progress in US-India relations as one of the three or four top priorities that the PM has tasked him to focus upon.  Although Narayanan was uninformed about Phase 2 of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (PolCouns briefed in detail), the NSA understood the importance of PMO involvement to maintaining forward momentum, including on the NSSP export control benchmarks.  Narayanan also welcomed the Ambassador's proposal to stay in close touch on our respective regional policies, relating  how King Gyanendra had explicitly assured Prime Minister Singh in a January telephone call that there would be no Palace move against the civilian government.  The NSA was typically preoccupied with India's eastern neighbors, warning of creeping \"Talibanization\" in Bangladesh and leadership splits in Burma.  On Kashmir, Narayanan assessed that violence is \"now at one of its lowest levels in 15 years, with a vibrant grassroots democracy.\"  But he also warned that this progress is \"fragile and cannot be taken for granted.\"  In a telling reflection of the NSA's place in the national security hierarchy, Narayanan mentioned on two issues the need to check with the Foreign Ministry before getting back to us, but also emphasized that he, more than most, is attuned to the political realities of coalition government.  End Summary.  2. (C) The Ambassador used a February 7 meeting with recently-named NSA MK Narayanan to review major issues on our bilateral agenda and to seek a better sense of where Narayanan will fit into the new national security team. Narayanan continues to occupy the same tastefully decorated office he used as internal security adviser, a few steps down the hall from the PM's South Block office, but the stacks of files on his desk and credenza had grown visibly since the last time we saw him there.  Responding to the Ambassador's opening presentation, Narayanan explained that Manmohan Singh had identified progress in US-India relations as one of the three or four top priorities that he expected the new NSA to focus upon.  In this context, he was up to speed on issues including the Boeing civil aircraft tender (he noted the importance of the President's phone call) and discussion of a possible Presidential visit later this year.  Although familiar with the broad outlines of our Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) Narayanan was unbriefed on the Phase 2 requirements or the status of Phase 1 implementation.  PolCouns briefed in detail on the Phase 2 quid-pro-quos, reinforcing the Ambassador's hope that the GOI will quickly build an interagency consensus for the required export control legislation.  Narayanan asked specifically about the division of NSSP responsibilities between State and NSC, sharing his sense that White House (and PMO) backing had been key to getting us this far.  Nepal -----  3. (C) The Ambassador noted with concern the pattern of insurgency and failing governance that seems to be emerging in much of India's periphery, and flagged the need for us to coordinate closely, including through intelligence and C/T channels.  Honing in on Nepal, Narayanan described King Gyanendra as an \"enigma,\" whose declarations the GOI is no longer prepared to believe.  To explain this point, the NSA described a January conversation in which the King conveyed to the PM his decision to postpone a long-anticipated visit to New Delhi.  Asked explicitly whether the Palace was \"planning something,\" the King said no.  These Palace reassurances were conveyed again in late January, so that now, Narayanan added, whatever the King says \"we will take with a ton of salt.\"  Echoing the Foreign Secretary (reftel), Narayanan expressed concern about Chinese efforts to exploit the crisis in Kathmandu for bilateral advantage, and was pleased that the US had joined India in demarching Beijing on the need to oppose the King's action.  4. (C) Looking beyond the immediate situation in Kathmandu, Narayanan described a deep crisis of governance, with the political parties marginalized, the King hurting democracy and a crown prince who is a \"loon.\"  \"We can starve the RNA,\" Narayanan noted, but what if that just \"strengthens the Maoists?\"  Narayanan said he did not anticipate any changes in the current GOI position, but asked rhetorically how we should deal with the Maoists -- pointing to the fact that the Palace writ now extends only to Kathmandu, and not beyond.  Bangladesh/Burma ----------------  5. (C) Turning to Bangladesh, the NSA described with concern what he called a BDG \"plan to decimate Awami League leaders\" adding that this \"is not something we can accept as part of their system.\"  He argued that Jamat Islami is now firmly entrenched in rural Bangladesh, warning of what he termed the creeping \"Talibanization\" of that country.  PolCouns pressed for better US-India information sharing in this area, prompting Narayanan to promise to check with the MEA on how our dialogue might be intensified.  In addition to spill over effects from Bangladesh, Narayanan was also concerned by what he called the \"apparent divergence\" within the leadership in Burma, and the risk that India could find itself surrounded \"by states which are collapsing.\"  Kashmir -------  6. (C) The Ambassador raised Kashmir, asking about conditions of governance there.  Narayanan was cautiously upbeat, reporting that \"violence is now at one of its lowest levels in 15 years, with a vibrant grassroots democracy.\"  But he also warned that this progress is \"fragile and cannot be taken for granted.\"  (Other Pakistan topics septel). Concluding this SA overview, Narayanan offered to pursue the idea of an intensified regional dialogue that addresses the issues in a less piecemeal manner.  Military Sales --------------  7. (C) The meeting wraped-up with a review of military sales issues, building on Narayanan's discussion earlier that day with a delegation from the US-India Business Council headed by Tom Pickering and Joe Ralston.  The Ambassador cited the strong US delegation at Aero-India as evidence of the US intention to play in a big way in the Indian military sales area.  Narayanan -- who spoke warmly of his past relationships with Ambassador Pickering and General Ralston -- described the US as \"the most important player in the market\" with a diverse range of offerings.  Nonetheless, Narayanan said, \"we have a nagging feeling about reliability.\"  The Ambassador argued that US companies are well positioned to address the Indian interest in co-production, and underlined that the climate for addressing reliability issues has totally changed in the US.

NEW DELHI 709       B. NEW DELHI 961  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The expected appointment of retired career diplomat Satinder Kumar Lambah as Special Envoy to Pakistan would maintain the web of engagement between New Delhi and Islamabad, but at a quieter pitch, a decidedly lower political level, and with firmer MEA guidance than was the case when JN Dixit and Brajesh Mishra handled the back-channel.  Lambah would owe his job to Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, his superior in the MEA over twenty years ago. This will reinforce his \"low profile\" personality and ensure that the Indo-Pak back-channel closely follows South Block's lead.  Although Lambah is not an anti-Pakistan hawk, he would not be the free-wheeling operator that Dixit was, and would probably prove less able to clear bureaucratic and policy logjams in New Delhi.  Lambah's apparent selection would be the latest example of PM Manmohan Singh's attempts to rationalize the bureaucracy and eliminate the competing power centers represented in the past by \"super-diplomats\" like Dixit and Mishra.  It will also place a greater burden on the PM to be willing to intervene with new ideas and initiatives if MEA-led efforts stumble.  This cable also provides biographic data on Lambah.  End Summary.  Moving the Back-Channel Off the Front Page ... --------------------------------------------- -  2.  (C) Ambassador SK Lambah has not been publicly named as the next interlocutor with Islamabad, although \"Hindu\" Diplomatic Correspondent Amit Baruah recently said that his assignment \"is an 'open secret' in South Block and beyond.\" He speculated that \"since the 'official track two' is supposed to be quiet, no formal announcement would be made.\" Both Commodore Uday Bhaskar, Deputy Director of the MOD-affiliated Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, and BJP Foreign Policy Adviser Ambassador SK Arora emphasized to Poloff the importance the GOI placed on keeping the back-channel talks out of the public eye, ostensibly to avoid inflating expectations or sending conflicting signals.  In this regard, MEA has repeatedly expressed to us their consternation at frequent leaks from Islamabad of engagements between Dixit, Mishra, and GOP NSA Tariq Aziz.  ... And Moving Diplomacy Back to the MEA ----------------------------------------  3.  (C) Lambah's anticipated selection as Special Envoy would also represent the latest in a string of recent MEA victories to consolidate high-level diplomacy back into the Foreign Ministry (Ref A).  Lambah, like Special Envoy for West Asia Chinmaya Gharekhan (Ref B), is expected to report to Foreign Minister Natwar Singh -- a break from NSAs Dixit and Brajesh Mishra, who enjoyed direct access to the PM.  Foreign affairs editors in New Delhi are betting that other special envoys to be named, for example to China and to the European Union, would also be \"MEA men,\" which will strengthen and enlarge Natwar Singh's political clout.  4.  (C) Interestingly (and another sign of the MEA's concerted effort to regain control of the foreign policy function), PMO Director Pavan Kapoor -- who accompanied Mishra and Dixit on all their private diplomacy -- told PolCouns on February 3 that he will not be replaced when he leaves for a Geneva posting later in February.  That decision was made by the MEA, which chose not to detail a successor to the PMO (presumably calculating that putting fewer FSOs there makes it harder for that part of South Block to pursue an independent foreign policy).  \"Natwar's Man\" --------------  5.  (C) Because Lambah is expected to report to Natwar Singh, for whom he worked as DCM when the latter was High Commissioner to Islamabad, most observers expect Lambah to be \"Natwar's Man.\"  Former MP Kuldip Nayyar and journalist Zafar Agha told us recently that Lambah would faithfully carry the MEA's messages, but they did not believe he would have the clout to untangle the inevitable logjams that crop up in this relationship.  He would probably find it difficult to initiate policy unilaterally, which appears to be a suitable match for his personality, they said.  Having dealt with Lambah extensively in recent years, we share this assessment that he is unlikely to step out of the Foreign Minister's shadow.  He's No Dixit -------------  6.  (C) In addition to not possessing the political heft and top-level access that JN Dixit enjoyed, Lambah's personality is not the \"force to be reckoned with\" that Dixit's was, according to Nayyar.  However, because Lambah does not represent a separate power center, he could be successful at consensus-building within the MEA.  One of Lambah's former Foreign Ministry superiors, BJP Foreign Affairs Cell member Dr. IP Singh, recalled that in the mid-1970s he was \"a low-profile doer.\"  \"Not Overly Hardline\" ---------------------  7.  (C) Although former High Commissioners to Islamabad are usually hawks on Pakistan -- Natwar himself and Center for Policy Research Professor G. Parthasarthy come to mind -- several Indian commentators have predicted to us that Lambah would be acceptable to the GOP.  NDTV \"Foreign Correspondent\" host Ajai Shukla, who met Lambah in early February, described him as \"not overly hardline\" and \"a sophisticated negotiator able to take the eagle's eye view of bilateral talks held under the watchful eye of the international community (read: US).\"  The Pakistani High Commission had a similar positive view.  Shukla expanded that \"Lambah is the opposite end of the spectrum from Parthasarthy, because Lambah was High Commissioner during a period of relative detente,\" although Islamabad \"may be concerned with Lambah's post-Taliban work in Afghanistan, where he leveraged India's position relative to Pakistan's.\"  Good on US-India ----------------  8.  (C) Lambah is highly regarded by his foreign service colleagues, and has received good reviews for his role as National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) chairman.  As Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Lambah worked closely with his US counterpart, Ambassador Jim Dobbins.  Since retirement, he has been active in the CII/Aspen Strategy Group, a high-level forum that focuses on advancing the US-India relationship. In his frequent interactions with the Embassy, Lambah is open and accessible, speaking warmly of his relationships in the US.  (NOTE: Lambah has refused all meetings until his appointment is announced officially.  End Note.)  Bio-Notes ---------  9.  (C) After joining the IFS in 1964, Lambah held assignments in Moscow, Dhaka, and Rome.  His senior postings were as follows:  -- 1978-82, Deputy Chief of Mission, Islamabad -- 1982-86, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran), New Delhi -- 1983, Deputy Secretary General, Seventh Non-Aligned Summit, New Delhi -- 1986-89, Ambassador to Budapest -- 1989-92, Consul General, San Francisco, where he helped raise $4 million in six months to fund scholarships and two Indian Studies chairs at UC/Berkeley Journalism School -- 1992-95, High Commissioner, Islamabad -- 1995-98, Ambassador to Bonn -- 1998-2001, Ambassador to Moscow -- 2001, Retired from IFS; chaired a committee on MEA reorganization -- 2001-02 (July), Special Representative to Kabul -- 2004, Convener, National Security Advisory Board  10.  (C) Lambah, a Hindu, was born on July 16, 1941, in Peshawar, in what is now Pakistan.  He holds a master's degree in history from the prestigious St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi.  Lambah and his wife, Nilima, have a son and a daughter.  Comment -------  11.  (C) Lambah's selection as Special Envoy would represent the MEA's tightening grip on Indian foreign policy, especially on Indo-Pak relations.  As he dives into the Indo-Pak relationship, we expect he will enjoy a much shorter leash than Dixit.  We do not agree with those who suggest this reflects a downgrading in Pakistan's importance to the GOI.  Rather, it reflects more an across-the-board consolidation of Foreign Ministry control over the Indian international agenda.  Whether Lambah would energize India's approach to Pakistan is another question.  From the Delhi perspective, his appointment could well specify a less vigorous and creative approach to Islamabad, when the times may call for the opposite.  This will put a premium on NSA Narayanan and the PM himself to step in with new ideas and initiatives if/when the MEA-led process breaks down, much as former PM Vajpayee did so successfully.

Begin verbatim text:  -- India had participated in the Core Group set up following the Tsunami as an effort to develop more effective joint action with the US, Australia, and Japan initially and, thereafter with Canada and Netherlands in providing emergency aid and assistance to countries affected by the Tsunami.  -- We have taken note of the US proposal for India to join other donor nations, World Bank,  ADB and the UN Development Group to form a Tsunami Coordination Group.  -- We agree that, in order to be effective, the primary objective for a Tsunami Coordination Group should be to facilitate coordination of efforts by the different donors towards reconstruction and rehabilitation in the Tsunami affected countries and quick disbursement of pledged assistance.  -- We, therefore, support a general conference in spring 2005 to coordinate positions between the donor nations and countries affected by Tsunami.  -- We believe that individual donor events on a country-specific basis would be less in consonance with the required approach and objectives of such a Tsunami Coordination Group.  -- India would endorse a Tsunami Coordination Group for the reconstruction phase on the same principle as behind the setting up of the Core Group following the Tsunami.  -- India has already initiated the process of providing reconstruction assistance on a bilateral basis to countries affected by the Tsunami in its neighborhood, in particular Sri Lanka.  10.02.2005 New Delhi.  End text.  3.  When USAID raised this with SK Chattopadhay, Joint Secretary for Disaster Management at the Ministry of Home  SIPDIS Affairs (MHA), he remarked that the GOI Planning Commission is already coordinating with UNDP, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank on the elaboration of a reconstruction program for affected areas in India.

NEW DELHI 878       B. NEW DELHI 877      C. NEW DELHI 876      D. NEW DELHI 874  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The GOI remains unapologetic about the last minute cancellation of the SAARC Summit and the resulting unhappiness in Dhaka.  In this context, on February 9, the MEA urged PolCouns not to underestimate the extent to which developments in Bangladesh influenced India's decision not to attend the SAARC Summit.  With no apparent sense of urgency to make things right with Dhaka, the MEA explained that the GOI's decision was intended to send a message to the BDG. Despite India's strong stand, our interlocutor reiterated the Foreign Secretary's unconvincing line on the importance of SAARC to New Delhi, and added that other interactions would continue.  In support of this assertion, press reports indicate that the Indian Cabinet has given the Petroleum Minister approval to enter into gas pipeline negotiations with Bangladesh.  Dhaka's High Commissioner complained to the DCM about Indian mistreatment.  We should look for opportunities to continue this dialogue and press for real information sharing.  End Summary.  A Message for Dhaka -------------------  2.  (C) MEA Director (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PolCouns and Poloff that in light of increasing intolerance in Bangladesh and \"sustained anti-India sentiment\" there, India needed to bring pressure to bear on Dhaka.  Describing a \"clarity of thought\" on Bangladesh throughout the GOI, he urged PolCouns not to \"lessen the importance\" of events there in New Delhi's decision not to attend the SAARC Summit.  Sandhu underlined that the King's takeover in Nepal was not the sole motivator for India's change of heart, asserting that developments in both countries took place independent of each other.  The Director added to his list of Bangladeshi offenses that \"sitting ministers\" and senior politicians have made statements against India recently, with the intention of raising passions, and concluded that this is not the \"SAARC spirit.\"  3.  (C) While maintaining that it was about time New Delhi sent a message to Dhaka, Sandhu countered that the signal was not necessarily a negative one, rather it was meant to encourage Bangladesh to be \"introspective.\"  India is not trying to fault the BDG, but wants them to realize the danger to themselves from leaving certain issues unchecked, he argued.  \"The US Doesn't Get It\" -----------------------  4.  (C) Somewhat incredulous that the USG continues to ask for concrete evidence to support India's claims regarding creeping \"Talibanization,\" Sandhu said that even a layman could see what has been going on, and cited recent US press coverage of Islamic extremism in Bangladesh, such as the January \"New York Times Magazine\" expose.  PolCouns pointed out that the information presented in the reftels had all been reported in the press, which the Director argued only further proved his point.  PolCouns noted that an FBI agent for the legatt office in New Delhi was on his way to Dhaka to help on the January 27 attack, and added that we had made very clear US concern about half-hearted investigations of these politically motivated attacks.  Sandhu remained skeptical of US investigators' ability to get results in Bangladesh.  PolCouns offered, in the interest of maintaining US-India dialogue on this issue, to come back with our further insights on the situation in Bangladesh.  Still Neighbors ---------------  5.  (C) While he did not convey any sense of GOI urgency about stopping the backward slide in bilateral relations, Sandhu attempted to express optimism that initiatives already in the works, such as gas pipeline discussions, would continue, and that New Delhi remained committed to regional cooperation in SAARC.  Sandhu insisted that economic interaction between the two countries would not stop, but added that India needs to see the BDG pay attention to New Delhi's political and security concerns.  While refuting the suggestion that India was at a dead-end with Bangladesh, the Director noncommittally predicted the SAARC Summit would happen \"sooner or later.\"  Contrary to the criticism that New Delhi had acted in the opposition Awami League's favor in sinking the Summit, Sandhu asserted that India's decision \"had nothing to do with parties.\"  He added that India should not be seen as a bully, emphasizing that someone needed to call attention to what was going on in Bangladesh.  High Commissioner Cries Foul ----------------------------  6.  (C) In a lunch with the DCM, the Bangladeshi High Commissioner Hemayet Uddin vented his frustration and anger at the way India quashed the SAARC Summit.  Uddin claimed that the GOI made its announcement on February 2 without first notifying either the Ministry in Dhaka or the High Commission in New Delhi, and was especially stung that in his statement, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran singled out Bangladesh as a culprit.  Despite his vitriol, the High Commissioner highlighted some positive developments in the relationship, including plans to begin train service connecting Calcutta to India's Northeast, and the Tata Corporation's planned USD 2 billion investment in Bangladesh which will include the use of local gas supplies and might \"smooth the way\" for fuel sales to India.  Comment -------  7.  (C) The GOI's official line that SAARC is an important aspect of India's foreign policy is contradicted by the meltdown over the Dhaka Summit.  This is unfortunate, not because of the organization's great potential to accomplish regional integration, but because India's commitment to SAARC would demonstrate New Delhi's willingness to sit down with its neighbors and generate some much-needed good will.  While the MEA harbors undisguised disdain for the Government of Bangladesh, there are other stakeholders in the relationship, in particular Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who has successfully moved the Indian Cabinet to give its blessing to his dialogue on a gas pipeline through Bangladesh.  8.  (C) We will also engage with senior-level MEA SAARC experts on the Summit issue, and expect to hear a more nuanced line from that side of the Ministry.  Sandhu accepted PolCouns' suggestion that the US and India continue this discussion at higher levels, and post recommends that we find an early opportunity to revive our SA-led regional dialogue, with a special focus this time on the situation in Bangladesh.

(SBU) Summary: On February 5, the \"Times of India\" ran a hysterical story that metal plates recovered from two \"small-time drug peddlers\" on December 8, 2004 were analyzed and found to be weapons-grade highly enriched uranium. Subsequent reporting, including a press release from India's Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), claimed the material was only depleted uranium (DU) with no significant radiation hazard.  The head of AERB's Operating Plants Safety Division (OPSD) assured SciOff that the material was DU, and described identifying markings on the plates.  Action request for DOE; paragraph 5.  End Summary.  2.  (U) The \"Times\" article entitled \"2 held with weapons-grade uranium in Bareilly\" reported that metal plates recovered from two small time drug peddlers were sent to the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) for examination, and were determined to be 253.6 grams of HEU containing 99 percent (weapons-grade) uranium-235.  The article further reported that senior police sources did not rule out the possibility that the uranium had come from an atomic facility at Narora in Bulandshahr district (Uttar Pradesh), and that the arrested persons were carrying a list of other substances with specific industrial uses including 92U, 26Fe, 14SI, 28NI, and 29CU.  3.  (SBU) In a February 5 conversation, R. Venkataraman, head of OPSD at India's AERB, asserted to SciOff that:  - The material was not/not enriched uranium, but was DU meant to shield radiological sources; - It was not/not from the Indian atomic power station in Narora; - BARC believes it was imported; likely from a scrap yard; and - GOI would issue a detailed press release.  4.  (U) On February 5, AERB released the following statement, which corroborates Mr. Venkataraman's comments:  Begin text:  Uranium Piece Does Not Pose Any Security Threat Or Health Hazard  This is with reference to the news item titled \"2 held with bomb-ready uranium\" that has appeared in a section of the press on February 5, 2005.  In this connection, AERB would like to clarify the situation.  Taking note of the media report about the recovery of a uranium bar that appeared in a Varanasi newspaper in mid-December, AERB contacted the Senior Superintendent of Police, Bareilly for details of the case.  He was also requested to send the piece to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) for testing.  The report of the analysis carried out by BARC has confirmed that the piece is of depleted uranium. This material contains very low concentration of fissile uranium (about 0.21% of Uranium-235) and cannot be used for producing a bomb.  As such the piece does not pose any security threat.  The piece also does not pose any significant radiation/health hazard as the radiation dose on the piece is negligible.  Such pieces of depleted uranium, being a heavy material, are generally used as shielding material in imported industrial radiography cameras, radiotherapy units used in hospitals or as counterweight in aircraft.  There have been instances in the past when such pieces have been found in scrap yards.  The piece is now in the custody of AERB.  End text.  5.  (C) In a February 9 conversation with Mr. Venkataraman, SciOff obtained a verbal description of the recovered material as follows:  - Two metal pieces of aircraft balance weight with \"holes for an allen wrench\"; - Both had \"NH Inc.\" and \"Unauthorized Adjustment Prohibited\" inscribed on them.  AERB officials speculate that the material entered India as scrap, and would like to learn who the manufacturer was. Mission would be grateful for any DOE advice in this regard.  Comment -------  6.  (C) Subsequent press reporting has mostly mirrored the AERB release, although the author of the original \"Times\" article asserted in a follow-up piece that Bareilly police are still concerned that \"the seized metal piece is radiating.\"  At this stage we are confident this is a case where a journalist's lack of scientific understanding led to premature and inaccurate reporting.

NEW DELHI 909      B. NEW DELHI 586      C. 04 NEW DELHI 7494  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: FM Natwar Singh's February 15-17 trip to Islamabad will be an opportunity for the two governments to re-engage at a high level after a hiatus of nearly two months, during which the most important bilateral stories -- Islamabad's request for World Bank assistance to resolve the Baglihar Dam impasse and the January LOC shelling incidents -- were largely negative, and when even the Pakistani cricket team's much-heralded February 25-April 18 tour of India has run into political hiccups.  For New Delhi, Pakistan has taken a back seat to other regional crises in the past month: the Tsunami, Nepal, the SAARC summit postponement, and resulting tensions with Bangladesh.  Although Mission contacts expect no major breakthroughs from Natwar's visit, they are upbeat about the resumption of high-level dialogue, given the opportunities the two sides lost to engage in Dhaka and the interregnum of the back-channel after NSA JN Dixit's death.  In addition to setting dates for Composite Dialogue (CD) and technical meetings through the summer, the Foreign Minister will likely take up concessions the GOI has made regarding the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.  We also continue to hear rumors of an accord on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus.  End Summary.  Overcoming Recent Setbacks on LOC, Baglihar -------------------------------------------  2.  (C) Natwar Singh's February 15-17 trip to Islamabad -- the first senior bilateral interaction since the December 27-28 Foreign Secretaries meeting -- will occur after several setbacks in the Indo-Pak relationship.  Islamabad's request to the World Bank for a neutral arbiter to resolve the Baglihar Dam impasse (Ref A) and the January 18 and 20 cross-LOC shelling incidents (Ref B) have receded into the background, but in the absence of the vigorous diplomatic activity of last fall, these negative episodes have introduced a note of pessimism into the commentary here on the Indo-Pak relationship.  3.  (C) Now that the GOP has initiated the dispute resolution process to address the Baglihar Dam impasse, Mission contacts agree that New Delhi and Islamabad should let the process play itself out.  Former Director of the Observer Research Foundation's (ORF) Pakistan Centre Sushant Sareen explained that Baglihar could be addressed on its technical aspects, unlike the majority of bilateral issues that would require political compromise to resolve.  Commodore Uday Bhaskar, Deputy Director of the MOD-affiliated Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, agreed with this perspective, as did International Centre for Peace Initiatives Director Karan Sawhny.  4.  (C) Senior GOI officials seem willing to continue to give Islamabad the benefit of the doubt regarding the recent shelling incidents.  ORF Senior Pakistan Fellow Wilson John, usually a hawk on Musharraf, speculated to Poloff that the shelling was probably not an \"official\" act, but more likely the work of \"spoilers\" carried out either by Kashmir-focused terrorists or by low-ranking officers of the Pakistan Army acting unilaterally.  IDSA's Bhaskar added that India could \"absorb\" such incidents \"to a point,\" and at the current time the GOI valued the peace process far more than retaliation.  5.  (C) It is reflective of the current Indo-Pak malaise that even the much-awaited India tour of the Pakistani cricket team has become bogged down in wrangling over one of the proposed match sites, with Islamabad objecting to playing in Ahmedabad for \"security reasons,\" which has been read here as a slap at the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat.  Indian observers expect the tour to go on, but the politicization of South Asia's most popular sport -- which last year played such an important role in fomenting mutual goodwill -- has cast a small shadow over the generally upbeat atmosphere around Indo-Pak people-to-people ties.  Opportunity for the GOI to Refocus on Pakistan --------------------------------------------- -  6.  (C) Natwar's trip comes after the GOI has directed much of its foreign policy focus elsewhere for the past several weeks.  Several regional crises -- the December Tsunami and its aftermath, the constitutional coup in Nepal, the deteriorating security situation in Bangladesh, and the GOI decision to pull the plug on the SAARC summit -- have diverted attention away from Pakistan.  ORF's Wilson John joked to Poloff that, \"For once, the border with Pakistan is among India's least concerns.\"  An MEA Joint Secretary echoed this perspective, quipping that India's deteriorating relations elsewhere in South Asia have made Indo-Pak issues look good.  It took only days for the LOC shelling incidents and the Baglihar Dam impasse to disappear from India's major daily newspapers.  Against this background, Natwar's high-profile trip is expected to generate the momentum needed to begin the next round of CD talks.  Prospect for Manmohan Trip in March -----------------------------------  7.  (C) One agenda item certain to be on the Islamabad agenda will be the GOP's invitation to PM Manmohan Singh to visit Pakistan in March.  Coming on the heels of Natwar's trip, and given the positive read-out of PM Singh's meeting with Pakistani PM Shaukat Aziz in November (Ref C), we expect a PM Singh visit would be well received in both countries.  That being said, our MEA interlocutors have carefully stuck to a \"one step at a time\" approach to their bilateral engagements, and have not committed either way on the PM's travel.  The outcome of ongoing state elections and the status of economic reform efforts in the budget session of Parliament could be a factor here.  Clearing the Way for Pipeline Discussions -----------------------------------------  8.  (C) The Indian Cabinet on February 9 authorized Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to pursue energy deals with Burma, Bangladesh, Iran and Pakistan.  This announcement represents a GOI climb-down from the MEA's prior insistence on Pakistan extending MFN to India and/or providing transit rights for Indian trade to Afghanistan as a prerequisite to the pipeline.  In a short conversation looking ahead to Natwar's trip, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K. Singh indicated to PolCouns that this pipeline breakthrough would be a deliverable for the Foreign Minister's trip to Islamabad.  On February 11, Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told the Ambassador that an agreement was \"not going to happen easily, quickly, or smoothly.\"  The Energy and Resources Institute's (TERI) RK Batra indicated to us that numerous pipeline issues remain, including financing, physical protection, and possible ILSA restrictions.  Future of Composite and Technical Talks ---------------------------------------  9.  (C) Natwar's trip should yield a schedule for this Spring's round of bilateral talks, although it would be too soon to expect an announcement of an accord on any of the Composite Dialogue agenda items (Wullar Barrage, Siachen Glacier, Promotion of Friendly Exchanges, Terrorism and Drug Trafficking, Sir Creek, and Confidence Building Measures in Jammu and Kashmir) or the bilateral technical talks (nuclear CBMs, conventional military CBMs, and the Khokhrapar-Munnabao rail link).  One major issue that may be ripe for a breakthrough is the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route.  10.  (C) J/S Singh told us on February 10 that negotiations are continuing, and remarked that \"we're close but not quite there.\"  Veteran journalist and Track-Two practitioner Kuldip Nayyar was convinced the bus service would begin within the year.  Likewise, the \"Hindustan Times's\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri told us that MEA sources have been promising \"something big\" for the Natwar trip, and suggested that the bus was it. International Centre for Peace Initiatives Director Karan Sawhny suggested that even incremental movement in any bilateral discussions would be critical, to ensure that Islamabad continued to find value in ongoing engagement.  A more detailed examination of Indian predictions for Indo-Pak relations in 2005 follows septel.  Next Up: Trade Talks --------------------  11.  (C) In the next scheduled major bilateral interaction, New Delhi will host expert-level trade talks on February 22. There are a host of bilateral trade issues, including normalizing the trade flows that now transit third-countries, intellectual copyright issues, and preparations for the South Asia Free Trade Area that is to begin next year.  Further details on this event will be addressed septel.  Comment -------  12.  (C) Several recent opportunities have passed for Indian and Pakistani officials to interact since the Foreign Secretaries met last December, including the postponed SAARC  SIPDIS summit, and much of the news in the meantime has been unhelpful to the peace process.  If Natwar's trip takes place as scheduled and both capitals see it as successful, that could herald another 6-9 months of diplomatic engagement which would be as important as the continued LOC cease-fire and possible further reduction in Kashmir-oriented terrorism.  The fact that his trip is being heralded as \"the first bilateral visit of an Indian Foreign Minister to Pakistan in 17 years\" demonstrates the difficulty the Indian media has in accurately describing so-called milestones in Indo-Pak diplomacy, given last year's hectic calendar of meetings. However, the run-up to Natwar's trip is demonstrating the new, positive dynamic of Indo-Pak relations, with each senior level encounter creating pressure on the bureaucracy to generate deliverables of some sort -- and that in turn helping to ratchet the two sides further away from conflict.

STATE 25168       B. STATE 24949  Classified By: Ambassador David C. Mulford.  Reasons 1.5. (B,D)  1.  (U) This is an action request.  See para 9.  2.  (C) Summary: As instructed reftels, the Ambassador advised Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran on February 11 of the USG position on assistance to Nepal and our intention to withdraw our Ambassador as early as February 14.  Arguing that the RNA had enough supplies for some time, Saran pressed for a postponement of US military assistance.  Following the meeting, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S Jaishankar called Polcouns requesting a formal reassurance from Washington that the US would not fill the gap created by the GOI and UK suspension of military supplies, given the \"centrality of this issue.\"  Saran said India would also recall its Ambassador, but the timing and duration might not be identical with ours.  The GOI had been thinking along similar lines, and the MEA will revert to us on exact timing.  Saran reported that sources in Kathmandu have told the GOI that the King is looking for a way out of the crisis and has sent an intermediary to New Delhi for discussions.  The Foreign Secretary offered to provide more specificity after he meets  SIPDIS that person on February 12.  End Summary.  3.  (C) In a late afternoon meeting on February 11, the Ambassador underlined to Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran our desire to remain in close consultation with India over the crisis in Nepal, but drew attention to slight differences in our positions on military assistance (Ref B).  Saran was aware that the USG intends to review its assistance programs, but pressed for a postponement of military assistance.  He understood our desire not to embolden the Maoists, but emphasized that India also did \"not wish to give satisfaction to the other side.\"  The UK had also drawn this line, he noted, and the next few weeks would be crucial.  He did not agree with the argument that the RNA could collapse as a result, observing that they had enough arms to carry them over for some time.  We need to build on the pressure, he said.  The King is feeling the heat, and \"if we let up it will disappear.\"  4.  (C) The Ambassador responded by pointing out that the differences between our positions seemed mostly semantic: India has a major arms supply relationship that it has suspended, but does not wish to announce that it has done so.  In contrast, the US does not have such a relationship, and the USG does not wish to make a public statement, because there is nothing to stop right now.  5.  (C) Saran replied that \"the King should know that we will not open the floodgates, and will not send masses of equipment.  He should not get that satisfaction from us,\" and urged the US to be \"clear about what we say.\"  Following the meeting, MEA J/S (Americas) S. Jaishankar called Polcouns requesting a formal reassurance from Washington that the US will not attempt to fill the military supply gap created by the Indian (and UK) suspension of military supplies.  That is \"the key signal at this point,\" Jaishankar emphasized, adding that he \"hopes we understand the centrality of this issue\" for the GOI.  6.  (C) As instructed Ref A, the Ambassador then informed Saran that the United States may recall its Ambassador as early as February 14, and urged India to join with us and the UK in order to send the strongest possible message to the King.  The Foreign Secretary responded that India was also planning to recall its Ambassador for consultations, but that the timing and duration might not be identical with ours. The step would follow in the next several days, he stated. Jaishankar told Polcouns after the meeting that India shares our view on the withdrawal of Ambassadors, and was thinking along the same lines even before our approach.  MEA J/S (Nepal) Ranjit Rae will revert on the specific timing, but it will be \"sooner rather than later.\"  Saran would be happy to meet with Ambassador Moriarty if he comes through Delhi on his way out of Kathmandu.  King Looking for a Way Out? -------------------------- 7.  (C) Saran then reported that highly reliable sources in Kathmandu have told the GOI that the King is looking for a way out of the crisis.  The King is aware that India did not agree with his recent actions, and has sent an intermediary to New Delhi for discussions.  The Foreign Secretary said he would meet that person on February 12, and could provide more specificity after they meet.  8.  (C) During the last several days, very reliable sources had also told the GOI that the King had timed his takeover to coincide with the SAARC Summit, in the hope that he would present the grouping with a fait accompli.  He thought he had a foolproof plan, but has now realized he miscalculated, and that his scenario was unravelling.  The King is not suicidal, Saran observed, which makes it all the more important for us to keep up the pressure.  9.  (C) Action Request: Given the importance of remaining as close as possible to India and the UK on Nepal, Mission requests a formal Washington reassurance that the US will not attempt to fill the military supply gap created by the US and UK suspension of military supplies, as well as guidance regarding the exact state of the US military supply pipeline to Nepal.  A reply by OOB February 12 before the expected February 13 encounter between NSA Narayanan and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld at Wehrkunde would be appreciated. MULFORD " }

Mulford, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) In a February 10 meeting with the Ambassador and staff aide, Dr. Madhavan Nair, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Chairman was generally upbeat about the NSSP framework of growing US-India cooperation on space technology but was visibly frustrated at what he perceives are several significant obstacles slowing progress.  Dr. Nair asked the Ambassador for assistance with:  - the alleged 8 month delay for a one week briefing from Boeing on a transponder bus deal that was the subject of a carefully negotiated State Department license;  - the lack of an umbrella agreement for space technology cooperation or a working group between NASA and ISRO;  - the closing window of opportunity for a US payload to go on the Chandrayaan mission and promoting the idea of ISRO as a launch provider for USG payloads;  - ISRO's end-use licensing checks; and  - visa processing delays for ISRO personnel. Despite these concerns, Dr. Nair remains \"positive\" about the \"good rapport\" between the US-India on space technology collaboration.  Dr. Nair was joined by three other ISRO officials: Dr. Jacob Ninan, Director of International Cooperation. Dr. PS Goyal, Director of the ISRO Satellite Centre, and Dr. S. Sundararamaiah, Scientific Secretary. End Summary.  2.  (C) The Ambassador, describing the NSSP as a \"phased process,\" assured Dr. Nair that he realized that while those at the policy levels of both governments want to move forward together, there is \"tension and irritation\" at the working levels.  The Ambassador committed to \"understand and fix\" irritants that threaten to stall NSSP implementation.  Dr. Nair said NSSP was \"a good move\" but said progress since the agreement was signed was \"not at the same speed\" as expected.  The Ambassador asked Dr. Nair about ISRO's current top priorities and where we could help.  The ISRO Wish List ------------------  3.  (SBU) First, Dr. Goyal complained that since the Bangalore Space Conference 8 months ago when Boeing announced the deal, the company has been unable or unwilling to provide a 1-week briefing required to move to the next stage of company-to-company cooperation.  He asked the Ambassador to help on the issue by raising it with either the USG, which he said Boeing blamed for the delay, or Boeing directly.  4.  (U) Second, Dr. Nair noted the absence of an umbrella agreement between ISRO and NASA to focus on both \"national legislation issues and international committments,\" and suggested a working group to tackle obstacles to better coordination.  Dr. Nair remarked that such umbrella agreements already exist between India and Russia and have been very useful to navigate each others' bureaucracies efficiently.  5.  (U) Third, according to Dr. Nair the window for the USG to put a payload on the Chandrayaan lunar mission was closing quickly.  Dr. Goyal confirmed that the scheduled launch date was end of 2007, and that any payload -- whether the Mini SAS or MQ -- would take two years to integrate into the program. Calling them \"thrust areas\", Dr. Nair lamented that time may run out before the governments could seize this significant opportunity to collaborate in the spirit of NSSP.  Dr. Nair also pitched the USG to use ISRO as a launch provider, and also to begin exploring joint ventures, promising \"cost-effective payloads\" if the USG would coordinate with India.  6.  (U) Fourth,  the ISRO Chairman expressed frustration at having to deal with several USG agencies to get the required licenses for certain equipment, and asked if it were possible for one agency to handle it.  The Ambassador said this was unlikely to change, but he would convey the sentiment.  7.  (U) Finally, Dr. Nair raised the issue of the difficulty in getting visas on short notice for ISRO officials. \"Science, like business, cools down fast if not attended to,\" he remarked and appreciated any fast track method for getting his scientists appointments and visa clearances as fast as possible.  8.  (C) When asked about ISRO's role in the tsunami aftermath, Dr. Nair agreed his organization had played an important role by providing damage assessments within 1-2 days of India's coast, Sri Lanka and other affected neighbors.  ISRO also provided emergency communications with Andaman and Nicobar which no other agency could provide, and also facilitated remote medical consultations to the affected areas.  9.  (C) Comment:  While ISRO Chairman Nair remains upbeat, the climate at ISRO towards NSSP is cooling due to their perception of unmet NSSP expectations and continuing obstacles to space technology cooperation.  We remind the Indians that NSSP is a phased process, but we will have to reach out and work hard to resolve the current irritants listed here to get ISRO back on the NSSP bandwagon. End Comment.

MEA Director of Disarmament and International Security Affairs Venu Rajamony complained to PolCouns on February 9 that neither Pakistan nor the U.S. have been \"at all transparent\" about the status of the A.Q. Khan investigation.  In response to PolCouns' query about India's approach to the North Korean nuclear proliferation issue at the upcoming IAEA Board of Governors meeting, Rajamony underlined the GOI's firm line on the issue.  He also reminded us of India's position that it is necessary for the international community to focus more on the supply side of nuclear proliferation.  He reiterated New Delhi's frustration over the A.Q. Khan issue, highlighting that, as far as the GOI is concerned, all nuclear proliferation roads lead back to him. MULFORD " }

Mulford, Reasons 1.5 b,d  1.  (C) Summary: In a February 11 meeting with the Ambassador, Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said that India's national security compelled it to look towards Iran for natural gas.  He pointed out that India is competing in Iran with many others, including some of the United States' close friends and allies.  By seeking oil and gas relationships with Iran, India is merely ensuring it would be well-positioned when the \"Iran problem\" is resolved, he added.  He also asserted that Indian investment in the Iranian oil and gas sector is some distance in the future, and perhaps the Iran will not be of as much concern by then.  Aiyar contended that a major \"strategic\" hurdle had been crossed with the Indian cabinet's decision on February 10 to authorize him to pursue energy deals with Iran and Pakistan.  Aiyar said he anticipates the negotiations to be neither quick nor easy.  He said he is fully supportive of the Economic Dialogue and would welcome results-oriented exchanges on energy issues.  Aiyar was very optimistic about India's hydrocarbon potential.  He was pleased with the response he received from American companies during his recent Houston visit.  Aiyar believes that entry of a major American company into India's upstream oil and gas sector will provide international credibility for India's hydrocarbon potential.  In contrast to his often provocative and sometimes anti-American pronouncements and writings, Aiyar was thoughtful, reasonable and insightful.  The Ambassador urges Energy Secretary Bodman to consider an early visit to India.  Such a visit would help support our transformed bilateral relationship with India.  It is also important we engage at high levels with a country that is likely to  play an important role in the global oil and gas markets in the future.  End Summary.  India-Iran Cooperation ----------------------  2.  (C) In a February 11 meeting with Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, the Ambassador raised USG concerns about Indian investments in the development of Iran's petroleum resources given Iran's nuclear activities and it support for terrorism.  The Ambassador said he recognized India's growing energy needs but was obliged to alert India to our concerns, which are based on US policy and US law.  3.  (C) Aiyar responded that India's energy security and, by extension, its national security compelled it to look towards Iran for gas.  He described briefly the explosive growth in India gas demand.  Current Indian production of 90 million cubic meters per day (mcmd) is about ten times higher than in the 1980s.  Yet, it falls far short of demand, which is estimated at 150 mcmd and projected to increase to 400 mcmd in 20 years.  Given this shortfall and the absence of adequate alternative sources, according to Aiyar, India is forced to turn to Iran, the country with the second biggest gas reserves in the world.  New discoveries in India and new sources of gas -- Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, Turkmenistan -- may reduce Indian reliance on Iranian gas, but he sees no alternative to trying to source as much gas from Iran as possible.  4.  (C) Secondly, Aiyar continued, India is only competing for oil and gas relationships in Iran with many others -- Japan, European countries, China -- some of whom are the United States' close friends and allies.  (Note: Aiyar clearly implied that the United States should first ask its friends to back out of the Iran oil and gas sector before pressing India to do so. End Note.)  Thirdly, according to Aiyar, India did not want to be in the position it found itself in with Libya.  It had refrained from seeking hydrocarbon relationships in Libya due to United States sanctions.  When sanctions were lifted, American companies quickly moved in, leaving India out in the cold, he said. The effect of United States policy to discourage other countries from Libya was to preserve the Libyan oil and gas sector for American oil and gas interests, he observed.  By seeking oil and gas relationships with Iran, India was merely ensuring it would be well positioned when the \"Iran problem\" is resolved, Aiyar explained.  5.  (C) Lastly, Aiyar asserted, Indian investment in the Iranian oil and gas sector is some distance in the future, and perhaps Iran will not be of as much concern by then. Showing a clear preference for a multilateral solution, he noted that India was working with the United States within the IAEA to address international concerns about Iran's nuclear activities.  He claimed that India has made clear that Iran must adhere to its treaty obligations.  Aiyar closed the discussion on Iran by saying that India will keep an eye on evolving international efforts to resolve concerns about Iran, but he does not see India stepping back from relationships in the Iranian oil and gas sector at this time.   Iran-Pakistan-India Pipeline ----------------------------  6.  (C) Aiyar contended that a major \"strategic\" hurdle had been crossed with the Indian cabinet's decision to authorize him to pursue energy deals with Iran and Pakistan (as well as Burma and Bangladesh.)  He said this move will reassure the Pakistanis and Iranians who naturally wondered whether he had the backing of the Cabinet.  They will now recognize that \"I am not a wild card,\" he noted.  7.  (C) Aiyar will begin discussions with the Iranian Oil Minister the week of February 14 during the Asian Gas Buyers' conference in Delhi.  He fears that if India is not involved in any Iran pipeline discussions up-front, it will lose any influence on the pricing.  If the price differential between LNG and pipeline gas at the Indo-Pak border is narrow, then India will opt for LNG, he asserted.  Trying to dampen any expectations of an imminent agreement, Aiyar said he anticipates the negotiations to be neither quick nor easy as the Iranian are hard bargainers.  \"The process is only beginning,\" he noted, and will be long drawn out.  Economic Dialogue -----------------  8.  (SBU) The Ambassador described the Economic Dialogue (ED) framework, in which the 5 tracks are retained because they serve a useful purpose, but the leadership of the ED is elevated so that key issues can be lifted to the White House/Prime Minister's Office level.  A new CEO's forum will be added to advise policy makers on what needs to be done to remove structural impediments to greater trade and investment ties.  The Ambassador felt that energy companies should be included in this forum.  9.  (SBU) Aiyar responded that Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen had briefed him about the ED.  Aiyar said he is fully supportive of the ED.  Any restructuring of the ED is acceptable to him if it encourages greater energy-related ties between the two countries.  He would like results-oriented exchanges on energy issues.  His priority for such exchanges would be for American companies to study India's hydrocarbon potential and \"advise us on how best to utilize it.\"  He also wants an institutionalized and continuing, not sporadic, intellectual exchange between Indian and American companies and institutes.  Aiyar's Road Show -----------------  10.  (SBU) Aiyar, who was in Houston last month to promote interest in India's fifth round of exploration and production leasing, said he was witnessed an enthusiastic response from American companies.  The companies he met with were pleased with the policy framework and the incentives in the National Exploration Licensing Policy.  He did not know whether this interest will manifest itself in greater bidding for the leases, although he sensed a changing perception about India's potential in the eyes of American companies.  Aiyar believes that unless a major American company enters India's upstream oil and gas sector, there will be no international credibility for India's hydrocarbon potential, which is completely open to foreign investment.  11.  (SBU) Aiyar was particularly impressed with his visit to ExxonMobil's $2 billion research and development facility in Houston.  He lamented that Indian companies are not spending as much on R&D.  He pledged to strengthen institutional relationships with organizations such as the US Chamber's hydrocarbon committee, the Canadian Petroleum Institute, and the University of Alberta.  12.  (SBU) Aiyar referred to his meeting in Houston January 31 with DOE Director Robert Price and regretted he could not meet with Energy Secretary Bodman as he had not yet been confirmed.  The Ambassador expressed his hope that the Energy Secretary, who has a great interest in India, could visit  SIPDIS this year.  Aiyar said he would warmly welcome such a visit. He asked whether it was appropriate now, with the Energy Secretary sworn in, to write or call to congratulate him.  SIPDIS The Ambassador encouraged Aiyar to do so.  Bay of Bengal: South Asia's North Sea? --------------------------------------  13.  (SBU) Aiyar spoke at length about India's hydrocarbon potential, noting that known oil and gas reserves in a belt from the Gulf to Indonesia suggest that the Bay of Bengal may have huge gas deposits.  The 2003 discovery by Reliance in the Krishna-Godavari basis and subsequent discoveries by Cairns and ONGC further strengthen the case.  Aiyar said he wants to change the perception of the international community and Indians of India as a hydrocarbon-poor country.  14.  (SBU) The problem, according to Aiyar, is South Asia's geology.  Over 95 percent of India's potential deposits are in soil formations that are only 60 million years old while most of the world's oil and gas deposits are in formations that are 300 million years old.  Secondly, Indian deposits are covered by a vast volcanic layer.  Both these peculiarities pose challenges for exploration in India. Aiyar wants to encourage scientific discussion with American companies and institutions to help India better address these challenges.  15.  (SBU) Aiyar said he has come up with two additional ideas for expanded US-India ties in the energy sector.  He expects much of India's oil and gas reserves will be found in deep water.  The United States, with its experience in deep sea exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, has great potential for providing technology transfer to India. Second, Aiyar noted a decline in oil and gas production in Texas, with West Texas Intermediate output down 60 percent in the last 10 years.  According to him, the exploration, drilling and production assets that are being made idle could be redeployed, in part, to India.  Comment -------  16.  (C) In contrast to his often provocative and sometimes anti-American pronouncements and writings, Aiyar was thoughtful, reasonable and insightful.  He stood his ground firmly on Iran, but did not use the opportunity to vent against our approach, something he may have been quick to do in earlier incarnations.  We were impressed with his candor and his forthrightness.  He took pains to wave his welcome to American energy companies.  He was also eager to open a dialogue and relationship with the Department of Energy, building on his well received interactions with DOE and U.S. industry in Houston last month.  17.  (C) The Ambassador urges Energy Secretary Bodman to consider an early visit to India.  Besides being one of the world's fastest growing economies, India is also one of the fastest growing oil and gas consumers and importers.  It is important we engage at high levels with a country that may play an important role in global energy markets in the future.  A visit by Secretary Bodman would also help  support our transformed bilateral relationship with India.  Such a visit would establish relationships that may allow us to exert some influence on Indian oil and gas activities in countries such as Iran.  Finally, a visit by the Energy Secretary would help convey momentum and focus to an active  SIPDIS but sometimes drifting set of cooperative activities under the Energy track of the bilateral Economic Dialogue.

Blake, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (U) This is an action request.  See para 5.  2.  (C) Sharing perspectives on Nepal developments with Polcouns and Poloffs on February 15, International Crisis Group (ICG) analyst Suman Pradhan (protect) reported on the growing number of Nepalese politicians who have converged in New Delhi in recent days, and their attempts to engage the Indian government and political class to restore democracy in their country.  While many important political leaders remained under house arrest in Kathmandu, second rung leaders are working Indian contacts intensively, and intend to expand their reach in the weeks ahead.  Pradhan, who has also relocated from Kathmandu for the time being, reported that these exile politicians have already seen Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, old friends like ex-PM Chandrashekar, NDA Convenor George Fernandes, and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, and plan press conferences, seminars and other public meetings to advance their cause.  They have deliberately not sought to engage with the BJP.  Prabhan asserted there is support for the King in India among Hindu nationalist groups, royal families connected by marriage to the Palace, business interests, and in parts of the Army disappointed with the parties' handling of the Maoist insurgency.  3.  (C) Arguing that New Delhi has the potential to become a major center of Nepalese democratic political activity outside Nepal, Pradhan cited a February 14 meeting of six Nepalese political parties in New Delhi that pressed the GOI to cut off all military assistance to the King (the GOI has already done this).  This group included Pradeep Giri (Congress-D), KC Chitra Bahadur (NCP-MASAL), Rajinder Mahoto (NSP-A), Sekhar Koirala (Nepali Congress), Govind Koirala (NCP-UML), and Chandra Dev Joshi (NCP-United).  4.  (C) Pradhan indicated that Nepalese politicians also intend to reach out to a broad array of influential non-Indian individuals and organizations in New Delhi as part of their campaign to increase pressure on the King, and may seek an appointment with the Ambassador as well.  5.  (C) Action Request: The GOI is of course already a major player in Nepal, but if New Delhi does in fact increasingly become a center of expatriate Nepalese democratic activity, Embassy will want to increase its contacts with Nepalese leaders here.  We would be inclined for now to keep these contacts at the working level, not engaging at the Ambassador's level.  As we look ahead, Post would appreciate guidance on dealing with such an eventuality. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr.  Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: GOI Special Envoy for West Asia and the Middle East Peace Process Chinmaya Gharekhan told the DCM on February 15 that India would like to provide and fund security training for the Palestinian Authority, in response to what he said were statements by the Secretary welcoming such offers.  Gharekhan, who is planning a \"familiarization trip\" to the region from February 19, emphasized India's desire to work in coordination with the US and expressed interest in attending a UK-sponsored conference in March on the peace process.  On Iraq, the DCM urged the GOI to reconsider its ban on Indian travel there, noting that India may lose a valuable opportunity by delaying.  Gharekhan responded that New Delhi will do so, but only after assessing that the security situation has improved, in consideration of the high political stakes involved in any violence against Indians there.  The Envoy, an experienced UN veteran and former Indian Permanent Representative, suggested that it would be useful for the US to work to have the new Iraqi government recognized by the UN as soon as possible.  End Summary.  \"We are Happy to Help\" ----------------------  2.  (C) While acknowledging that the US has the lead on the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, Gharekhan told the DCM he thought India could play a role.  Upbeat about recent developments, the Envoy said \"we can offer any kind of security training, counter insurgency, border security, crowd control, even for an eventual army.\"  Gharekhan highlighted the need to work with the US to avoid redundancy or contradiction and asked that the USG keep India in mind in that regard.  Gharekhan added that he does not have a \"blank check,\" but India will provide the training after the GOI has a better sense  of what the Palestinians' needs are.  3.  (C) During his first trip to the region as Indian Special Envoy, which will begin on February 19 and take him first to Jordan and Egypt, and then to Tel Aviv and Ramallah, Gharekhan will also inform Israel of New Delhi's offer. Confident that Tel Aviv would support the Indian initiative, he added that he plans to meet PM Abbas hopes to see Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, as well.  4.  (C) Further emphasizing India's strong interest in a role in the Middle East, Gharekhan mentioned a March conference in London on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that PM Tony Blair is associated with, and asked for US support in securing an invitation for India.  He added that FM Natwar Singh will make the same request during Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's visit to New Delhi February 17-18.  Mission would welcome Washington Guidance on whether it would be possible for India to attend.  Mission flagged for our UK counterparts that the FM will be making this request.  Travel Ban Stands -----------------  5.  (C) Emphasizing US and Indian common interests in the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq, the DCM welcomed the Envoy's support for peace efforts in the region, and asked if the GOI had any new ideas on Iraq.  Gharekhan said that he will not visit Iraq during this trip, as he was waiting for the new government to settle in.  The DCM urged the GOI to reconsider its ban on Indian travel to Iraq, noting that by delaying India may lose valuable opportunities to get in on the ground floor as the Iraq transformation proceeds.  Gharekhan acknowledged that \"India cannot afford to stay out,\" but recalling the three Indian truck drivers kidnapped there during summer 2004, he asserted that the possibility of another such crisis is a considerable political obstacle to lifting the ban.  Despite this, he commented that all political parties in India recognize the need for their country to be involved in Iraq, \"even the Left.\"  \"Take Iraq to the UN\" ---------------------  6.  (C) Gharekhan suggested that the US work to have the new Iraqi government recognized by the UN as soon as possible. Based on his many years' experience in that organization (reftel), there would be broad support for such a move, perhaps in a special session, he observed.  Job Description ---------------  7.  (C) Gharekhan explained that he would define his mandate as he went along, but that his broad areas of focus would be the Middle East Peace Process, along with Iraq.  The Envoy, who does not yet have a space in the MEA, remarked that he does not need an office there, but will eventually have a staff.  His area of responsibility includes two MEA bureaus: West Asia and North Africa (WANA) and the Gulf Division.  He has told us he does not expect to have any involvement on India's Iran policy.  Bio Note --------  8.  (C) A friend of FM Natwar Singh, Gharekhan is a career diplomat who has served as India's Permanent Representative to the UN in New York (1986-1992) and Geneva (1977-1980).  He was MEA Joint Secretary for the Pakistan and UN divisions (1980-1983), and an Additional Secretary in Rajiv Gandhi's PMO from 1984 to 1986.  After his retirement in 1992, Gharekhan was appointed the UN Secretary General's Personal Representative to the Security Council, and later as Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories from October 1996 to September 1999.  In October 2004, Natwar made Gharekhan part of his six-member Policy Advisory Group.  After retirement, he also lived for an extended period in Sharon, Connecticut, where his daughter was a doctor.  Since returning to Delhi, he has been a regular on the retired Ambassador's circuit, and has been open and accessible to the Embassy. MULFORD " }

PolCouns encouraged New Delhi's participation, noting that the USG is offering this initiative as a gesture of transparency and in the interest of greater regional stability.  Rajamony cautioned, however, that the GOI would want to keep a low profile on these missile defense issues in the ARF and would be unlikely to make any sort of presentation at an ARF seminar.  2.

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: As a concrete demonstration of India's magnanimity and competence, New Delhi's recent large-scale assistance to its tsunami-stricken neighbors had illustrated the country's standing as a regional and emerging world power, according to observers here.  India is particularly proud of its efforts in Sri Lanka, which it views as a sign of the strong bilateral relationship that Prime Minister Singh will play up during his planned March visit to Sri Lanka.  One MEA contact described the GOI goal as \"an EU kind of relationship\" with Sri Lanka.  From the Indian perspective, the tsunami has proved an overwhelming diplomatic success -- within South Asia, outside the region, and bilaterally with the US.  End Summary.  Tsunami Public Diplomacy  SIPDIS ------------------------  2.  (C) Without a hint of bashfulness, six weeks after the disaster, the MEA published a polished, glossy review of India's relief efforts at home and abroad titled \"Bridging the Ocean: India Leads Relief Measures in Tsunami-hit Areas.\"  In a country-by-country overview of India's external aid, punctuated with photographs of Indian military personnel and hardware delivering assistance, the MEA explained that because of \"a natural sense of affinity and...confidence in its capabilities,\" India was the first country to come to Sri Lanka's aid.  The booklet, clearly intended for foreign audiences (one well-informed MEA interlocutor did not even know it existed), concluded that India's \"management\" of the tsunami has led to \"a changed perception of the country in  SIPDIS the eyes of the international community.\"  \"Elephant Underground\" ----------------------  3.  (C) South Asia expert Professor SD Muni commented to Poloff recently that India's aid for Sri Lanka further strengthens that relationship, as it was part of \"a trend that was building all along.\"  Muni did not attach much significance to the fact that India's relief in Sri Lanka was the country's first large-scale military deployment there since the unsuccessful 1989 Indian Peace Keeping Force action.  The Indian armed forces were the logical choice because of their capabilities to accomplish such a mission, he countered, adding that in 2003 the Indian military also provided flood relief to its island neighbor.  Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies researcher N. Manoharan offered a similar assessment, remarking that the military response was a \"natural\" one.  4.  (C) Manoharan observed that although there was an \"inherent power projection\" in India's relief effort in Sri Lanka, Colombo was very appreciative.  On the long term prognosis for India-Sri Lanka relations, he predicted that there will always be a view in Sri Lanka that India is the \"elephant\" in the neighborhood, and while that feeling is \"underground\" now, it may return.  Following the tsunami, the sense in Sri Lanka was overwhelmingly positive, he concluded.  In Step With Colombo --------------------  5.  (C) As evidence of the positive momentum between New Delhi and Colombo, MEA Joint Secretary (SAARC) V. Ashok highlighted to PolCouns and Poloff on February 16 the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that he expects the Prime Minister will sign during his March trip to Sri Lanka.  The CEPA, he explained, builds on the existing free trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries.  It will include a reduction in the outstanding negative lists on both sides, the addition of trade in services, and harmonized standards and customs procedures.  Describing this as phase two of the India-Sri Lankan partnership (with phase one having been the FTA) Ashok animatedly mapped out next stages after the CEPA, which would include national treatment for each other's investors, and the movement of professionals between the two countries, as well as the integration of electric and transportation grids.  Describing the end point as \"an EU kind of relationship,\" Ashok praised Colombo's ability to consider economic development on a separate plane from the GOSL's political difficulties.  Tiger Watching --------------  6.  (C) While MEA Director (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) TS Sandhu, in a January 7 conversation with PolCouns, had hoped for cooperation between the GOSL and LTTE in countering the tsunami, a month later he expressed concern that Sri Lankan  SIPDIS President Kumaratunga may miss an opportunity to engage with the Tigers.  Although he thought the February 7 attack on LTTE political leader E. Kausalyan did not bode well, Sandhu ventured that both the Tigers and government may be too exhausted to fight, possibly creating an opening for talks. Prominent foreign affairs commentator Maj. Gen. (retd) Ashok Mehta echoed Sandhu's dimming optimism on the tsunami-prompted prospects for peace in Sri Lanka.  On  SIPDIS February 10, he told Poloff that Kausalyan's death supported his belief that the common tragedy would not bring the GOSL and LTTE closer together.  Gloomier still, the IPCS' Manoharan predicted that amidst claims of ethnic discrimination from Sri Lankan Tamils whom aid was not reaching, the tsunami had resulted in further division, rather than been an opportunity.  Regional Power --------------  7.  (C) Local strategists have also looked to capitalize on the perception that India \"stood its ground\" with the US, and asserted its own primacy in South Asia.  In its tsunami relief publication, the MEA took care to point out that the Indian Navy arrived within hours of the disaster \"at least a week before the US Marines reached there.\"  Professor Muni argued to Poloff that despite the MEA's reassurances that the US and India coordinated successfully in Sri Lanka \"eyebrows were raised\" at the US' involvement in what the GOI considers \"its soft belly.\"  Muni paternalistically asserted that the GOI's position that New Delhi did not need foreign tsunami assistance, but would request it if that assessment changed, applied to Sri Lanka as well.  8.  (C) Despite these barbs from some in the strategic community, the MEA, publicly stressed its close coordination with the US, highlighting New Delhi's selection for the Core Group as evidence of the country's equivalence with Japan and Australia: \"recognizing the key role that India can play in the region, it was invited to be a part of the Tsunami Core Group put together by the United States.\"  One senior MEA official complained to us in this context that academics like Muni will never believe the new reality of Indo-US partnership.  Likewise, in a February 15 meeting with USAID Assistant Administrator Douglas Menarchik, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar made the point that the  SIPDIS \"real test of US-India partnership will be our ability to coordinate in third countries.\"  Comment -------  9.  (C) From the Indian perspective, the tsunami has been both a terrible tragedy and a diplomatic success -- within South Asia, outside the region, and bilaterally with the US. The Indians proved themselves to be effective at managing their relief efforts abroad, as well as their coordination with foreign governments.  At the working level, MEA officials were cooperative and surprisingly forthcoming with information.  New Delhi's strong performance during the disaster is the kind of evidence India has been looking for to support its claim that it is an international power and a benevolent neighbor.  This role is particularly welcomed here with reference to Sri Lanka -- a country that India views as a model neighbor, with trade and other ties accelerating rapidly.  In this context, the Indian Navy's exemplary performance in Sri Lanka is evidence that the ghosts of India's unsuccessful 1989 military intervention have now been laid to rest. MULFORD " }

Summary:  In a February 10 meeting sponsored by the US- India Business Council (USIBC) and the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), senior Indian and US defense company representatives suggested that to expand the bilateral defense market, the USG should reform its export licensing process, showcase how NSSP and other progress make the US a more reliable supplier, and consider more co- production with Indian manufacturers. End Summary.  2.  On the margins of the 2005 AERO India trade show hosted by the GOI, the Ambassador represented the USG at the first meeting of the US-India High-Technology Group (HTCG) sub- group on \"Indo-US Industry Cooperation in Defense Production.\" He joined a panel comprised of former U/S Thomas Pickering (representing Boeing and co-chair of the USIBC Defense Services Mission), retired Lt. Gen SS Mehta (representing CII), and Maj. Gen HS Sehgal (Technical Manager, Land Systems, Ministry of Defence).  US Export Control Attache Michael Rufe (USDOC) also attended. The audience of about 50 was equally divided between USIBC delegates from US defense manufacturers and GOI defense sector entities invited by CII.  3.  The goal of the event was to identify possible specific priority programs for US-India defense production. In his opening remarks, the Ambassador invited the Indian government to \"test us\" to prove the USG is a reliable supplier as well as a strategic partner.  He cited changes in the US-India relationship such as the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) and the powerful and growing India lobby in Washington as proof of a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.   Maj. Gen Sehgal gave an overview of the MoD's procurement procedure.  4. Members of the audience raised the following points:   - US export licensing requirements disadvantage US industry at each stage of defense sales transactions: talk, negotiate, sell and transfer. Could there be a \"duration of program\" license for 15+ years that might cover contacts sufficiently to put GOI concerns at ease?  Could existing contracts be protected by higher thresholds required to sanction them under US law?  (Note:  Ambassador Pickering noted such an export license would not be useful since Congress can always change laws and policy. End note.)   - Could any Indian end-users be pre-cleared so that only the technology and the use need verification?  In any case, can the export license process be expedited?   - The USG has to thoroughly explain how industry will be affected by changes made under the NSSP.  Suggestions for doing this included releasing a profile of how many dual-use BIS and munitions list DTC licenses have been granted since NSSP was launched, what areas NSSP has facilitated or removed export licensing requirements for, the processing times for licenses, and a breakdown of licenses granted by industry.   - Could the Glenn Amendment be repealed?   - Could a DTC specialist be placed at Embassy New Delhi, or at least come on TDY to brief the Indians on export licenses for defense sales?   - Indian industry asked for more co-production, and joint research and development, as a way to make US tenders more attractive to the GOI.   - Lt. Gen Mehta asked if co-production of anti-terrorism equipment could be a starting point for broader US-India cooperation and increasing high-tech trade.  5. Comment:  While few specific projects were identified for US-India defense cooperation, both US and Indian industry were upbeat about the future of their commercial relationship. Many questions could not be substantively addressed because there was no DTC or DoD representation at this event.  The mission strongly recommends expanding USDOC export licensing seminars in India to include State(PM) and Defense representatives in order to respond to queries that inevitably cross USG agency authorities.

Mulford.  Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The February 16 agreement by India and Pakistan to begin bus service across the LOC between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad beginning on April 7 is the most important Kashmir-specific CBM since the November 2003 LOC ceasefire agreement, and will have important political ramifications in J&K and in the Indo-Pak relationship more broadly.  Initial reactions in the Valley have been largely positive, although there is a reservoir of skepticism that the LOC, which has been closed for some 50 years, will actually open, and about who will benefit.  As viewed from New Delhi, the deal represents a major climbdown by the GOI for which PM Manmohan Singh should get most of the credit, although New Delhi's concessions also open the door to criticism from the opposition BJP that the GOI has caved to Pakistan.  Septel will assess other aspects of the Islamabad agreements addressing the broader Indo-Pak relationship.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Initial reactions in the Valley to the February 16 agreement have been largely positive, although there remains a significant reservoir of skepticism among cynical Kashmiris that it will actually come about and benefit them.  A number of journalists in Srinagar have told us that those Kashmiris who have electricity (power remains a major problem during this harsh winter) have been glued to their TVs, and that word is spreading fast among those who do not.  PDP Chief Minister Mufti Mohammmad Sayeed and his daughter PDP President Mehbooba Sayeed held separate press conferences late in the day, both hailing the agreement as \"a milestone in Kashmir's history.\"  Reached in New Delhi, Mehbooba was jubilant, predicting that the bus would have a \"tremendous impact on the situation\" and going so far as to call it \"the light at the end of the tunnel.\"  3.  (C) Separatist opinion is predictably divided, with the moderate All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) more positive than the pro-independence JKLF and hardline APHC led by SAS Geelani.  Reached in Srinagar, moderate separatist Prof AG Bhat called it \"a very big breakthrough.\"  Observing that it would \"make the people happy,\" he hoped the bus would lead to more intra-Kashmir trade.  APHC moderate Bilal Lone also hailed the decision, but called for \"more improvements on the ground.\"  Reached in New Delhi, the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq welcomed it, but drew attention to the need for the GOI to provide \"relief to the common man.\"  Moderate Jamaat-i-Islami leader GM Bhat also termed it a \"breakthrough,\" and predicted that this small step would leave to bigger steps.  4.  (C) JKLF leader Ghulam Rasool Dhar, reached while Chairman Yaseen Malik was travelling, was non-committal, raising concerns about procedures potential travelers would have to undergo to obtain travel documents and commenting that if clearance is required from J&K officials, travel would be \"much more difficult for people like us\" (i.e. pro-independence or separatist-oriented Kashmiris). According to one journalist in Srinagar, SAS Geelani has already diminished the achievement, predictably calling for the implementation of age-old UN Resolutions on Kashmir.  Comment -------  5.  (C) The major beneficiaries of this agreement -- the most significant Kashmir-related CBM since the November 2003 LOC ceasefire -- will be the Kashmiris themselves.  However, New Delhi and Manmohan Singh deserve most of the credit for making the concessions necessary to reach this deal with Islamabad.  In the Valley, the PDP stands to be the big winner politically, because of its very visible campaign to make the LOC into a soft border, to the point where billboards the party erected during 2003 noting the distance to Muzaffarabad in kilometers had become an object of scorn.   6.  (C) With news still fresh, modalities unclear, and many memories of false starts in Indo-Pak relations, Kashmiris remain predictably cautious in their reactions, and they will presumably wait to see how the agreement is implemented before reacting as optimistically as have Mehbooba and other PDP politicians.  Demographically and geographically, the largest group of potential beneficiaries are located closer to the LOC in Doda, Rajouri, Poonch districts, while there are fewer potential takers in Srinagar, where family and other personal ties across the LOC are less strong. Nevertheless, if the first bus departs for Muzaffarabad on April 7, the symbolism of the LOC opening could have further implications for Indo-Pak relations in ways we cannot yet foresee. MULFORD " }

(SBU) Summary:  In a trilateral meeting with USG and IAEA officials on February 9, the GOI agreed to join the Regional Radiological Security Partnership (RRSP); identified a lead technical contact within the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE); offered to serve as a venue for radiological security training and to continue its cooperation with the IAEA on radiological safety training; proposed to participate in specific missions to address orphaned radiological sources; and suggested that the IAEA host a working-level meeting with the GOI and DOE in April to develop a plan for these and other related activities.  This initiative was useful in reminding India's scientific establishment that there are significant areas of US-India collaboration on nuclear matters, even within the constraints established by US law and policy.  End Summary.  GOI Ready for Radiological Partnership --------------------------------------  2.  (U) In her opening remarks in the trilateral USG-GOI-IAEA meeting on February 9, MEA Additional Secretary (International Security) Meera Shankar outlined examples of India's expertise and willingness to work internationally to recover radiological material (e.g., in the Republic of Georgia), as well as to provide training in radiological security and safety in partnership with the IAEA and other parties such as the US.  While supporting bilateral initiatives like DOE's Global Threat Reduction Initiative, throughout the meeting, Shankar and other GOI representatives reiterated that their work on this issue has been, and will continue to be, under the aegis of the IAEA.  3.  (U) Director of the Office of Global Radiological Threat Reduction Ed McGinnis affirmed DOE,s desire to partner with India and the IAEA in the area of radiological security. \"India is well-positioned to be a regional leader in radiological security, especially in assisting countries that don't have India's capabilities,\" he said.  Misuse of high-risk radioactive sources, while not resulting in mass deaths, would have significant economic, health and strategic consequences.  McGinnis went on to outline the mission of the RRSP, multilateral partnerships with IAEA and Interpol, and programs to identify, secure, recover, and in some cases, replace, high-risk radioactive sources.  McGinnis also highlighted the important benefit to radiological safety that would result from this initiative.  4.  (U) Anita Nilsson of the IAEA reviewed the agency's two-track approach to radiological security which is to support infrastructure development and security enhancements to states upon request.  IAEA also offers training and assistance to establish an effective regulatory framework to ensure sustainability.  These activities are funded by voluntary contributions through member states, including in-kind contributions such as India's joint training programs.  5.  (U) Dr. K. Raghuraman of the Department of Atomic Energy and Dr. SP Aggarwal of India's  Atomic Energy Regulatory Board presented the GOI perspective on radiological security which is comprised of four parts:  1) legislative and regulatory framework for all nuclear and radiological activities; 2) an integrated system for physical protection of nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities; 3) a comprehensive nuclear material accounting and control system; and 4) a national registry of all radioactive material.  6.  (U) Focusing on GOI interest and experience in conducting international training, Nilsson expressed the need to ensure that training is both holistic and contributes to sustainability.  Because of the many everyday uses of radioactive materials, securing high-risk sources requires raising security awareness among states, national and local authorities, and law enforcement, among others, and will require a widespread, holistic approach to be effective. Further, training should be linked to established educational institutions, e.g., universities, to be sustainable.  7.  (U) India is most interested in providing training in the areas of security and safety, physical protection of facilities, and regulatory measures, according to Shankar. She also asked about the location of IAEA,s current radiological safety regional training centers.  (According to the IAEA,s Khammar Mrabit, the IAEA currently has centers in six countries:  Argentina, Malaysia, Belarus, Greece, Morocco, and Syria.)  Clearly interested in raising India's international profile in this area, Dr. Raghuraman noted, \"We've already been acting in a regional role for training.\" He added that India is willing to tailor its courses for specific operations, as they did in support of the recovery of high-powered, orphaned sources in the Republic of Georgia.  8.  (U) Beyond training, Shankar said the GOI was interested in offering its expertise in the areas of information management, education, and recovery operations, but the GOI would require further discussion about resource availability before committing to operations in these areas.  Next Steps ----------  9.  (U) The trilateral group agreed to meet at the invitation of the IAEA in Vienna after the IAEA Preparatory Committee meeting on the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in April. This trilateral group will develop a work program for GOI participation in the RRSP.  The three parties also designated technical points of contact: Nilsson as the interim POC for the IAEA, Dr. Raghuraman for the GOI, and Dwyer for the USG.  The GOI also issued a press statement on the meeting (text in para 11).  Bio Note:  Dr. Raghuraman -------------------------  10.  (SBU) Dr. Raghuraman is favorably known to DOE, IAEA, and the Mission.  Head of the International Studies Division in the Department of Atomic Energy's Strategic Planning Group, Dr. Raghuraman is a technical scientist filling a position in DAE normally reserved for an MEA foreign service officer.  Raghuraman told SciCouns that MEA made an exception for his appointment because of his extensive experience in international affairs while serving as a Science Attache at the Indian Mission to the IAEA in Vienna.  He is among those we are encouraging to take a more proactive view of the NSSP in the context of moving our nuclear relationship forward. In this regard, this initiative was useful in reminding India's scientific establishment that there are significant areas of US-India collaboration on nuclear matters, even within the constraints established by US law and policy.  GOI Press Statement -------------------  11. (U) Begin text:  A joint delegation of representatives from the US Department of Energy and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited India on 9 February 2005 for the first India-US-IAEA trilateral meeting on the Regional Radiological Security Partnership (RRSP) program.  The US and IAEA representatives welcomed India's participation in the RRSP program as a Regional Partner and discussions were held to work out the modalities of this cooperation.  The three sides acknowledged their shared objective of enhancing globally the security of dangerous radioactive sources.  The US and the IAEA delegates expressed appreciation for India's offer of providing infrastructure and expertise on a regular basis for conducting international training courses in India under the aegis of the IAEA on issues related to the security of radiological sources and materials as also for locating orphan radioactive sources in countries which are unable to effectively deal with them and which seek assistance from the IAEA.  The three sides agreed to continue further discussions on the subject.  Participants ------------  12.

(C) Summary:  NRC Commissioner Jeffrey S. Merrifield and Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran discussed India's energy future at a meeting in the Secretary's office in New Delhi on February 11, 2005.  Saran told Merrifield that energy is a key strategic interest of India and nuclear power would be an important part of the energy mix that would fuel India's development.  India would like more collaborations in the nuclear field, but a one-size-fits-all policy does not appear to accommodate realities on the ground.  Merrifield underscored the importance of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) peer review process to improve the safety and operation of nuclear power plants.  Merrifield promised he would articulate in Washington the quality and progress of nuclear power generation efforts in India and the role nuclear power is expected to play in the energy future of India.  End summary.  ----------------------------------------- Saran: Energy at the Top of Indian Agenda -----------------------------------------  2.  (C) Saran told Merrifield that he was in Washington in November and had very useful discussions with now Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice.  He discussed with Rice the need to look at India's energy situation and the necessity to take a comprehensive look at the U.S.-India nuclear relationship. India has had a similar dialogue with the European Union, the relation of India with the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and a call to greater openness to look at India's aspirations in the nuclear energy field.  3.  (C) Saran told Merrifield that the U.S and India need to move the nuclear agenda forward.  There is a long history of US-India cooperation on nuclear matters and now India has developed significant capabilities.  Saran said India is looking forward to economic growth of 8-10% per annum, which will place significant demands on the energy sector.  4.  (C) Saran said that given the fact that energy security is at the top of the agenda of the current government, India hopes to continue dialogue on energy related matters. Ambassador Mulford has met with Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, there is a new Secretary of Energy who is familiar with India, a sustainable development summit just took place in India, and the Prime Minister has said that he hoped to raise India's energy agenda to the Joint Summit. The PM has invited India, China and South Africa to join hands in looking at future energy needs.  5.  (C) Saran said China is now a major energy consumer and China and India, in a short period, will be putting significant pressure on world energy markets.  Thus, it is doubtful that the country will be able to sustain growth relying only on fossil fuels.  Nuclear power is a definite option for India but there are issues related to fuel supplies.  In this regard, India's task of sustaining economic growth will be simpler if it has cooperation from the U.S.  --------------------------------------------- -------- Saran: One-Size-Fits-All Policies are a Big Challenge --------------------------------------------- --------  6.  (C) Saran remarked that, in his view, there is insufficient appreciation in the U.S. on how far India has come.  India would like to encourage more interaction but has come against some barriers.  One of the challenges is dealing with a one-size-fits-all U.S. policy that does not appear to accommodate realities on the ground.  7.  (C) India has no record, Saran said, of being involved in any untoward behavior.  This is not because of U.S. pressures, but because such behavior is not in India's national interest.  India is developing new export controls and looking at export control methodologies as India could profit from U.S. experience in these matters.  India wants very badly to overcome obstacles that stand in the way of implementing the NSSP.  India would very much like Commissioner Merrifield to tell U.S. policymakers about what he saw in India and would value Commissioner Merrifield's advice on how to move forward.  --------------------------------------------- -------- Commissioner Merrifield: India is a Senior Partner in Nuclear Power Generation --------------------------------------------- --------  8.  (C) Merrifield told Saran that for this visit, NRC personnel split into two teams.  One team carried out detailed technical discussions in Mumbai, while the Commissioner and Deputy Director Doane traveled on to Rajasthan to visit the Rajasthan Atomic Power Station facilities.  9.  (C) Merrifield told Saran that the visit was very good and very positive and that he was delighted about participation of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in the WANO where Americans and others come together to benchmark safety practices and operations of nuclear power plants among peers.  10.  (C) Merrifield said that since becoming a Commissioner, he has learned that the worldwide nuclear industry is a very small fraternity.  In his view, direct interactions through WANO, for example, have resulted in significant improvements in the safety and operations of the nuclear power sector. Thus, putting nuclear power generation in the hands of an enterprise like NPCIL, which interacts with the nuclear power industry elsewhere, bodes well for the future of nuclear power in India.  11.  (C) In addition, the manner in which India is achieving milestones in bringing nuclear power plants on-line, on time, and within budget, provides great credibility to the Indian program.  Thus, NRC looks forward to enhanced, new levels of interactions.  12.  (C) The Commissioner told Saran that NRC and AERB want to identify AERB personnel who can come to NRC and work shoulder-to-shoulder on technical issues related to nuclear power plant safety.  NRC will also encourage the visit of AERB scientists to national labs.  NRC is aware of India's nuclear reactor design capabilities and India's wish to participate in design of a new generation of reactors.  He understands India's desire to engage in benchmarking NRC codes against AERB codes, a process from which NRC and AERB could benefit.  13.  (C) With regard to NSSP, NRC participates as a regulatory agency.  NRC is clearly pleased with the progress of an NRC-AERB dialogue and the mutual benefit that it brings to both agencies.  Merrifield told Saran that even within NSSP and within NSG guidelines, nuclear safety knows no boundaries.  Progress in the NRC-AERB relationship should remain focused on enhancing civilian nuclear reactor safety.  14.  (C) Now, as it relates to nuclear energy, India is a senior partner at the table, Merrifield said.  Unfortunately, many of those who make rules for U.S.-India interactions have little understanding of nuclear safety and what it takes to operate a nuclear power station in an efficient, cost-effective and yet safe, manner that protects the public as well as the environment from undesirable effects. Merrifield told Saran that a backward looking legislative framework needs to be brought up to date as this framework prescribed a nuclear relationship between the U.S. and India at the time when India did not have any significant nuclear capability.  15.  (C) Merrifield said that, speaking for his own agency, he views NSSP as an interactive process.  Thus, in order to move the NSSP inter-agency process forward it would be ideal to have some bilateral progress.  Merrifield told Saran that he would be meeting with DOE officials and that he would make sure that the new DOE Secretary is aware of India's energy concerns.  NRC, as a regulator, oversees various nuclear activities, including safeguarding of nuclear materials, so there are further items of mutual interest that NRC could share.  16.  (C) This being said, NRC is a unique agency where the Presidential appointees have an extraordinary level of independence.  As NRC must recoup 90 percent of its operating costs from the industry it regulates, it is always challenging for NRC to find funds to carry out bilateral cooperation.  Notwithstanding this challenge, the NRC is committed to collaboration with India, Merrifield told Saran.  17.  (C) Saran commented that he is very encouraged that India also will \"put its money where its mouth is\", that India is encouraged by the Commissioner's words, but still there are mental and psychological barriers to be broken.  -------------------- Meeting Participants --------------------  18.

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The Ambassador used the return to New Delhi of Ambassador Shiv Mukherjee as an opportunity to discuss with the GOI the current strategy on Nepal.  During the February 16 meeting, also attended by MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal/Bhutan) Ranjit Rae, Polcouns and Poloff, Mukherjee expressed hope that the King would respond to international pressure within the next two weeks by restoring a democratic government, but implied that New Delhi does not have a contingency plan if this does not occur.  Mukherjee and Rae stated that neither the Maoists nor the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) have the strength to defeat the other militarily, and that a political solution must be found.  They indicated a Maoist victory would be unacceptable and implied India will quickly adjust its arms embargo if the RNA begins to suffer substantial losses.  Mukherjee expressed support for the idea of a joint US/UK/India demarche when the three ambassadors return to Kathmandu, but cautioned this would require political-level approval.  He concluded that it is unlikely there will be any significant progress on the issue of the Bhutanese refugees during the current power struggle.  End Summary.  Return to Democracy -------------------  2.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador's query regarding the GOI strategy, Mukherjee indicated that the GOI hopes King Gyanendra will respond to international pressure in a short period of time, possibly within the next eight to ten days, and make moves towards restoring democracy in Nepal.  He predicted that the possibility of losing aid from donor countries and military assistance from India, and the increasing diplomatic pressure will force the King to change his policy.  However, when the Ambassador asked what would happen if the King does not restore democracy, Rae reiterated that he expected the King to do so, demonstrating that it is unlikely the GOI has developed a contingency plan if the current efforts fail.  Mukherjee stressed the importance of the King developing a road map for the return to democratic rule and that \"he must do it quickly.\"  He commented that the GOI is not demanding the King re-establish democracy in a given way (such as restoring the previous government), only that it happens. \"If he makes the right kind of gestures, it could be business as usual,\" Mukherjee stated.  Maoists -------  3.  (C) Neither the Maoist nor the RNA has the ability to defeat the other in combat, Mukherjee stated.  Rae commented that the Maoists do not have the firepower to take Kathmandu or any of the larger towns with a significant RNA presence, although their writ runs free in the countryside.  Mukherjee added that the Maoists can sustain the insurgency indefinitely and \"to avoid this the King must respond to our actions and come back to the (negotiations) table.\"  He expected that the RNA could maintain operations for about 3 to 4 months before supply problems would hamper their activities and allow the Maoists to make headway.  If the Maoist succeed in making early progress, Mukherjee commented, the GOI would have to rethink its strategy.  India's foremost objective, he added, is to prevent a Maoist victory.  Diplomatic Efforts ------------------  4.  (C) Mukherjee expressed support for a joint US/UK/India demarche to demonstrate to the King that the international community is committed to its demand for a return to democracy after the Chief's of Missions return to Kathmandu (Mukherjee plans to go back on February 20).  While calling this a \"very pragmatic step,\" he also noted that it would need to be blessed at political levels of the GOI.  He added that he was glad most of the interested countries had been firm and on-message, with the exception of Pakistan, China and Russia.  Mukherjee agreed with Polcouns that further Mil/Mil information sharing between the US and India regarding the ground situation in Nepal could be beneficial.  Bhutanese Refugees ------------------  5.  (C) Mukherjee noted that the political upheaval in Nepal has put the issue of the Bhutanese refugees on the back burner.  He added that nothing was happening before the King's action and it is very unlikely the Royal Government of Bhutan will be willing to resume the Joint Verification process during this time of uncertainty in Kathmandu.  When questioned about Maoist activity in the camps, he commented that the UNHCR has reported the Maoist are present in the area, but does not see it as a major danger.  Comment -------  6.  (C) This discussion was helpful insofar it confirmed GOI agreement regarding the imperative of preventing a Maoist victory, but worrisome in its exposure of the GOI's \"hope for the best\" diplomatic strategy.  Given what we understand is the low likelihood of the King yielding to US/UK/Indian pressure for a return to full democracy, we may wish to begin a serious dialogue with the Indian Government about fleshing out a fallback plan. One opportunity for doing this would be a visit to New Delhi by Ambassador Moriarty in connection with his return to post. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary:  In this February 11 meeting, NRC Commissioner Merrifield complimented Jaishankar about the accomplishments and maturity of the Indian nuclear power industry.  \"With regard to nuclear power,\" Merrifield said, \"India can no longer be treated as a junior partner.\" Merrifield also highlighted the importance NRC assigns to activities of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).  Jaishankar asked for forward thinkers in the U.S. to address the baggage and cobwebs that continue to burden the U.S.-Indian nuclear relationship and find common interests to bring back a natural relationship on nuclear issues.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- ----------- Accomplishments and Maturity of the Indian Nuclear Power Industry --------------------------------------------- -----------  2.  (C) Commissioner Merrifield expressed satisfaction about the progress of the nuclear safety cooperation program with India and told Jaishankar that NRC would welcome AERB members to come to work \"shoulder to shoulder\" with NRC personnel on nuclear power regulatory matters and that NRC would make efforts to place AERB technical personnel in U.S. institutions.  He expressed admiration for the facilities in Hall 7 at BARC as well as the maturity and accomplishments of the Indian nuclear power program.  (Comment: Hall 7 is a high-bay facility that can accommodate large experimental set-ups which are as tall as a multi-story building and require substantial amounts of electrical power and water cooling to simulate the conditions that nuclear fuel rods encounter during operation in a Pressurized Heavy Water nuclear reactor.  End comment.)  3.  (C) Merrifield highlighted that Indian participation in WANO has given the worldwide nuclear industry an opportunity to understand the strengths of India's nuclear power program.   4.  (C) With regard to nuclear power, Merrifield said, India can no longer be treated as a junior partner.  As a regulator who has seen over 200 nuclear power plants, he knows about the comparative strengths of worldwide nuclear power programs.  Upon returning to the U.S., Merrifield said he could articulate what he has seen in India.  5.  (C) Merrifield told Jaishankar that he intends to go back to promote the usefulness in making progress with NSSP. Merrifield said that NRC considers collaborations in benchmarking of safety codes important and that the ability to move in this area is somewhat wrapped up with dialogue and progress on export control.  Merrifield said that by returning to the U.S. better informed, he will be able to promote progress in NSSP so that U.S.-India collaborations in nuclear safety can move forward.  6.  (C) The Commissioner told Jaishankar that given NRC views on the value of WANO, NRC will encourage WANO to issue timely invitations and that NRC will endeavor to assist Indian visitors seeking to obtain visas to attend WANO events in the United States.  Through his interactions in India, Commissioner Merrifield said that he understands the visa issue much better and it is easier for NRC to facilitate the process when it has timely information it can act upon.  --------------------------------------------- --- A More Nuanced Approach to NSSP Would Be Helpful --------------------------------------------- ---  7.  (C) Jaishankar, expressing gratitude for NRC's attitude, said that while Commissioner Merrifield realizes the centrality of NSSP, the U.S. requires some forward thinkers to address the baggage and cobwebs that continue to burden the U.S.-India nuclear relationship.  It is reasonable to expect, that given the current price of hydrocarbons, heavy investments in nuclear power in India are likely to continue.  In addition, investments in nuclear power in the United States could once again grow.  The U.S. and India, thus, have common interests and some decisions to make on how to bring back to life a natural relationship.  It is India's hope that the U.S. and India will be able to look at the nuclear relationship in a broader context.  8.  (C) India is very cognizant of shared concerns of proliferation.  In implementing export controls, India is not doing this for the U.S., as exports of sensitive materials and technologies are just as detrimental to India's interests as they are detrimental to U.S. interests.  9.  (C) The U.S. and India need to take steps that demonstrate a shared purpose and India requests that the U.S. take a more nuanced approach.  The Indians resent that the U.S. continues to express proliferation concerns with India, which has an \"impeccable record,\" and that the U.S. continues to put India in the same light as countries whose records are poorer.  In particular, grouping India with serial proliferators is incorrect and greatly unfair, Jaishankar concluded. 10.  (C) Jaishankar indicated that improving the relationship takes parallel efforts in India as well as in the U.S. However, progress in NSSP requires support within the Indian nuclear establishment.  Jaishankar remarked that in 1982 the challenges posed by supplies of fuel for the Tarapur nuclear power station seemed intractable.  The lesson learned at that time was that when there is a desire to find a creative solution, a solution can indeed be found.  11.  (C) In the context of the broader dialogue of the U.S.-India relationship, progress in NSSP requires that the constituencies in the technical community remain supportive. In this regard, India's space program has found much benefit from the NSSP.  The Indian nuclear technical establishment is far more skeptical.  For NSSP to succeed, it must be implemented in letter as well as in spirit.  A generous approach is important and the human element is important. Barriers vitiate the atmosphere in which NSSP could blossom. When Indian scientists who want to attend international conferences are denied visas, implementation of NSSP suffers.   ------------------------ Getting on With the NSSP ------------------------  12.  (C) Merrifield told Jaishankar that, in his view, there are two kinds of attorneys.  One kind of attorney reads a contract line-by-line and word-by-word.  Another kind tries to look at an agreement beyond the individual words and individual lines to develop a vision of the total significance of an agreement.  Merrifield said that he, just as Jaishankar, wants dialogue and progress and wants to get beyond the baggage so the relationship can move forward.  13.  (C) Merrifield told Jaishankar that with regard to NSSP, NRC's inputs are only in those matters that deal with nuclear safety.  Through his interactions in India, Commissioner Merrifield said that he understands the visa issue much better and it is easier for NRC to facilitate the process when it has timely information it can act upon.  -------------------- Meeting Participants --------------------  14.

NEW DELHI 1261      B. NEW DELHI 1263  Classified By: DCM ROBERT BLAKE, REASON 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  On February 11 NRC Commissioner Merrifield met MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar who has the non-proliferation portfolio within her purview.  Commissioner Merrifield expressed satisfaction with his visit to Indian facilities and suggested that further cooperation could bring regulatory technical personnel to NRC and that thermo hydraulic testing facilities at BARC could be of interest to NRC in certification of new CANDU reactor designs.  Shankar suggested material research, nuclear safety codes, proliferation resistant reactors, ITER, and personnel exchanges as additional areas for cooperation.  She also indicated the importance of imports of nuclear fuel to further development of India's nuclear power program.  End summary.  --------------------------------------------- ----------- Merrifield Expresses Satisfaction With Indian Engagement --------------------------------------------- -----------  2.  (C) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Jeffrey S. Merrifield said he came to India with deep curiosity and interest about the nuclear safety programs of AERB, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL).  He told Shankar that the AERB capabilities are impressive and that Hall 7 of BARC has some extraordinary facilities to carryout tests on CANDU related hardware (Ref. B).  3.  (C) The Commissioner told Shankar that he was afforded good access at Tarapur 1 & 2 and reactor-face access at Tarapur 4 as well as unprecedented access at RAPS 1, 2, 3 & 4 as well as the comprehensive tour of RAPS 5 & 6, which are under construction.  The Commissioner told Shankar that he had visited all nuclear power plants in the United States and over 100 facilities abroad and by international standards the material conditions of Indian nuclear power plants compared favorably with plants he has seen elsewhere in the world.  4.  (C) The Commissioner told Shankar that he feels it is important to move forward with bilateral cooperation with AERB.  He expressed his wish to accept AERB staff at NRC. The Commissioner said that he and the NRC are great supporters of World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) benchmarking nuclear power stations.  In his view, WANO exchanges provide an opportunity for operators of US nuclear power plants and operators of Indian nuclear power plants to mutually benefit by witnessing best operating and safety practices in each other's plants.  Merrifield said that in the field of nuclear safety, one can never know or learn enough.  5.  (C) The Commissioner told Shankar that the visit to India has empowered him to push the dialogue further and that through his thorough engagement of the India nuclear power industry, executives and technical personnel, site visits during this journey to India, he has been able to gauge the vigor and dynamism of the Indian nuclear industry.  --------------------------------------------- ------------ MEA Shankar's View on U.S.-Indian Nuclear Cooperation and Indian Export Controls --------------------------------------------- ------------  6.  (C) Shankar expressed satisfaction that Commissioner Merrifield visited a number of nuclear power plants, both safeguarded as well as unsafeguarded.  She also expressed satisfaction about the positive impression that Merrifield received.  In India's view, the dialogue on nuclear safety is an important part of the overall U.S.-India relationship.  It is India's wish that cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy expand.  7.  (C) The U.S.-India relationship has undergone a transformation, Shankar said, and India wishes it to move in a pragmatic way.  With the NSSP the relationship has made progress in non-nuclear areas and some progress with regards to safeguarded facilities.  Thus, the Government of India looks forward to more cooperation.  8.  (C) She went on to say that India has a cradle to grave control of technologies and materials that apply to nuclear exports.  India has the Atomic Energy Act, Shankar said, which predates many of the laws that other countries have put in place to protect nuclear materials, technology and know how.  It is not really in India's interest that its technologies fall into the hands of those countries that may want harm India's interests.  India has a number of redundant checks on issuing licenses for production and transport of nuclear materials.  Customs is fastidious on clearances that affect nuclear materials.  In addition, India keeps its regulations in the nuclear field up to date so that control systems remain relevant.  9.  (C) Responding to DCM Blake's observation that in order to move forward on NSSP the U.S. was looking forward to India's progress on export control regulation, Shankar said that India is making progress, that there is much on India's agenda and that India is actively engaged.  However, it is tough to develop a consensus, Shankar said.  Common ground develops in inter-agency meetings in Delhi, but the common ground quickly crumbles when participants try to develop consensus in and buy-in from the institutions they represent.  Shankar mused that in this regard there is a lot to be said about authoritarian governance as it forges consensus without effort.  --------------------------------------------- Further Development of Nuclear Power in India ---------------------------------------------  10.  (C) Shankar explained that India's goal is to have in place 20 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2020, an option that it can insure using a thorium based fuel cycle.  This option is attractive because it will allow India to expand the nuclear power program based on internal resources.  Nuclear energy has its advantages as it is environmentally benign and produces no greenhouse emissions.  The costs of building nuclear power plants have gone down dramatically for NPCIL, so India believes that nuclear power generation is quickly becoming very cost effective when compared to other sources of energy.  11.  (C) Thus, supplies of nuclear fuel continue to be of interest to India and it is an area where the U.S. might want to have a re-look given the zooming price of liquid hydrocarbons.  India understands that constraints of U.S. law prevent the US from providing fuel.  But, if other states agreed to provide nuclear fuel to India, the US, perhaps ought not to oppose such arrangements, Shankar said.  12.  (C) In the nuclear field, India is looking at options that would allow it to obtain nuclear fuel from elsewhere. One option worth considering is to put nuclear power plants that are built through international cooperation under site-specific safeguards.  At this time, however, India does not intend to put the power plants it has built on its own under site-specific safeguards.  13.  (C) Given the objectives of sustained economic growth and India's demographics, if India is going to insure rapid development it must ensure its energy program keeps pace. Constraints on expanding the nuclear program will hold back India's development, as nuclear energy is a critical part of India's energy supply mix.  The Indian energy market, Shankar said, is very price inelastic.  Markets cannot absorb very sharp energy price increases as resistance to price increases in India can lead to anarchic behavior.  Thus, India envisions that international cooperation in meeting its future energy needs will allow India to develop faster.  14.  (C) Shankar then steered the discussion to harmonization of guidelines under the nuclear safety convention.  India believes that there is a mismatch between nuclear safety requirements and availability of equipment under the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  In India's view, it would be important to harmonize the nuclear safety exception that will allow a more flexible interpretation of NSG rules such that technology transfers that promote nuclear safety can take place.  In short, India and the U.S. must find creative solutions to end the isolation of the India nuclear power program and bring about benefits that both the US and India can share.  15.  (C) Merrifield told Shankar that in his view as an attorney, legislation and regulation always arise from a back-looking perspective.  Thus, now that we are in 2005, the U.S.-India dialogue on nuclear matters is far different but takes place under a framework that developed over the course of 40 years.  There is a need to review these issues with a more forward-looking perspective.  16.  (C) With regards to nuclear regulation, nuclear safety knows no international boundaries, Merrifield said.  It is important that the U.S. and India reduce barriers to improve safety and be able to move forward under the NSSP framework.  --------------------------------------------- ----- India's Wishes for Collaboration on Nuclear Safety --------------------------------------------- -----  17.  (C) In the nuclear area, Shankar said, the focus on nuclear safety is welcome.  There have been workshops between the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in India and the U.S. and it looks like the agenda that had been agreed to originally has been completed.  Thus, perhaps, the U.S. and India ought to look at additional areas where future cooperation.  Shankar identified four areas that would be of interest to India:  -- New reactor design; -- Nuclear reactor material degradation; -- Probabalistic risk assessment; and -- Training of personnel.  18.  (C) Shankar elaborated that India would very much like to have an opportunity to place some young scientists, for periods of about six months, within NRC or at educational institutions that have strong programs in nuclear safety and power.  In addition, India is also looking forward to validation of nuclear reactor safety software where the US and India could validate each other's safety codes.  19.  (C) Regarding U.S.-specific cooperation, India is interested in proliferation resistant reactors and would like very much to participate in the Gen-IV R&D project, as it strongly believes that India has something to bring to the table.  20.  (C) Merrifield told Shankar that, while NRC is eager to benchmark codes and to allow comparison of predictions of U.S. and Indian codes, some of the details of what cooperation is possible depend on our government's progress on the NSSP process.  With regard to Gen-IV, Merrifield told Shankar that DOE is in the lead.  The Commissioner is aware that India has capabilities that it could bring to the table and the Commissioner promised that he would highlight India's capabilities and its interest in Gen-IV when he engages DOE officials upon his return.  --------------------------------------------- ----- Use of BARC Facilities For Safety Testing of CANDU Components --------------------------------------------- -----  21.  (C) Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) International Affairs Director Raghuraman asked Merrifield to provide some clarification about opportunities there may be for safety collaborations on thermo hydraulics, which could take advantage of equipment in Hall 7 of BARC.  Merrifield qualified that the prevalence of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) in the U.S. called for development of specialized facilities that address safety questions that are relevant to those reactors.  The U.S. has research facilities that allow the NRC to determine that safety requirements for PWRs are met.   In contrast, if the NRC were asked to certify a CANDU reactor for construction in the U.S., the U.S. does not have any CANDU reactors in its inventory, nor does the U.S. have any facilities to validate information that the reactor manufacturer would need to provide in support of the certification requirements.  Thus, if questions were to arise with the certification of the new CANDU reactor, it is conceivable that the U.S. might consider requesting India's collaboration to use the facilities in Hall 7 of BARC.  22.  (C) Commissioner Merrifield told Shankar that the NRC, as a regulatory agency, looks at issues very broadly and examines those in which it can find creative solutions to move forward.  As a regulatory agency, NRC embraces other regulatory agencies.  In NRC's view, regulation of the nuclear industry benefits the public by allowing utilities to deliver power, in a safe manner, at costs that are consistent with high standards of safety and public protection.  -------------------------------------------- Visas Challenge Indian Participation in WANO -------------------------------------------- 23.  (C) As it regards India's participation in WANO, the NRC is very supportive of WANO benchmarking and the U.S. nuclear industry has already benefited from interactions from NPCIL in the WANO context.  In the WANO context, Shankar observed, some Indian nuclear power program participants had been denied visas to participate in IAEA sponsored activities. Merrifield said that while visas are not in the purview of NRC, NRC became aware of the difficulties that S.K. Jain, Managing Director of NPCIL, was facing in obtaining a visa to travel to the United States.  In this case, NRC collaborated with Embassy New Delhi to ensure that Jain could travel to the United States to participate in the meeting.  24.  (C) Regarding visa issues, DCM Blake added that timely submission of visa applications provides an opportunity for consular and Embassy officials to help insure travel of Indian scientists to the United States without delay.  ----------------------------------- India Wishes to Participate in ITER -----------------------------------  25.  (C) Shankar also expressed interest for India's participation in the ITER project.  India discussed the ITER project with the leadership of the European Commission (EC) during their visit to India.  India was told that the EC has an open mind and Shankar wanted to make sure that it flagged India's interest in participation in ITER and hoped that the U.S. would support India's endeavors.  26.  (C) Merrifield explained that in regard to ITER, the site selection has become a challenge that is clouding the discussions about those who would like to participate in the project.  Nonetheless, he stated that we would inform DOE about the interest of the Government of India in this matter.  -------------------- Meeting Participants --------------------  27.

CHENNAI 120  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr., Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1.  (C) Summary: In a reflection of India's mounting concern about internal disorder, Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee recently described India's Naxalite insurgency as \"the gravest threat to our internal security.\"  This worry is also reflected in the stern GOI reaction to the coup in Nepal, with the GOI attributing the September 2004 merger of a once disparate Naxalite movement into the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in part to Maoist gains in recent years in Nepal. Named after the West Bengal village of Naxalbari, where peasants revolted in May 1967, Naxalite strategy is to create a \"revolutionary corridor\" from Nepal southward and extending across eight states, followed by a \"Compact Revolutionary Zone (CRZ)\" that they can control and administer, and finally, a Maoist state in this area.  While Naxalite violence has spread into 15 states in Central and Eastern India, the level of violence has not increased dramatically, with the GOI reporting roughly the same number of deaths (500) in 2004 as in 2003.  Naxalites have taken root in regions ruled by a nexus of organized criminals and corrupt politicians, where governance is poor and poverty and injustice endemic.  Indian experts note that Naxalism tends to find favor among peasants in agricultural areas suffering from \"extreme distress,\" which suggests that the movement's potential to spread may be limited.  The GOI sees increased development assistance and law enforcement action as the keys to a solution, but cannot succeed until the police and local politicians radically change their approach to governance. In addition, the GOI has only recently focused on Naxalism, as the previous National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government made \"Islamic terrorism\" its top priority.  The mainstream Communists would like to absorb the Naxalites, whose leaders have thus far rejected this possibility on the grounds that Congress long ago coopted the Communists into supporting economic reform.  Naxalites have attacked at least one affiliate of a US corporation (Coca Cola), but not American citizens.  End Summary.  What is a Naxalite? -------------------  2.  (U) The Naxalites view themselves as a historical movement with a long-term vision, and both short-term and strategic goals.  For the present, they are bent on securing a base in India's remote areas, but hope to carry out a revolution in all of India that will result in the establishment of a \"People's Republic.\"  The Naxalite movement was an attempt by young Indian Communists in the late 1960's to renew the Communist movement, which they charged was being coopted into mainstream politics.  Its name comes from a peasant movement which started in the village of Naxalbari in the Darjeeling District of West Bengal in May 1967, and formally began in 1969 when activists formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist).  3.  (U) The CPI(ML) concluded that a traditional Marxist revolution based on an urban proletariat could not take place in India, as it is largely a agrarian, pre-Industrial society.  The party's ideology instead sought to create a peasant movement focusing on land reform and agricultural issues, and its largely urban proponents fanned out to remote areas of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh to organize.  The CPI(ML) quickly fragmented into factions, as leaders developed ideological differences and broke away to form their own groups, some of which turned to violent insurgency.  Once fighters reach the age of 45, they are urged to surrender, gain amnesty and work above ground to support the younger fighters.  4.  (U) GOI and Indian press accounts assert that Naxalite influence has increased dramatically in the past year, with Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee recently describing the Naxalite insurgency as \"the gravest threat to India's internal security.\"  A GOI intelligence report leaked to the press in January claimed that as of September 2004, Naxalites were active in 156 districts in 13 states, and by February 2005 this had reportedly expanded to 170 districts in 15 states, although evidence is difficult to verify.  There are purportedly 35 active Naxalite groups in India, although only 12 engage in political violence.  The GOI estimated that approximately 6,000 persons have been killed in the Naxalite insurgency in the past 10 years.  With a well-established support base in some areas, the Naxalites have in some instances negotiated unofficial cease-fires with political parties, which allow them to operate freely without fear of police intervention.  Military Capabilities ---------------------  5.  (C) Although they can gather up to company strength (150 cadres) to conduct attacks, the Naxalites usually operate at the squad level (15 cadres).  Their combat with Indian security forces has been restricted to classic small infantry encounters, relying primarily on concentration of superior forces, attacking at a time and place of their choosing, and use of surprise and ambushes, to overcome the military superiority of the enemy.  GOI and Indian think tank reports verify that Indian Naxalites do not receive weapons from abroad.  They have determined that while the Naxalites have armorers that manufacture and repair weapons, their principal source remains the Indian security forces and the local arms market At present they rely on infantry weapons, including some automatic weapons, but have begun to construct crude indirect fire weapons (mortars), which are inaccurate and of little military value.  6.  (C) The biggest upgrade in Naxalite military capabilities has been the integration of Claymore mines into their attacks.  The most spectacular use of Claymores was on October 1, 2003, when Naxalites attempted to assassinate AP Chief Minister Chandrababa Naidu with a simultaneous detonation of up to nine mines.  Since the Naidu attack, Naxalites have used Claymores several times to kill up to eight policemen at a time by detonating the mines under their vehicles as they travel along rural roads.  Indian analysts have hypthosized that the Naxalites are acquiring the mines and training in their use from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but have not presented verifiable proof to back up this assertion.  Naxalite groups have repeatedly oppose the presence of American multinationals in India and have targeted their facilities for attack, most notably an attack on a Coca Cola bottling plant.  However, they have not threatened American citizens or conducted attacks against them.  Nepal as Inspiration --------------------  7.  (U) The \"Peoples' War success\" of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) inspired India's Naxalites to restructure their organizations on the Nepalese pattern.  The main tenets of the CPN (Maoist) ideology and its relationship to India were outlined in an extensive interview conducted by American Communist journalist Li Onesto with Prachanda, the CPN (Maoist) General Secretary on February 20, 2000.  (The full text of the interview is found at www.lionesto.net).  8.  (U) Prachanda pointed out that his party has cooperated with the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) and People's War (PW) since before the declaration of the Nepalese \"people's war\" in 1996, and that \"the Nepalese revolution is part of the world revolution.\"  Despite this cooperation, Prachanda derided his Indian comrades as \"adventurists with no vision.\"  He insisted that Indian Naxalites have fruitlessly spent 25 years attempting to establish a \"guerrilla zone,\" without realizing that this is only \"transitional.\"  He urged Indian Naxalites \"to seize, to capture, base areas,\" and govern them, as his party has done in Nepal, noting that this is not possible without \"strong mass support.\"  While this interview is now some five years old, it is still viewed here as among the most reliable windows into the views of Nepal's Maoist leaders.  War Against India -----------------  9.  (U) Prachanda insisted that as his movement becomes successful in Nepal, India will commit its armed forces to counter-insurgency there, saying \"that when the Indian Army comes in with thousands and thousands of soldiers, it will be a very big thing.  But we are not afraid of the Indian Army, because, in one way, it will be a very good thing.  They will give us lots of guns.  And lots of people will fight them. This will be a national war.\"  As part of its strategy of preparing for war against India, the CPN (Maoist) has been working with the Naxalites to build a strong Indian support base to tie down Indian security forces and hinder the Indian Army from successfully prosecuting war in Nepal.  He predicted that after the Indian Army is defeated, the CPN (Maoist) will declare a Peoples Republic of Nepal.  The Indian Revolutionary Corridor ---------------------------------  10.  (U) The CPN (Maoist) was the principal agent in the creation of a Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organizations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA) in 2001.  The Committee includes the CPN (Maoist), the CPI (Maoist) and the Communist Party of India - Marxist Leninist - Janashakti group, as well as three Bangladeshi Maoist parties and one from Sri Lanka (Ref B).  The Janashakti (\"people's power\") Group claims that it no longer participates in peoples war and has run candidates for elective office.  In September 2004, with the reported support of CCOMPOSA and Nepalese Maoists, the MCC and PW united to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist), which is modeled after the CPN (Maoist) and has adopted an almost identical ideology and strategy.  The CPI (Maoist) has since expanded its activities to new areas of India in the hope of creating a \"revolutionary corridor\" extending from Nepal across eight Indian states, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Karnataka.  This region is called the \"compact revolutionary zone (CRZ)\" in Maoist jargon.  In some areas of these states Naxalites have established parallel administrations which extract \"revolutionary taxes,\" run schools, and administer justice.  The Bihar Stronghold --------------------  11.  (C) The CPI (Maoist) is strongest in Bihar, where it is active in 30 of the state's 40 districts.  The Indian Home Minister told Parliament on December 14, 2004 that Maoists had killed 513 people across India in 2004.  Of these, 155 were killed in Bihar.  Although press reports indicate that Naxalites are active in 16-18 of neighboring Jharkhand's 22 districts, Consulate Calcutta sources claim that Naxalites are active at some level in the entire state.  Dr. Ajai Sahni of the Institute of Conflict Management (ICM) provided a number of reasons why Naxalism has found a home in Bihar. The state is dominated by an unusually rigid caste system in which the upper castes oppress and exploit the Dalits and tribals and violently resist social change.  To maintain their stranglehold on power, Bihar's upper castes fund an army of criminals (the Ranvir Sena) armed with over 16,000 weapons, including automatic rifles and grenade launchers. The Ranvir Sena has carried out several massacres of Dalits in the state and is patronized by all the political parties except the Left.  Sahni argued that this has resulted in \"extreme distress\" of the state's tribals and dalits, who turn to the Naxalites for protection and justice.  Life in Bihar -------------  12.  (C) A journalist who recently returned from an extended stay in Bihar described to Poloff how the Naxalites function in the state.  He maintained that they have a virtual \"shadow government\" in parts of Bihar, and collect taxes from virtually every business (sic) in the countryside and erect barriers at night to collect tolls from truckers.  One businessman in Jharkhand described how he routinely added extra amounts to his contract bids to pay off the Naxalites, who would not otherwise allow his projects to proceed.  The journalist claimed that most people in Bihar, including the Naxalites, no longer view the insurgency as an ideological struggle, but rather as a way of life, and that some Naxalite leaders are making a good living from it.  The reporter claimed that the Bihar Naxalites do not provide a better way of life or infrastructure to the state, but bring a measure of justice to the poorer classes and castes, in that the high castes no longer interfere in the lives of the low castes in areas where Naxalites are active.  13.  (C) Another journalist told Poloff that the Bihar police have long stopped trying to battle the Naxalites, preferring to make their own separate arrangements with their leaders. Under the agreements the two sides agree not to fire on one another.  The police then fire off their ammunition in the jungle once every month and claim it was used in \"encounters\" with the Naxalites.  The journalist asserted that police are killed by the Naxalites only when they have not yet realized the arrangement, and insist on conducting anti-Naxalite patrols.  Those officers who survive quickly \"get smart\" and adjust to the system, he maintained.  Bihari Police Assessment ------------------------  14.  (C) In a February 10 meeting in Patna, Director General of Police (DGP) M.R. Sinha (protect) told Poloff that \"key Maoists\" from Nepal and Bihar are working together. Commenting that interrogations of \"hundreds of Naxalites\" during the past few years demonstrated increased Naxalite/Maoist activity along the border with Nepal, Sinha credited increasing cross-border cooperation to the growing strength of Nepali Maoists, and their desire to create a \"grand liberation zone\" (sic) stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Himalayas.  The Nepalese Maoists believe they must work with their Naxalite counterparts in India to realize their dream, he stated.  15.  (C) Sinha affirmed that while Sitamarhi, Darbhangha, Bettiah and Bagaha are the four Bihari districts with the most Naxalite activity, 30 of the state's 40 districts have some Naxalite presence.  According to Sinha, the police are well-aware that the Naxalite problem on the Nepal border has grown worse over the last four years, but have only been able to launch a few operations against them.  He commented that he had \"been there and walked the border many times\" and the terrain favors the Maoists, especially because the police forces are undermanned.  Complaining that a 2001 proposal to triple the number of police in the region was never implemented, Sinha confirmed that there are currently only enough officers to post one man about ever kilometer along the border, and this is not nearly enough to inhibit Maoist/Naxalite movement.  He asserted that very few Maoists and Naxalites he had interrogated knew or cared about the movement's politics and ideology, and were only involved to earn money.  This makes it easy to recruit informants, he maintained, since the police can easily double a Maoist fighter's daily wage of about 50 rupees (about usd 1.25).  The Impact of Elections -----------------------  16.  (U) State elections are currently taking place in Bihar and Jharkhand.  According to the GOI, the CPI (Maoist) launched a series of attacks on police after calling on voters in both states to boycott these elections.  While Naxalite/police violence has caused casualties on both sides, the CPI (Maoist) has denied the boycott call, saying that the Indian security forces are using the election as an excuse to intimidate the Maoists.  One Maoist leader argued that the CPI (Maoist) could easily have enforced a total boycott, but are too busy \"sorting out organizational issues following the merger of PW and MCC\" to bother with the election.  Nepal-India Nexus -----------------  17.  (U) The GOI also attributes the recent upsurge in Naxalite activity to infiltration from Nepal, saying that King Gyanendra's February 1 crackdown could lead CPN (Maoist) leaders flee to India and join forces with the Naxalites. Local media have reported that Nepalese Maoist leaders are already in India, including Baburam Bhattarai, considered to be number two in the CPN (Maoist) hierarchy after Prachanda, and the movement's ideological/intellectual leader.  Despite these assertions, there is no evidence that Nepali Maoists have joined the fighting in India.  According to Prakash Singh, a former Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF), \"Nepalese Maoists come here, get arms and ammunition from their counterparts and return to their original bases in Nepal.\"  18.  (C) Bihar DGP B.R. Sinha argued to Poloff that a Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) crackdown on the Maoists would only make the situation in Bihar worse if rebels seek shelter in India.  He dismissed this as \"unlikely,\" however, as the RNA was not strong enough to combat the Maoists, and would spend most of its resources attempting to secure the Kathmandu Valley.  He commented that, if pressed by the RNA, Maoists would more likely retreat further into the Nepalese jungle, which they already control.  South Also Simmering --------------------  19.  (U) Naxalite violence also continues unabated in South India, which has been wracked by tit-for-tat killings, as Naxalites ambush the police, who then kill Naxalites in \"encounters.\"  Andhra Pradesh (AP) is the only state which has negotiated a \"cease fire\" with the Naxalites, which resulted in a seven month suspension of violence.  The conflict resumed in January, however, (Ref A) after police allegedly killed a number of Maoists in \"encounters,\" and the Naxalites responded with attacks on police, politicians, and property.  The CPI (Maoist) asserts that it was forced to retaliate after police picked up unarmed Naxalites, murdered them, dumped their bodies in the forest and claimed they were killed in gunfights.  Chief Minister YS Rajashekhara Reddy has asserted that the CPI (Maoist) has taken advantage of the peace process to rearm and consolidate.  While the police insist they will challenge Naxalites carrying arms, the state administration, eager to get the Maoists back to the negotiation table, is urging both sides to exercise restraint.  20.  (U) Noted terrorism expert Ajai Sahni claims that lopsided economic liberalization in AP has increased Naxalite popularity, as former Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's development policies were urban centric and ignored economic problems in the countryside.  As a result, many of the state's farmers were put into \"extreme distress\" and provided support to Naxalite groups, he stated.  Nihar Nayak, a research associate at the Institute for Conflict Management, assessed that \"over the past five years, Naxalite activities have increased in the districts surrounding Bangalore city - India's 'Silicon Valley,'\" and that \"the economic impact of the Naxalite rampage is potentially devastating.\"  Former Insider's View ---------------------  21.  (C) Anand Swaroop Verma has been a Communist and Naxalite sympathizer since the 1970s.  Although no longer active in any Communist organization, Verma reportedly continues to be trusted by the various Naxalite factions and has entree to their leadership.  Writing primarily in Hindi, Verma is the author of several books on Nepali Maoists, and is the Convenor of the Indo/Nepal People's Unity Forum, an Indian support group for Nepali Maoists.  The works of Verma and other Naxalite supporters can be read at www.revolutionarydemocracy.org.  22.  (C) Verma pointed out to Poloff that the CPI (Maoist) describes the current Indian state as \"a criminal nexus in which politics and crime have become irrevocably intertwined.\"  The Party has no illusions that it will have sufficient armed force to overthrow the state over the short term, but plans to use violence to establish a secure base and compel the \"ruling class\" to negotiate its demands.  The CPI (Maoist) believes its rural, peasant-based revolution will eliminate feudalism and neo-colonialism from the countryside and capture the cities in the revolution's final phase.  It plans to enact radical land reform, break up the estates of big landholders, divide the property among landless laborers, implement minimum wage laws, and end bonded labor.  23.  (C) Verma recently pointed out to Poloff that Indian Naxalites have split into two contending factions: The Communist Party of India (Maoist), and a group of above-ground Maoist parties with the same goals, but which no longer espouse armed struggle and \"people's war.\"  Verma noted, however, that the above-ground Maoist parties retain their arms and have clashed with the CPI (Maoist) on several occasions.  Both factions believe that the Indian state is the principal enemy, but advocate different revolutionary models.  The CPI (Maoist), like its counterpart in Nepal, describes India as a \"semi-colonial\" state that is becoming a de-facto colony of the US and its Indian supporters. However, it prefers a \"New Democratic Revolution\" based in the countryside and carried out by the peasants.  The above-ground parties call for a non-violent, urban-based \"Socialist Revolution,\" led by the working class, and centered around opposition to \"Neo-liberalism,\" which it describes as another variant of \"American imperialism.\"  Not Just a few Peasants with Guns ---------------------------------  24.  (C) Verma described the Naxalite movement as \"very strong,\" pointing out that it started in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh (AP), but has since spread to Madhya Pradesh (MP), Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Jharkhand.  He could not or would not quantify how many Naxalites are under arms. Agreeing that the CPN (Maoist) is the model for India's Naxalite groups, Verma noted that the ideologies of Communist parties in China and Cuba do not apply to South Asia.  Nepali Maoists are providing support, but no state provides aid, he claimed.  25.  (C) Verma also conceded that some of India's Naxalites are \"adventurists\" who are carrying on \"class war without a purpose.\"  He claimed that without proper \"training\" guerrillas carry out \"aberrations\" such as extortion, murder, torture, and disfigurement in the name of \"class struggle.\" In order to gain legitimacy, he said, Indian Naxalites will have to declare \"liberated zones,\" such as those that exist in Nepal, and administer them fairly.  Such a move will \"win the sympathy of the rural masses.\"  While such zones do not exist today, there are plenty of rural areas that Naxalites \"rule at night\" and where no representative of the Indian state dares to go.  The GOI Increasingly Worried - Changes Tack -------------------------------------------  26.  (U) Reflecting a series of increasingly worried statements by DefMin Mukherjee and PM Manmohan Singh, the GOI response to the rising tide of Naxalism has been to adopt a carrot and stick approach.  On February 7, Home Minister Shivraj Patil said that the GOI \"encourages the states to form unified commands, under the respective Chief Ministers, comprising state police and central paramilitary forces to deal with the naxal menace.\"  He pointed out that New Delhi had provided 23 battalions of paramilitaries to those states affected by Naxalite violence.  However, Patil noted, police measures alone would not provide a long-term solution to the problem, only \"social justice, the removal of economic disparity, development and a fresh initiative\" by the state governments would work.  Patil added that the GOI would provide \"special schemes in naxal-hit areas, especially in the forest and the development-starved regions\" in the next five year plan.  This was echoed in PM Singh's recently announced \"Action Plan\" for the next six months, which lists \"Monitor Naxalism with a view to improve the situation,\" as one of its primary goals.  27.  (C) The GOI prefers that the Naxalite issue be addressed by state governments and their security forces, an approach which has prevented effective coordination of security efforts.  The repeated complaint of the West Bengal Government, for example, is that the Naxalites cross from Jharkhand to conduct attacks and then return to their safe-havens, and that the Jharkhand government is not doing enough (or anything) to prevent it.  The ineffectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by a February 11 Naxalite attack in Karnataka.  The Naxalites assembled in AP, crossed the state border into Karnataka, attacked a police station and retreated into AP immediately thereafter.  Speaking in Jharkhand on February 13, PM Singh pledged that the GOI \"would soon come out with a comprehensive strategy to cope with the Naxal problem.\"  He noted that \"Naxalism is a problem Jharkhand is already grappling with, but it requires greater coordination between the state and the center to curb it.\"  Comment -------  28.  (C) It is difficult to quantify the extent of support for the Naxalite cause in India's rural areas, but all evidence suggests that it has grown considerably over the past two years.  This is partly due to encouragement by Maoist gains in Nepal, and partly to the inability of the Indian state to counter it effectively.  The Maoists operate in remote, isolated areas with largely tribal and/or lower caste populations that are poor, underdeveloped and alienated from the central government.  These regions provide fertile soil in which Naxalism can grow, but are not found throughout the country.  Even fairly alarmist Indian analysts concede that Naxalism does not take root in cities, and only in rural, agricultural areas experiencing \"extreme stress,\" which suggests that the insurgency may have geographical and socio-economic limits.  While poverty is widespread in India, the large numbers of poor in other areas of the country are more likely to respond to the non-violent variants of Communism propounded by the above-ground parties (septel), than to the Naxalites' calls to violent revolution.  29.  (C) The GOI approach to Naxalism has been marked by inconsistency, swinging between defining it simply as a law-and-order problem and declaring it a symptom of a much deeper social/economic malaise.  Different states have also defined the problem differently.  These varying approaches have prevented the emergence of a clear and consistent policy and provided the Naxalites with breathing space to expand their movement.  30.  (C) Naxalism is likely to endure, however, because the GOI does not have the ability or the will to address it effectively.  The \"carrot and stick\" approach laid out by Home Minister Patil has slim chance of success.  The strong nexus between corrupt politicians and organized crime in the areas where Naxalites have taken root, prevents development programs from being implemented.  In these areas, political parties, criminal organizations, and the police work together to monopolize power and maintain the status quo.  This often leaves the Naxalites as the only organized group perceived by the poor as defending it from exploitation.  31.  (C) Likewise, security forces in these areas tend to be poorly trained, poorly motivated, poorly equipped, and riddled with corruption.  It would take years of training and major investments to rebuild the police from the ground up and shape them into an independent and effective force capable of ensuring basic law and order in the districts where the Naxalites are active.  There is no indication that the GOI intends to undertake such a program.  In their present state, the police cannot provide the stick that will force the Naxalites to give up violence and come to the negotiating table.  32.  (C) Despite assistance from Nepalese Maoists, India's Naxalites cannot defeat the security forces, or establish the \"base area\" they need to demonstrate their ability to govern.  After 25 years of waging insurgency, they have accomplished little more than to render parts of their self-declared \"CRZ\" ungovernable and to rule the night in remote areas.  With neither the Naxalites nor the authorities in a position to prevail, the prognosis is an indefinite stalemate.  33.  (C) The mainstream Communist parties favor an end to the insurgency, and would like to absorb the Naxalites or to see them convert their organizations into Maoist political parties.  However, open hostility between the Naxalites and the mainstream Communists has prevented this from coming about.  For the Naxalites, India's Communist parties are too close to Congress and its \"neo-liberal\" economic policies, considering then \"deviationist.\"  Naxalites have demonstrated that they have a sufficient base of support in some areas to win election to local offices and state Legislative Assemblies, but they refuse to join mainstream politics as long as they face the prospect of death at the hands of local political mafias after emerging from the underground.  34.  (C) We will address the relationship between the Maoists and the Communists parties backing the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) septel. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: After several weeks in which the process of Indo-Pak normalization appeared to be grinding to a halt (Ref B), this week's Islamabad deal has shifted the dynamic, at least temporarily, in a much more constructive direction.  PM Manmohan Singh's fingerprints were clearly in evidence in the several climb downs from prior MEA positions on travel documents for the bus and on linking the gas pipeline to other trade issues -- further examples of Indo-Pak diplomatic breakthroughs that required high-level political intervention (Ref D).  Although a palpable \"can-do\" spirit has followed the announcement of the deal, implementing the bus service may yet get hung up in the details.  The early criticism of the agreement comes primarily from the BJP, who are labeling it as a sell-out and may accelerate barb-throwing as Parliament reconvenes (septel).  As much as the bus is a positive symbol, it is also a target for Kashmir-oriented terrorism, and before the ink had dried Jaish-e-Mohammad threatened to disrupt the service if it led to \"more atrocities by Indian forces in J&K.\"  Still, with one large box checked off the Indo-Pak agenda, the atmosphere in New Delhi is now primed for renewed talks on a short-list of confidence building measures, including nuclear CBMs, prior notification of missile testing, MoU's on counter-narcotics cooperation and maritime security, and revisiting the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline as an economic vice political issue.  As talks resume in the coming weeks, we need to be perceived as unambiguously behind the peace process and appreciative of the political risks that both sides have taken to get this far.  End Summary.  Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus Deal: The Main Course --------------------------------------------- --  2.  (C) Most of the Indian media and many of our contacts stand behind the words of MEA spokesman Navtej Sarna, who characterized the February 16 agreement on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service as the \"mother of all confidence building measures.\"  Although Indian newspapers had been abuzz for days with speculation that the bus deal would be inked during FM Natwar Singh's February 15-17 visit, a healthy dose of caution -- born, in part, in the collapse of the July 2001 Agra Summit -- was also palpable until TV networks broadcast the Foreign Ministers' statements that a compromise had been struck and the bus would begin operations on April 7.  Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran said that the deal was \"an indication that the peace process is beginning to yield results.\"  Indian newspapers were awash with interviews of Kashmiris from \"divided families\" proclaiming the bus service to be \"the happiest news of the past 50 years,\" and photos of celebrations on the streets of Srinagar.  3.  (C) Track-Two activist George Matthew -- who plans to bring over thirty Indian panchayatis (local legislators) to Pakistan in March -- reflected the overall upbeat atmosphere in Delhi, telling Poloff that, by showing that the impasses that had dogged the bus proposal (Ref F) could be resolved, the service \"opens new vistas of cooperation, opens the floodgates of local people-to-people exchanges.\"  Matthew, who hails from Kerala, was as optimistic as any Delhiite at the \"great giant step\" toward normalizing Indo-Pak relations.  His words were echoed throughout the Indian media's coverage of the agreement.  The Mechanics of the Deal -------------------------  4.  (C) Recognizing the political value of having Natwar Singh bring deliverables home, the GOI climbed down on what MEA had previously characterized as bottom-line demands in order to reach this deal -- no longer requiring bus passengers to obtain visas to transit the LOC or passports as identity documents.  Instead, Indian passengers seeking to visit Pakistani Kashmir (as well as the Northern Areas) will send their applications to the Regional Passport Office (RPO) in Srinagar, which will forward the application to its counterpart agency in Pakistani Kashmir for validation.  The passenger will be notified when the paperwork is approved. Then, upon reaching the border, the host government will issue an entry permit.  Rather than have a single bus make the entire Srinagar-Muzaffarabad run, separate busses on each side of the LOC will ferry people from each city to the LOC, and carry back travelers from the other side.  Travel onward from Kashmir into other areas in the two countries via the bus will be prohibited, but New Delhi has not yet explained how it plans to enforce this provision aside from requiring that visitors check in with police periodically.  5.  (C) Indian commentators have observed that Islamabad made compromises as well, noting that the service will be available to all Indian and Pakistani citizens (Islamabad had reportedly wanted to restrict the service to Kashmiris only).  Furthermore, each government is to design its own entry papers, which, for travelers from Pakistani Kashmir to J&K, will include a Government of India stamp -- another concession by Islamabad.  Because of the processing time and the need for the MEA to issue instructions to the RPO, however, many of the initial passengers from Srinagar are likely to be Indian passport-holders, according to Indian press reports.  Third-country nationals are barred from riding the bus.  6.  (C) Some infrastructure obstacles also require attention.  For example, patches of the road near the LOC are reportedly in dire need of repair, although the Indian Army has already begun de-mining areas close to the LOC.  J&K Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed went so far as to pledge to expand the road into a four-lane highway.  The frequency of travel has yet to be announced, though most press reports predict it will begin with either weekly or bi-weekly service.  Some Indians are also asking whether the road will be opened at some future time for private vehicles, and for trade.  A Much-Needed Boost -------------------  7.  (C) Over the past few weeks, Pakistan-watchers in New Delhi had grown concerned that the dialogue process was slowing and could grind to a halt.  Director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dipankar Banerjee was greeted with a roomful of nodding heads when he commented at a recent seminar on Indo-Pak relations that \"in the absence of movement, the dialogue will end sooner rather than later.\"  Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis Deputy Director Commodore Uday Bhaskar on February 1 predicted that Natwar Singh's trip would provide \"little movement aside from embedding the process further,\" and Observer Research Foundation (ORF) Senior Pakistan Fellow Wilson John less than a week before the announcement brushed aside the prospect of substantial agreement until later in the year.  8.  (C) Now, however, even the skeptics have also turned optomistic.  Former Director of the ORF Pakistan Centre Sushant Sareen commented that the most significant aspect of the agreement was that it breathed new life into Indo-Pak relations, which had been dragging over recent diplomatic reversals (Ref C), and Wilson John acknowledged that it was \"a great step forward, and a good boost to the flagging Composite Dialogue.\"  Even anti-terrorism hawk Ajai Sahni admitted that it was \"a baby step forward.\"  BJP Leading the Naysayers -------------------------  9.  (C) In addition to the knee-jerk public criticism of the bus service from pro-independence hardline Kashmiri separatists (Ref A), BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi castigated the compromise on travel documents as \"ignoring national interests and security concerns.\"  He expanded that \"the decision will open a floodgate for infiltration by terrorists in the garb of tourists.\"  Parliamentary opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh followed up by publicly questioning whether the UPA government had adequately focused on counterterrorism concerns while formulating the compromise of travel documents.  Although domestic political opposition seems to be galvanizing around security issues, BJP leaders are also initiating a second line of attack by predicting that the compromise will embolden Kashmiri secessionists and \"may lead to Kashmiri leaders demanding an independent state.\"  Former PM Vajpayee will reportedly promote this theme at a campaign rally in Patna on February 18.  10.  (C) BJP National Executive Member Seshadri Chari took a less combative tone in private, telling us that although \"there is nothing new there, the NDA government has also worked on these CBMs.\" \"Pakistan's attitude does not seem favorable to the peace process, the agreement itself is good as long as there are no security lapses,\" he concluded. Associate Professor Savita Pandey of JNU's South Asia Center took a much harder line, decrying the accord as \"compromising and diluting India's stand on Kashmir completely\" and predicting that \"the Opposition will raise the 1994 parliamentary resolution, which maintains that India cannot accept any territorial compromise on Kashmir, including Pakistani Kashmir.\"  Don't Break Out the Champagne Just Yet --------------------------------------  11.  (C) To headlines such as \"LOC on Way to Become Soft Border\" that ran in \"The Pioneer,\" Sareen quipped, \"It's much too soon to make that determination.\"  He acknowledged that the bus service and other announcements were \"the important start of a series of steps, but not major developments on their own.\"  Sareen -- who had predicted before the Natwar visit that there would be no significant tangible results for the first several rounds of talks \"unless forced by domestic politics\" -- credited the accord with \"keeping the Composite Dialogue alive, keeping the process going.\"  He noted that, as with the visa process, people seeking to use the bus could be denied entry permits for political as well as security reasons.  More broadly, Sareen cautioned that \"Pakistan may see the signals the wrong way ... they may read this as weakness of resolve by New Delhi, that would be a terrible miscalculation to make if they think that they will get their way on the entire agenda.\"  ORF's Wilson John also pointed out that the March 1999 kick-off of the Delhi-Lahore bus service -- which was also hailed as groundbreaking -- did not impede the Kargil war.  12.  (C) Security is another concern yet to be fully addressed.  Because the bus service has become a symbol of the health of Indo-Pak relations, it is certain to become a target for Kashmir-oriented terrorist groups.  Even before the ink on the deal had dried, Jaish-e-Mohammad threatened to disrupt the service if it led to \"more atrocities by Indian forces in J&K.\"  The raised stakes will require closer cooperation between Indian and Pakistani paramilitary forces, as intelligence sharing to detect and prevent an attack on the bus will be essential.  Other Transport Links Face Fewer Political Obstacles --------------------------------------------- -------  13.  (C) The hand-shake on the Munnabao-Khokhrapar rail service to link Rajasthan and Sindh starting in October will likely mute criticism -- from the MEA (Ref E) and elsewhere -- that Islamabad is only interested in \"Punjab-to-Punjab\" contacts.  The rail link and the proposed Amritsar-Lahore bus service cross the International Border, not the LOC, so they could be accommodated under the standard passport/visa regime that is used for the Lahore-Delhi bus and train. Furthermore, the prospect of bus services between Amritsar-Lahore and Amritsar-Nankana Sahib (the birthplace of Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak) was cheered by veteran Sikh leader Manjit Singh Calcutta as \"delighting Sikhs all over.\"  Movement Proposed on Opening Consulates in Business Hubs --------------------------------------------- -----------  14.  (C) Also broadening the appeal of this week's deliverables is the announcement that the GOP and the GOI will work toward re-opening their consulates in Mumbai and Karachi, respectively.  More than the protection of their nationals abroad, this proposal seems targeted to the business communities in the two countries' commercial hubs, and should facilitate cross-border business travel.  For example, \"The Telegraph\" on February 16 reported that a Karachi-based software firm and a New-Delhi based IT organization are submitting a joint bid for a $1 million Sindh government project to train call center workers.  As would be expected, however, news of the Mumbai consulate re-opening was publicly slammed by Shiv Sena senior leader Pramod Nawalkar, who threatened, \"The Sena will never entertain any Pakistanis in Mumbai.\"  Slew of CBMs Teed Up for Spring Discussions -------------------------------------------  15.  (C) A cluster of CBMs that Delhi-based Pakistan-watchers had previously considered low-hanging fruit have been short-listed for early attention.  Renewed talks on nuclear CBMs, the agreement on details for prior notification of missile testing, as well as MoU's on counter-narcotics cooperation and maritime security (to include modalities of dealing with the hundreds of fishermen who are jailed for crossing the maritime boundary) are all expected in the coming months.  Some of these had reportedly come remarkably close to completion during technical deliberations last year.  The GOI and GOP said they would also discuss larger issues, such as the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline (Ref B); broader ones, such as increasing bilateral trade; and more contentious ones, including the Baglihar and Kishanganga hydro-electric projects.  Unsticking the Wicket ---------------------  16.  (C) Press reports also indicate that a compromise has also been brokered on the Pakistani cricket team's February 25-April 18 India tour.  Details will be reported septel.  Comment -------  17.  (C) It is hard to accurately capture the wave of optimism in New Delhi without appearing to have forgotten the history of Indo-Pak relations.  As one of Delhi's most prominent Pakistan watchers, \"Asian Age\" editor MJ Akbar, noted: \"There is a law of Indo-Pak relations -- nothing has happened until it has happened, so much scalding tea has spilled between the cup and the lip (the Agra summit being the most famous instance) that only the very brave predict good news.  A sub-law indicates that when things happen, everything seems possible.\"  The fact that the February 16 announcement -- the most significant breakthrough since the Composite Dialogue kicked off -- comes after several weeks of negative Indo-Pak news exemplifies the sine curve of South Asian diplomacy.  The hype is certain to settle down as the bureaucracies work to operationalize the agreement; and, admittedly, an additional 40 visitors on a weekly basis hardly constitutes \"opening the floodgates.\"  Although much can happen in the seven weeks until April 7, and detractors have already sharpened their word processors, this accord gives the Composite Dialogue a much-needed shot in the arm. The GOI deftly and simultaneously positioned itself as both magnanimous and responsible, and surprised most with the speed and intensity of the diplomatic momentum it can muster.  While acknowledging that there is still a long way to go on the road to normalization, this week's breakthroughs are a welcome kick-off to the 2005 Indo-Pak Diplomacy Season.  On the Indian side, much of the credit goes posthumously to NSA Dixit, whose implementation of the PM's admonition to \"think outside the box\" made the bus deal possible.  This success also demonstrates the degree to which Prime Ministerial engagement is imperative to progress in the Indo-Pak relationship.  In this context, we need to be perceived as unambiguously behind the peace process and appreciative of the political risks that both sides have taken to get this far. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: In contrast with the predominant view in the Indian media that by opting out of the Dhaka Summit, India dealt a fatal blow to SAARC, the GOI told us it remains committed to the organization.  MEA Joint Secretary (SAARC) V. Ashok told PolCouns and Poloff on February 16 that he was \"hopeful\" regarding the future of regional cooperation, indicating that India would attend a rescheduled Summit, provided Nepal and Bangladesh took steps to reverse the political misdeeds that India cited in its cancellation notice (ref B).  Ashok was equally upbeat about SAARC's negotiations for a regional free trade area, SAFTA, even with the question of most favored nation status from Pakistan unresolved.  End Summary.  Prerequisites for a Summit --------------------------  2.  (C) Ashok recognized that India's decision to unilaterally cancel the February 6-7 South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit had \"caused rumblings among the neighbors,\" but explained that New Delhi had to convey a firm message to Nepal in response to the King's actions on January 31.  Ashok, who was already in Dhaka on February 2 when the Foreign Secretary announced that PM Singh would not attend, remembered having to inform the BDG as having been \"slightly embarrassing.\"  Describing the blast at the hotel where the PM was to have stayed, the Joint Secretary insisted there were legitimate security concerns  SIPDIS about the Dhaka Summit.  In a more sober view of Bangladesh than some of his MEA colleagues, Ashok empathized with the effort the BDG has now taken twice to organize the Summit, commenting that while Dhaka was \"initially miffed,\" they are now talking about new dates.  But, without the appropriate political atmosphere, SAARC cannot achieve any results, he added.  3.  (C) PolCouns underlined our interest in the scheduling of an early SAARC Summit as a means to build confidence and further regional integration.  SAARC \"awaits normalcy,\" Ashok asserted in response.  When India sees positive signals from both Bangladesh and Nepal on security and democracy, he continued, \"we could see about restarting the SAARC process.\"  The Joint Secretary noted that Nepal weighed more heavily in the GOI decision to not go to Dhaka.  As far as making a third attempt at the thirteenth Summit, Ashok said that he would be happy to see the meeting happen in April or May 2005.  If it slips beyond then, he continued, is not inconceivable that the Summit would be pushed into 2006, in light of parliamentary, climatic (monsoon), and religious (Ramadan) considerations from June to December.  4.  (C) Reiterating what the Foreign Secretary said in his February 2 announcement that the Prime Minister would not go to Dhaka, Ashok insisted that India is committed to the organization and that he was \"hopeful\" for its future. Confident in SAARC's potential, he underlined his previously enunciated view that it is time for SAARC to move from meetings and studies to projects, and highlighted for example a regional HIV/AIDS program that will involve training doctors and paramedics, along with mobile clinics and awareness programs.  5.  (C) Ashok conveyed a positive line on SAARC just days after Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran in his February 14 speech on India's South Asia policy slammed the organization for having a \"hardly inspiring\" record, and being one in which the members have a \"deep resistance to doing anything that could be collaborative.\"  Saran added that some members see SAARC as \"a vehicle primarily to countervail India.\"  SAFTA Not Yet Derailed ----------------------  6.  (C) His enthusiasm for the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) unfazed by neighborhood developments, Ashok was nearly as upbeat about the prospects for trade negotiations as he had been before the Summit's double postponement (ref C).  His only concern was that the seventh ministerial meeting scheduled for the end of February in Male would now be held in March, which would also delay the eighth and final meeting of negotiators.  7.  (C) Even the potential sticking point of Pakistan's hesitation in granting MFN status to India did not appear to Ashok as insurmountable.  He was optimistic that if Pakistan allowed India MFN (i.e., normal trade relations) status through SAFTA, which the agreement would require, Islamabad would also grant it bilaterally.  He confirmed that during the sixth SAFTA meeting in December, the two discussed India removing textiles from their negative list, if Pakistan did so with chemicals.  While there is resistance to this move among textile industry interests in India, Ashok thought economic common sense would prevail, as it had with Sri Lanka (ref A).  He cautioned, however, that if Pakistan and Bangladesh prefer to remain \"with their heads in the sand,\" the other four SAARC members, who already enjoy fairly liberalized trade, will proceed without Islamabad and Dhaka.

(C) Summary: The elections for the Bihar State Assembly are being watched more closely than usual this year, because the outcome could possibly weaken the UPA coalition in Delhi.  A resurgent Congress is losing patience with Bihar satrap Lalu Prasad Yadav, and would like to reduce his influence in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition in New Delhi as a first step towards parting company.  During a February 10-12 trip to Bihar, Poloff heard that losses in Bihar elections by Lalu,s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will likely result in a hung assembly when votes are counted on February 27.  Such an outcome would please Congress, as it would weaken Lalu's hold on Bihar and lessen his influence in Delhi.  However, if Lalu performs reasonably well, Congress leadership may order the Bihar party to side with him, and the UPA will not be effected.  A disparate coalition is working together to oust Lalu, and for the first time in 15 years his Muslim/Yadav (farmer) vote bank looks vulnerable, although he remains personally popular.  With the UPA in power in Delhi, his traditional strategy of offering himself as the best bulwark against Hindu nationalists and possible communal violence no longer works.  Lalu,s acceptance of the post of Railway Minster appears to have been a major tactical error, because it angered a former ally who coveted the position and has since decided to run against Lalu, taking crucial Muslim and Dalit votes away from the RJD.  End Summary.  Ramifications For New Delhi ---------------------------  2.  (C) The Bihar race could impact the Congress-led government in New Delhi, by changing the make-up of the governing UPA.  Although Bihar,s opposition parties agree that they want to get rid of Lalu, he retains considerable influence because of the 26 seats he delivered to the UPA during the 2004 general elections.  If Lalu does pull out of the UPA the coalition would still have a majority in New Delhi and would not need to find new allies to maintain the government, but it would be weaker.  Sonia Gandhi and the Congress leadership view him as an \"embarrassment,\" are tired of his antics and want to see his influence diminish, according to Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) Director Prabhat Ghosh and several journalists, but it is not clear at what point Congress would drop Lalu.  If he maintains a significant portion of the Bihar vote, Congress might decide that it has no choice but to support him to maintain the UPA alliance because the party is not in a position to annoy Lalu.  Predictions -----------  3.  (C) During a recent trip to Bihar, pundits predicted to Poloff that Lalu would lose a significant number of seats in the state assembly and his wife Rabri Devi could lose the Chief Ministership, due to a fragmentation of his core Muslim/Yadav vote bank (The latter is a lower caste comprising mostly of poor farmers, of which Lalu is a member).  Ali Anwar, President of the All-India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz (a body representing Backwards Muslims and Dalits), forecast that Lalu and the RJD may only get about 70 seats in the 243-seat assembly, and then lose power.  ADRI Director Ghosh suggested that the RJD would get between 70 and 85 seats, which would also not be enough for the RJD to retain the Chief Ministership.  He speculated that the local National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Janata Dal (United) could make a bid to form the government after the elections, with former Railway Minster and leader of the JD(U) Nitish Kumar as Chief Minister.  4.  (C) Should the election result in a hung parliament, as most observers predict, the real political battle will be waged after the elections, when the job of coalition building begins.  According to Anjana Prakash, Senior Advocate at the Patna High Court, the serious political wrangling will occur in the back rooms, as the major parties position themselves to increase their influence.  She added that no one should count Lalu out, because he is most wily when cornered.  Bihar Industries Association President S.K. Mehrotra agreed, stating, &the real politics will only come out after the election is over and the results made public,8 with each party vying for a part in the ruling coalition.  The Players -----------  5.  (C) Rabri Devi is Chief Minister, but her husband Lalu Prasad Yadav rules by proxy.  In a controversial -- and many believe illegal move -- Lalu nominated his wife Devi for the position in July 1997 after he was convicted of corruption. Despite spending time in jail four times in the last 8 years on corruption charges, Lalu has ruled Bihar for 15 years, except for two short periods in 1995 (in which the NDA formed a government for seven days) and 2000 (when there was Presidents rule for two months).  During his tenure, Bihar has slipped ever deeper into poverty, crime, and corruption, to the point it is now known as the country's worst governed state and the capitol of kidnapping and extortion.  Lalu has been quoted as saying, \"any person who reads a newspaper is not my voter.\"  Various interlocutors agreed that he purposely limits development in Bihar to maintain his hold on the poor and downtrodden that vote for him.  6.  (C) Lalu remains in power because caste and religion-based politics are the most potent social and political forces in the state.  For years, he has relied on poor Muslims and Yadavs to give him an unbeatable plurality in the state Assembly.  Muslims make up 17 percent of the population, and have voted for Lalu for years to keep the BJP out of power.  Lalu plays to these fears, most recently by distributing a CD with footage of the Gujarat riots.  He also draws support from his own caste, the Yadavs, a lower caste that make up 22 percent of the population.  The Yadavs have long been victims of discrimination too, and Lalu appeals to their sense of pride in having \"one of their own\" at the top.  These two groups, known in Bihar as the MY (Muslim/Yadav) Coalition, make up 39 percent of the population, providing Lalu with a hitherto unbeatable vote bank.  The Challengers ---------------  7.  (C) Current Union Minister for Steel and Chemicals and Fertilizers and LJP Chief Ram Vilas Paswan is the second most influential candidate in the race after Lalu.  A Dalit with great influence in his community, Paswan is also popular with lower class Muslims, and could take a significant number of votes in both of these communities from Lalu and the RJD. Paswan,s LJP formerly belonged to the BJP-led NDA, but quit over the 2002 Gujarat riots.  He later joined the UPA for the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.  Paswan has become a key ally in the Congress strategy for revival in Bihar.  8.  (C) Congress ruled Bihar until 1989, but its influence has declined steadily since then.  Its recent resurgence at the national level has convinced the state leadership that it can return to power.  Leftist parties, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (CPI) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) only managed eight percent of the vote in the 2000 elections and are not expected to play a major role in the 2005 polls.  9.  (C) The BJP and JD(U) have formed an alliance to contest the Bihar polls, and have announced that state JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar would be Chief Minister if they win the election.  Our informants agreed that if a fractured mandate provided a chance to oust Lalu, Congress, the LJP and the JD (U), might well join hands to form to form the government.  10.  (C) Our interlocutors also agreed that independent candidates will, for the first time, play an important role in Bihar elections.  ADRI Member-Secretary Shaibal Gupta stated that the RJD,s success over the last 15 years has created an ever growing number of people expecting positions in the Lalu government.  When these would-be politicians were not offered RJD tickets, they expressed their discontent by running against official RJD candidates.  He added that since five or ten seats will most likely decide the race, these independents could make all the difference.  According to BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai, although Congress and the RJD have an agreement not to field candidates against each other, Lalu has tried to get around it by fielding \"independent\" candidates against Congress.  Lalu,s Weakness, in 2005 ------------------------  11.  (C) A number of issues have weakened Lalu,s hold on power in Bihar.  With the BJP no longer in power in New Delhi, it is more difficult for Lalu to scare lower class Muslims into voting for him.  Since voting behavior in Bihar is dictated primarily by religion or caste, the emergence of Paswan means that Dalit voters can now vote for one of their own rather than Lalu, ADRI's Ghosh argued.  Several observers commented that Paswan might name a Muslim as his candidate for the Chief Minister position, forcing Lalu to drop Rabri Devi and follow suit to keep his Muslim vote bank intact.  12.  (C) S.K. Mehrotra of the Bihar Industries Association stated that many people are disenchanted with Lalu because he has nothing to show for his many years in office and now, with no threat of communal violence on the horizon, voters see Congress and the LJP as real options.  Also, the dramatic increase in crime in recent years and the growing anti-incumbency sentiment has galvanized the upper castes against Lalu.  His main mistake was ambition by taking the post of Railway Minister.  Lalu thought that it would position him to become Home Minister or even Prime Minister, but instead it only spurred his challenger Paswan who coveted the position.  13.  (C) Journalist Manish Kumar from NDTV summed up the general sense that Lalu is most dangerous when backed into a corner and that his ability to play off one side against the other should not be discounted.  He concluded, \"Lalu in the opposition is a scary thought and could be even more dangerous.\"  Comment -------  14.  (C) We will not know until the final results are announced on February 27 just how much Lalu has slipped.  If he confounds the critics and manages again to win a clear victory, the status quo will continue both in Bihar and in New Delhi.  Should he do poorly, Congress can be expected to begin marginalizing him.  Even though he has stated that he will not upset the UPA coalition in New Delhi, Lalu will not hesitate to do so, if he faces a loss of power and sees a chance to exact revenge. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (S) Taking advantage of the February 8-10 visit by DOE and Department officials seeking to engage the GOI in the Regional Radiological Security Partnership (reftel), we sought more information about the impact of a hypothetical radiological attack on Mission facilities.  DCM noted that GOI support for Mission security is generally good throughout India, but pockets of insecurity around the country, instability in neighboring countries, and the ready availability of rudimentary nuclear materials in South Asia coupled with the presence of radical terrorist groups all pose security risks to the Mission.  DCM told the delegation that the Mission has evacuation plans as part of its emergency response strategy, but does not have a detailed response plan in case of a radiological attack.  Noting that both the Mission and the GOI have some radiological detection capabilities, DCM expressed interest in developing a more detailed plan in case of a radiological emergency, including training for both Mission and GOI personnel.  2.  (U) DOE provided DCM with a booklet entitled, \"A Basic Guide to RTR Radiological Materials\" and offered to provide Mission with more information about how to prepare for a radiological emergency.  3.  (S) Mission would also encourage contacts between DS and DOE to determine the feasibility of ATA funding to support training that DOE might offer to Indian authorities in dealing with the consequences of an attack in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, or Calcutta using a radiological dispersion device.

In response to the DCM's discussion with Joint Secretary for the Americas S. Jaishankar on February 14, the Ministry of External Affairs' Disarmament and International Security Affairs Division provided Embassy with a non-paper on EXBS on Wednesday, February 16.  Following is the text of the non-paper:  (Begin non-paper)  India attaches importance to its export control cooperation with the US, which is our leading partner on the subject. We see this programme of cooperation as part of the larger purpose of strengthening our national controls which would enhance the overall environment for fostering and facilitating high technology trade with the US and for forward movement on the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership.  Last year, five exchanges were held as part of the programme of cooperation on export controls. Workshops were held on nuclear export controls (March 2004), enforcement (March 2004), legal area (April 2004), automated licensing (September 2004), and train the trainers on customs enforcement (December 2004). Four of these workshops were hosted by GOI.  A further set of exchanges were agreed to following exchange of proposals and counter-proposals in September 2004.  Subsequently, India hosted the Automated Licensing Workshop on September 28-30, 2004 and the 'Train the Trainers' module on December 13-17, 2004, and agreed to host the Risk Management and Targeting Workshop. Scheduling the workshop in February/March, 2005 has been difficult, especially in view of the fact that participation from Customs field formations had been requested by the US side.  GOI wishes to convey its convenience to host the Risk Management and Targeting Workshop during 4-15 April 2005 or 9-20 May 2005. USG may also like to convey the dates for the visit of GOI officials to the US for a seminar on export controls scheduled for spring.  GOI appreciates the favourable response received from the US side on holding Industry-to-Industry contacts facilitated by the two Governments on export controls in certain specific sectors to begin with. An early finalization of further details would be appreciated.  (End non-paper)  MULFORD " }

Mulford, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  In hopes of avoiding a slowdown on key issues in the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP), MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar outlined specific matters that require resolution during a February 18 meeting with visiting SA/RA Director John Schlosser, PolCouns, and PolMilOff.  Jaishankar was optimistic that several upcoming visits can focus both governments on steps to remove current obstacles.  In a separate meeting, Department representatives at Embassy New Delhi identified several opportunities in the near-term to maintain momentum on the NSSP.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Schlosser began the February 18 meeting by outlining progress in several areas under the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) initiative recently:  the first meeting of the HTCG defense industry group on the margins of AeroIndia, positive dialogue between India's nuclear establishment and Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Merrifield, as well as a trilateral discussion between the US Department of Energy, the IAEA, and GOI on the Regional Radiological Security Partnership.  As a result of completion of Phase One, the classified PAC-2 briefing was set for February 22, proving that the quality of the dialogue between the GOI and USG has improved dramatically.  Expressing appreciation for Jaishankar's efforts to stimulate the GOI to make progress on its export control commitments in Phase Two of the NSSP, Schlosser went on to urge the GOI to provide a copy of draft export control legislation, acknowledging that this would be \"crossing the rubicon\" for the GOI to provide draft legislation to another country.  Nuclear Irritants -----------------  3.  (C) Jaishankar responded that providing this legislation has been &a harder nut to crack than we thought8 due to foot-dragging by NSSP skeptics, especially in India's Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).  &Without the support of the nuclear establishment, we're trying to drive with the brakes on,8 he quipped.  Recalling the positive response of India's nuclear establishment to NRC Merrifield's comments during his February 8-11 visit to India (reftels), Jaishankar appealed for more flexibility regarding collaboration on nuclear safety, \"not legislative changes, but greater latitude.\"  Jaishankar admitted, however, that he understands Merrifield doesn't necessarily speak for the Administration, much less for the Nuclear Suppliers Groups (NSG).  Any changes to the NSG's approach to India would require consensus among its members, Schlosser noted.  Jaishankar countered that some NSG members tell India they would be willing to support greater flexibility in interpreting NSG safety guidelines, but are constrained by the US.  Jaishankar asserted that the issue of nuclear fuel supply is particularly urgent for India.  \"If we're pushed to the wall on this, we'll have to look at options that are uncomfortable for all of us,\" Jaishankar warned.  4.  (S) Referring to outstanding nonproliferation cases, namely, two Indian scientists sanctioned for involvement in Iran's WMD program, and an older case of Russian assistance to India's ballistic missile program, Jaishankar cautioned that these encourage some in the GOI to question US commitment to partnership with India.  The GOI has offered to show copies of the scientists' passports to determine the extent of their travel to Iran, but lack of response from the US has \"soured\" some on the Indian side, according to Jaishankar.  The Joint Secretary complained that Washington has pushed opposition to any Indian cooperation with Iran to \"ridiculous heights,\" adding that New Delhi does not view Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  Jaishankar added that Washington seems not to acknowledge its double standard of assisting Pakistan, nor sanctioning it for damage done by the AQ Khan network. 5.  (S) Expressing Washington's awareness of Indian sensitivities about these cases, Schlosser pointed out that there is evidence that Russian assistance is ongoing. Further, some of these &irritants8 could be removed if India brought its export controls in line with international standards.  Any effort the GOI is making on export control cooperation with other countries, e.g., the UK, Japan, Australia, would be viewed positively by the US, Schlosser added.  Misunderstanding on Space Collaboration --------------------------------------- 6.  (C) On civil space cooperation, Jaishankar admitted there may be &genuine misunderstanding8 of the phased nature of the NSSP within the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), but there is also a perception that the US is not using existing latitude to make progress on space issues. \"Some in the US adhere to the letter ) not the spirit ) of the NSSP,\" he said, adding, \"I need some help from you to move this along.\"  Possible Progress during Upcoming Visits ----------------------------------------  7.  (C) Noting that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's brief visit to New Delhi accomplished more progress on defense sales in one day than both sides had been able to achieve in the previous months, Jaishankar was confident that upcoming visits by FM Natwar Singh to Washington in April, as well as proposed visits by A/S Rocca, and a hoped for visit by President Bush later this year will focus both sides on realistic steps to move forward.  Jaishankar will be in Washington February 28 - March 2 to learn more about the Container Security Initiative, and expressed interest in meeting with counterparts on all aspects of the NSSP, including A/S Rocca, A/S Rademaker, and new Commerce Acting U/S for Industry and Security Lichtenbaum.  Embassy Identifies Other Opportunities --------------------------------------  8.  (C) Prior to meeting with Jaishankar on February 18, Embassy representatives met to brief Schlosser about the current state-of-play on the NSSP and review upcoming opportunities to move some of these issues forward within both the GOI and USG, especially in light of upcoming high-level meetings.  It is clear from meeting with our GOI interlocutors on several fronts that GOI expectations are high for visible progress on NSSP issues during these upcoming engagements.  EmbOffs identified several immediate opportunities for progress:  -- Nuclear:  We can capitalize on Merrifield's visit to move forward on issues under NRC's purview, showing India's nuclear establishment that progress in the civil nuclear area is not a pipe dream.  GOI will likely propose an energy dialogue (to include nuclear issues as well) at the April 5 Rice-Natwar meeting.  -- Onward Proliferation:  A Rademaker-Shankar meeting in Washington could help clear the backlog of older cases.  The GOI will continue to insist on sharp distinctions between onward proliferation and \"inward\" cases such as the Russian propellant mixers and conventional weapons transfers.  It would be useful to triage our list of outstanding cases to remove those no longer of active USG concern.  -- Space:  The Indians have promised a think-piece on possibilities for space collaboration, perhaps to be delivered before the April Rice-Natwar meeting.  Firewalls within the ISRO complex are being developed, mostly because of commercial concerns within ISRO.  -- Export Controls:  We are still waiting for some GOI movement on draft legislation on export controls, especially regarding catch-all controls, intangible technology transfers, and transit and trans-shipment.  Sharing draft legislation on export controls with us would be an unprecedented step for the GOI, but as Jaishankar mentioned, this is being opposed by DAE for lack of progress on India's request for the US to demonstrate flexibility on the safety exception to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  On training, in a February 23 meeting with AC/RSS Director Gromoll and SA/RA Director Schlosser, MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar explained that difficulties in scheduling a planned customs enforcement exchange were due to personnel shifts and not to any lack of commitment to the Export Control/Border Security Program on their part.  The GOI will not be able to host the next EXBS event until April at the earliest, but if we are able to do it in the US, it could be scheduled before April.  -- High-Tech Trade Facilitation:  As recent HTCG events indicate, there is still considerable confusion among industry about how to access US high-tech goods as envisaged by the NSSP.  There could be near-term progress on biotechnology, but longer-term movement will require establishing a timeline for creating a better regulatory and implementation framework for customs and law enforcement, based on capacity-building programs and technical exchanges. We are getting encouraging signals from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry that the level of attention attached to trade facilitation under the Trade and Commerce Tracks of the Economic Dialogue has increased based on strong direction from Minister Kamal Nath to work cooperatively with the US. Commerce Secretary S.N. Menon told us on February 24 that he wants to expand cooperation on standards and expeditious clearing of high technology goods through Indian ports based on a new integrated tracking system soon to be in place (septel).  -- Missile Defense:  Tangible deliverables include the February 22 PAC-2 Gem Plus classified briefing (septel), followed by a missile defense workshop organized by the Missile Defense Agency in Hyderabad, 3-4 March.  A possible POTUS-level deliverable might induct India as part of the Defense Technology and Security Initiative (DTSI) to streamline licensing authorizations for NATO countries, Major Non-NATO Allies, Japan, Australia, and Sweden.  We should also reply favorably to the Indian request for a missile defense technical cooperation agreement.  Comment -------  9.  (C) Mil-mil engagement with India is sailing along unfettered by the legacy issues that continue to stymie progress in the nuclear and space arenas.  One could think of a strategy where rapid implementation of export control legislation and regulations by India would result in an immediate suspension of unilateral controls the US applies on exports to the Indian space program.  These programs appear to be making genuine efforts to disassociate themselves from India's ballistic missile program.  In addition, as India is desperately short of natural uranium to fuel its stable of power-producing nuclear reactors, perhaps resurrecting the August 8, 1963 \"Bilateral Agreement on Cooperation for Civilian Uses of Atomic Energy\" as it regards to the Tarapur 1 and 2 reactors, may provide avenues for the Indian nuclear and space establishments to get on board the NSSP for good.

NEW DELHI 1282       B. MUMBAI 370  Classified By: A/DCM Geoff Pyatt, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The BJP leadership is determined to disrupt Parliament when the Budget Session convenes on February 25, insisting that the agitation will not end until the UPA \"restores\" the deposed Goa government (Reftel B).  Congress plans to undercut the agitation by convening the Goa Assembly for a floor vote to confirm the new UPA government there.  No other issues (e.g. Kashmir or a government report on the 1984 Sikh riots in Delhi) are sufficiently emotive or substantive to rattle the UPA.  Should the unpredictable Laloo Prasad Yadav fare badly in the Bihar elections, he could dramatically withdraw from the UPA while Parliament is in session, plunging the government into crisis.  The BJP has also pushed its former Foreign Ministers Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha to the foreground to criticize the recent UPA initiative to establish a bus service across the LOC in Kashmir.  Congress has called a series of leadership meetings and Parliament will likely remain nervous until the announcement of poll results on February 27 puts the election issue to rest.  Crisis would be averted if Congress and Laloo bury their differences to keep him in power in Bihar, allowing MPs to turn their attention to the budget.  End Summary.  The BJP is Out For Blood ------------------------  2.  (U) The BJP leadership has orchestrated street protests and held news conferences to signal its outrage at UPA behavior in Goa, and has promised to disrupt the Budget Session of Parliament (March 23-May 13) until a BJP government is \"restored\" there.  On February 8, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leadership led an all day sit-in in New Delhi to protest the UPA's February 2 dismissal of the NDA government in Goa.  BJP President and former DPM L.K. Advani noted that, \"The question is not about the dismissal of the Goa government.  It is about the Congress' attitude towards democracy.\"  BJP General Secretary Sushma Swaraj promised that \"In a situation like this, when democracy has been murdered, the Parliament may not be able to function normally.\"  3.  (U) NDA leaders returned to the streets of New Delhi on February 16, promising not to allow Parliament to function properly until the UPA government releases the Nanavati Report on the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots to the public and punishes those responsible.  New Delhi BJP Chief Harsh Vardhan claimed that those guilty of the massacre \"continue to roam free and are holding important positions in the Government,\" accusing Congress of \"avoiding any action...in view of the alleged involvement of some of its leaders.\"  Kashmir May Also Provide an Issue ---------------------------------  4.  (U) Some within the BJP leadership have also expressed anger at the February 16 announcement of a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad (Reftel A), and the Congress leadership is bracing for nationalist criticism.  On February 17, Former NDA Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh criticized the UPA for not \"keeping India's security concerns in mind,\" noting that \"if passports and visas have been done away with, where is the need for fencing along the LOC and the deployment of security forces?\"  Pro-BJP journalist Kanchan Gupta echoed the sentiments of the party's hard-liners on February 21, claiming that \"the Government of India has virtually abdicated India's sovereignty and sovereign rights,\" Gupta described the bus agreement as, \"a sellout\" that is \"heavily loaded against India's national interests,\" as it provides tacit recognition to \"a patently illegitimate and bogus institution called the 'Government of Azad Kashmir,'\" and allows Pakistani nationals to enter India without a passport.  5.  (U) Another Pro-BJP journalist, Ajay Bose, was not certain, however, that Kashmir would provide a ready-made issue to disrupt Parliament.  He claimed in a February 22 column that \"the BJP, which has traditionally represented ultra-nationalist sentiments against a compromise on Kashmir, is now of two minds on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus.\"  He pointed out that the party leadership has been \"muted\" in its criticism, and ascribes this to the crucial role played by former PM Vajpayee in launching the peace initiative with Pakistan.  He pointed out that this \"would make it difficult for the BJP to unleash a frontal attack on the bus accord.\"  The Jharkhand/Bihar Election Issue ----------------------------------  6.  (C) The perpetually chaotic situation in Jharkhand and Bihar may also provide grist for the BJP mill.  Election results are to be released on March 27.  Exit polls and press reports suggest that no single party is likely to win a clear margin of victory in either state (Reftel A).  There are growing indicators that the assemblies could be hung, leaving the formation of the government to complicated multiparty negotiations.  This lingering uncertainty could provide the BJP with an issue, especially if the inter-party squabbling becomes particularly messy or there is an upset in either of the two states.  Given the tradition of rough politics in Jharkhand and Bihar, allegations of vote-rigging, political violence, and electoral corruption are possible.  The Economic Issues -------------------  7.  (C) FinMin Chidambaram's presentation of the federal budget to Parliament on February 28, is likely to elicit opposition from the UPA's Left allies.  Since coming to power last May, Congress has repeatedly crossed swords with its Communist allies on economic issues, and Left MPs will be highly critical.  In a February 24 meeting with PolCouns, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma described a meeting that morning in which Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh south to placate the Left parties.  Predictably, the Communist leadership attacked the GOI's moves on foreign investment, airport privatization and banking reform.  However, their greatest complaint, Sharma reported, was the UPA's tendency to deploy policies without consultation, forcing the Left parties to read about developments in the newspapers.  The UPA has promised to do better in this area.  Chidambaram has been tasked by the Congress leadership with pushing reforms while not alienating the Left.  We expect the Left to engage in vocal public opposition to market-based reforms, but ultimately allow core reform measures to go through in exchange for social spending programs -- so long as their support is tacit and not overt.  8.  (C) The interim budget adopted July 2004 aimed to relax foreign investment restrictions in the civil aviation, telecoms, and insurance sectors.  The GOI overcame Communist opposition to raise FDI in civil aviation and telecoms, but cannot raise the FDI cap on insurance without an act of Parliament.  The GOI also will likely take additional steps toward the BJP government's stated goal of aligning the tariff schedule with that of the ASEAN countries. Chidambaram wants to &rationalize8 the USD 11 billion a year that the GOI spends on subsidies for wheat, rice, fertilizer, LPG, and kerosene to free up resources for increased spending on social issues.  The Left will likely oppose these measures.  Congress Spokesman Sharma predicted a \"balanced\" budget with benefits for both Left and reformist camps.  Chidambaram reportedly plans to mollify the Left by boosting public spending on health and education, and unveiling a guaranteed rural employment program.  These issues are the heart and soul of the Common Minimum Program, the UPA's manifesto, that was hammered out by Congress and the Left last spring.  The Left realizes, however, that it cannot obtain the funding it seeks for social programs without allowing key reforms to proceed, preferably without a political debate.  A Congress View Point --------------------- 9.  (C) On February 22, Congress MP Rashid Alvi told Poloff that he was certain the BJP will disrupt parliament, that the Goa government's dismissal would be the principal cause, and that the agitation would likely end abruptly on February 28, when the Congress government in Goa will prove its majority on the floor of the Legislative Assembly.  Since Congress will likely win this floor vote, he said, the BJP will then call off the agitation and promptly get down to parliamentary business.  10.  (C) Alvi dismissed the Nanavati Commission issue as an example of poor judgment by the BJP.  According to Alvi, the BJP has not seen the report and is only bluffing when it says that the report will prove Congress involvement in the anti-Sikh rioting.  Alvi claimed that Sonia Gandhi told him that no serving Congress Ministers are named in the report, and Congress will quickly introduce it on the floor of Parliament to take the wind out of BJP sails.  11.  (C) In Jharkhand, Alvi predicted that the JMM/Congress/RJD alliance will win a clear majority, and Congress will keep the JMM happy by naming Shibu Soren Chief Minister.  However, Congress is worried about Bihar, where the BJP could engineer Laloo's ouster and come to power.  If Laloo does poorly, Ram Vilas Paswan could rejoin the NDA in exchange for becoming Chief Minister.  The BJP would then trumpet its great achievement while Parliament is in session.  Alvi pointed out, however, that since Paswan has only three MPs, his departure will have little impact outside Bihar.  12.  (C) Congress is hoping that Laloo and Paswan both fail to form the government and turn to Congress, which has already promised to install a Muslim Chief Minister.  Alvi maintained that Minister of State Shaqeel Ahmed has been selected for the post, should Congress succeed.  Alvi opined that such an outcome would solidify Congress in Bihar and could end Laloo's political career, as the Muslims and Dalits would desert him for Congress, permanently ending his election-winning caste combination, and opening the possibility that he could be dropped as Railway Minister.  13.  (C) Alvi predicted that the BJP would not raise the recent agreement to open bus service across the line of control, saying that with Vajpayee as the architect of bus diplomacy, this issue is out of bounds.  Alvi also maintained the BJP may attack the UPA over the issue of F-16 sales to Pakistan.  The BJP Insider's View ----------------------  14.  (C) On February 24, BJP National General Secretary and MP Gautam Shri Singh Priya confirmed to Poloff that his party plans to disrupt Parliament unless the UPA \"restores\" the BJP government in Goa.  Maintaining that the BJP is tired of the UPA \"undermining democracy,\" Priya noted that Goa is one of three issues that will form the heart of the BJP's disruption campaign, (the others being the budget and fallout from the assembly elections).  Priya insisted that the UPA has made too many concessions on the economy to its Communist allies, and that this is resulting in growing deficit spending and economic instability that will lead to a new election within the next year.  15.  (C) According to Priya, Bihar represents an opportunity for the BJP to make gains against the UPA, as Laloo is the coalition's Achilles' heel, and there is little damage control that Congress can implement.  Since Paswan and Laloo are sworn enemies, it will be difficult for the UPA to form the government if Laloo does not win enough seats.  If Congress and Paswan form the Bihar government without Laloo or do not pay him due deference, he could turn on Congress, and withdraw from the UPA.  Without Laloo's 24 seats, the UPA is within 12 seats of losing power.  Priya predicted that in such a scenario, Laloo would join with Uttar Pradesh's Mulayam Singh Yadav and announce the formation of a \"third front\" aimed at unseating the UPA.  In Priya's scenario, this major parliamentary shake-up can only benefit the BJP. Priya confided that the electoral situation was very fluid and that the BJP leadership was ready to accept defeat in all three states if that should be the outcome.  Noting that his was a \"cadre-based party,\" Priya insisted that it would \"bounce back\" in the next election with former PM Vajpayee as its standard-bearer.  16.  (C) Priya dismissed both Kashmir and the Nanavati Commission report as viable issues, as they \"are only temporary.\"  In Kashmir, he said, the long-term trend is in India's favor, as it has \"restored democracy.\"  The BJP sees no benefit from undermining this trend or trying to make Kashmir policy a partisan issue.  Likewise, the BJP fully expects the UPA to table the Nanavati Commission report on the opening day of Parliament, quickly putting the issue to rest.  Comment ------- 17.  (C) With its fortunes fading, the BJP is looking for issues it can use to spark a revival during the Parliament session, lest it slip deeper into irrelevancy.  The party is hoping to mount a disruptive agitation around Goa, the Kashmir bus initiative, the Nanavati Commission Report and other issues, but Congress has already devised effective counter-strategies for most of these.  The most potent political issue overhanging Parliament is the Assembly Elections in Jharkhand, Haryana, and especially Bihar. Congress insiders have described to an unusual series of high level conclaves over the past few days, suggesting that Sonia Gandhi and the rest of the party hierarchy are aware of the possible fireworks ahead.  The BJP hopes that growing anti-Laloo sentiment could cause a faultline within the UPA that it can exploit.  If this does not happen, and the UPA agrees to work with Laloo to keep him in power, the BJP could come up empty once again. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: In a carefully considered February 14 speech on New Delhi's South Asia policy, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran unveiled a more muscular approach toward India's neighborhood that reflects the GOI's shifting view of its role in the world.  Departing from the standard GOI line on the primacy of national sovereignty, the address made a clear link between bad behavior next door and the consequences for India.  As did then-Foreign Minister Sinha's September 2003 remarks on neighborhood relations, Saran laid heavy emphasis on economic integration in South Asia.  The Foreign Secretary, however, went further making democracy a  SIPDIS prerequisite for regional cooperation.  Although he declared his intention not to single out particular countries, Sri Lanka was the only neighbor to escape unscathed.  End Summary.  Democracy's the Word --------------------  2.  (U) In a departure from traditional Indian rhetoric, Saran's deliberately hyped February 14 speech highlighted the \"drift away from democratic freedoms in some countries of our neighborhood.\"  Arguing that a more democratic environment in South Asia would lead to greater regional cooperation, Saran said that although the GOI will engage with any ruling government, \"our sympathy will always be with democratic and secular forces.\"  Although India would like to see more democratic regimes in bordering countries, \"it is not something we can impose upon others,\" and is not something for New Delhi to decide.  Saran also made an explicit connection between the neighbors' internal affairs and the impact on India.  The Foreign Secretary said his country's \"destiny is inseparable from what happens in its neighborhood.\"  3.  (C) Interpreting Saran's message, MEA Joint Secretary V Ashok (SAARC) explained to PolCouns and Poloff two days after the speech on February 16, that New Delhi needs to see democracy in South Asia in \"deed, not only word.\"  India had to be clear in conveying this, because pro-democracy groups in the neighboring countries \"look to India as an example.\" Echoing Saran, Ashok concluded that there was a point beyond which \"democracy ceases to be a purely internal matter, and neighbors' problems become India's problems.\"  Drawing a real-politic explanation for Saran's Wilsonian rhetoric, Ashok argued that that lack of democracy among the neighbors would inevitably breed instability that could spill across India's borders.  Economic Cure-All -----------------  4.  (C) A prominent theme in the Foreign Secretary's remarks was that South Asia should see India as an opportunity, not as a threat, and that it was India's diplomatic challenge to convey that message.  Praising \"some neighbors\" for having developed economic cooperation with India, Saran scolded others for \"seeking to isolate themselves from India.\" Rather than see India as \"besieging\" them, they should recognize that regional economies will benefit from integration.  He pledged New Delhi's willingness to open its markets and invest in cross-border infrastructure, noting that with Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan India has accepted a non-reciprocal relationship.  But, he said during the question period, \"the hand we extend must be grasped by the neighbors.\"  The MEA's Ashok put it more bluntly, cautioning that if the rest of South Asia does not recognize the economic benefits in cooperating with India, \"India has other options such as ASEAN and the Bay of Bengal Initiative\" (BIMSTEC).  No More Mr. Nice Guy --------------------  5.  (C) Saran's presentation of India's policy towards its neighbors contrasted with the approach then-Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha laid out in a September 2003 address \"We Approach our Neighbors in a Spirit of Fraternity\" (as opposed to Saran's \"India and its Neighbors\").  Like Saran, Sinha compared South Asia unfavorably to ASEAN and the EU, emphasized the potential \"mutual economic benefit\" the region could experience, and asserted that India's commitment to SAARC was \"undiluted and undiminished.\"  6.  (C) Where the two departed was in Saran's connection of economic integration to democracy.  While Sinha never once uttered the word, Saran's speech was littered with references to democracy.  The Foreign Secretary also coupled democracy and economic development in a recipe for improved regional security, observing that South Asia does not have a shared security perception.  A year and one half earlier, Foreign Minister Sinha also requested the region's respect for India's security, asking that they \"be sensitive to our security concerns.\"  Saran made the same point more starkly, commenting that \"India cannot and will not ignore such conduct and will take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard its interests.\"  Equal Opportunity Offender --------------------------  7.  (C) Despite his declared intention not to focus on individual countries, Saran slipped in references to India's neighbors in the context of New Delhi's concerns about them. Among the Foreign Secretary's barbs were: \"India would certainly welcome more democracy in our neighborhood\" (Nepal, Bhutan); \"transit routes, which would have created...mutual benefit, have fallen prey to narrow political calculations\" (Pakistan); and \"hostile propaganda and intemperate statements\" (Bangladesh).  The only neighbor Saran praised was Sri Lanka, as a country that has \"taken advantage of India's strengths,\" and has reaped not only economic, but political benefits as well.  Comment -------  8.  (C) Clearly disturbed at recent events in Nepal and trends in Bangladesh, the Foreign Secretary was much more assertive in expressing specific displeasure with India's neighbors and in making an explicit connection between the internal developments in the region, and the impact on India than Sinha did in 2003.  Delivered to a standing-room only crowd eager to hear where India's South Asia policy was going following King Gyanendra's coup in Nepal and the cancellation of the SAARC Summit, Saran's speech fueled the criticism that New Delhi is trying to throw its weight around in the region.  India's next steps with Nepal will be the first test of a policy that simultaneously acknowledges the need to work with whichever regimes are present next door, while insisting on democracy.  This new missionary current reflects an important departure from an Indian political consensus that traditionally has been strong on democracy at home, but completely agnostic about the character of governance among India's relationships abroad.  How seriously this new doctrine is applied, will tell us much about India's changing view of its international role and New Delhi's willingness to jettison the third-world view that guided past GOI foreign policy.

(C) Summary: Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's February 16-18 visit to India yielded \"nothing major,\" according to the UK High Commission, and was distinctly low key compared to earlier stops in Kabul and Islamabad.  Straw signed two immigration/law enforcement agreements, and discussed Indo-Pak, Nepal, Bangladesh, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Iran, UNSC reform and the July G-8 Summit.  Surprisingly, Straw did not raise Iraq.  The timing of his visit, in advance of expected elections in the UK later this year, led to speculation that he may have had his own constituency in mind as much as UK-India relations.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Reviewing the visit, UK High Commission Poloff told us February 23 that Straw seems to have viewed his New Delhi stop as something of a break after demanding visits in Kabul and Islamabad.  UK PolCouns agreed that New Delhi was a low-intensity breather after more substantial visits earlier in the trip.  Straw several times reminded audiences that he had honeymooned in India, and was clearly more at ease with his Indian interlocutors than he had been at previous stops, according to our High Commission contacts.  3.  (C) During his New Delhi visit, Straw met with External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh, National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan, Home Minister Shivraj Patil, and BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and L. K. Advani.  The latter meeting was intended in particular to defuse BJP criticism of the breakthrough Indo-Pak agreement for bus service in Kashmir. UK Poloff remarked that both the GOI and opposition figures were largely in harmony on the Indian policies toward Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.  4.  (C) One area of substance during Straw's visit was the agreement signed for prisoner transfers between the two nations, and the renewal of a memorandum of understanding on the return of illegitimate asylum seekers to India.  The slow documentation of Indian nationals prior to repatriation has been an irritant, and the February agreement renewed an MOU signed during Home Minister David Blunkett's 2004 visit. Although the agreements garnered positive press coverage, UK PolCouns hinted that they were aimed mainly at addressing anti-immigrant sentiment in Britain during election season, and would have little practical impact since implementation problems persist.  Indo-Pak Relationship and Kashmir ---------------------------------  5.  (C) Straw congratulated Foreign Minister Singh on the progress in relations between India and Pakistan. UK Poloff commented that the Straw visit came at a good time in Indo-Pak relationships, with little substantive discussion other than expressions of encouragement at the positive direction of confidence-building measures.  BJP former Foreign Minister Sinha was predictably critical of recent GOI policies, pointing out the potential for infiltration of militants into Indian Kashmir through the recently announced Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.  The High Commission reported that Straw found the general agreement with GOI policy among opposition politicians to be encouraging. During discussions with Straw on Kashmir, Home Minister Patil gave \"the answer you'd expect,\" namely that India was ready to hold talks with anybody.  Straw encouraged Patil to restart the dialogue with the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference, and also raised the subject of human rights in Kashmir.  Patil's response, according to the High Commission, was that human rights violations are down in Kashmir, and there are appropriate state and national human rights commissions to look into violations.  NSA Narayanan lobbied Straw to alter the Foreign Office's travel advisory to UK citizens warning them against travel to Jammu and Kashmir, and Straw agreed to look into that issue.  Nepal - Consultations, but how much coordination? --------------------------------------------- ----  6.  (C) The High Commission told us that both the UK and Indian side were interested in discussing the situation in Nepal, although the FCO did not want to heighten pressure on Kathmandu at this stage.  Straw and Singh agreed in their analysis of what had happened in Nepal, but they did not get into detail of what will come next.  UK Poloff told us that her impression of the discussion was that India is hoping that its levers (for example, suspension of military aid) will have a quick effect.  However, our High Commission contacts were not convinced that India knows what it will do if the King does not respond to these levers.  Foreign Minister Singh appeared to be very keen on maintaining consultations with the UK on Nepal.  Afghanistan and Iran --------------------  7.  (C) Arriving in New Delhi after Kabul, Straw offered thanks to India for its assistance to the government of Afghanistan.  The High Commission noted that Singh had responded positively to Straw's encouragement that India assist Afghanistan in the area of counter-narcotics, but pointed out that the UK had attempted to engage the GOI in counter-narcotics before, and had discovered that while in principle the MEA may favor attempts to combat the narcotics trade, in practice \"they aren't going anywhere.\"  When the conversation turned to Iran, Straw emphasized that India must push Tehran to cooperate with the EU-3 on its nuclear programs.  The Indian officials' response to Straw's exhortation was that they have given the message to Iran that Iran should cooperate in the talks with the EU-3 and IAEA. The High Commission stated that the UK feels that India has so far been helpful on the Iran matter.  More consultations on Bangladesh --------------------------------  8.  (C) The British reported that Singh was very keen to discuss Bangladesh with Straw, and noted that India gave a presentation on the \"terrorist threat\" coming from Bangladesh.  Straw made the point to Singh that the stability of the political system of Bangladesh is a wider issue than cross-border terrorism alone.  Singh and Straw agreed to consult further on issues involving Bangladesh.  India pushes its positions on international organizations --------------------------------------------- ------------  9.  (C) Singh confirmed to Straw that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will attend the July G-8 Summit at Gleneagles.  Indian interlocutors pushed the GOI's desire for a permanent seat on the UNSC, and Jack Straw's blunt answer at a press conference that India needed to recognize the realistic options for UNSC reform ruffled local feathers.  However, our UK contacts noted that Straw's remarks did not get the same outraged press coverage that attended Vladimir Putin's similar remarks in December.  10.  (C) British officers in New Delhi were disappointed that Straw did not engage Indian interlocutors on Iraq.  Comment -------  11.  (C) Unlike Straw's earlier visits, several of which came in the white heat of Indo-Pak crisis diplomacy, this trip had the feeling of a valedictory tour.  Predictably, there was much speculation here that domestic UK politics were driving Straw's visit (he told a TV interviewer that his constituency includes over 45,000 persons of South Asian descent).  That impression was reinforced by the Foreign Secretary's extensive tour of Indian Punjab.  His comments during the visit illustrated again how important South Asia is in his consciousness, and in public remarks he several times referred to his 2002 crisis diplomacy with Secretary Powell. Aside from the consular-related agreements, there were no deliverables, but Straw's discussions with senior GOI officials on regional and global foreign policy issues illustrate how the UK-GOI \"strategic dialogue\" is intensifying.

NEW DELHI 1282      B. ISLAMABAD 2264      C. NEW DELHI 1113  Classified By: A/DCM Geoff Pyatt for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The Indian government recently offered new evidence of its benign intentions for the Baglihar hydel project by noting that, if its dam were used to inundate Pakistan, one of its own existing downriver projects would be the first casualty.  Although the MEA continues to exude confidence the Baglihar project complies with India's treaty obligations, the GOI has been curiously unwilling to share with us any supporting evidence to prove their position. This is in stark contrast to the Pakistanis, who have begun a major public relations effort here.  Meanwhile, the Baglihar issue continues to move slowly on three fronts: its construction, direct discussions between Indian and Pakistani officials, and the dispute resolution process under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) umbrella.  The World Bank's IWT obligations are not as simple or straightforward as some commentators had originally suggested.  The new item in this mix is a handful of other planned hydel projects in J&K, some of which may conflict with proposed Pakistani projects.  The GOI may have to brace itself for more treaty challenges, although both sides continue to respect the IWT and seem content to let the World Bank take the lead in resolving the issue.  End Summary.  GOI: Salal Dam Guarantees Good Behavior on Baglihar --------------------------------------------- ------  2.  (C) In a little noticed February 16 remark, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran provided further insight into why the  SIPDIS GOI believes it is right on Baglihar, commenting that if India \"had any intention of either flooding Pakistan or denying water to Pakistan, the first installation that would disappear would be the Salal project,\" which is downriver on the Chenab from the Baglihar site.  Calling the 400 MW Salal project \"very important to India and the state of J&K,\" he said it was unrealistic to think that New Delhi would \"harm itself in order to have the capability to hurt Pakistan.\" Saran concluded that the IWT was signed precisely to prevent such suspicions.  Opaque GOI, Active GOP ----------------------  3.  (C) Our repeated attempts to obtain India's views on Pakistan's January 18 World Bank petition have met with stonewalling from the GOI.  The Indian Water Secretary cancelled a meeting with the DCM, and the Indian Indus Water Commissioner continues to deflect calls to the MEA.  In contrast, the Pakistani High Commission sent us an eight-page fact sheet outlining their view of how the issue has evolved since New Delhi first informed Islamabad of its intentions to build the project in 1992.  Baglihar Construction Proceeding ... ------------------------------------  4.  (C) According to the Indian press, work on Baglihar is accelerating, with the first of two 450 MW phases expected to be completed in early 2006 and the second in the 2007-8 timeframe.  New Delhi continues to brush aside Islamabad's calls to halt construction of the project -- slated to be the largest power generator in J&K -- until after the IWT process is complete.  MEA Joint Secretary Arun K. Singh has repeatedly pointed out that it put the Tulbul Navigation Project/Wullar Barrage on hold in 1987, and subsequent GOP unwillingness negotiate essentially killed it.  Eight rounds of bilateral talks since then have produced no results.  ... As are the IWT Process and Direct Talks -------------------------------------------  5.  (C) The Pakistani High Commission on February 23 pointed out to us that Islamabad offered to continue bilateral discussions while the IWT process continues -- and the issue was discussed during Natwar Singh's recent trip to Pakistan (Refs A and B) -- but the GOP would not put the dispute resolution process on hold because of its fear of being faced with a fait accompli, saying \"the Indians continue to build, we will continue with the World Bank.\"  World Bank Clarifies Its Role -----------------------------  6.  (C) According to the text of the IWT, the Bank is not a \"guarantor\" of the Treaty, but it does have ongoing responsibilities.  On issues that the two governments cannot resolve bilaterally, the Bank is to appoint a \"neutral expert\" (vice mediator or arbitrator) to try to adjudicate the \"differences.\"  The Bank is to consult both parties in selecting the neutral expert and it would also manage the trust fund to cover the expert's expenses.  7.  (C) If differences go beyond the expert's mandate of determining treaty compliance, the Bank would then help to establish an arbitration board to address what would be termed \"the dispute.\"  According to the IWT, the World Bank President and other eminent individuals (such as the UN Secretary-General and the Chief Justices of the US and UK)  SIPDIS would be asked to select three members of a seven-member independent arbitration court, with New Delhi and Islamabad each appointing two representatives of their own. Separately, a World Bank official in New Delhi told D/PolCouns recently that this would be the first test of the IWT and that Pakistan \"seems to have taken all the necessary steps\" to initiate the dispute resolution process.  The Bank official commented that despite the confidence we have seen among our GOI interlocutors, \"India may not want to be so bold.\"  Kishanganga/Neelum Dam on the Table ... ---------------------------------------  8.  (C) Meeting on February 10-14 in New Delhi, Indian and Pakistani Indus Water Commissioners discussed GOP technical concerns regarding the height and water diversion of another proposed dam on the Kishanganga (also called Neelum) River; although this represented an extension of the scheduled two-day meeting, the only outcome was an agreement to continue the dialogue.  FM Natwar Singh also discussed the issue during his February 15-17 Islamabad trip (Refs A and B).  Compared to Baglihar, however, the GOI would reportedly have difficulty presenting the GOP with a fait accompli, as the Kishanganga work site is snowed in between November and May, which allows more than two more months of negotiations before construction could resume.  The GOI would presumably want to complete Kishanganga before Pakistan can begin work on its own 969 MW Neelum-Jhellum Dam Project, because if the Pakistani dam is built first, IWT provisions appear to protect the downstream Pakistani project from upstream Indian diversions or ponding.  ... And Several Projects are On the Drawing Board --------------------------------------------- ----  9.  (C) Our World Bank contact added that even if India and Pakistan could resolve the Baglihar and Kishanganga projects, there are several more hydroelectric dams planned for Indian Kashmir that might be questioned under the IWT.  He ticked off the recently begun Dul Hasti Dam, and the proposed Burser, Pakul Dul, and Sawalkote projects -- all on the order of 1000 MW -- as significant undertakings in varying stages of planning that might be questioned as to their IWT compliance.  Comment ------- 10.  (C) GOI reluctance to discuss Baglihar and other power projects may reflect their supreme confidence, or perhaps concern that their case is not as firmly grounded as they have led us to believe.  The new item is the potential for the Dul Hasti, Burser, Pakul Dul, and Sawalkote hydel projects to exacerbate Pakistani anxiety over access to water.  As a Pakistani diplomat recently commented to us, \"There are no doves and there are no moderates on water issues.\"  The GOI, in its desire to produce power for J&K that fulfills the economic aspirations of Kashmiris and demonstrates the effectiveness of the elected government, may not fully appreciate -- or may simply not care about -- Pakistani concerns.  The saving grace in this politically charged impasse is the IWT.  India and Pakistan seem content to have the World Bank take the lead in resolving this issue, which should seriously reduce the likelihood of Islamabad's worst case scenario, that India's dams in J&K have the potential to destroy the peace process or even to lead to war (Ref B).

(C) Summary:  Meeting on 23 February, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar and DSCA Director for Middle East, Asia and North Africa Ed Ross agreed that a large cooperative defense program, such as a P-3 or C-130 sale, would build trust and demonstrate US reliability as a defense supplier. Jaishankar warned that the IAF cannot continue extending the deadline for a US response on the multi-role fighter RFI without appearing to give an unfair competitive advantage to US contractors.  He was favorably inclined to our proposals to post a security cooperation liaison officer at the Indian Embassy in Washington, and possibly a military liaison to PACOM, as well as to enter into a bilateral dialogue on the US Quadrennial Defense Review.  Finally, Jaishankar reiterated concerns about how US policy and Indian perceptions are affecting progress on the NSSP.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Opening this February 23 discussion, Jaishankar proposed a customer-oriented defense cooperation approach in which India and the US look closely at India's problems and requirements, and see where the US can provide the most assistance.  He made the following additional points in relation to security cooperation:  - Both governments must attack the presumption that the USG and GOI cannot do business together; - The Tsunami relief effort demonstrated \"operational comfort\" between the two countries; - Raising the relationship to a new level will require both governments to go into new areas; - Not everything will work out, but some things will, so the relationship is worth pursuing; - There was a palpable keenness to do business at the recent Aero-India international airshow; i.e. the US aerospace industry wants to be in the Indian market; - There is residual frustration over problems procuring US parts for Sea King and Sea Harrier aircraft, resulting from the 1998 sanctions; - The Indian military is aware that, in spite of past concerns about US \"reliability,\" they should do a risk evaluation and move forward; and - From a policy standpoint, Jaishankar will recommend to the MOD that the time to move forward is now.  3.  (U) Ross agreed with Jaishankar's overall approach, and asserted that a major US-India project will cause the pace of the bilateral relationship to pick up substantially, and will help both countries' bureaucracies to mesh.  He also affirmed:  - There is no inherent incompatibility between USG and GOI bureaucracies; - Only time and effort will help the systems adjust to each other; and - DSCA is looking for an opportunity to collaborate on a very specific program to build trust and demonstrate commitment.  Multi-role Fighter RFI ----------------------  4.  (C) To Jaishankar's query about a US response to the Indian Air Force RFI for procurement of 126 multi-role fighters, Ross replied that while he could not give a specific date, the USG was treating the request very seriously and needed \"a little more time.\"  Jaishankar acknowledged his recent phone conversation with Peter Flory, OSD PDASD (ISA), informing him that the Ross delegation would not have a definitive response to the RFI, and would request additional time.  Jaishankar said MEA's recommendation to the MOD was to be as flexible as possible in allowing more time for the US response.  However, he was clear that with answers already received from other suppliers, the GOI could not extend the RFI deadline much longer without appearing to give an unfair competitive advantage to US contractors.  GOI Defense Cooperation Liaisons -------------------------------- 5.  (C) Ross recommended that the GOI post a security cooperation liaison at the Indian Embassy in Washington to interact with DSCA, the US military, and other USG agencies involved in security cooperation (similar to a DoD Office of Defense Cooperation).  Explaining the advantages of having a GOI officer in the US intimately familiar with FMS and export licensing procedures, who can contact the right people to answer questions from New Delhi, Ross suggested that the best time to appoint such a person is before a major defense cooperation project gets under way.  Jaishankar expressed interest, adding that he would work with the US Embassy on a job description.  6.  (C) In response to Jaishankar's question on whether other countries have liaisons to US commands such as PACOM, USD member Jim Alverson, OSD/ISA India desk officer, explained that some countries do, and that PACOM had expressed interest in a Liaison Officer from India.  Jaishankar said he had heard various people make a case for it, and thought India should consider the idea.  Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Dialogue -----------------------------------------  7.  (C) OSD/ISA's Alverson conveyed an OSD proposal for dialogue with the GOI that would inform DoD's work on its next QDR.  He explained that DoD wanted to solicit ideas and viewpoints from a very small number of allies and partners, and wanted India included in this effort.  Jaishankar called the proposal a \"splendid idea\" that could not have come at a better time.  MEA Concerns on the NSSP ------------------------  8.  (C) Jaishankar also went over previously expressed concerns related to the NSSP process.  The first involved October 2004 USG sanctions against two Indian scientists in \"a very public way\" with \"very little proof,\" over alleged technology transfers to Iran.  Though he considered it an \"aberration\" in US-GOI coordination, Jaishankar claimed this incident embarrassed him personally.  Specifically, he did not understand why State Department officials could contact him personally for a \"favor\" regarding an imminent IAEA meeting on Iran, while hours later he had to find out about sanctions from the Federal Register.  9.  (C) While Jaishankar understood our concern about WMD-related technology transfers to Iran, he stressed that if US policy is expanded to say India can not \"sell a screwdriver\" to Iran without being sanctioned, \"we have a problem.\"  10.  (C) Jaishankar's final worry involved the Indian Department of Atomic Energy's (DAE's) \"very weak\" enthusiasm for the NSSP's civil nuclear component.  While he did not elaborate in this setting, he was concerned that the GOI needs DAE support to maintain momentum on the NSSP.  He expressed hope that the US would look for NSSP areas that can be interpreted generously enough for DAE to feel like there is something in it for them.  11.  (U) Mr. Ross and Mr. Alverson cleared this message. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: King Gyanendra's actions are \"exactly opposite of what is required,\" Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran told visiting Ambassador to Nepal James Moriarty on February 25.  Ambassador Moriarty and Saran agreed on the need for concerted pressure on the King from India, the US, and the UK.  Saran did not object to Ambassador Moriarty's comment that although the US plans to withhold the delivery of weapons until there is improvement in the political situation, non-lethal aid and military training would likely continue.  Saran took a very tough line on the King, expressing pessimism about Gyanendra's ability to make the right moves, and agreed on the need for milestones that would demonstrate that the King is moving in the right direction. Saran also agreed to re-engage the government of Bhutan regarding the ongoing effort to repatriate Bhutanese refugees in camps in Nepal.  End Summary.  2.  (C) Stopping in New Delhi en route to Kathmandu following consultations in Washington, Ambassador Moriarty, accompanied by PolCouns and Poloff, called on Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran to discuss Indian and US views on the re-establishment of democracy in Nepal.  Throughout the meeting, Saran expressed great suspicion of King Gyanendra's motives and the King's willingness to take steps that would lead to restoration of democracy in Nepal.  Saran stated that while the King may \"say the right things\" in his statements, it was clear from his actions (e.g., his appointment of convinced monarchist Tulsi Giri as vice-chairman of the council of ministers) that he does not believe in multi-party democracy.  Maoists and Military Aid ------------------------  3.  (C) Saran expressed his belief that the King seeks to restore an absolute monarchy and does not understand how to defeat the Maoist insurgency.  He said that the US, India and the King have a strong interest in preventing a Maoist takeover in Nepal, but the King's actions undermine that goal.  If the King's actions ultimately led to stability and a Maoist defeat, the setbacks to democracy might be palatable to India, he opined.  However, the February 1 dismissal of the government was \"exactly opposite of what is required.\" Saran reiterated that the King had restrained the RNA from taking the fight to the Maoists prior to February 1 and that the dismissal of the government had not reversed that.  In fact, stated Saran, the King's actions had necessitated further retrenchment of the RNA into the Kathmandu Valley, abandoning the field to the Maoists elsewhere.  (Note: Embassy Kathmandu will coordinate with the Indian Embassy to check on this allegation.  End note.)  Much of Nepal outside the Valley was now \"on autopilot,\" with no government presence, he asserted.  4.  (C) Saran referred to the suspension of military aid by the UK and India as a much-needed \"jolt\" to bring the King back on the right track.  He admitted that suspension was the only lever available, and hoped that the US and UK would be supportive.  He noted that the announced suspensions left a gap in RNA supplies, but if the King felt there was even a \"hint\" that the RNA could fill that gap from other sources, then pressure would dissipate.  Saran did not see a risk of imminent military collapse.  Ambassador Moriarty informed Saran that the next anticipated US provision of lethal assistance would be the expected May delivery of 3,000 M-16 rifles, adding that if the King does not take steps to restore democracy by then, this consignment would be unlikely to proceed.  However, non-lethal military aid and training (in particular JCETS training of the RNA Ranger units) are scheduled for March and April, and would probably be provided as planned.  Ambassador Moriarty underlined that no final US decision has been taken in this regard.  Saran did not respond to the news that US military training, like India's, would probably continue.  Working with the King and the Parties -------------------------------------  5.  (C) In response to Ambassador Moriarty's presentation of the steps that the King must take to show seriousness about restoring democracy (release of political detainees; restoration of most if not all of the constitutional freedoms; reaching out to the political parties to participate in the government), Saran agreed that the US and India should press the King.  However, the Foreign Secretary remained convinced that the King's goal was to consolidate his position as an absolute monarch.  Saran noted that the King's situation had become \"very bad,\" with even the initial popular support for his moves fading as production, food supplies, and even government customs revenues have been curtailed as a result of Maoist-initiated road closures.  6.  (C) Saran agreed that the King realizes that his seizure of power was not as easy as he had initially thought, and he might respond to pressure.  The Foreign Secretary noted signs of \"desperation\" in the King's latest statements, and speculated that this might, if true, allow India and the US to work with him.  He highlighted the importance of leaving a way out for the King that would not humiliate him, adding that India had been careful not to attack the King personally for this reason.  7.  (C) Ambassador Moriarty cautioned the GOI that creating a \"democracy movement in exile\" from the second-tier party activists who have moved to New Delhi could backfire: these individuals had relatively little clout inside Nepal and any assistance to them by the GOI would make most Nepalis suspect their motives.  Acknowledging that the MEA has been in contact with these politicians, Saran stated that there was little danger of allowing them too much influence, as it was clear that the party leaders in Nepal would resume their roles upon being released.  He speculated that continued shutting out the parties from political life would cause them to give up on a compromise with the King and fall in with the Maoists.  He agreed on the necessity to maintain pressure on the Maoists to force them to realize that they will not achieve a Maoist state, and asserted that a united front of the parties with the monarchy is essential to maintaining that pressure.  Bhutanese Refugees ------------------  8.  (C) Saran agreed that the signs of progress on repatriation of Bhutanese refugees achieved during the October 2004 visit of PRM A/S Dewey were frozen due to the crisis in Nepal.  He suggested that the GOI could speak to the Bhutanese about their willingness to continue identifying and repatriating the refugees.  Saran worried that if the Bhutanese heard about a concrete proposal to resettle refugees abroad, the RGOB would refuse to take any back.  He felt it was most important to focus on repatriation of Category 1 refugees to get momentum going.  Comment -------  9.  (C) We were struck by Saran's deep pessimism about the King's willingness to make good-faith efforts to restore democracy, which may reflect a sense of betrayal by the Palace.  His exasperation may result to a considerable extent from India's multiple unheeded warnings to the King not to take this step.  That said, when pressed, Saran was willing to acknowledge that continued concerted efforts by the GOI and USG might help convince the King to move in the right direction.  10.  (U) Notable also was the positive local media coverage of Ambassador Moriarty's visit, which focused on the close coordination between the USG and GOI, and Ambassador Mulford's comments to the press that India had a leading role in responding to the Nepal crisis.  11.  (U) Ambassador Moriarty has cleared this message. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 1304       B. NEW DELHI 796      C. CALCUTTA 72  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Despite a decisive victory in Haryana, Congress and its United Progressive Alliance (UPA) allies have emerged chastened by the elections in Jharkhand, and Bihar.  Although the Jharkhand/Bihar outcome has given the BJP and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners a new lease on life, the UPA is still securely in place in New Delhi.  In Jharkhand and Bihar Congress pulled defeat from the jaws of victory, and let over-confidence, and infighting get the best of it.  Congress also revealed itself to be less competent at managing regional alliances than the BJP.  Bihar regional satrap Laloo Prasad Yadav is the big loser in this process, although he is down but not out, and will fight on. Over the long term, Congress will be more comfortable with a chastened and more humble Laloo who is unlikely to challenge the UPA.  The bright spot for Congress is Haryana, where it scored a clear victory.  The BJP is likely to form the government in Jharkhand in a matter of days.  The situation in Bihar remains murky, with the most likely outcome being a period of President's rule followed by a UPA coalition government.  Congress, now must focus on cementing its UPA alliance and facing a revived NDA, and will likely be more cautious and less inclined to take dramatic economic and foreign policy initiatives.  End Summary.  The UPA Falls Short in Bihar ----------------------------  2.  (C) Congress arrogance and inability to stem infighting amongst its allies cost it a chance to score a three state sweep against its NDA opponents in recently concluded elections in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana.  Instead, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, Congress provided a much-needed shot in the arm to the BJP and its NDA alliance, which has been in a downward spiral since the 2004 elections.  Congress has proved less adept than the BJP at managing coalition politics, and has paid a heavy price.  In Bihar, divisiveness among UPA allies at the state level resulted in a hopelessly hung assembly, with no party or coalition in a position to form the government.  3.  (SBU) In Bihar, Laloo's weakness and that of his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was already quite apparent (Ref A).  Not only did he fail to keep his winning caste combination (Yadavs and Muslims) together, he needlessly antagonized Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan by taking the Railways portfolio in the national cabinet for himself.  As a result, Paswan announced his intention to depose Laloo and his willingness to work with practically anyone to establish a non-RJD government.  For the first time in many years, Bihar's Dalits had a clear choice and many of them voted for one of their own, giving 30 seats to Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).  Instead of trying to maintain unity, Congress saw an opening to humble Laloo and to distance itself from one of its tainted ministers.  The result was a three-sided contest, with voters choosing between Congress/LJP, RJD, and the NDA.  4.  (U) There was no \"Congress wave\" in Bihar.  As a party, it won only 10 seats, two less than it had before.  The RJD (73 seats) and its Communist allies control 77 seats, far short of a majority in the 243 seat house.  The BJP, like Congress, merely held its own with 39 seats, while its Janata Dal United ally won 54, for a total of 93.  This leaves no party in a position to form the government.  ...And Cripples Itself in Jharkhand -----------------------------------  5.  (C) Congress repeated the same pattern in Jharkhand, where it chose to ally with Coal Minister and tribal leader Shibu Soren and his JMM and to the exclusion of those parties needed to win.  UPA candidates undercut each other in crucial contests, handing unexpected victories to the BJP, with Laloo accusing Soren of having \"destroyed the whole scene,\" by allying with Congress against him.  Soren's blatant nepotism also alienated his supporters, resulting in the defeat of both of his sons, and reducing the JMM to only 17 seats in an 81 seat assembly.  Congress won only nine seats, meaning that the combined Congress/JMM total of 26 seats is far short of the required 41.  6.  (C) The BJP victory was not a result of its sterling record in Jharkhand.  Its performance as the state government incumbent has been lackluster, especially in the crucial area of economic development, and there was no undercurrent of BJP support in the state.  Instead, the divided UPA presented such an unattractive picture that many votes went to the BJP by default.  In other cases, the UPA votes were split, handing a de-facto victory to the NDA candidate.  Haryana: Congress Bright Spot -----------------------------  7.  (C) Haryana was the Congress bright spot, in that it won a clear two thirds majority of 67 seats in a house of 90, while reducing its regional opponents the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) to only 9 seats.  The BJP contested all 90 seats and won only two.  In Haryana the BJP demonstrated that without a regional ally it could not be a viable party, while the INLD was a spent force that had alienated its supporters with heavyhandedness, nepotism, and corruption (Ref B).  Congress Views --------------  8.  (C) Jaipal Reddy, Congress Minister for Information and Broadcasting, told us that the Jharkhand and Bihar elections were a \"debacle for the UPA,\" blaming them on \"our own bickerings.\"  He confided that the UPA did not have a well thought-out strategy in either state, and it was handled badly by \"some of our overzealous leaders.\"  Reddy insisted that there was still a chance that the UPA could form the government in Jharkhand, as \"the governor is our man,\" and confirmed that substantive talks with Paswan over the fate of Bihar will not start until March 1 or 2.  Reddy claimed that the elections would have no ill-effects on the national coalition and could even strengthen the Congress position within the UPA, as \"Laloo will be a subdued man now.\" Congress MP Rashid Alvi called the Jharkhand and Bihar outcomes \"big lessons\" for Congress, which must retain a \"united face\" or \"face the return of the NDA.\"  The BJP View ------------  9.  (C)  In a February 28 conversation, R. Ramakrishna of the BJP Election Cell, confirmed that the BJP and JD(U) would stake a claim on forming the government in Bihar, although the election outcome was a disappointment for the BJP, in that it had hoped to win over 100 seats in Bihar. Ramakrishna insisted that the party remained confident of forming the government and the BJP is actively recruiting \"seven or eight independents.\"  In Jharkhand, the BJP legislators will meet on March 1 to select a candidate for Chief Minister.  He did not think that the election would have a serious impact on the UPA government in New Delhi over the short term, and could only cause problems if Sonia Gandhi failed to resolve the tension between Laloo and Paswan.  Other Pundits Comment ---------------------  10.  (C) D. Raja, the National Secretary of the CPI pointed out that this election was a serious wake-up call for the \"secular parties\" in that they must follow \"coalition norms\" or face a growing challenge from a revived NDA, and called for UPA parties to stop fighting among themselves.   Veteran journalist Zafar Agha claimed that Sonia Gandhi was working to engineer a face-saving formula to keep Bihar in UPA hands, which calls for Laloo to resign as Railway Minister and hand the portfolio over to Paswan.  In return, Paswan is to accept Laloo as Bihar Chief Minister.  Agha said the UPA needed to cultivate coalition allies with a clean image and not to name \"tainted Ministers\" such as Laloo to the Cabinet.  \"Hindu\" editor Harish Khare asserted that the Communists have also been humbled in this election, as they now see a new need for \"secular\" parties to unite and confront a revived BJP.  Winners and Losers ------------------  11.  (C) The biggest loser in the election was Laloo, who has been weakened and no longer has the nationwide political clout that he had before the election.  Although he continues to protest that he can form the government in Bihar, his wife Rabri Devi submitted her resignation as Chief Minister on February 28 and he does not have the required numbers.  The biggest winner in Bihar is Ram Vilas Paswan, the kingmaker for the government there, who is also a UPA Minister.  At present, he remains determined not to join any government with the BJP or the RJD and insists he is prepared for a period of President's Rule (Under the Indian Constitution, the Governor may dismiss the government and rule the state when no clear winner emerges from an election).  12.  (C) Rather than accede to these demands, Mrs. Gandhi could decide to allow a protracted period of President's Rule.  In November 2004, she installed Congress war-horse Buta Singh as governor, and with him at the helm in the state, Congress would have its own administration in place for up to one year.  This scenario would provide Congress with a chance to tackle some of Bihar's intractable problems of governance and demonstrate competence, positioning the party to win on its own in the next state elections.  13.  (C) Coal Minister Shibu Soren is also a major loser, in that he failed to deliver Jharkhand for the UPA and failed to achieve his goal of becoming Chief Minister.  Only five seats short of forming the Jharkhand government, the incumbent BJP/JD(U) is confident of recruiting enough independents to put it over the top.  It will have to pay a price, however, most likely ministerial berths for those independents who sign on.  Shibu Soren's alienated deputy who ran against the JMM as an independent and won, is among those independents most likely to join the NDA.  Congen Calcutta reports that the BJP is also looking to replace Chief Minister Arjun Munda, whose performance has been mediocre at best, with Babulal Marandi, who was Jharkhand's first Chief Minister after the state was created.  The UPA seems resigned to defeat and has all but conceded that the BJP will stay on.  14.  (C) Congress is a clear winner in Haryana, but there are no less than nine contenders for the Chief Ministership.  The Congress Assembly Party meets March 1 to select the next Chief Minister, but most acknowledge that the legislators will only rubber-stamp Sonia Gandhi's choice.  The front-runner is three-time Chief Minister Bhajan Lal, who controls the biggest block of legislators.  Sonia has said that she would prefer younger blood and reserves the option to select a youthful candidate.  One big winner is Haryana Congress politician Randeep Surjewala, who defeated Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala in his own constituency. Surjewala has been thrust into national prominence and is among the contenders for Chief Minister, or State Party President and is set for a long and successful political career.  The Immediate Future --------------------  15.  (C) Sonia Gandhi has called Paswan to New Delhi to convince him to join with Laloo and Congress to establish a \"secular\" government in Bihar.  While Paswan could well accede to her wishes, he would demand a heavy price, to include a Chief Minister not from the RJD or Laloo's family, and that Laloo step down as Railway Minister in New Delhi, and give the portfolio to Paswan.  The arrangement would also likely include a Deputy Chief Minister from the LJP who is hand-picked by Paswan.  A humbled Laloo may have no choice but to accept such an arrangement, lick his wounds and live to fight another day.  The BJP will also try to woo Paswan, offering him the post of Chief Minister in a coalition government.  As a Dalit leader who depends on Muslim backing, it would be very difficult for Paswan to accept such an offer.  The BJP/JD(U) will fall short without Paswan.  Long-term Implications ----------------------  16.  (C) This election has revived the rapidly-declining fortunes of the BJP, which has demonstrated that it can hold onto power in Jharkhand, humiliate Laloo on his home turf, and retain a base of support in the Hindi belt.  Despite its clear victory in Haryana, Congress has been sobered.  This election has ended its winning streak and its plans to extend its control over new states and further relegate the BJP to irrelevancy.  Congress will now have to re-examine its relations with the regional parties and devise ways to better manage regional alliances in future contests.  17.  (C) While a setback for Congress, this election is certainly not life-threatening.  The UPA remains firmly in power in New Delhi and the NDA is in no position to unseat it.  At a time when many were predicting a break up of the NDA, the BJP and its allies have won a new lease on life and have regained some confidence, but remain weak.  Congress picked up the state of Haryana, the BJP will in all likelihood retain power in Jharkhand, and Bihar is headed for a period of President's rule.  In the end, Paswan is likely to be true to his caste loyalties and pragmatic instincts and patch together a UPA government in Bihar.  This means that at the end of the day, Haryana will have changed hands, while Jharkhand and Bihar remain where they were.  18.  (C)  While Congress is now chastened, it could eventually conclude that it successfully humbled Laloo and removed his wife as Chief Minister.  Should Paswan prove to be a more pragmatic and reliable ally, some within Congress will determine that this was a small price to pay to rein in Laloo and Shibu Soren and their excesses.  19.  (C) This election outcome has revived \"two coalition\" politics in India, as the BJP/NDA becomes more confident and upbeat.  Congress will now have to be more careful and cultivate its allies, while BJP has come back from the brink.  Future contests will involve these two parties and their allies, and Congress will have to be careful to not repeat its tendency towards arrogance and overconfidence.  20.  (C) Having been presented with clear evidence of instability within its alliance, Congress will likely focus more attention on cultivating and placating its allies, including the Communists who have come forward in the wake of the election with renewed calls for \"secular unity\" to stem a possible NDA resurgence.  At least for the short term, this outcome is likely to make Congress more cautious in dealing with the economy and foreign affairs.  21,  (U) This message was coordinated with Amconsul Calcutta.

(SBU) Summary: In a brief February 22 meeting, National Security Council Secretariat Joint Secretary Arvind Gupta and Deputy Director (Information Security) Commander Mukesh Saini were upbeat on US-India cybersecurity cooperation, clarified the objective of the upcoming April 18-19 Cybersecurity Seminar in New Delhi, and demonstrated that the GOI is educating the Indian legal system on cybersecurity and related issues.  They also outlined some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Indian IT Act (2000) and described the December 17 arrest of Baazee.com CEO Avnish Bajaj as a case of inadequate police training on IT issues -- an area they say they are trying to improve.  Gupta also outlined how the NSCS became the GOI's cybersecurity nodal agency. Separately, President Kalam in a recent address at the National Judicial Academy underlined the importance of India having a robust cybersecurity regime.  End Summary.  GOI Very Upbeat on Cyber-Cooperation ------------------------------------  2.  (SBU) J/S Gupta opened February 22 discussion by with Poloff comparing the upcoming April 18-19 Cybersecurity Seminar (Ref B) in New Delhi to last November's Cybersecurity Forum: \"We shared our concerns then, now we will share information and cooperation.\"  He also welcomed what he termed \"growing IT interdependence\" as part of expanding the overall US-India relationship, adding that, \"The logic of markets and the logic of globalization make cybersecurity cooperation a necessary win-win situation.\"  Goal of April Seminar ---------------------  3.  (SBU) Gupta then explained that the goal of the April seminar is to address US concerns regarding Indian legal issues in the cybersecurity arena, including for example the IT Act (2000), the Evidence Act, the Criminal and Civil Penal Codes, digital evidence, data privacy, and confidentiality. \"I was surprised, for example, on how far Indian industry was ahead of law enforcement regarding due diligence,\" he expanded, noting that firms need to be very sensitive due to their high level of accountability.  Serious about Cybersecurity Legal Training ------------------------------------------  4.  (SBU) Although Gupta had no data on how much is budgeted nationally for cybersecurity, he pointed out that related classes are taught at the Indian Institutes of Science and that the Indian Institutes of Technology offer both courses and research opportunities.  The Department of Information Technology also funds cybersecurity research projects, as does the Banking Research Institute, he added.  Cdr. Saini reiterated GOI interest in on-site co-training in both India and the US (Ref D), and on cooperation in tackling the \"hard problems\" list.  5.  (SBU) Gupta told Poloff that the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal is training new and current judges in cyberlaw.  The training includes a layperson's overview of the technological possibilities and limits of IT, as well as training on India's IT laws.  Separately, the \"Hindustan Times\" on February 25 reported that the first class of a dozen lower court judges in New Delhi had just completed a three-day seminar on IT and law as part of its obligations as a signatory to the UN Commission on International Trade Law. Their program included overviews of steganography, encryption, digital signatures, website defacing, and recovery of digital data as evidence.  Gupta hopes to have some recently-cybertrained judges attend the April Seminar.  6.  (U) Separately, in a February 19 address to the Judicial Colloquium on Science, Laws, and Ethics at the National Judiciary Academy, President AJP Abdul Kalam offered the following remarks on modernizing India's cyber laws and cyber capabilities: \"India's cyber laws need to look at the fact that nowadays nations are electronically connected, with all their electronic assets.  Defense and national security establishments will be targets for cyber attacks during a conflict.  In such a situation, a country can be defeated without a missile or aircraft attack, just through intelligent cyber war.  Hence it is essential to generate a model of the connected economic and defense security system as a cyber/electronic network.  This will reveal the need for a new policy with redundancy and restriction of external connectivity and external partnership of certain vital establishments.\"  IT Act \"India's Most Comprehensive Cybersecurity Tool\" --------------------------------------------- ---------  7.  (SBU) The most comprehensive legal tool New Delhi has for cybersecurity is the IT Act (2000), Gupta told Poloff.  This statute being revisited, he said, and may be amended to account for changes in technology and to incorporate lessons learned, but it is \"robust enough and impartial enough to address the situation\" and it \"rests on a solid foundation of Indian civil and criminal law traditions.\"  Gupta underlined that the problems with the IT Act were that law always lags behind technology, and that law is bound by borders while IT is not.  \"In the UK, Australia, the US, the problems are the same but the laws are different,\" he added.  Gupta expected that the US delegation to the April seminar would have many questions regarding the IT Act.  Baazee.com Arrest Blamed on Inadequate Training --------------------------------------------- --  8.  (SBU) When asked if the IT Act would be amended in light of the December 17 arrest of Baazee.com CEO Avnish Bajaj (Ref C), Gupta answered that his office was surprised when the arrest happened, and he noted that it drew extensive criticism from the Indian IT sector as well as from foreign IT firms.  Saini commented that the issue was not the IT Law itself but the poor police training that led to, as he viewed it, \"improper implementation of the law.\"  Gupta continued that a major drawback with the IT Law is that even after almost five years it lacks a substantial body of case law to guide the police and the courts.  Observing that \"Personally, I think the arrest was a mistake,\" Gupta reiterated the importance of training judges, police, investigators, and attorneys on the law, and asked if we could provide US cybercrime cases that could be used as references as India develops its own case law.  (Note: Mission is following up on this.  End note.)   He reiterated that the law is being revisited and the case is currently in the courts where it will continue to unfold.  He expected the US delegation in April to discuss this case as well.  Where the NSCS Fits in the GOI ------------------------------  9.  (SBU) Gupta concluded by outlining NSCS's overarching function as supporting the NSC and NSA MK Narayanan (Ref A), and providing independent inputs on both traditional and non-traditional security issues, including cybersecurity.  As such, the NSCS takes the lead in coordinating with agencies throughout the GOI on national information security policy, including the Department of Telecommunications, the Department of Information Technology, and the Ministries of Law and Home Affairs, as well as academia and private industry.  In the area of international cybersecurity cooperation, he said that New Delhi's relations with Washington are \"the strongest we have;\" although in this meeting he only specified cybersecurity cooperation with China, in the past our GOI cybersecurity interlocutors have referenced relationships with Canada, Russia and Israel (Ref D).  Comment -------  10.  (SBU) The brief NSCS conversation and President Kalam's remarks demonstrate that the GOI understands that the US-India Cybersecurity Forum can provide New Delhi with the training and contacts to help it nourish India's growing information economy and make its governmental organization and policies regarding cybersecurity more sophisticated.  It provides another strand in the web of functional relations that strengthens the US-India government-to-government dynamic.  The US-India cybersecurity relationship will require careful nurturing from both sides to ensure the working groups fulfill their potential, as well as complete their stated goals and objectives.  However, the groundwork has been laid for a long-standing and robust cyber exchange with important political and commercial benefits. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi and Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's prior trip to Kabul were \"immensely successful,\" MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) Arun Singh told PolCouns on February 28.  In connection with Karzai's visit, India made an additional USD 100 million development assistance commitment, raising its total to USD 500 million, with an eye to furthering its long-term foreign policy goals in Central Asia.  Following Karzai's raising of the military assistance issue, the GOI would welcome a dialogue with us on how New Delhi could best contribute to the expansion of the ANA.  End Summary.  2.  (C) MEA Joint Secretary Arun Singh was ecstatic about Karzai's successful February 23-25 visit to New Delhi, as well as the visit by FM Natwar Singh to Kabul one week earlier.  In a meeting with PolCouns and PolOff on February 28, he outlined several areas of increasing Indian-Afghan cooperation, including infrastructure, ANA development, and transit trade.  Completion of Pul-i-Khumri Power Line Promised --------------------------------------------- -  3.  (C) Singh explained that India will fully fund and execute the 200 km mountainous segment of the Pul-i-Khumri to Kabul power transmission line, as well as construct a transformer substation in Kabul, committing USD 100 million to this project, and raising the total amount of Indian aid planned for 2002-2008 to USD 500 million.  The power project is expected to ease critical shortages of electricity in Kabul.  Singh said construction will begin after the snows melt this year.  New Delhi now would like trilateral discussions with Kabul and the Asian Development Bank, which will fund the construction of another 200 km segment in the plains, in order to agree on technical specifications and timing of construction.  Singh noted that the Indian Power Grid Corporation, the executing entity for the project, has been responsible for the surveys, but suggested that it might be helpful for US technical experts from Kabul to meet their Afghan and Indian counterparts to share plans.  Singh suggested that further use of US helicopters might be needed for transport during the construction phase.  4.  (C) According to Singh, India has completed a warehouse project in Kandahar for dry goods and produce and now plans an expansion of capacity.  The GOI has also completed installation of satellite uplink facilities at Kabul and downlink stations in ten provincial capitals to facilitate TV coverage, and plans to expand that coverage to the rest of the country.  During his visit to Kabul, FM Singh also handed over the penultimate batch of 49 vehicles from a total commitment of 300 trucks for the Afghan National Army, and inaugurated the Indian-funded Indira Gandhi Hospital (reftel).  Other assistance measures announced during the Karzai visit included an Indian plan to implement on a pilot basis a community development program to generate alternative employment in opium growing areas, and the signing of an MOU on cooperation in civil aviation, including training in airport management, air traffic control, navigation aids, and aircraft maintenance and safety procedures.  What Afghanistan Needs Next ---------------------------  5.  (C) Reviewing potential areas for future assistance, Singh noted that Afghanistan has a shortage of skilled laborers, particularly in construction fields such as plumbing, carpentry, and electrical work.  Additionally, a large cohort of 15-18 year olds is about to enter the job market.  He suggested that these issues might be addressed through \"train-the-trainer\" type assistance in which Afghans would be trained to teach needed skills.  He noted that the establishment of a central certification authority for skilled workers would increase the value of skills learned, and enhance the job mobility of the workers who hold certificates.  (Note: a central certification authority might help to strengthen the influence, authority, and visibility of the central government outside of Kabul.  End Note.) During his visit here, Karzai highlighted requests for more Indian teachers and doctors to work in Afghanistan, and Indian expertise to assist in setting up telemedicine facilities to provide services in remote areas.  6.  (C) Asked about military assistance to the ANA, including parts for the Army's Soviet-origin equipment, Singh agreed that GOI-USG coordination would be useful.  He stated that Karzai had raised the ANA issue during his visit to Delhi. With this step accomplished, the Joint Secretary added, the time had come for the US to review and consolidate requests for assistance to the ANA, and present the coordinated requests to the GOI.  Transit of Goods and Gas ------------------------  7.  (C) Singh emphasized that India supports Afghanistan's inclusion in the SAARC regional organization.  Afghanistan has already broached the idea with India and Pakistan, suggesting that the GOA wanted to confirm support for its accession before making the next step of a formal request to the SAARC Secretary General.  Singh stressed the benefit to trade and assistance programs of a transit agreement with Pakistan for links between India and Afghanistan, and stated that Karzai had committed to press the government of Pakistan for agreement.  Karzai publicly bemoaned the \"miserably low\" level of bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan (USD 180 million/year) at an industry-sponsored meeting, and a transit agreement would further his efforts to increase trade.  Underlining the GOI vision of a comprehensive partnership with Afghanistan, Singh noted that Natwar Singh was joined in Kabul by eight technical ministers, all of whom met with their GOA counterparts.  8.  (C) Singh emphasized that India now has no political objections to gas pipeline links from either Turkmenistan (via Afghanistan) or Iran (via Pakistan).  In New Delhi, Singh reported, Karzai pushed hard for the pipeline from Turkmenistan.  However, the Joint Secretary added, gas supplies from Turkmenistan now appear uncertain, and the GOI was not sure of extra gas production capacity there that was not already committed to Russia.  India would not commit to the costs of a pipeline in light of the uncertainty of supply, but would seek an arrangement similar to what was recently reached with Iran (payment only for supplies delivered at the border, leaving the pipeline construction and operation costs on the supplier).  Iranian aspects of the Indo-Afghan relation -------------------------------------------  9.  (C) Reflecting on the recent visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi, Singh stated that the Iranian Foreign Office and establishment are supportive of Karzai, but the \"other lot,\" meaning the mullahs, \"was of two minds,\" and supported his electoral opponents.  Iran has also complained to the GOI about the Indian-sponsored Salma Dam in Afghanistan, fearing a reduction in water supplies downriver.  In these cases, India told the Iranians to discuss their complaints with the Afghans, Singh stated.  Comment -------  10.  (C) The commitment of USD 500 million in development assistance to Afghanistan is a major step for India, establishing this as the GOI's largest commitment as a donor nation anywhere in the world, and demonstrating the priority New Delhi accords to this relationship.  We would encourage early US engagement on the Kabul-Pul-i-Khumri project as a means to build on the positive atmospherics of the Karzai visit. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 1282      B. NEW DELHI 1480  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: In a February 28 conversation with PolCouns and Poloff, outgoing MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Arun K Singh was generally upbeat about short-term Indo-Pak rapprochement, and expressed cautious optimism about long-term sustainability of this trend.  After sharing impressions from his recent trip to Islamabad with Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Singh sketched out a fairly ambitious but realistic diplomatic agenda for the Spring, which will culminate in a meeting between the two Foreign Secretaries in July.  Singh ticked off a short list of  SIPDIS technical agreements that he predicted would be ready for signature then.  He added that the time was not yet ripe for redeploying medium-range missiles, and predicted that the PM's trip to Islamabad would probably happen not in March, but later in the year.  Singh was enthusiastic about the growth of Indo-Pak grassroots connections, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad (and other proposed) bus links, and the upcoming India tour of Pakistan's cricket team.  He presented the Baglihar Dam impasse and Pakistani inaction against terrorist infrastructure as problems to overcome, but not as risks to the peace process.  This is also Singh's final week before he hands his office over to J/S (Establishment) Dilip Sinha and begins to prepare for his next posting as India's Ambassador to Israel.  Singh is one of the Indian Foreign Ministry's rising stars, and we commend him to Embassy Tel Aviv.  End Summary.  Upbeat on the Indo-Pak Trajectory ---------------------------------  2.  (C) Opening the February 28 discussion with PolCouns and Poloff with macro observations on Indo-Pak relations, J/S Singh was upbeat for the short term but cautioned that it would be \"2-3 years\" before he would say that the improvement was sustainable, stressing that \"we need to make leaving the dialogue more difficult.\"  Pointing to the February 25-27 Pakistan-India Peoples' Forum in New Delhi as the most recent people-to-people success, he noted that over 400 Pakistanis joined a like number of Indians for the weekend convention.  Indo-Pak Agenda Remains Ambitious but Realistic --------------------------------------------- --  3.  (C) Turning to official interaction, Singh outlined an ambitious bilateral agenda for the Spring.  Dates for technical talks on nuclear and conventional CBMs, maritime CBMs, border security issues, and the Lahore-Amritsar-Nankana Sahib bus services would be set soon, he said, followed by the Composite Dialogue (Siachen, Sir Creek, Tulbul Navigation/Wullar Barrage, Terrorism and Narcotics Trafficking, Economic Cooperation, and Kashmir).  The pending round of talks would culminate with the Foreign Secretaries meeting in July.  Singh specified that the MEA would focus on a few items -- finalizing an agreement on pre-notification of missile tests and MoUs on maritime incidents and on accidental/unauthorized nuclear launches -- that had been targeted for Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran's signature in July.  When PolCouns asked about an agreement to move medium-range missiles away from border areas, Singh responded that it was too soon to discuss that level of CBM.  4.  (C) Sharing his impressions of the \"immensely successful\" trip with Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Singh described a gradual recognition in the Pakistani establishment that coming to closure on Kashmir would not be easy, and that progress would have to come incrementally.  He also observed that both governments had been constrained by their own past articulation of the issues, and were only now breaking away from old positions.  Asked for his impressions of the Pakistani political dynamic, Singh remarked that dissident voices remain, but there is a growing awareness that there is no alternative to a political settlement on bilateral issues.  Keeping PM Visit in the Pocket ------------------------------  5.  (C) Singh doubted that PM Manmohan Singh would accept Islamabad's invitation to visit in March, explaining that domestic politics would keep the PM occupied for at least the next several weeks.  He added that a PM visit would have to wait for the right timing, when it could \"add to the process.\"  Singh concluded that a March trip would be too soon after the successful Natwar Singh visit.  Srinagar Bus to Depart on Time, Others to Follow --------------------------------------------- ---  6.  (C) Joking that the permits and logistical details (roads and bridges) necessary for the April 7 inauguration of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus were \"driving me mad,\" Singh insisted that the bus would depart on time.  When asked about other proposed cross-LOC bus links, such as Jammu-Sialkot, he cautioned that the GOI would have to wait and see how well the first bus service goes before planning additional routes in Kashmir.  7.  (C) Singh saw no obstacles facing the proposed Amritsar-Lahore-Nankana Sahib bus routes that would cross the international border, and he predicted that those proposals should be cleared during an April technical-level meeting. In the interim, two busses might be given special permission to cross the border before the official service begins: one on March 14 for the laying of the cornerstone for the connecting road, and one for the April 14 New Year festival of Baisakhi, which has added importance as the anniversary of the establishment of the present structure of Sikhism.  \"The two Punjab Chief Ministers are successfully running their own foreign policy,\" Singh remarked lightly.  He was also upbeat on the Khokhrapar-Munnabao rail service starting on time in October, and conveyed that the Pakistanis he met in Islamabad were also optomistic.  Cricket: The Best CBM ---------------------  8.  (C) The best Indo-Pak CBM is cricket, Singh observed, reporting that three Indian visa officers camped in Lahore's Qadhafi Stadium had already issued over 3,000 visas to Pakistanis who purchased tickets for the upcoming Indian matches.  As a bonus, ticket-holders would be permitted to cross the Wagha border and then be given a free bus ride \"that will run every five minutes\" to the March 8-12 match site in Mohali, Punjab.  According to Indian press, 10,000 anticipated Pakistani visitors are expected to begin arriving by March 5.  Baglihar: Pak is Wrong, but We Will Respect Decision --------------------------------------------- -------  9.  (C) Singh advised that the MEA planned to deliver to the World Bank its response to Pakistan's petition against Baglihar Dam (Ref A) on February 28.  He reiterated the standard GOI rebuttal that: (1) Baglihar complies with the Indus Water Treaty; (2) Islamabad's move to engage the World Bank dispute resolution process was \"premature;\" and (3) Islamabad's objections are \"paranoia or political,\" not technical.  When asked by PolCouns why the MEA was not as politically active on this issue as the Pakistan High Commission, Singh responded that New Delhi is taking a \"less aggressive approach\" and \"keeping the tone low.\"  He agreed, however, that if the dispute resolution process leads to a finding against the GOI, \"we will comply.\"  Meanwhile, in a tangible vote of confidence for New Delhi's position, Finance Minister P Chidambaran announced that the 2005-06 Budget includes a line item of USD 70 million for Baglihar's construction and that adequate funds would be provided for the following year as well.  Infiltration Down but Infrastructure Remains --------------------------------------------  10.  (C) Turning to the subject of cross-border terrorism, Singh shared with us the GOI assessment that infiltration remained low but there have been no GOP moves against terrorist infrastructure, reiterating that Indo-Pak rapprochement depended on Pakistan President Musharraf's \"January 6, 2004 promise\" not to permit terrorists to operate from Pakistan.  Singh pointed out that the February 24 suicide terrorist attack in Srinagar targeted the Divisional Commissioner's office, which houses the Regional Passport Office -- the Indian agency that is to certify and issue entry permits for passengers on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus.  To PolCouns' question of whether the GOI was concerned that terrorists would use the bus to infiltrate across the border (as the BJP has charged), Singh answered that it was not a serious threat, because the applications for entry permits require the same information that otherwise would have been used to obtain visas.  Bio-Note: MEA J/S Dilip Sinha -----------------------------  11.  (C) J/S (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Dilip Sinha assumed his current charge on March 1.  Born into an upper-caste Kayashta family in Bihar, one of his uncles is former Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha.  This connection has not hampered his career under the UPA government, as FM Natwar Singh appears to have hand-picked Sinha for his new posting, which is one of the most high profile in the Indian Foreign Service.  In his prior position as J/S (Establishment), he was responsible for preparing lists of assignments and promotions for the Foreign Secretary to approve, as well coordinating with the J/S (Administration) on running MEA's overseas Missions.  Sinha was reportedly tipped to replace Navtej Sarna as MEA Spokesman in July 2004, but that promotion fell through.  He has served in Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Germany and Pakistan.  Career highlights include:  -- 1978 Joined Indian Foreign Service -- 1986-90  First Secretary (Political), Islamabad -- 1991-95  Director, PMO (Chandra Shekhar/Narasimha Rao governments) -- late 1990s Posted to UN Mission/Geneva -- 2001-04 DCM, Dhaka -- 2004-05 J/S (Establishment)  Comment -------  12.  (C) This was Singh's last day Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran).  His replacement, J/S (Establishment) Dilip Sinha, will overlap with him until mid-March and then Singh will prepare for his next post as India's Ambassador in Tel Aviv.  Singh seemed genuinely optimistic for the next six months of the Indo-Pak agenda, even when discussing the most contentious current issues such as Baglihar and cross-border terrorism.  Acknowledging that the process is neither complete nor self-sustaining, he clearly views the momentum of the relationship going in the right direction, especially when seen from the perspective of someone who worked the 2002 near-war with Pakistan.

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The February J&K municipal elections produced largely positive results.  Participation, among the most important criteria for defining a \"successful\" election in the state, greatly exceeded expectations (even in areas with a history of alienation from New Delhi), proving again that Kashmiris will defy terrorist threats and separatist boycott calls to shape how they are governed, even if they do not consider their votes necessarily as \"a vote for India.\" Compared with other J&K polls since 2002, there were few casualties.  There were also few reports of irregularities. However, during the campaign, many candidates withdrew, and many newly-elected councillors from the Valley have since resigned, gone into hiding, or fled to Jammu following insurgents' threats, depriving the exercise of some of its shine.  How these local bodies will function remains unclear.  End Summary.  Another Solid Electoral Exercise --------------------------------  2.  (C) Observers continue to watch elections in J&K more closely than in many other Indian states for a number of reasons, including: to gauge the credibility of an electoral process that has often been flawed in the past; to take stock of voter enthusiasm and participation as indications of Kashmiri alienation and attitudes towards India; to monitor popular attitudes towards the separatists; and to assess insurgent behavior.  While budgetary restrictions prevented us from observing the three week February municipal polls firsthand, we have spoken with many who did.  These were the first elections at this level in 27 years, and as such represented the best barometer of grassroots voter behavior in the Valley since the insurgency began in 1989.  Among the more significant observations from this exercise:  -- In the third major electoral exercise since the Legislative Assembly elections in 2002, the voting process was again credible.  There were few reports of irregularities, and those that were noted paralleled those present elsewhere in India (such as names missing on voters' lists, while some \"mobile voters\" voted early and often). Even National Conference (NC) President Omar Abdullah, who had complained to the press of \"rigging,\" recently played these allegations down to D/Polcouns.  We have also seen no further support for JKLF leader Yasin Malik's allegations that coercion by the security forces was behind high turnout rates.  -- Voter participation was higher than at any time since 1989.  This was not a result of greatly increased pro-India sentiment in the Valley, although there is much anecdotal evidence that Kashmiris increasingly yearn for normalcy. With each successful election, Kashmiris have fewer reasons to reject the electoral process as illegitimate, as they see their influence over who governs them.  As a journalist from the \"Daily Excelsior\" put it to us, Kashmiris for the most part treated the elections not as a political exercise related to the status of Kashmir, but as a developmental issue, which \"provided the silent majority the justification it needed to take part,\" and put those who opposed it on the wrong side of democracy.  After seeing the size of the turnout in the first round, All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) hardliner SAS Geelani adopted a variant of this view, maintaining that the elections were about \"developing civic amenities.\"  -- Polling ranged from the low teens to mid-20 percent even in separatist bastions such as Shopian, \"Srinagar's \"Gaza\" (Maisuma), and the areas around the Hazratbal shrine and the APHC HQ, where turnout has been in the low single digits since 1989.  One Srinagar-based correspondent called these turnout rates \"a vote against the separatist leadership,\" which had tried to make the election into a \"plebiscite on attitudes towards India, and the people did not buy it.\"  -- Journalists in the Valley tell us that threats and intimidation from insurgents were much more responsible for keeping Kashmiri voters away from polling stations than the calls by Hurriyat leaders for a boycott, although only Geelani, the two JKLF factions, and Shabir Shah really were active in urging a boycott (the moderate Hurriyat issued several calls, but little more).  As \"Pioneer\" Srinagar correspondent Kurshid Wani put it, \"whatever boycott there was was not under the influence of the APHC but rather due to the insurgents.\"  Hurriyat leader Prof AG Bhat conceded that the 2003 split in the APHC contributed to the high turnout, as voters would not listen to a divided leadership.  -- The governing PDP did fairly well in South Kashmir, while the NC did well in Srinagar and parts of Central and North Kashmir, but neither party emerged from the fray much stronger vis-a-vis the other.  As usual, Congress did poorly in the Valley.  PDP and Congress together did very well in Poonch/Rajouri (where turnout was 79 percent).  The BJP did well in the Jammu region. -- Large numbers of women (30 percent of total turnout was female) and young people participated, both as candidates and voters.  Security Dominates the Aftermath --------------------------------  3.  (C) Terrorist intimidation, however, has taken some of the shine from the results:  -- During the campaign, large numbers of candidates withdrew their names from consideration, and many newly-elected councillors from the Valley have reportedly resigned, gone into hiding, or fled to Jammu as a result of threats from insurgents.  Reliable data are difficult to obtain, but a well-connected journalist in Jammu told us that \"scores\" of candidates resigned during the campaign, resulting in unopposed contests, particularly in terrorist-infested areas in South Kashmir, that 91 persons were elected unopposed, and that there were no candidates at all in 35 wards (of 890 total statewide).  Many of these resignations took the form of advertisements in the vernacular press, in which candidates apologized for running for office.  Since the results were declared, 10-15 more councillors have resigned, but initial reports of mass resignations appear to have been overblown.  -- Terrorists killed relatively few (five) candidates, political workers (five), and their relatives and friends, and few injuries were reported.  However, the assassination of a 75-year old councillor expected to be elected the Mayor of Srinagar cast a pall over the relatively high (by post-1989 standards) turnout in Srinagar (some 20 percent) and led to an uptick in resignations from successful candidates.  Many unsuccessful candidates are reportedly also lying low or have gone into hiding.  -- The J&K government has gone to some lengths to address these security concerns after Omar Abdullah threatened to withdraw all NC representatives from municipal bodies to protest their vulnerability.  Since then, at least one Personal Security Officer (PSO) has reportedly been assigned to each elected councillor.  Many observers predict that security will be a major factor in how well the local councils function, because so many councillors (444 in the Valley alone) will potentially be exposed.  Fears are reportedly most pronounced in Srinagar, Anantnag, and Pulwama, but are present elsewhere as well.  PDP General Secretary Sadiq Ali told us the assignment of PSOs has  SIPDIS assuaged concerns somewhat, while unusually harsh winter conditions in the state have diverted attention.  He expected concerns to resurface with warmer weather.  -- Journalists speculate that councillors from the Valley who have fled to Jammu are likely to trickle back by the end of the Winter Session of the Legislative Assembly when the Durbar moves to Srinagar in May.  Press reports of 400 departures for Jammu have not been corroborated.  Comment -------  4.  (C) These elections are another important success for the J&K government.  Although likely to try to reduce the effectiveness of these elected bodies, the terrorists cannot be unaware of the strong popular support Kashmiris in particular showed for these polls.  The relatively small number of casualties during the process is very positive, but it is unclear what this means.  The optimistic reading is that jihadi commanders in the Valley received and heeded instructions from Pakistan not to disrupt the polls, but it is also possible that the terrorists merely altered their strategy -- and seek to disrupt the democratic process in an ex post facto manner via intimidation, rather than widespread and indiscriminate murder as was the case in the fall 2002 state elections, during which some 800 politicians, election workers, and civilians were killed.  5.  (C) It will not be clear until later in the year whether councillors' security will be as much of an issue as appears to be the case at present, and whether these civic bodies will be as successful in practice as was the process that constituted them.  Mufti (and the GOI) now must ensure that they have the funds and the authority to act on issues voters entrusted to them, lest an opportunity to demonstrate the positive results of the democratic process for Kashmiris is lost.  Given the rhetorical emphasis Mufti and the GOI are now placing on economic development in J&K (while leaving dialogue with the separatists for another time), it would be a major mistake for the state and central government not to put their money where their mouth is.

(U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 3.  2.  (C) Following up the Foreign Secretary's earlier approach to the Ambassador on the subject of third country arms transfers to Nepal (reftel), Acting MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) Renu Pall called in PolCouns and PolOff on March 1 to inform us of a GOI report that the Government of Pakistan has offered a USD 5 million \"soft loan\" on generous terms to the Government of Nepal to provide modern stores, equipment and training to the RNA.  Pall urgently requested the USG to intervene with the GOP, adding, \"we would not want to see this go through.\"  The offer, stated Pall, calls on the RGON to submit a final proposal for requested supplies to the Embassy of Pakistan in Kathmandu.  Pall noted that Pakistan had provided a loan on similar terms in 1989, offering 20 year repayment, low interest, and a five year grace period. Responding to questions, Pall stated that the GOI had not directly approached the GOP on this matter, and did not have any details of what military provisions might be on offer. Pall was unaware whether the GOI had yet approached the Government of Israel regarding similar concerns (reftel).  3.  (C) Action request.

(C) Summary:  At the fourth US-India Joint Working Group on Peacekeeping on February 14, IO PDAS Swigert underscored US concerns about sexual exploitation committed within UN peacekeeping ranks and asked India, a main troop contributor, to play a leading role to ensure that the problem is dealt with forcefully and effectively.  The US delegation encouraged India to consider the merits of the \"Peacebuilding Commission\" recommended in the UN High-Level Panel (HLP) report, but India reacted coolly to the notion that a new body be created as a Committee of the Security Council.  Both countries agreed that the increasing number and complexity of peacekeeping operations (PKOs) and the difficulty of transitioning from peacekeeping efforts to economic development are growing burdens on the international peacekeeping system.  A \"menu approach,\" \"hybrid interventions,\" and regional approaches to peacekeeping were discussed as options to alleviate some of the burden on troop-contributing countries (TCCs).  India raised UNSC reform in several contexts, asserting that current Security Council procedures lack transparency and that the UNSC is not representative of the developing world.  The group agreed to convene a meeting of working-level experts to discuss operational issues and construct a framework for the next meeting, but did not specify a timeframe.  End Summary.  2.  (C) In opening remarks, both delegation heads expressed confidence that growing Indo-US relations would also enhance collaboration in peacekeeping efforts.  MEA Joint Secretary Prakash specifically cited the US Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities (EIPC) Initiative funding and joint exercises with the US Pacific Command as bringing the two governments even closer.  Prakash hailed the timely and close cooperation between the two militaries in the aftermath of the Tsunami as further evidence of an expanding military relationship.  IO PDAS Swigert emphasized the increasing strain expanded peacekeeping activity places on the UN, and explained the challenge for the USG as it responds to growing demands while maintaining troop levels in Iraq and cutting domestic spending at home.  Summaries of agenda items follow.   Sexual Exploitation in Peacekeeping Operations --------------------------------------------- -  3.  (C) Swigert stressed that the large-scale \"sex for food\" scandal in the DRC PKO will severely undermine the UN's ability to carry out UNSC resolutions.  He made three recommendations to enforce the Secretary General's \"zero tolerance\" policy for abuse and exploitation:  -- All civil and military PKO personnel should receive training in the UN Code of Conduct and human trafficking;  -- Professional investigators, not UN human rights workers, should investigate allegations so that evidence can be used in civil or military trials;  -- Since the UN lacks prosecution authority, Special Representatives of the Secretary General for PKOs should have appropriate disciplinary and administrative tools to deal decisively with offenders.  4.  (C) Swigert noted that India's standing as a leading contributor to UN PKOs puts it in an ideal position to propose corrective action to the UN, e.g., that all PKO participant nations be required to sign an agreement to uphold the UN \"zero tolerance\" policy and take appropriate disciplinary and administrative measures against violators. The Indian delegate responded that because this issue had only recently come to light, the GOI was not yet in a position to endorse such a recommendation and was still evaluating the problem and proposed solutions.  Swigert reiterated the world must see the UN taking serious action on its own policy, not becoming mired in extended debate.  Indian Views on Multidimensional Peace Operations --------------------------------------------- ----  5.  (C) Prakash highlighted India's support of the UN system overall and its significant contributions to UN PKOs specifically.  He enumerated several changes which add to the complexity of contemporary PKOs, including:  -- Nature of conflict:  Non-state and intra-state actors are becoming more prevalent, as are \"spoilers\" and terrorists;  -- Number of PKO participants:  What was once a strictly military operation now includes civil police, human rights and election monitors, jailers, constitution writers, etc.;  -- Mandates:  \"Hybrid\" mandates, i.e., where the UN takes over from a non-UN regional or national force, non-UN PKOs, and UN-mandated, but coalition-run PKOs.  Prakash noted, however, that the regional approach to PKOs is not a universal model since there is no regional security organization in South Asia similar to NATO or the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS);  6.  (C) Prakash then raised UNSC reform, a recurring theme from the Indian side during the meeting.  Recognizing that most conflicts are in developing countries, he argued that the UNSC as presently constituted was not representative of the developing world and lacks transparency.  Further, the \"CNN/BBC factor\" is creating more demand for intervention in areas where there is little capacity for an effective response by either the UN or regional entities.  7.  (C) Swigert acknowledged that a regional approach to PKOs could raise questions about the legitimacy of such interventions, but added that it had great potential as well, pointing to the African Union (AU) mission for Darfur as an important example where a regional organization could do more than the UN to encourage a cease-fire by deploying monitors. On UNSC reform, Swigert stated that the US is seriously considering the recommendations presented in the UNSC's High Level Panel report, and is open to proposals for improving the organization, including the possible expansion of the Security Council, and stressing the importance of broad international consensus before adopting any structural reforms.  Peacekeeping Lessons Learned ----------------------------  8.  (C) Identifying common ideas about how PKOs can be more effective in the future, US and Indian officials shared lessons learned from their experiences in Haiti, Liberia, and the DRC.  Col. (ret) Brown presented a non-paper outlining US lessons learned in PKOs in Haiti and Liberia, including:  -- Military action should only be an interim measure until other options are available, such as intervention by a regional coalition or the UN;  --  Selecting a PKO leader with experience and credibility is critical for earning respect within the affected country and among the international community;  -- The UNSC must give UN planners authority to procure materiel and deploy staff rapidly; and  -- Root causes of instability must be addressed over the long-term by appropriate international, regional, and national entities, not by the military.  9.  (C) Group Capt Gill, a Senior India Air Staff Officer recently returned from a command in MONUC in the DRC, reviewed positive factors in the Indian deployment in and around Bunia, beginning in July 2003.  Among the factors Gill noted for the Indian units' success there:  -- Broad authority for Force Commanders;  -- Formation of a quick response team with airlift capability;  -- Active search for intelligence inputs;  -- Relative success sealing the border (he admitted the border was only about 60 percent \"sealed\");  -- Community involvement and immediate impact projects to improve infrastructure in their AOR;  -- A specific MOU detailing scope of work, vice standard MOU language; and  -- Committed troops with a high level of discipline.  10.  (C) On the oft-discussed need for more robust mandates, Army Col Pithawala asserted that even \"Chapter Six\" missions, i.e., pure peacekeeping operations, must have the means and training to be more assertive so \"spoilers do not get the upper hand\" and endanger troops.  Implementing a more robust mandate, however, takes additional time for training and \"unlearning habits and mind-sets from previous missions.\" Underscoring the need for resources for intelligence gathering for both Chapter Six and Seven operations, Pithawala stressed the \"need to spend resources to cultivate sources.\"  Role of Police in Peacekeeping ------------------------------  11.  (C) Moran emphasized the necessity of civilian police (CIVPOL) units, along with functioning legal, justice, and prison systems to restore stability.  He also discussed the challenge of coordinating the efforts of peacekeeping missions, including uniformed troops and CIVPOL, with those of UN agencies, bilateral donors and NGOs, noting that coordination problems are particularly acute in the case of demobilization, disarmament and reintegration campaigns.  He outlined recent efforts to tackle complex crisis coordination issues within the USG through the creation of the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS).  Noting that the HLP had taken note of some of these same difficult coordination issues and recommended the creation of a \"Peacebuilding Commission,\" he distributed a paper describing the USG position to support the establishment of such a body under the Security Council.   12.  (C) In the discussion that followed, the Indians responded that their national police and paramilitary forces have much to offer PKOs due to cultural diversity, IT skills, English language ability, and experience with numerous low-intensity conflicts at home.  The Indian delegation also stated their police are better suited to conduct CIVPOL training than their European counterparts because of this real-world experience, and have set up a training facility using UN PK models.  Peacebuilding Commission ------------------------  13.  (C) In the following discussion on the UN HLP proposal to create a Peacebuilding Commission, Swigert explained that such a commission should be a subsidiary of the UNSC with observer participants from IFI's and ECOSOC, among others. Swigert stressed that this did not represent encroachment by the Security Council on General Assembly or ECOSOC issues. While the GOI has not taken an official position, Prakash expressed reservations that the proposed Peacebuilding Commission should be a Security Council Committee.  Other GOI officials were concerned about how \"failing\" states would be identified, and felt the Security Council should stick to handling breaches of security and  not have its authority extended to include failing states.  Emerging Challenges in Contemporary Peacekeeping --------------------------------------------- ---  14.  (U) The MEA's Nandini outlined overarching and operational challenges facing future PKOs, including:  -- Increasing number, complexity, and expense of PKOs;  -- The \"CNN/BBC factor\" which generates attention and demand for action around the world;  -- Formalizing more flexible means of engagement, e.g., \"hybrid interventions\" of regional forces or other entities, followed by the UN;  -- The need for rapid deployment in the face of perennial resource constraints;  -- Safety and security of troops;  -- Ensuring integration of all actors and effective transition at the right time; and  -- \"Soft challenges,\" such as increasing women's participation in PKOs, preventing sexual exploitation, etc.  15.  (C) Nandini asserted that \"hybrid interventions\" in which regional or national troops would be deployed rapidly to critical situations in the  months before a UNPKO can deploy should be standard  operations.  Formalizing this arrangement would ensure rapid crisis stabilization and give a UNPKO time to deploy.  Discussion turned to the transition between \"green helmets\" and \"blue helmets.\"  The Indian delegation expressed concern that UN missions are often perceived as \"less robust\" following a peacekeeping intervention by US or other regional forces.  Prakash asked if the US would consider joining the \"blue helmets\" during the transition period or extending their stay as \"green helmets\" after the \"blue helmets\" have arrived.  Swigert noted a variety of ways the Security Council had acted to allay concerns about capabilities of UN missions, for instance by providing a strong Chapter Seven mandate and by recruiting capable, well-trained forces to follow the multinational forces, as India had done in following the EU \"green helmets\" in Eastern DRC.  Swigert added that the US saw its contribution as most effective in providing \"green helmets\" in select circumstances, as the US had done in Haiti and in off-shore forces in Liberia before UN blue helmets took over.  The US evaluates each case individually, he stressed.  16.  (C) Citing the recent downturn in events in Bangladesh and Nepal -- the first and fourth largest TCCs, respectively -- MEA's Prakash asked whether \"democracy-deficient\" countries should be allowed to participate as peacekeepers. Rather than trying to formalize a \"democracy test,\" Swigert proposed that all TCCs should commit to uphold the UN Code of Conduct.  17.  (C) As the destination of 80 percent of the UN's peacekeeping troops, including the two largest PKOs in the world (DRC and Liberia), Africa presents a special challenge to PKOs, according to Nandini.  The question is how to support efforts to find \"African solutions to African problems,\" be it through the African Union (AU) or regional configurations like ECOWAS.  Prakash questioned the AU's capacity to respond effectively to current peacekeeping demands on the continent, adding that India would watch closely how the G8 responds to these needs.  \"Will the UN always be the first call and the last hope for Africa?\" he asked.  Indo-US Cooperation in Peacekeeping ----------------------------------- 18.  (C) Col Rajput presented an overview of the United Services Institutions' Center for UN Peacekeeping (USI/CUNPK).  CUNPK offers training capsules for junior and senior officers, military observers and logistics officers, and conducts an outdoor military/CIVPOL field exercise that the UN has taken as a model for PK training.  Indo-US cooperation has included a command post exercise, a lessons learned seminar with USPACOM, and $800,000 in EIPC funds used to enhance capabilities of the Center.  19.  (C) Concluding, Moran presented an overview of the new Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), the successor of EIPC.  The five-year, $660 million program, with immediate focus on capacity building in Africa, would provide training and equipment for 75,000 peacekeeping personnel as well as deployment support and enhancement of gendarme-like capabilities.  Moran stated that the US had found past cooperation with India under the EIPC program very fruitful, that the US had taken note of India's expertise in gendarme-like training in particular, and that the US welcomes India's interest in continued cooperation with the US in the peacekeeping training field.

Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: During a February 25 lunch that the Ambassador hosted for visiting Ambassador to Nepal Moriarty, Indian experts on Nepal agreed that:  -- The RNA was unlikely to collapse as a result of the suspension of military assistance;  -- A Maoist takeover is more likely to result from political failure from the King and political parties than from military victory;  -- The monarchy must make democratic changes or collapse as an institution; and  -- The King's actions have strengthened the Maoists' position.  End Summary.  2.  (C) The lunch, hosted on February 25 by the Ambassador in honor of Ambassador to Nepal Moriarty, gathered several of India's most prominent non-government Nepal experts including retired Ambassadors, academics, and retired military officers.  Discussion focused on the crisis and the US and Indian responses.  Implications of Assistance Cutoff ---------------------------------  3.  (C) There was broad agreement that India's suspension of military aid would not impact the RNA so severely that it would be unable to withstand the Maoists.  Therefore, the experts advised, India, the US, and the UK should continue their current approach to maintain pressure on the King. Participants concurred that neither the Maoists nor the RNA had the military strength to defeat the other.  MG (Ret) Ashok Mehta disputed the notion that the RNA would soon face shortages of weapons or ammunition due to suspension of military aid, but conceded that the GOI and USG should investigate the question of RNA supplies more closely.  4.  (C) Considering potential scenarios proposed by Ambassador Moriarty, participants identified two paths that could lead to a Maoist victory: a poorly-negotiated compromise (forced upon Nepal by other countries) that would hand too much power to the Maoists, or a campaign of targeted violence or assassinations that saps the will of the GON to resist the Maoists.  5.  (C) Participants were skeptical that the supply of explosives for the Maoists' IEDs could be cut off.  Although these illegal explosives come largely from commercial sources in India, participants doubted that India could stop the smuggling or implement a chemical tagging system.  Terrorism expert Ajai Sahni reported that India had studied this option in the past, but that the Maoists constructed their explosives from common chemicals that were not amenable to tagging.  Nepal's Political Future ------------------------  6.  (C) The Indian experts came to no agreement on a solution to the present crisis, although they agreed broadly that:  -- A constituent assembly could provide a political solution to the King's problem of legitimacy.  However, the Maoists would only support such a step if they are certain of dominating the process.  -- In contrast to most Nepal residents, who reportedly are not considering radical changes to the monarchy, as they are widely supportive of the institution, many Indian Nepal experts are beginning to contemplate the future of the Kingdom without a monarch.  -- The King has severely damaged the institution of monarchy with his absolutist tendencies.  The Palace would not survive Crown Prince Paras as King.  Former Indian Ambassador to Nepal AR Deo, who heads the Nepal Center at the prominent New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF), stated that Nepal appears to be no exception to the international trend of monarchies ending around the globe. The question for policy makers is how to ensure a soft landing.  7.  (C) Interlocutors agreed that India has relatively little leverage on the King.  Retired Ambassador G Parthasarthy, one of the architects of India's 1989 economic blockade of the Kingdom, noted that any attempt to squeeze the King economically would hurt primarily the people of Nepal, thus \"repeating the mistakes of 1989.\"  Similarly, India has few levers to pressure the Maoists into concessions. Participants supported the Ambassador's observation that time favors the Maoists in the present crisis, and that the Maoists recognize this.  Because they were under relatively little pressure to negotiate, Parthasarthy and Deo warned that \"other countries'\" efforts to craft a compromise would favor the Maoists and might enable them to take over the government.  Comment -------  8.  (C) Aside from the opportunity to hear comments from several of India's most prominent Nepal experts on whom the GOI draws for outside expertise, the exchange also was useful for its insights into the pulse of Indian specialists' thinking on the crisis.  The discussion was equally beneficial for clarifying misconceptions regarding USG policy (particularly military assistance), as a number of guests were unaware of important nuances in the USG position.  The guests were pleased at the opportunity to interact with Ambassador Moriarty on his stop in New Delhi before returning to Kathmandu. MULFORD " }

KATHMANDU 470       B. DELHI 1482  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) The GOI feels strongly that the USG should delay the first phase of the Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) for the Royal Nepalese Army, because this is not the time to send mixed messages to the King.  In a March 2 meeting with Polcouns and Poloff scheduled to discuss Bhutan, MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal) Ranjit Rae raised the issued of US military  SIPDIS assistance to the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), following on a March 1 discussion between our Ambassadors in Kathmandu (Ref A).  Drawing on Refs A and B, Polcouns explained that our possible JCET would provide medical training with a humanitarian intent.  We also noted the GOI's decision not to return RNA students receiving military training in India if that training is ongoing.  Rae argued that it was imperative that there be no daylight between the GOI and USG position and that medical training provided by US troops inside Nepal would be seen by His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) as a normalization of military relations.  2.  (C) Rae emphasized that the RNA was starting to feel the squeeze and now was not the time to soften our position, citing as evidence a phone call between the RNA chief and an Indian counterpart in which the Nepalese appealed for India to re-open its pipeline.  He added that the GOI is \"getting feelers that the King is having a re-think and could release political prisoners and restore democratic freedoms as early as next week.\"  With this in mind, Rae asserted, the USG should hold the line on lethal and non-lethal equipment and training in Nepal.  He conceded that the GOI will allow military training of Nepalese officers in India to continue, but no training is being conducted across the border and no military equipment of any sort is being provided by India to the RNA.  Rae noted that the issue of non-lethal US military equipment had not been raised with Foreign Secretary Saran when Ambassador Moriarty saw him on February 26 (Ref B).  3.  (C) Rae commented that Nepal was becoming a major issue in domestic politics.  The Foreign Minister confirmed to the DCM at a social function that Nepal would be the first question he faces in this Parliamentary session.  He added that he was encouraged that Indian political parties were maintaining a united front on the issue and not giving the King reason to be optimistic.  He concluded that the message to the King remained that he needs to make some move towards democracy in order to receive assistance from the GOI. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (S) In a March 1 conversation with Poloff, influential columnist and political insider Saeed Naqvi commented on Rahul Gandhi at some length.  Naqvi prefaced his remarks by noting that he was a personal friend of Rahul's father, Rajiv Gandhi, and a well-wisher of the Gandhi family.  Naqvi was initially delighted when Sonia Gandhi projected Rahul as the heir apparent, but has since lost faith.  He claims that the word among Congress insiders, including those in the coterie surrounding Sonia Gandhi, is that Rahul will never become Prime Minister for several reasons.  Saying that he \"refused to indulge in gossip,\" Naqvi claimed that it is increasingly common knowledge that Rahul suffers from \"personality problems\" of an emotional or psychological nature that are severe enough to prevent him from functioning as PM.  2.  (S) Naqvi also claimed that his Congress contacts tell him that Rahul has failed as an MP representing the Gandhi pocket borough in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh.  Congress purportedly hoped to create a revival campaign in UP based around Rahul and his appeal as a member of the Gandhi dynasty, but has now given up, as he \"is causing more harm than good\" and operates at cross-purposes to the state Congress leadership.  According to Naqvi, Rahul has done nothing for UP except to make pro-forma appearances in Amethi, and has \"made no impression on the people of the state.\"  This is leading to growing discouragement that Congress will be able revive and take over the state from Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) any time in the near future.  This growing impatience is reportedly fueling internal debates as to whether it would be better for Congress to accept a junior partner status and cultivate an appropriate regional ally, such as Mayawati and her Dalit-based BSP party.  3.  (S) Naqvi stated that the Gandhi family always preferred that Rahul's sister, Priyanka, enter politics, as she was judged to be more intelligent and savvy.  Arguing that Sonia Gandhi is an Italian mother, and \"like an Indian mother,\" has a protective feeling regarding her son, Naqvi speculated that Sonia apparently went against her better judgment and selected Rahul over his sister as \"heir apparent.\"  Naqvi claimed that Gandhi dynastic politics had no future, as the family has run out of prime ministerial candidates with appropriate charisma.  Indira Gandhi was the last member of the dynasty capable of being an effective PM and Rajiv would never have won re-election had he not been assassinated. Naqvi implied that the common impression among Congress insiders is that Rahul is far below even his father in political ability.  4.  (C) Comment: Naqvi offered an unusually sharp commentary of views we have heard elsewhere.  While our Congress contacts invariably hail Sonia as a \"visionary leader\" with a special feeling for India's \"common man\" there are few in the party who are willing to offer such glowing comments on Rahul.  Rahul disdains the Delhi social scene, in contrast to most of his political peers.  In the few instances we have come across Rahul, he has kept a very low profile and kept mostly to himself or close friends.  Despite signs of growing unhappiness from Congress insiders regarding Rahul, however, he continues to be the subject of press reports that  rave about his participation in the early January Congress Youth training camp and suggest that he is preparing to take the mantle of the \"leader of young India\" and \"blossoming into a leader with mass acceptability.\"  During the two-day youth training session, Rahul engaged in interactive discussions ranging from pesticides in cola products -- he was against closing the plants -- to defending the GOI,s globalization policy and economic reforms.  Given this publicity machine that Rahul enjoys, we, unlike Naqvi, are not yet prepared to write him off just yet. MULFORD " }

(SBU)  Summary: Senator Hillary R. Clinton received an enthusiastic welcome during her unofficial February 17 - 23 visit to New Delhi.  Her stay in India included a call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, meals offered in her honor by Foreign Minister Natwar Singh and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, and a speaking engagement at a major conference sponsored by the newsweekly \"India Today.\"  Other than causing some consternation with her remarks on India and nuclear issues, the Senator's visit was very positive.  That Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi offered Senator Clinton a meeting (the first for an American official since the May 2004 elections), the Prime Minister hosted a tea, and FM Natwar Singh a lunch, indicates the high regard in which Indians hold the Clintons.  End Summary.  India's Open Arms -----------------  2.  (SBU) Offering her an unusually warm welcome, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Health Minister Anubumani Ramadoss, and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar all threw events in Senator Clinton's honor.  The lunch, reception, and dinner were a who's who of the New Delhi power elite, including Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, Deputy Chief of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Senator Clinton met with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi at her home on February 25, the first official American to do so since the May 2004 elections.  On the same day, she had a private discussion over tea with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  In an interesting reflection of Manmohan's relationship with the left parties, the PM also invited Brinda Karat, head of the All-India Women's Democratic Association, the women's wing of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M).  The Senator's schedule also included a 15 minute session with young Parliamentarians, who, according to press reports, appreciated the opportunity and were impressed by her presentation.  Conclave Remarks: Shared Interests ----------------------------------  3.  (SBU)  Capping an impressive lineup for the two-day \"India Today Conclave,\" which also included Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani PM Shaukat Aziz (via satellite), Senator Clinton delivered remarks during the concluding dinner on February 26.  Speaking to the elite audience, she emphasized the degree to which the US-India relationship has strengthened in the last decade, and the number of issues on which our interests converge, including our shared democratic values.  In language that some of our Congress Party contacts found uncomfortably reminiscent of the old US policy, Clinton raised the nuclear issue, calling for creative \"ways to reconcile the decision of India and Pakistan to be nuclear states, with the US commitment to the non-proliferation treaty.\"  On regional matters, she acknowledged the magnitude and importance of India's assistance to Afghanistan, and congratulated India on its leadership role during the Indian Ocean tsunami crisis.  She also provided a timely reminder of the important democratic transition underway in Iraq.  The Senator expressed optimism for further improvement of the India-Pakistan relationship, praising President Musharraf as a \"legitimate partner for a stable, productive, and mutually beneficial way forward.\"  4.  (U) Senator Clinton delivered a strong economic message, highlighting the need for free markets.  While recognizing India's remarkable growth, she drew attention to the yawning trade gap between the US and India and the concerns some Americans have over outsourcing, including the protection of sensitive information.  Encouraging increased Indian investment in the US, the Senator also stressed the major role of the private sector in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS and in economic development more generally.  Welcome Anytime ---------------  5.  (U)  While describing the Senator as \"charming\" and having \"infectious candor,\" media coverage of Clinton's stay in India included few details of her interactions, in keeping with her status as a private visitor.  The impressive access Senator Clinton had to Sonia Gandhi, and official New Delhi's warm embrace, mirrored by that of the public, indicates the high regard in which the Clinton family is held in India.

Blake, Jr., for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Outgoing MEA Joint Secretary (Gulf Division) R. Dayakar and his successor Sanjay Singh reiterated GOI willingness to support Iraq's reconstruction, but offered no new initiatives in a meeting with PolCouns and PolMilOff on March 3.  Assistance to Iraq will continue to be constrained by what the UPA's Left parties and the Congress Party will support.  Despite these constraints, Indo-Iraq trade continues, especially in the oil sector.  India hopes to reactivate a pre-2001 contract for oil exploration in Iraq. End Summary.  2.  (C) Presenting a non-paper encouraging support for the Iraqi transitional government (Reftel), PolCouns expressed appreciation for GOI statements following the January 30 elections, and noted that support for the democratic transition in Iraq remains among the USG's highest priorities.  3.  (C) Dayakar reviewed current GOI support for Iraq: training and scholarships in India for Iraqis and a new program to produce high energy biscuits for the World Food Program for distribution in Iraq.  Earlier proposals such as the dispatch of a military hospital to Najaf would be activated when the security situation improves, he promised. In the meantime, the travel ban on Indian citizens traveling to Iraq remains in effect, and sending Indian troops will not be considered.  He confirmed that the GOI will participate in the donors' conference for Iraq in April.  4.  (SBU) PolCouns asked about a March 2 article in \"The Asian Age\" about hundreds of Indian agricultural workers from the Indian state of Andra Pradesh who migrate to Iraq each month despite the travel ban, seeking work in military camps, construction sites, and transport companies.  Dayakar opined that most of these workers are actually looking for work in other Gulf States, but are lured to Iraq by unscrupulous manpower agents.  5.  (C) Despite the travel ban, Indo-Iraq trade continues, Dayakar explained.  Notably, oil trade with Iraq has increased and will continue to do grow as India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) pre-2001 contract for oil exploration is reactivated.  According to Dayakar, Iraq is one of several countries where India is pursuing new oil exploration opportunities.  6.  (C) In the aftermath of the January 30 elections, PolCouns commented on positive changes in Iraq and internationally:  that some observers had noted that the insurgency may be losing support because of the elections, and that even opponents to Coalition intervention in Iraq are making constructive statements.  Recalling a GOI official's comment that Indian Parliamentary politics are \"lagging behind reality\" in the case of Iraq, PolCouns asked about MP interest in Iraq in the current session of Parliament. Dayakar responded that Parliament is a fair barometer of public interest, and that there had been 2-3 queries on facts, not policies, submitted by Parliament the previous day.  In the absence of a new political directive, he indicated that GOI policy would continue on its current cautious path.  7.  (C) PolCouns also asked about the status of GOI acceptance of the agrement for the Iraqi ambassador-designate to India.  Dayakar said the agrement had been held up for \"technical reasons.\"  (Note:  According to Iraqi Charge S. Husayn, the agrement has been pending since September.) However, he promised fast-track consideration of the agrement and indicated that the GOI would revive its invitation for an Iraqi Foreign Minister visit to New Delhi as soon as the transitional government is selected. 8.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 1519       B. MUMBAI 370      C. CALCUTTA 91  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: Attempts by Congress to grab power in Goa and Jharkhand has thrown the Indian domestic political scene into turmoil.  Observers in Delhi see these moves as part of a larger strategy by Congress operatives to gain control over a majority of Indian states.  Should Congress succeed in Jharkhand, Bihar is likely to be next.  Congress has bet that it can win control of the North Indian Hindi Belt, and position itself to govern India for decades to come.  The BJP is outraged, and has launched a vigorous counterattack, foreshadowing a period of protracted political infighting that will poison the political climate in the weeks and months ahead.  These events have paralyzed the budget session of parliament, leading to doubts that it will be able to conduct business.  The Jharkhand episode in particular has damaged the reputations of Sonia Gandhi and the technocratic Congress leadership, and emboldened the BJP.  The Left, while not happy with these steps, appears willing to cooperate, because it fears a resurgent BJP.  President Kalam is conferring with the Jharkhand governor on March 4, and he could convene the Jharkhand Assembly for a floor vote as early as March 7.  With the GOI embroiled in domestic politics, some important initiatives in which the US is interested could be put on hold until the Congress/BJP battle is resolved.  End Summary.  The Power Grab at the State Level ---------------------------------  2.  (C) The Congress Party crossed something of a Rubicon recently when it launched a power grab in Goa (Ref B) and Jharkhand (Ref C).  Despite its poor performance in the Jharkhand elections (Ref A) and the lack of a clear majority in Goa, Congress determined that it would manipulate the levers of power in New Delhi and compliant governors to consolidate its control of two more states.  This outraged the opposition NDA, making political consensus next to impossible and setting off a protracted period of Congress/BJP infighting.  The Congress move was a deliberate gamble for high stakes.  If successful, it could solidify the Congress position and set the stage for a long period of Congress rule across the country.  If not, a revived NDA could score serious blows against Congress.  The Master Plan ---------------  3.  (C)  In our estimation, the Congress leadership decided that gaining control of state governments, resources and patronage would be so valuable to its bid to cement itself as the preeminent player in Indian politics that it paid little attention to appearances or consequences.  The logic is that the Indian electorate has become so cynical that it will over time put aside its initial revulsion and accept these tawdry tactics, especially once Congress begins dispensing patronage.  Most of the Indian public have long assumed that politicians are for sale to the highest bidder, and are not that shocked to see \"independent\" MLAs lining up to support Congress governments in exchange for ministerial berths and cash considerations.  4.  (C) There is much speculation in the Indian political class that Congress does not intend to stop with Jharkhand and Goa.  Should it succeed there, commentators expect the party to use similar tactics to re-install Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi in Bihar, and then to go after the big prize - Uttar Pradesh (UP).  Mohan Singh, a prominent MP from Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP), predicted to Poloff recently that this was only the opening salvo in a concerted Congress assault aimed at recapturing the entire North Indian Hindi belt.  According to Singh, the installation of a compliant governor in Lucknow willing to do its bidding is part of a Congress plan to undermine and bring down the SP government.  BSP MP Ilyas Azmi, who is close to BSP leader Mayawati, confirmed to Poloff on March 3 that Congress is negotiating a Congress/BSP alliance aimed at rebuilding a coalition of Dalits, Muslims and upper castes capable of recapturing the state.  5.  (C) On March 1, well-connected journalist Saeed Naqvi told Poloff that his interaction with the Congress leadership has convinced him that they have not abandoned their \"old think\" and are determined to use any tactics to recapture their old base in the Hindi belt, win an absolute majority in Parliament, and send a clear message to UPA allies that they must be compliant and accept Congress \"leadership,\" or face marginalization.  Naqvi insisted that this plan was out of step with present Indian realities, and the Congress must learn to deal honestly with regional parties.  This was echoed by Azmi, who said that after capturing UP, Congress hopes to install UPA/Congress governments in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.  He maintained that Rajasthan is being saved for last, as Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is not as vulnerable as other BJP leaders.  Congress Viewpoints -------------------  6.  (C) Congress politicians have downplayed the power grab, trying to depict it as a natural result of hung assemblies. Congress MP Maulana Obaidullah Azmi claimed that his party was only using tactics perfected by the BJP during the NDA government, while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Tariq Anwar said everything is going according to plan, except that by backing Shibu Soren for Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Congress provided an opening for the BJP to cry foul.  He conceded that Soren \"does not have a good image,\" but would nevertheless produce a clear majority on March 21, the current deadline for the UPA to prove its majority in the Jharkhand State Assembly.  Congress ally D. Raja of the CPI rather disingenuously claimed that the BJP should not be upset about events in Jharkhand, as it could \"prove its point,\" at that time.  7.  (C) In a March 3 meeting with PolCouns Sonia loyalist and Congress spinmeister Rajiv Desai (strictly protect) was confident that when the dust settles, Congress would emerge the winner in Jharkhand and Bihar.  Desai was also confident that Mrs. Gandhi would successfully disassociate herself from the more tawdry aspects of recent events, while insisting that Jharkhand Governor Razi was incapable of taking such a dramatic step on his own.  Now that the Congress leadership has focused on Jharkhand and Bihar, he maintained, it will end the situation quickly.  He named Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Sonia loyalist Ahmed Patel as the key players in the damage control effort.  Desai was optimistic that the controversy surrounding the elections would make it harder for the Left parties to attack the GOI's handling of economic issues, on the grounds that it fear a resurgent BJP more than reform.  BJP Viewpoints --------------  8.  (C) The power grab has the BJP up in arms and more united and engaged than at any time since its fall from power in May 2004.  BJP MP Ram Nath Kovind denounced the Congress moves as a \"danger to democracy,\" and claimed that \"the myth of Sonia Gandhi as a great politician, known for her renunciation, has exploded.\" BJP MP Kalraj Mishra was even more scathing, stating \"this exposes the real designs of the Congress, that the party cannot tolerate opposition and would like to monopolize all political activity.  I am hopeful that the day is not too far off when these undemocratic acts will hugely benefit us.\"  What Will Be the Impact? ------------------------  9.  (C) The situation is extremely fluid and could change quickly.  As of March 4, Congress has experienced dramatic setbacks, with a reactivated BJP dramatically flying in 41 MLAs at the President's residence in New Delhi, a fairly convincing display that it has the real majority in Jharkhand.  BJP President LK Advani was quick to assert that since the BJP was the first to present a majority in the state assembly, Jharkhand Governor Syed Sibtey Razi should ask the party to form the government.  Labeling Razi \"a contract killer of democracy\" being \"micromanaged\" by Sonia Gandhi, Advani demanded dissolution of the Soren government, its replacement by a BJP government, and Razi's recall.  In view of this, President Kalam may request that Razi convene the Jharkhand State Assembly within 72 hours for a floor vote, according to the media.  10.  (C) As the aggrieved party, the NDA now has an issue around which to rally the faithful and attract support. Before the budget session the BJP/NDA was clearly on a downward trend.  The assembly elections were make or break contests for them, and they did well enough to revive their spirits and keep their hat in the ring.  Almost everyone agreed that they should have formed the government in Jharkhand, as they were very close to winning a majority. Likewise, few are convinced that Congress/UPA has a clear majority in Goa and should form the government there.  The Congress-led government confirmed its majority in a March 4 vote of the Goa State Assembly.  Yet its majority remains razor-thin and vulnerable to the types of machinations that led to its gaining power in the first place (Ref B).  In addition, the BJP is challenging its recent dismissal from power in Goa before the Indian Supreme Court, which could rule as early as March 4. . 11.  (C) Congress is banking on the fact that the Left parties will join with \"all secular parties\" to stave off a BJP/NDA resurgence.  In a March 2 meeting with Poloff, Communist Party of India Secretary D. Raja confirmed that the Left was relatively happy with the budget and felt that Congress was responding to its calls for increased social spending and more taxation of the wealthy.  He also confirmed that the Communists have committed their MLAs to the UPA effort in both Bihar and Jharkhand.  Raja said that he fully expected a resurgent BJP/NDA to mount a counterattack, and the Left parties to stand with the UPA against it.  12.  (C) In playing dirty, Congress has tarnished its image, and demonstrated that is has no long-term friends, only temporary allies.  In Bihar, it allied first with the discredited Laloo, then with Paswan against Laloo, and is now back with Laloo against Paswan.  There is a lingering distrust of Congress among Indian politicians and these developments will only encourage suspicion.  Most will assess that regional parties that ally with Congress are self-serving and mercenary.  Long-term Implications ---------------------  13.  (C) Congress can expect its popularity to fall as a result of these moves.  With the party strategy going poorly in Jharkhand, Sonia Gandhi and PM Manmohan Singh are distancing themselves from the effort.  Congress spokeswoman Ambika Soni and others continue to insist that Mrs. Gandhi and the PM were not involved in the Jharkhand events, and that Governor Razi acted on his own.  Despite these attempts at damage control, it will be difficult for Mrs. Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to keep their reputations untarnished, as most Indians assume they had a hand in events in Jharkhand and Goa.  Should Congress gain control in both states, it is not likely to take long for most political players to decide that the balance of power has shifted and that it is best to go along with the new dispensation, take advantage of new opportunities, and cooperate with the newly-installed governments.  14.  (C) The budget session of parliament is likely to be the first casualty.  Few now expect it to conduct serious business during the remainder of the session, which ends on May 13.  This means that the budget could pass without debate, which would make the Left happy, as its social initiatives would remain in place, unchallenged by the opposition.  In return, the Left could decide to stress \"secular unity\" and tone down its public opposition to the UPA, resulting in a measure of \"stealth economic reform,\" as Congress enacts economic measures without parliamentary debate or contentious squabbling with the Left.  The Communists and Congress will need each other more than ever now, and we suspect that they will continue to coordinate, with the Left receiving some economic concessions in exchange for its political support.  Who is Responsible ------------------  15.  (C) The UPA \"core group\" consisting of the PM, Mrs. Gandhi, and the \"senior ministers\" (Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, Shivraj Patil and Ghulam Nabi Azad) is coordinating the Congress handling of the state elections.  The aggressive Congress strategy carries the trademark of hard-bitten professional politicians in the Congress leadership.  The role of the PM and Mrs. Gandhi is not yet clear.  It is conceivable that veteran ministers drafted the plan and presented it to Mrs. Gandhi for her approval.  PM Singh has remained aloof from domestic political machinations and may not have been involved at all.  Based on his reputation and priorities, we doubt he would have acquiesced in an approach that has clearly distracted energies from his priority of economic reform.  The Gamble ----------  16.  (C) Congress has decided to play a high-stakes gamble in hopes of restoring its position as India's pre-eminent political party, which controls a clear majority of state governments.  Over the long term, Congress hopes that this will translate into a clear parliamentary majority for the UPA and ultimately for Congress.  As recent events have demonstrated, such a plan can easily backfire.  Should the BJP rally its supporters, present a majority in Jharkhand, and force Shibu Soren to step down, it would force Congress to go into a defensive mode and postpone its plans for other states.  Bihar could then face a protracted period of uncertainly.  With Congress and the BJP locked in bitter combat, it could take several months for a clear winner to emerge, with major policy decisions taking a back seat to domestic politics. MULFORD " }

STATE 27085      B. KATHMANDU 460      C. GENEVA 2859      D. NEW DELHI 1482  Classified By: Ambassador David C. Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The Bhutanese Ambassador reaffirmed to us on March 3 that Thimphu remains committed to repatriate Category 1 refugees under the Dewey-Wangchuck framework, but is unlikely to allow any refugees to return until the constitution is finalized, and sees little prospect of progress on the refugee issue while political turmoil persists in Nepal.  Ambassador Tshering also reiterated that no Bhutanese would travel to Nepal to participate in the Joint Verification Teams in the current security situation and cited the recent imposition of a military curfew in the Jhapa District to bolster his case.  The demands by both Thimphu and Kathmandu that the other draft the next letter spelling out modalities of the Dewey-Wangchuck plan is another hurdle we must overcome to move the process forward. We support a trip to the region by A/S Dewey (or the Ambassador) as part of the effort to convince Thimphu that a solution to the refugee issue must be found.  The USG should continue to press Bhutan and Nepal to engage with the other, but the Nepalese King's dismissal of the Deuba Government has heightened Bhutanese security concerns and given Thimphu further arguments for delay.  The refugee issue is not a high priority for the GOI at this time, but the MEA is intrigued by talk of a \"global solution.\"  The EU feels the time is not right to press the issue.  Mission continues to research conflicting local opinions about whether the RGOB could use the census to facilitate further expulsions.  End Summary.  Bhutan's Position -----------------  2.  (C) The Dewey-Wangchuck framework remains our best road map, but the return of any refugees, including verified Category 1 refugees is unlikely prior to the adoption of the constitution, which could take a year, Bhutanese Ambassador Tshering told Polcouns and Poloff in a March 3 meeting.  He  SIPDIS reasoned that the Bhutanese people do not want refugees, possibly influenced by Maoists ideology, returning during the implementation of the constitution and formation of political parties.  (Note: This is the first time the RGOB has confirmed that political parties will be allowed under the new constitution.  End Note.)   He also reiterated that the RGOB will not restart the Joint Verification Team (JVT) process until the political and security situation in Nepal becomes more stable.  3.  (C) Polcouns expressed USG desire to receive a response to the January 19 letter from A/S Dewey to King Wangchuck asking the RGOB to transmit a second letter to Nepal reaffirming its commitment to the JVT process.  Tshering responded that he believed the Nepalese were responsible for sending the next letter, demonstrating that the standoff over the exchange of correspondence between Kathmandu and Thimphu continues.  Tshering reiterated Thimphu's three major concerns:  1) the security of JVT members; 2) the lack of stability in Nepal; and 3) the unwillingness of the Nepalese opposition to abide by agreements made by the GON.  He commented that events since February 1 have reinforced Bhutanese concerns.  The Ambassador concluded that security remains foremost for the RGOB, and that it has no other alternative but to wait until the situation in Nepal improves.  He seemed incredulous at our suggestion that the JVT's might resume, citing the imposition of a military curfew in the Jhapa District as evidence of the dangerous security situation.  GOI Views ---------  4.  (C)  The MEA also does not consider the refugee problem a high priority at this time, particularly in light of the political problems in Nepal.  MEA Joint Secretary (Nepal) Ranjit Rae acknowledged to Polcouns on March 2 that the GOI had not heard that the new government in Nepal was willing to continue PM Deuba's policies concerning the refugees (Ref B).  Rae also inquired about the possibility of a \"global solution,\" suggesting that this problem should not be too difficult to resolve, \"because only about 16,000 families need to be resettled.\"  Polcouns responded that we need to see progress towards repatriation and have heard different messages from the international community about possible resettlement numbers as part of such a global solution. Commenting on the possibility of restarting the verification process, Rae agreed with the Bhutanese position that there must be security in Nepal for the JVT members, as neither side can afford another violent incident.  Queried by Polcouns, Rae reaffirmed Foreign Secretary Saran's promise to Ambassador Moriarty that New Delhi will encourage the Bhutanese to continue identifying and repatriating the refugees, especially those in Category 1 (Ref D).  EU Views --------  5.  (C) EU Mission Development Assistance Counselor Brian O'Neill told Poloff on March 3 that the EU does not believe the time is right to press for a solution to the refugee problem.  He indicated that the EU was still interested in working together with the USG to find a solution to the problem, but that the EU was waiting for the situation in Nepal to become clearer.  Options -------  6.  (C) We do not believe that discussions of third country resettlement would lead to more expulsions by the RGOB, because Thimphu is genuinely concerned about its image on the world stage.  We have told the Bhutanese Government on a number of occasions that the refugee issue is the one issue that clouds its otherwise exemplary relations with the international community.  That said, the USG may want to reinforce to Thimphu that, if resettlement is discussed, the RGOB should not use the issue to justify further expulsions. We also need to bear in mind the USG stake in the success of Bhutan's democratic transition.  7.  (C) We also do not believe that the introduction of a \"third option\" would lead to a Bhutanese refusal to take back any refugees.  The possibility of third country resettlement is already public, and the RGOB continues to maintain its willingness to repatriate bona fide Bhutanese citizens. However, the Bhutanese Embassy has repeatedly said that only refugees classified as Category 1 fall into this group and would be allowed to return.  Were the USG to provide a clearer picture to Bhutan as to how many refugees could be resettled in third countries, Thimphu would be reassured that they would not need to accept large numbers of persons, and possibly be more willing to resume the JVT process.  In order to provide a clearer picture of possible resettlement numbers, the UNHCR surveys must first be completed.  The surveys, which UNHCR has said could be completed in approximately 8 months, would assist in finding a durable solution when the political situation in Nepal improves.  8.  (C) We believe that a high-level USG delegation to Bhutan would highlight our determination to move the process forward.  However, based on comments by the Bhutanese, such a visit would be less productive while the political situation in Nepal remains unclear, and until the Nepalese government has made a decision to allow the UNHCR surveys. 9.  (C) We believe that maintaining a dialogue with a greater \"Friends of Bhutan\" group is important and continue to meet with them on the topic.  Officers from the EU Mission and the Australian and Canadian High Commissions are traveling to Bhutan in the near future and have pledged to provide readouts of their trips.  Census ------  10.  (C) Post continues to research the Bhutanese census.  We have asked Thimphu officials for details, including a copy of the census questionnaire, and are awaiting a reply.  We are also seeking input from our local human rights contacts. Mission will report back on the likelihood that the RGOB could use this census to facilitate further expulsions. MULFORD " }

Reason 1.5 (B,D)  1. (C) Summary:  Admiral Clark, we greatly appreciate your willingness to host the upcoming visit to the USA of your counterpart, Admiral Arun Prakash, India's Chief of Naval Staff and Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee.  President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agree that Indo-US relations have \"never been as close as they are at present.\" Expanded defense cooperation has been integral to our growing ties.  We expect your interaction with Admiral Prakash will present numerous opportunities to build on our existing military cooperation and to help fulfill President Bush's vision of a long-term strategic partnership with India.  2. (C) With your help, our military cooperation program with India has expanded steadily since the waiving in September 2001 of US sanctions imposed after India's 1998 nuclear tests.  We now routinely engage in mil-mil exercises of growing scope and sophistication.  I was pleased to attend the USN hosted reception for the MALABAR 2004 Naval Exercise, which included the first visit of a US nuclear powered warship to India, the first use of the newly developed USN-IN Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), our first sub vs sub exercise, and the first use of the Navy Fuels Transfer Agreement.  In another example of our growing exercise program, during Cooperative Cope Thunder the Indian Air Force deployed four Jaguars and an IL-76 tanker to Alaska - as a demonstration of their newly acquired tanking capability. These exercises, and numerous others, were well covered in the Indian press and viewed as opportunities for the Indian military to demonstrate their professional prowess and to gain credibility as a region al power.  Our recent mil-mil cooperation in tsunami relief in Sri Lanka and elsewhere provides a template for what we expect will be increased Indo-US cooperation to manage crises and address common threats in the region from Southeast Asia to the Arabian Gulf and East Africa.  3  (C) Although our military sales relationship remains underdeveloped, the government's serious consideration of US suppliers for its next generation multi-role fighter reflects a new willingness to consider the US for a major hardware purchase.  US arms sales have struggled to overcome the perception that the US is not a dependable partner (based on our sanctions), and heavy competition from the Russians, Israelis, and French for a very price sensitive customer.  We believe a significant contract would further cement Indo-US defense ties and we continue to see good potential for the sale of P-3C Orions.  In 2004 the Indian Navy signed a LOA for Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle services worth $700,000 and they have indicated a desire to test this capability as soon as possible.  The recently enacted budget includes a 7.8 percent increase for the military to fund ongoing modernization and purchases.  4.  (C) I think you will find Admiral Prakash to be a highly professional and thoughtful officer, well disposed toward the United States, and progressive in his thinking.  He will be direct and engaging in conversation.  He attended the US Naval War College, graduating in 1990.  He has fond memories of his time in Newport, and is looking forward to the opportunity to speak at the college during this visit. Admiral Prakash is a Naval Aviator with 2,500 hours of flight time.  He attended flight training in the UK and was the first commanding officer of an Indian Navy Harrier squadron. He has commanded four ships including the Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Viraat.  He was promoted to flag rank in 1993 and as a Rear Admiral served as the Commander of the Eastern Fleet.  As Vice Admiral he served as the Commander-in-Chief, Andaman Nicobar Command (India's only operational joint command), and Commander-in-Chief, Western Naval Command.  He was appointed Chief of Naval Staff and promoted to Admiral in August 200 4 and became the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCS equivalent) in January 2005.  5.  (C) Admiral Prakash leads a highly professional, regionally dominant Navy with growing capability and blue water aspirations.  Most importantly, India shares many of our key maritime concerns - maritime terrorism, use of the seas for proliferation of WMD, safety of sea lines of communication (particularly for Arabian Gulf Oil), piracy, smuggling, and un-regulated dhow traffic.  Regrettably, we expect Admiral Prakash's leadership will be somewhat constrained by a lumbering and sometimes corrupt bureaucracy (particularly in procurement), a coalition government that includes representation of two regional Communist Parties, and some old-think (in a few cases anti-American) government officials.  We ask that you join us in continuing to search out practical, mutually beneficial ways to expand military cooperation, understanding that this is part of a long term effort to build a substantial, reliable, useful 21st century partnership with India.  A priority in this area is to bring India into the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), since it has unique assets it can bring to bear in this region. End Summary.  Background ----------  6.  (C) PM Singh's Congress Party came to power in an upset election victory over the BJP-led coalition in May 2004. Although Singh's senior advisors had been out of power for eight years, they wasted no time articulating their priorities for India's foreign and defense policies.  They have stressed that an expanded and mutually beneficial partnership between India and the US on regional and transnational security issues is a high priority for the new government.  There is still, however, lingering suspicion in some parts of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition and the GOI about this new relationship.  The PM's team is divided between modernizers who favor stronger ties with the US, and Nehruvian socialists whose views of the US have changed little since the Cold War.  The modernizers clearly are in the driver's seat, however. Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee sees practical advantage in cooperating with the US to modernize India's military equipment and strategy while advocating for transparency in defense acquisitions.  7.  (C) As noted in \"The Congress Agenda on Security, Defense, and Foreign Policy,\" the Party seeks to improve the function and transparency of India's national security decision-making process, reform the intelligence services, address Service personnel issues, and combat domestic terrorism.  Unlike the BJP which concentrated national security decision-making largely in the Prime Minister's office, Congress has a more diffuse, transparent, and collective approach which utilizes a resuscitated National Security Council (NSC), expanded Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), and reenergized Strategic Policy Group (SPG) and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB).  8.  (C) Defense Minister Mukherjee, an economist and former Foreign Minister with no defense background, will likely acquiesce to the senior Congress leadership (particularly Sonia Gandhi, who remains the power behind the throne) on matters requiring broad consensus.  A proponent of maintaining strong mil-mil ties with Russia, we expect Mukherjee to adhere to the larger Congress agenda toward the US by continuing to move US-India defense ties forward, albeit with less public rhetoric than the BJP, out of deference to the leftist parties.  Next Steps in Strategic Partnership -----------------------------------  9.  (C/NF) On September 17, the US and India signed Phase One of the President's \"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership\" (NSSP).  The NSSP lays out an ambitious path of cooperation in four strategic areas:  civil nuclear energy, civilian space programs, high-technology commerce, and dialogue on missile defense.  These areas of cooperation are designed to progress through a series of reciprocal steps that build on each other.  Completion of Phase One has enabled the US to make modifications to US export licensing policies that will foster cooperation in commercial space and civilian nuclear energy programs, remove the headquarters of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) from the Department of Commerce's \"Entities List,\" and offer an FMS sale of the PAC-2 missile defense system.  On February 22, the GOI received a classified briefing on the capabilities of the PAC-2 GEM PLUS missile defense system as a deliverable for successful completion of Phase One.  The Indian government has now requested a missile defense technical cooperation agreement of the sort we have with other key allies.  In his role as Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Prakash will have a role in shaping Indian nuclear and missile defense policy.  We believe the visit to NORAD was proposed by the Indian Navy specifically to offer Admiral Prakash a view of US policy in these areas.  10.  (S) Phase Two of the NSSP requires intensive efforts by the GOI to adopt national legislation governing technology transfer, adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime and Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines, and strengthen export controls.  In turn, the US commits to undertake cooperation on US-Indian commercial satellites, approve the sale of the PAC-2 system and offer a classified briefing on the PAC-3 system.  Until now, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has the lead in this effort, with the MOD playing a supporting role.  Regional Political-Military Issues: Tsunami Relief --------------------------------------------- -----  11. (C) The Indian military reacted exceptionally well to the recent tsunami disaster.  The rapid and effective deployment of resources to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and later Indonesia, in addition to India's hard hit Andaman and Nicobar Islands clearly demonstrated India's regional force projection capability.  At the peak of operations, the Indian Navy had 31 ships, 22 helicopters, four aircraft and 5,500 personnel assigned to disaster relief.  The Air Force, Army and Coast Guard were just as heavily involved.  The Indian military was hit hardest on the island of Car Nicobar.  The Indian air force lost 103 personnel on this island and the Navy lost about half that.  During the operation, the Indian Navy converted three hydrographic ships to 47 bed hospital ships (a design feature of the class) and sailed them to Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Chennai, India.  During the relief effort the Indian military was unusually responsive to questions about their intentions and provided almost daily briefings.  We reciprocate d with the PACOM force lay down.  The Indian government also coordinated closely with us as a founding member of the Tsunami Core Group.  Later, India provided two MPAT planners  SIPDIS to CSF-536 in Utapao, Thailand and sent an liaison officer (Indian Naval Attache in DC) to PACOM Hqs and a liaison officer to CSF-536 (Indian Air Attache in Bangkok).  This exchange of information assisted both countries in channeling relief to those areas most in need while avoiding duplication of effort.  Pakistan --------  12.  (C/NF) While India and Pakistan are currently in their most intense period of dialogue in decades, the GOI continues to place a high priority on containing Pakistan's nuclear threat.  Following the positive Indo-Pak Foreign Ministers' talks (dubbed the \"Composite Dialogue\" or \"CD\"), the successful Singh-Musharraf meeting in September, and an attempt at developing a \"Kashmir Roadmap\" based on the PM's first visit to Kashmir in November,  a mood of cautious optimism has emerged in India that Islamabad and New Delhi have indeed started on a path of sustainable rapprochement. During these recent CD meetings, India put forward a total of 72 CBMs, of which Indian FM Singh and his Pakistani counterpart FM Kasuri agreed to 13 including to: continue the LOC ceasefire; conduct a joint survey of the International Boundary along Sir Creek; implement the outcome of the August meeting of Defense Secretaries regarding the Siachen Glacier; and discuss trade cooperation.  The Ministers also agreed to technical talks on conventional and nuclear CBMs among other issues during the fall.  As expected, the two sides disagreed on infiltration levels and the centrality of Kashmir, but have expressed commitment to continue their dialogue on these issues.  The February 16 agreement to begin bus service between Srinigar and Muzaffarabad beginning April 17 has been hailed as the most important Kashmir-specific CBM since the November 2003 ceasefire.  13.  (S) Despite recent Indian allegations of mortar firing by Pakistan against Indian positions along the LOC twice in three days (January 18 and 20, 2005), both governments have responded in a measured and serious manner, conscious that the 14 months of silence along the LOC has come to symbolize the de-escalation of the Indo-Pak conflict, while providing tens of thousands of Kashmiris the longest respite from daily shelling since the 1999 Kargil War.  The ceasefire, the first formally observed in peacetime between the two countries since 1947, has fueled hopes for broader progress in military CBMs.  These instances of shelling, if they do not stop, could spill over into the Composite Dialogue and negatively affect the broad sense of goodwill that exists in India for fixing relations with Pakistan.  14.  (C/NF) Despite positive progress on these pending issues and growing acceptance of \"de-hyphenating\" America's relationships with the two neighbors, reports in the Indian press of possible renewed consideration of F-16 sales to Pakistan has brought long-held fears to the fore again.  The widely-held view in India is that such weapons are inappropriate for destroying terrorist assets and that Islamabad ultimately seeks F-16s as a nuclear weapons delivery system to be used against New Delhi, thereby sparking a regional arms race.  Moreover, Indians often complain of a lack of balance in US policy which Indians believe favors Pakistan.  The US is seen as soft on proliferation issues regarding Pakistan and harsh in its judgment on India.  The fear among the Indian security and military establishment is that new weapons for Pakistan will cause Pakistan to become more aggressive against India.  Siachen Glacier ---------------  15.  (C) In 1984, India and Pakistan occupied parts of the Siachen Glacier and the Saltoro Ridge, which became the highest altitude battleground in the world.  Siachen is politically relevant as it is linked to unresolved border disputes with Pakistan and China.  This remote region lacks military strategic relevance, leading many Indians to question the economic cost of such a burdensome deployment. In 1994, in an effort to lower tensions, New Delhi and Islamabad almost reached an agreement on demilitarizing the Glacier.  If redeployment/demilitarization along the Siachen Glacier were to take place, monitoring mechanisms would need to be implemented to provide both sides confidence that reoccupation of the ridge lines was not occurring.  The cease-fire along the LOC on the Glacier, in effect since November 26, 2003, remains in effect, and the two sides continue to discuss the matter as part of the Composite Dialogue.  India's main demand is that positions currently occupied by both armies be verified.  Afghanistan -----------  16.  (C) On Afghanistan, India has backed up its strong political support for President Karzai with generous economic assistance (over $500 million).  India provided in-kind assistance for the October elections, has offered to assist in training Afghan diplomats, army, and police, and has committed to construction of a power line connecting Kabul to Baghlan province in the north.  With the imminent completion of the GOI program to outfit the ANA with military vehicles, New Delhi is now assessing what more India might do to assist with the Afghan Army's development.  Iran ----  17.  (C) India views Iran as a source of energy, a corridor for trade to Central Asia (most importantly to Afghanistan), a partner in stabilizing Afghanistan, and as a counterweight in Pakistan's regional calculations.  Increased high-level exchanges and intensified cooperation in the energy sector illustrate the degree to which the GOI values the relationship.  There has been considerable movement recently in the Indian position on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline.  India has removed its MFN and transit corridor conditions and given Cabinet backing for the Petroleum Minister to negotiate with Iran and Pakistan.  At the same time, the GOI is strongly opposed to Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons.  New Delhi is pursuing a low-key but engaged policy toward Iran, attempting to achieve its strategic goals in the Gulf without jeopardizing its growing ties with the US or Israel.  New Delhi portrays itself as a moderating influence on Tehran, particularly on nuclear issues where Indian and US interests o n nonproliferation converge.  Nepal ----- 18.  (C) New Delhi responded swiftly and with unusual firmness to King Gyanendra's February 1 decision to dissolve the multiparty government in Nepal and reserve all power for himself, calling the action \"a serious setback to the cause of democracy.\"  The GOI has expressed a strong desire to coordinate with the United States as the situation unfolds in Kathmandu and remains concerned about the effect of the King's actions on the ongoing Maoist insurgency.  Prior to these developments, New Delhi had expressed concerns about the Maoist influence in Nepal, the potential for violence and political instability to spill over into India, and repercussions for Indian interests in Nepal.  The US and GOI have coordinated closely in response to the coup, providing a template for the sort of security partnership we would like to apply elsewhere.  Although we have not joined India in publicly declaring a suspension on supplies of weapons, the US and India broadly agree on the problem and the way forward.  Bangladesh ----------  19.  (C) The wave of terrorist attacks in early October in the northeastern Indian states of Nagaland and Assam are raising alarms that violence and political instability in Bangladesh are now affecting India, courtesy of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA).  These follow other incidents such as the August attack on former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and seizure of a major arms shipment in Chittagong in April.  Dhaka has accused New Delhi of contributing to its deteriorating political situation while Delhi maintains that the source of Bangladesh's problems is Islamic fundamentalism and terrorists the GOB is unwilling or unable to control.  Despite these differences, both countries' Foreign Ministers recently agreed to work together to address each others' security concerns.  The GOI is also considering increasing its deployment of security forces along its border with Bangladesh and constructing a fence, similar to the LOC fence in Kashmir, along the border.  Iraq ----  20.  (C) The escalating violence in Iraq, including the taking of Indian hostages in July (who were subsequently released), stories of abuse of prisoners, and inaccurate reports of mistreatment of Indian laborers by US forces and companies in Iraq have hardened public opinion against Coalition activities.  The GOI, however, has a strong interest in stability in Iraq and wants to preserve its historic cultural, economic and political links with Baghdad.  Although their line remains firm against sending troops to Iraq, the GOI has already disbursed half of its $20 million commitment to Iraqi reconstruction, split evenly between the UN and World Bank Trust Funds.  21.  (C) Despite the GOI's deliberately low profile public and material support in the run-up to the elections, Indian Government, media, and other observers welcomed the successful completion of Iraq's first election on January 30.  The MEA called the election a \"noteworthy development\" and reaffirmed Iraq's strategic importance to New Delhi. Circumspect about engaging the interim regime, the GOI will likely engage the new Baghdad government with more conviction, although practical and security concerns and continued opposition from India's left wing parties will present obstacles to a more visible Indian presence in the near future.  China -----  22.  (U) India's \"Look East\" policy, initiated in the 1990s, envisions India as an equal player in the greater Asian community, ideally and eventually as influential as China. Beijing, on the other hand, does not view New Delhi as a geographic, strategic, or economic peer.  Dialogue on the long-standing border dispute between the two countries plods along with minor progress, the most recent being the designation of trade markets on both sides of the disputed border in August.  While India's direct dispute with China about its border does not present much of a hurdle, China's supply of material and technology to rival Pakistan has been a more formidable obstacle to relations between the two countries.  Much of India's political class continues to see China as a long term military, economic, and political challenge if not threat.  Russia ------  23.  (C) By far the largest supplier of military equipment to India for decades, Russia's exceptional military relationship with the country is guaranteed for a long time to come and was reaffirmed by Russian President Putin's December 04 visit to Delhi.  The inconsistent quality of Russian-made materiel as well as the difficulty of obtaining spares since the break-up of the Soviet Union are common complaints among the Indian military.  The Indians, however, are shopping more on the global market for other sources of weaponry -- namely Israel and France -- to improve their military capabilities. While not reneging on its traditionally strong bond to Russia, the Congress Party has made it clear that more effort must be spent on fostering India's relationship with the US on a variety of fronts, especially in the areas of defense and high-tech.  Israel ------  24.  (C) Despite the return to power of India's traditionally pro-Palestinian Congress party, the robust Indo-Israeli relationship established under the previous government does not appear to have lost steam.  This is largely a result of India's growing reliance on Israel for military hardware, technology, and training, and Israel's streamlined and less public arms sales process.  Although official figures are not available, Israel appears to be India's number two supplier of military hardware (behind Russia).  Most recently, India signed a $1.5 billion contract for three Phalcon airborne radars.  Previous deals included infantry and special forces equipment, UAVs, aircraft avionics, Barak missiles, sensors for defense above the LOC, Green Pine radars, and assorted munitions.  New Delhi is also considering acquiring the Arrow ATBM from Israel, and is a strong contender for a multi-billion dollar contract to upgrade and modernize the Indian Army's artillery.  Recent reciprocal visits by top brass from both arm ies are paving the way for the first ever joint military exercises between the two countries which may be held in India some time in 2005.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) ----------------------------  25. (SBU) Reliability and Responsiveness of the USG - The Indians remain concerned about the reliability (i.e., no sanctions) and responsiveness of the US as a defense supplier in general, although less so than previously.  These concerns emanate from past experience with sanctions and delays in responding to requests for information and pricing data. Four rounds of sanctions over the years have left some within GOI with the impression that the US is not a reliable defense supplier and that we practice \"light switch\" diplomacy.  The sanctions that followed the 1998 nuclear tests in particular left a deeply negative impression because they cut off military supplies not just from the US, but also from third party sources that contained US components.  On 1 December 2004, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Prakash sent a letter to Admiral Doran expressing concerns about the status of FMS and security assistance issues.  Three main issues raised concern the Sub-Rescue contract, P-3 Orion, and Aviation Training. Admir al Doran replied on 14 January 2005 with details on the status of each program.  26. (U) Aero India the largest aerospace tradeshow in South Asia, took place from 9-13 February 2005 at the Yelahanka Indian Air Force Base in Bangalore.  The centerpiece of press attention for Aero India 2005 was the participation of five US military aircraft on static display and fifteen US defense contractors.  The US demonstrated the largest foreign presence at this show.  Two themes emerged from Aero India: 1) All MoD officials and military personnel were very pleased and impressed with the USG's participation in this event and 2) There are still serious doubts about the USG's reliability as a defense supplier.  Having established the seriousness of US commitment to competing in the Indian arms market, the challenge now is to come to the table in a timely fashion with competitively priced products for a major military platform.  27.  (SBU) P3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft - In response to their request, the Indian Navy was provided P&A data in September 2003 for 8 P-3B(H) Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft.   These aircraft would be brought out of long-term storage and fully refurbished, bringing them up to P-3C Plus capability.  The total case value for 8 aircraft with associated weapons, equipment, spares and training would be approximately $1 Billion.  When the Indian Navy learned that P-3Cs might be available they expressed interest in these aircraft instead of the P-3Bs.  A P-3C aircraft and sensor package has since been cleared for release to India and a weapons package is under development.  The US Navy's International Programs Office sent a delegation to New Delhi from February 15-16, to discuss P&A information for P-3C with the Indian Navy.  Currently, the US Navy's International Programs Office is exploring Indian Navy requests for the \"hot\" transfer of one or two P-3Cs to the Indian Navy and is exploring the possibili ty of lowering the total costs of this proposed sale.  28.  (SBU) SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters - In September 2003 the Indian Navy requested pricing data for the purchase of 16 Sea Hawk helicopters to replace their aging Sea Kings.  This P&A data is expected in early 2005. ODC has learned that GOI will probably release a global Request for Proposal (RFP) to meet this requirement.  If that happens the Sea Hawk will face stiff competition from French and Russian aircraft, which are likely to be aggressively priced.  29.  (SBU) E-2C Hawkeye aircraft - In July 2003 Northrop Grumman provided the Indian Navy with an open source brief on the E-2C Hawkeye, which led to a request for P&A data for 6 aircraft.  This P&A data has just arrived, with a total case value of approximately $1.3 Billion for 6 aircraft and associated equipment.  The Indian Navy's interest in the Hawkeye waned however, when they learned that it would not be able to operate from their newly acquired aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov.  As a result, the Hawkeye sale is on hold for the foreseeable future.  30.  (C) Deep Sea Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) - The DSRV case was initially opened in 1997 but was suspended in 1998 due to sanctions.  The case was restarted after September 2001.  In March 2004, the Indian Navy approved an amendment to the DSRV case and made an initial deposit of $158,425.  The total value of the DSRV amendment is $734,443.  ODC is currently working with the Indian Navy to update the DSRV case to allow for modifications to their model 209 submarines so they are compatible with the DSRV.  The Indian Navy has indicated their desire to conduct a demonstration of this rescue capability.  31.  (C) Excess Defense Articles.  On 15 February the Indian Navy was briefed by Navy IPO that the US will be retiring MHC and LPD class ships in FY 2006 and 2007.  The Indian Navy has indicated an interest in these vessels and specifically asked that this information be kept confidential (possibly to avoid interference from Indian shipyards).  Challenges to Defense Cooperation with India --------------------------------------------  32. (SBU) The Indian bureaucracy is large and slow moving. Every case revolves around a \"file\" that contains everything related to the case and which must physically move from one agency to another for approval.  There is little delegation of authority, so decisions of any importance are made at very high levels.  In general, decisions are made by committee, which diffuses responsibility and is a legacy of past arms scandals.  One by-product of past arms scandals is that the Indians are beginning to prefer FMS to DCS for defense sales because government-to-government transactions have less potential for allegations of corruption.  US-India Joint Military Exercises Continue to Expand --------------------------------------------- -------  33. (C) Since sanctions were waived in September 2001, we have conducted a series of bilateral exercises of increasing scope and sophistication with the Indian Navy.  The fifth and largest 'Malabar' exercise was conducted from October 1-10 off the south Indian Coast and featured ASW, AAW, SUW, and VBSS exercises.  For the first time we utilized the IN-USN Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which were perceived to significantly ease the planning process and set the stage for even more sophisticated exercises.  These SOPs will be reviewed, enhanced and expanded during the Malabar 05 planning conferences.  The exercise also featured the first sub vs sub event, the first port visit of a US nuclear powered warship to India, and the first use of the Navy to Navy fuel transfer agreement (which we hope will ultimately open the door for an ACSA).  We have proposed that Malabar 05 include the Indian aircraft carrier Viraat, and Malabar 06 include a US carrier.  Despite numerous requests, the Indian Navy has not inclu ded a KILO class submarine in any of our exercises.  34.  (C) Exercise Flash Iroquois with USN SEALS and Indian Maritime Commandos (MARCOS) was conducted in October 2004 in a training area south of Mumbai. The focus was on ship intervention.  Also Indian MARCOS participated in the EOD exercise, Spitting Cobra with EODMU Five in January 2005. Finally, US warships are stopping routinely in Chennai, Cochin and Mumbai for refueling, crew rest and recreation.  35. (C) Future exercises in 2005 will include only the Malabar 05. A Flash Iroquois Special operations exercise involving SEALs was not scheduled due to operational commitments of the SEALs.  The planned Search and Rescue exercise (SAREX) has been postponed to CY 2006 due to funding issues (PACFLT) and a desire to conduct a more sophisticated exercise by the Indian Navy.  The Indian Navy would like this exercise to include a submarine rescue phase and to actually test the DSRV capability purchased through FMS.  An Evolving View on Indian Ocean Security -----------------------------------------  36. (C) Indian Ocean security issues have become increasingly important in GOI strategic thinking as India has become more dependent on foreign sources of energy (primarily oil and natural gas), while deepening its commercial and security ties to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.  The Indian Navy considers its area of responsibility to extend from the Strait of Hormuz to the East Coast of Africa to the Strait of Malacca.  This strategic perception drives the Indian Navy's desire to interact with US forces outside the PACOM's AOR.  37. (C) During the Cold War, India was highly sensitive to the US presence in the Indian Ocean.  Indian think tanks and politicians used to routinely criticize and make issue of the US presence on Diego Garcia.  Indian security agencies for decades reported fictitious US efforts to build bases or acquire basing rights in the region.  Although some suspicions of USG strategic objectives in the Indian Ocean persist among left wing politicians, intelligence agencies, and old-school defense analysts, there has been a dramatic change in Indian perceptions of both their role and the US role in Indian Ocean security for the following reasons:  A. (C) Today India is more cognizant that their Indian Ocean security concerns can only be met in an atmosphere of cooperation and coordination with regional countries and particularly with the US.  They are looking at peaceful non-military areas, such as search and rescue, anti-piracy and smuggling interdiction, where they can lead and influence their regional partners.  Participating with the US in exercises, joint patrolling, etc., enhances India's role as a leader in maintaining maritime security in the Indian Ocean.  B. (C) India and the US have common interests in energy security, and the USN plays a critical role in assuring safe oil supplies and freedom of navigation against various threats in the northern Indian Ocean.  C. (C) India has a growing perception that China is attempting to increase its influence around the Indian Ocean.  Indians have complained for years about Chinese transfers of military technology and arms to Pakistan and Burma, but now they worry about China's efforts to enhance its ability to protect its sea lines of communication with energy sources in the Persian Gulf.  Indian analysts are worried specifically about reports that China has built a radar station for Burma in the great Coco islands (with a good view of the Indian missile test site in Orissa) and is involved in up-grading the port at Gwadar in western Pakistan.  China's military infrastructure modernization on the Tibetan plateau completes the encirclement in Indian eyes.  The Indian Navy is very conscious of the ongoing modernization and expanding operating area of the PLA(N).  PSI, CSI, RMSI --------------  38. (C) Despite skepticism among some strategic commentators, New Delhi continues to express interest in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and other maritime security initiatives, but not as a junior member and not without concern about possible contravention of international maritime conventions.  The GOI continues to inquire about the status of the PSI Core Group, suggesting India be offered Core Group membership (or that the Core Group be disbanded) before it will consider participation in the initiative.  We are urging Washington to respond to India's approaches, believing that PSI is a vehicle for bringing India into the global counter-proliferation community and changing India's historic role as a regime outsider.  In contrast, the GOI has agreed to join the Container Security Initiative (CSI).  This may be a stepping-stone toward greater cooperation with India on other maritime security issues, outside the political obstacles posed by PSI.  Indian Navy leaders see RMSI as an interesting conce pt that has yet to take shape.  IN-USN relations -----------------  39. (C) Indian Naval doctrine is similar to that of the US, but on a regional vice global scale.  The four key elements are:  -- Protection of India's sea lines of communication -- Maintenance of regional influence -- Protection of India's maritime interests -- Regional projection of power  40. (C) India has by far the most capable navy among North Indian Ocean countries.  Although they generally operate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they occasionally deploy to the South China Sea, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea.  They clearly have blue water strategic aspirations.  After years of funding shortfalls, the Indian Navy shipbuilding budget was increased in 1998.  The navy has inducted three new destroyers and two frigates in the last four years.  Though bogged down by bureaucracy, the Indians have active procurement and construction programs, including designing and building a nuclear submarine and an indigenous aircraft carrier.  Reduced to only one aging aircraft carrier, India has been under pressure to find a replacement.  With the indigenous aircraft carrier (called the Air Defense Ship) not expected to be ready until 2010, India signed an approximate $700 million deal on January 20, 2004 with Russia to have the Admiral Gorshkov refitted.  The deal was negotiated over a deca de, and the project is expected to take five years to complete.  The Brahmos cruise missile developed in partnership with Russia may provide the Indian Navy with a credible land attack capability, which along with nuclear submarines (to overcome the speed and endurance limitations of their diesels) are seen as necessities for the future.  Likely Indian Themes during the Visit -------------------------------------  41. (C) In the context of the four key elements of Indian Navy strategy, Admiral Prakash will likely raise the following issues during your visit.  A. (C) Protection of sea lines of communication.  In discussing Indian Navy issues, senior officers often note that protection of India's sea lines of communication is one of the principal areas where interaction with the USN should expand.  The Indian Navy has a growing responsibility for ensuring the security of the ocean transit routes through the Indian Ocean.  Indian ocean security challenges faced by the Indian navy include: Indian oil and gas imports come principally through the Strait of Hormuz; smuggling of arms and drugs in the vicinity of Sri Lanka in support of the LTTE; arms and drug smuggling as well as heavy traffic in illegal animal skins from along the Bangladesh and Thailand coast; unregulated dhow traffic and the Strait of Malacca presenting a continuing threat of piracy to commercial traffic.  India has a vital national stake in maintaining the SLOCs, and her geographic position is such that she could become a primary contributor to Indian Ocean security.  This area could be the future key stone for engagement with the Indian Navy.  B. (C) Maintenance of regional influence. The government of India is using the Indian Navy more and more as a diplomatic tool.  Indian Navy goodwill tours to Southeast Asia and the gulf countries are regular events, meant not only to show the Indian flag, but also to demonstrate that India's interests extend beyond the Indian EEZ.  The GOI, however, is very sensitive to perceptions by Indian Ocean countries as to their intentions.  As an example, when considering the US request for IN ships to escort high value shipping in support of OEF, the GOI informed each of the countries neighboring the Strait of Malacca as to the reason for Indian navy presence in the strait. In many ways, interactions and operations with the USN legitimize the Indian Navy (and by extension India's) presence throughout the region.  -- The Indian Navy is very keen to develop relationships with NAVCENT.  India sees the Gulf region as within a sphere of national security interest, that goes beyond the Indo-Pak rivalry.  India requires oil, it has business interests, and has millions of citizens working in the Gulf region who repatriate 5-6 billion dollars in remittances annually. Accordingly, India needs strategic relationships and sees a naval role in providing security for the country's interests.  As the US is the principal guarantor of energy security in the Gulf region, Indian strategists consider some sort of cooperative atmosphere with the US military in the Middle East imperative.  The Indians will continue to seek ways to interact with US forces in the Middle East, including sending ships to the region and asking for direct channels of dialogue on regional issues (beyond Pakistan) with either CENTCOM or the Joint Staff.  In this context Admiral Prakash may suggest establishing \"Staff Talks\" at the Navy Headquarters level noting t hat existing talks with Seventh Fleet do not cover all of his concerns regarding the North Arabian Sea and Arabian Gulf. They will also continue to press for low level dialogue including periodic visits by Indian officials to CENTCOM headquarters in Florida and calls by their middle eastern military attache's on NAVCENT headquarters in Bahrain.  C. (C) Protection of India's Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Though still quite undeveloped, India sees their EEZ as a future source of natural resources for a growing population. Environmental security issues such as oil spill prevention and cleanup, protection of oil rigs, husbanding of fishing resources, and ocean floor exploration are becoming areas of possible future cooperation.  We have a different perspective on UNCLOS with regard to the presence of USN hydrographic vessels in the Indian EEZ.  They diplomatically protest the presence of our vessels and the media reports the incidents as US \"spying.\"  The July 2004 visit of the USNS Mary Sears (at India's invitation) for a hydrographic subject matter expert exchange was cancelled due to their demands to limit/control the use of her equipment while within the Indian EEZ.  D. (C) Regional projection of power.  The Indian Navy watched the US naval role in Afghanistan and in the Iraq war with great interest.  The ability of the USN to carry the fight to a landlocked country made a strong impression on the GOI. Accordingly, there is a rethink going on within the Indian Navy as to their ability to project power ashore, which is critical to the Navy's interest in playing a more decisive role in any future conflict with Pakistan.  This is in contrast to the current emphasis on sea control.  The Indian Navy staff has asked us in the past for any information that could be provided describing USN operations with respect to Afghanistan and Iraq.  Very little unclassified information is currently available, and any discussion in this area would be very much appreciated.  Additionally, it should be noted that the Navy to Navy Fuel Transfer Agreement would allow Indian ships operating in the South China Sea or Mediterranean to received fuel from a US tanker.  This would be a good way of de monstrating the value of such agreements and preparing the way for approval of an ACSA which has made little progress through the Indian MOD bureaucracy.  The Indian Navy recently advised that they would be sending a warship (probably a Delhi Class DDG) to the International Fleet Review in Portsmouth UK scheduled for June 28.  They have suggested exercising with the Sixth Fleet during the return transit of the Indian ship.  Future Indian and US Navy Cooperation -------------------------------------  42. (S) During the recently concluded Navy Executive Steering Group (ESG) meetings in November 2004, VADM Mehta (Deputy Chief of Naval Staff) pointed out that the area is a volatile region that affects the entire world.  He noted that piracy, fundamentalism, and religious bias within the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean required both Navies to work together towards interoperability and to create a system for the exchange of information for mutual benefit.  He stated that he was looking for increased scope and complexity with the Malabar Exercise series as well as an exchange of actionable intelligence on a regular basis through a combined data-link.  VADM Mehta noted that several US courses have been completed by Indian Naval personnel and the desire was to pursue higher level courses in fields such as LOFAR, EW, and Network Centric Operations.  He also stated that they are ready to respond to US requests for training in India.  He noted that development of the SOP and Navy to Navy Fuel Agreement were g ood starts in bilateral cooperation.  43. (S/NF) We have been exchanging intelligence information with the Indian Navy under the Morning Dew Intelligence Exchange Agreement.  Although we provide information to the Indian Navy routinely through the bilateral (secret rel India) circuit they have provided little in return.  For their part, the Indian Navy has voiced dissatisfaction with the type of information provided.  They routinely request \"actionable\" intelligence.  During RADM Porterfield's 9-12 January visit the Indian Navy was provided with detailed information about two high interest vessels.  The Indian Navy has responded quickly with useful information regarding one of the vessels (in an Indian port) and promised more to follow.  They recently provided photographs of the Chinese heavy lift craft Tai An Kou carrying a PLA(N) KILO Class submarine from Russia back to China through the Indian Ocean.  If this continues, we will have moved to a new and far more satisfying level of cooperation.  44.  (C) One key element that will make more robust exercises (and operations) possible in the future is reliable, encrypted communications and the sharing of a common operational picture.  We expect CENTRIX (to be used in Malabar 2005) will provide the heretofore missing link.  45.  (C) Port visits to India continue at about one per quarter.  Last visit was USS Blue Ridge in Goa, 15-18 February 2005.  During the July 2004 visit of USS Cushing to Mumbai, the local Foreigners Regional Registration Office (INS equivalent) demanded a \"crew list\" from the ship and, in accordance with policy, the CO refused.  The FRRO then refused to process visa applications for two sailors departing on emergency leave.  The Charge appealed to the Ministry for External Affairs and was able to obtain the visas.  Diplomatic approval for subsequent visits has been contingent on the ship providing a \"Shore Party List\" of names only, of those departing the ship and entering India. Four ships have visited India under this regime without incident.  The Indian Navy views this issue as outside their purview.  Conclusion ----------  46. (C) India's leaders see the advantages of a closer defense relationship with the US.  During his visit, Admiral Prakash will explore various avenues for expanding our existing cooperation.  It is in our common interest to work as partners in resolving the regions security issues.  A strong USN-IN relationship strengthens our ability to influence IN decision making in times of crisis and prepares us for the common challenges for Asian stability in the decades ahead.  This is a necessarily slow and painstaking process.  We are working to develop habits of cooperation and trust that will grow in the years to come.  47. (C) Once again, we appreciate the opportunity your invitation to Admiral Prakash presents.  We look forward to hearing of the progress achieved during his visit. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: Following a week of political turmoil in which Congress has taken a beating for playing fast and rough with the democratic process in several states, the party leadership moved to install a cleaner politician as Chief Minister of Haryana.  Bhupinder Singh Hooda, a longtime Congress loyalist and a dark horse contender, was chosen for his anti-corruption credentials and clean political image. Hooda's selection suggests an effort by the party do some damage control after the Goa and Jharkhand election missteps and to rebuild its image.  End Summary.  Dark Horse Victory ------------------  2.  (C) Senior Congress and Jat (predominantly a caste engaged in agricultural) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda represents a new generation of Haryana political leaders. Although press reports indicated that he and former Chief Minister Bhajan Lal were the two top contenders to become Chief Minister, Congress insider Randeep Surjewala told the Mission that Hooda was never seriously discussed for the post and that the Congress had decided on Lal.  After Congress was accused of attempting to impose governments on Goa and Jharkhand, Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel, and other powerful Congress leaders purportedly urged party President Sonia Gandhi to drop Lal, who has been linked with corruption and unethical political practices, and to replace him with Hooda, who has a reputation as a relatively clean politician.  Expanding Congress, Base ------------------------  3.  (C) Caste factors also helped tip the scales in Hooda's favor, with Mrs. Gandhi accepting the argument that Hooda's appointment would expand the party's base among crucial Jat electorates in neighboring Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  Both states are currently ruled by non-Congress governments, and have been targeted for takeover attempts.  Hooda had carefully cultivated the Jats by encouraging their aspirations to have \"one of their own\" as Chief Minister, instead of the long-serving Lal, who is from a small, non-Jat caste.  4.  (C) Well-connected television journalist Harish Gupta confirmed Surjewala's assessment, telling us that Ahmed Patel, Rahul Gandhi, and other influential Congress leaders argued to Mrs. Gandhi that following the fiascos in Goa and Jharkhand, the party had to cultivate a cleaner image.  Hurdles for Hooda -----------------  5.  (SBU) Hooda, however, faces numerous challenges.  He will have to resign his Lok Sabha seat and win election to the Haryana State Assembly within six months, and he may have difficulty fulfilling his election promises.  Hooda, who projected himself as a \"crusader against corruption,\" will have to establish and maintain a clean administration, a difficult task in a a state known for its corrupt politicians.  This will be of particular interest to us in the fast growing Gurgaon corridor, home to many US corporates.  Hooda is likely to institute a thorough and impartial investigation into the alleged massive corruption against ousted Chief Minister and rival Jat leader Om Prakash Chautala, which could further roil the state's politics.  Party Stalwart --------------  6.  (U) A longtime Congress activist, Hooda began his political career under the patronage of his cousin, Birender Singh, a former Haryana Congress President.  He served as the block Congress Committee president from 1972 to 1977, Haryana State Youth Congress senior vice-president from 1980 to 1982, and headed a district development council from 1983 to 1987. He entered mainstream politics in 1991 when he won a Parliamentary seat with a surprise upset victory against Devi Lal, the patriarch of Haryana politics.  He became a Congress Committee Member in 1992, and served as the Haryana Congress Parliamentary Group convenor from 1994 to 1996.  His only stint in the state assembly came in 1996, but he resigned after being elected to the Lok Sabha.  His career received a boost when then AICC President, Sita Ram Kesri, appointed him President of the Haryana Congress in 1997 following Congress,s 1996 resounding defeat.  He was elected to the Lower House for the fourth time in 1998.  Bio Data --------  7.  (U) Known as \"Bhupi\" to his friends, Hooda was born on September 15, 1947 -- one month after India's Independence -- in a village in Haryana's Rohtak district.  The son of veteran parliamentarian Choudhary Ranbir Singh, he is a farmer and lawyer by profession.  He holds a BA and an LLB degree from Punjab University, Chandigarh, and Delhi University, respectively.  His wife, Asha, has an MA in English.  The couple have a son and a daughter.  His interests range from social service to reading to sports, and he has traveled extensively.   Comment -------  8.  (C) Hooda's selection indicates that Mrs. Gandhi and her inner circle have determined that Congress must adopt a more defensive strategy following the failure of takeover attempts in Jharkhand and Goa.  Congress appears set to embark on a large damage control exercise, stressing clean politics and anti-corruption, in an attempt to rebuild an image that was badly eroded by the Jharkhand/Goa missteps.  Congress leaders, such as Bhajan Lal, who have a track record of corruption and manipulation may be set aside for now in favor of those with cleaner reputations.  Although the chastened Lal has for now accepted defeat gracefully, there is the potential for the politically astute, \"old war horse\" to cause trouble in the future.  He has a history of cobbling together defectors from other parties, and could play a spoiler role for the Congress down the road. MULFORD " }

Blake Jr, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (S) Summary:  During a highly-anticipated February 22 briefing on the Patriot Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2) missile defense system, GOI and USG representatives cited the exchange as evidence of the transformed Indo-US relationship.  Throughout the session, GOI statements and questions indicated a keen interest not only in procurement, but opportunities for technology sharing to include collaboration and joint-production.  Questions from the Indian delegation focused on PAC-2 performance parameters, shelf life, capabilities compared to Israel's Arrow system, US missile defense deployment plans, and possibilities for technology transfer and co-production.  The GOI delegation was well aware that the briefing was limited to PAC-2 and posed few questions beyond that scope, although some specific technical questions will require follow-up.  In separate follow-on conversations with MEA Additional Secretary (International Security) Meera Shankar and MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar on February 23, US representatives expressed their willingness to keep the PAC-2 dialogue open if the GOI has a continued interest.  Shankar clarified the status of India's missile defense planning and specifically requested a MD technical collaboration agreement with the US.  End Summary.  Partnership Delivers PAC-2 Briefing -----------------------------------  2.  (SBU) In his opening remarks, head of the Indian delegation MOD Joint Secretary Gautam Mukhopadhaya heralded the PAC-2 briefing as the result of achievements in the Indo-US political relationship.  He welcomed the briefing as an indication of both countries, willingness to \"step into more advanced areas of defense technology; not limited to procurement, but also including joint development.\"  While missile defense (MD) has \"a certain cachet\" in the press, Mukhopadhaya hoped this briefing would address the GOI's technical questions about such a system.  Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Director for Middle East, Asia and North Africa Ed Ross expressed appreciation for the \"active and progressive\" defense relationship that was developing between the two countries, and underscored that a briefing on \"cutting edge technology\" such as the PAC-2 is given only to \"our closest friends.\"  US Policy and Planning for Missile Defense ------------------------------------------  3.  (C) Phil Jamison, OSD/ISP Assistant for Missile Defense Policy, outlined the US approach to MD:  field modest capabilities in 2004-05; add capabilities through research and development; and seek cooperation with allies.  He noted that the addition of MD to the US defense posture has lessened dependence on nuclear forces for protection.  In STRATCOM's plan for 2005, ten ground-based interceptors and up to 20 sea-based interceptors will be added, and other radars and laser systems added or upgraded.  Another defense layer will be developed in 2006-08 by the addition of more ground- and sea-based interceptors and radars.  US Combatant Commanders are currently undertaking operational planning for MD in their AORs and the services have begun to man and train for MD missions.  David Kiefer of the Missile Defense Agency gave an overview of the US missile defense program,s goals, major components, current status and future plans.  Patriot System Overview for India ---------------------------------  4.  (S) Major John Eggert, US Army Staff, briefed the Patriot Configuration-3 Ground system and the PAC-2 Guidance Enhanced Missile Plus (GEM ) missile.  He enumerated improvements to Ground Configuration-3 over previous versions, to include upgraded radar and software, and remote launch capability. He gave a detailed depiction of system components and how they function and work together using \"Track Via Missile\" technology, and described a typical US Patriot battery.  He also praised the long shelf-life and minimal maintenance requirements for the PAC-2 GEM  missile.  Eggert reported the perfect record of the Patriot system during OIF -- all nine theater ballistic missiles defined as a threat to protected assets were successfully intercepted.  Finally, he displayed multiple diagrams showing PAC-2 GEM  performance against missiles launched from different distances. In addition, the presentation also included GEM  performance against fixed wing and cruise missile threats.  (Note:  Per standard guidance for such briefings, the Indian delegation was shown classified slides, but were not given hard copies of the briefing.)  5.  (S) Questions from the Indian side included the following:  -- What special waveforms does the system use to discriminate between decoys and warheads/re-entry vehicles? -- What is the maximum detection range and altitude? -- What is the maximum detection range and altitude in cued mode (i.e. when prompted by an outside detection system)? -- What is the minimum time and distance in which a missile threat can be engaged? -- What is the total area one Patriot battery defends? -- Has protection envelope data been verified by actual missile firings? -- What is the maximum range to hit a C-130 flying at an altitude of 5000-6000 meters? -- What is a PAC-2 GEM  missile's time/range to self-destruction? -- How does Patriot handle multiple missiles launched at the same target? -- How does the missile complete its end game intercept, and can it do so without radar updates? -- What redundancies exist in case of radar failure? -- Can control of missile launchers be transferred if one battery goes down? -- How much time is required to pack up a Patriot battery, move it, and set it back up again? -- What is the \"dead zone,\" or minimum range for the PAC-2 to detect/engage a threat? -- What Aegis radar upgrades are taking place (in relation to integration with Patriot)? -- What is the weight of the PAC-2 GEM  warhead? -- How does Patriot compare to Israel's Arrow missile defense system? -- At this stage of the NSSP (Next Steps in Strategic Partnership), what kinds of information are you authorized to share? -- Has transfer of technology occurred with other countries buying Patriot? -- Has there been collaboration with other countries on PAC-3? -- Does the US have overarching missile cooperation arrangements with major partners, and does it involve technology sharing? -- Are other countries acquiring components of an overarching missile defense system? -- How effective is Patriot as a stand-alone system (i.e. without space-based cueing)? -- What is being developed beyond PAC-3? -- What is the status of MEADS (Medium Extended Air Defense System)? -- Will MEADS have a sea-based component? -- What is the time frame for MEADS to be deployed?  6.  (S) An open-ended question and answer period allowed the Indian delegation to ask questions.  They seemed satisfied with most of the answers, but did ask a few questions that were beyond the scope of the briefing, such as Patriot operation in \"cued mode,\" Aegis integration, and a request for more information on \"special wave forms\" for target discrimination.  The briefer did not have information to respond to a question about the weight of the PAC-2 GEM warhead, but offered to get the answer for the Indian side.  FMS Process -----------  7.  (C) Following the briefing on PAC-2 capabilities, DSCA Director Ross highlighted differences and advantages of the FMS process over direct commercial sales, namely, that FMS includes USG engagement from the earliest stages of an acquisition.  Not only does an FMS sale normally guarantee lifetime system support and a purchase price negotiated by, and at the same cost available to, the USG, but also, more importantly, it fosters a strong working relationship, which can facilitate acquisition of other sensitive technologies. He briefly outlined the initial steps in a successful FMS deal: 1) Notify DSCA early regarding requirements; 2) Submit requirements in a Letter of Request; then 3) USG reviews and responds in a Letter of Offer and Acceptance with pricing and availability data.  Follow-on MEA Dialogue ----------------------  8.  (C) In a follow-on meeting with MEA Americas Joint Secretary S. Jaishankar on February 23, Ross commented that  SIPDIS the PAC-2 exchange was very forthcoming, and asked if Jaishankar had any feedback from the Indian side.  Jaishankar responded that it will take a little time for him to receive feedback, but said he did gather that on some questions, it was not possible for the US side to provide a response at this time.  Jaishankar thought the briefing was helpful for the GOI, and said that at this stage of India,s effort to determine its missile defense needs; &every bit (of information) we get8 is useful for India,s thought process.  He noted a tendency in this type of meeting for Indian questioners to keep pressing, \"Until you hit a wall.\" Jaishankar noted that conceptually, India is at a very early stage in its thought process on missile defense.  9.  (C) Jaishankar asserted that, as a recent nuclear power, India brings few Cold War prejudices to its missile defense consideration.  As a point of reference, he said the GOI is looking very closely at what Japan and Taiwan are doing with missile defense.  Remarking on recent MD debate in the Indian press, Jaishankar observed that some commentators argue in favor of MD as a means of \"adding to the uncertainties\" of those who might launch nuclear weapons.  10.  (C) Ross commented that while many believe the US is making missile defense available as part of its own overarching MD program, a future PAC-2 sale to India would be strictly for India's own use.  In reference to India's interest in the PAC-3 system, Ross explained that even US Patriot batteries use a mix of PAC-2 and PAC-3 missiles.  11.  (C) Jaishankar asked if the US now considers its NSSP obligation to provide a classified PAC-2 brief as having been fully discharged, and what the next step is.  Jim Alverson, OSD/ISA-NESA India Country Director, responded that the US has completed the PAC-2 briefing, but that future missile defense dialogue and briefings would continue in accordance with NSSP.  Alverson said that if India is interested in purchasing PAC-2, the USG and India would proceed along the same Foreign Military Sales process used for other major defense transactions.  12.  (C) In a separate meeting on February 23, AC/RSS Director Robert Gromoll, SA/RA Director John Schlosser, and PolCouns met with MEA Additional Secretary for International Security, Meera Shankar.  Shankar expressed appreciation for the \"new depth\" in the US-India bilateral relationship, reminding the US delegation that India was among the first countries to welcome the US vision of a missile defense shield.  India's desires go well beyond MD acquisition, Shankar continued.  The GOI is most interested in a technology partnership similar to MOUs the US has with other allies, including full collaboration and industrial participation.  According to Shankar, since India's strategic MD framework is still being formed, the GOI has not reached consensus on whether they need a MD system or what elements it should have.  As a result, New Delhi seeks more information about the future direction of the US MD network. Gromoll responded that he will follow-up on the possibilities of technical cooperation with Washington, and that the next step would be a formal letter of interest from the GOI.  13.  (C) During a separate meeting that same day with Ed Ross, Shankar expressed appreciation for the PAC-2 briefing and the technical question-and-answer exchange that followed.  She said India is at a very preliminary stage and is still conceptualizing whether it will pursue missile defense, and if so, what type and what elements it would seek.  Beyond acquisition, Shankar expressed interest in areas of possible MD technological collaboration with the US.  She inquired about PAC-2 and PAC-3 performance parameters in the Persian Gulf War (Note:  The PAC-2 classified briefing contained PAC-2 performance information).  Shankar stated that India has an interest in PAC-3.  Ross explained that Ground Configuration-3, included in the brief, is the heart of the Patriot system with either the PAC-2 GEM  or PAC-3 interceptors.  He also expressed appreciation for the GOI's desire for industrial participation in MD.  Shankar stressed that the GOI is very interested in MD \"as a concept\" that can strengthen India's nuclear posture of \"No First Use.\" Shankar expressed strong interest in US-India technology collaboration on MD, and in pursuing a U.S-India Memorandum of Understanding on missile defense cooperation similar to that which the U.S. has with other countries.  She further offered that India was looking forward to the March 3-4 command post exercise planning meeting with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency as an opportunity to build another dimension of our MD dialogue, and welcomed the invitation to send observers to the Roving Sands MD exercise at the end of March.  She asked that the U.S. provide a written letter of invitation for India to send observers to the exercise (Note:  MDA has since sent the letter to the GOI through Embassy New Delhi).

NEW DELHI 1707      B. NEW DELHI 1261/1263/1264      C. NEW DELHI 1175      D. NEW DELHI 750  Classified By: Ambassador David C. Mulford, Reasons 1.4 b,d  1.  (C) Secretary Bodman, now that you have had a few weeks to settle into your new role, I want to share with you some thoughts and ideas on our relationship with India.  You already know from our meeting last November my views on the emerging India, a vibrant, multi-faceted democracy that is a growing and increasingly confident regional power with legitimate global ambitions.  A decade of economic reforms has raised GDP growth to the 7-8 percent range and has created growing public support for continuing reforms. Successive governments are moving these reforms forward, albeit within the political constraints imposed by India's vigorous and sometimes frustrating democratic system.  Most big players here predict several decades of sustained robust economic growth, thanks in part to India's youthful population, which will lift India into the top ranks of global economic and political powers.  Energy is at the heart of the Indian agenda because there is consensus that India will not be able to achieve its aspirations without secure and reliable energy supplies.  The Indians realize that we are critical to their energy agenda, which gives us considerable leverage in influencing their developing energy policies.  A Comprehensive Relationship ----------------------------  2.   (C) President Bush's 2001 directive to transform the strategic agenda with India has borne good results in the last four years.  The bilateral relationship has strengthened on virtually every front.  Today we consult regularly at the highest levels on political, economic, security, and global issues.  Secretary Rumsfeld visited Delhi in January. Secretary Rice is expected next week.  She will be followed  SIPDIS by Secretary Mineta in April and Secretary Snow in the fall. Foreign Minister Natwar Singh is scheduled to be in Washington in April.  We hope there will be other cabinet visits this year, including by you.  We also expect the President to visit India sometime later this year.  3.   (C) These high-level exchanges are a sign of how far our relationship has changed.  Where once there was doubt and suspicion, today there is greater candor and cooperation. Our close coordination in responding to the December Tsunami and the ongoing Nepal crisis are cases in point.  Even when we disagree, as we did over Iraq, we are generally able to deal constructively with our differences, and move on.  The announcement of the \"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP)\" last year was an important signal that both sides want the relationship to grow closer in the years ahead and to leave behind the sanctions-focused era of US-India diplomacy.  4.   (C) The bilateral economic relationship, which once was a laggard, is beginning to expand.  In the 9 months it has been in power, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government has moved on several issues of importance to us: it has finalized an Open Skies policy with us; it has strengthened its IPR regime; it has raised foreign direct investment limits in several areas; and it has lowered tariff rates in sectors of importance to our industry.  Another highly symbolic FDI legacy issue, the Dabhol dispute, which was complicated by the Enron collapse, is moving closer to resolution.  We hope Boeing will soon be awarded a $8.5 billion contract for sale of commercial aircraft to Air India, which has not bought new planes since the 1980s.  The United States is India's biggest export market and its largest foreign investor.  Although a large trade imbalance remains, India is becoming an increasingly important destination for U.S. exports.  Last year our exports grew by 21 percent, with prospects of a similar increase this year. The growing Indian market offers extraordinary potential for U.S. exports and investment in the decades ahead.  The Economic Dialogue ---------------------  5.  (C) The principal tool we have used to strengthen the economic relationship is the US-India Economic Dialogue (ED).  Last October, following the Prime Minister's visit to New York, we agreed that the ED, which had yielded uneven results, needed to be revitalized.  The leadership of the ED has been elevated so that key issues can be lifted to the White House/Prime Minister's Office level.  National Economic Advisor Al Hubbard and the Prime Minister's principal economic advisor Montek Singh Ahluwalia will serve as overall coordinators.  The five existing tracks of the ED -- Finance, Environment, Trade, Energy, and Commerce -- will remain because they are useful.  A new CEO's forum will be added to advise policy makers on what is required to remove structural impediments to greater trade and investment ties.  I believe American energy companies should be represented at this forum.  6.   (C) For the five tracks of the ED to yield tangible results, it is essential that there be support from the relevant Departments in Washington and Ministries in Delhi. The Energy track of the ED has historically been its most active track, with numerous cooperative activities across a broad spectrum of energy-related areas ranging from clean energy and energy efficiency to cooperative activities on natural gas and coal.  These activities, however, have drifted somewhat in recent times.  The Foreign Ministry has told us that launching a revived energy dialogue -- similar to what India has with the EU -- will be a priority for Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's April 5 visit to Washington. I hope you will give your personal attention to revitalizing the energy pillar because of its great potential to move our broader economic relationship forward.  The four areas that I believe hold the greatest potential are cooperation on energy security, civil nuclear activities, natural gas, and clean and efficient energy.  Energy Security ---------------  7.   (C) India imports about 70 percent of its oil and gas needs, primarily from the Middle East.  It is among the fastest growing importers of oil and gas in teh world.  In the decades ahead, India (along with China) could be competing with the United States for access to limited supplies.  For this UPA government, as with the previous National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, energy security is a high national security priority -- in many ways it is the tail that is driving Indian foreign policy. Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar is widely regarded as the brightest and most successful of the UPA ministers.  He has significantly raised his Ministry's profile, usurping the international role that the Foreign Ministry earlier monopolized.  The state-controlled oil and gas companies have been directed to aggressively seek out oil and gas properties offshore and overseas.  India has transformed its position on participating in trans-Pakistan gas pipelines to take advantage of energy supplies in Iran and Turkmenistan.  8.   (C) It is important for these reasons that we engage in an energy security dialogue.  We could influence Indian energy policy such that it follows a path conducive to U.S. economic, political, security, and global environmental interests.  We have reported on India's growing oil and gas relationship with Iran (Ref C).  A renewed and invigorated high level exchange could allow us to exert some influence on this Indo-Iran energy relationship and to encourage forays in other directions, such as the burgeoning India-Qatar ties. It will also make the Indians more attentive to resolving investment disputes some of our companies face (Dabhol, Tamil Nadu), and yield significant opportunities for U.S. business.  The idea of an energy security exchange was first broached by us in 2002, when Under Secretary of State Al Larson suggested to the GOI that discussion could move along two tracks:  fuel and supply diversification; and energy preparedness in the event of a major supply disruption.  The GOI was enthusiastically receptive to this proposal, in part because it resonates well politically within this highly energy import-dependent economy.  The GOI, which was in the process of creating its own strategic stockpile, also felt it could benefit from American expertise in this area. Subsequently, DOE hosted several visits by GOI officials, including one by then-Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik, to share our experience in creating the National Petroleum Reserve.  The GOI participated in DOE's Strategic Oil Stockpiling Conference in November 2004.  9.   (C) We believe that our energy security exchanges should be revitalized and broadened beyond an occasional meeting or site visit at the margins of some event.  The process should get high level (i.e., Secretarial and Ministerial) support. We should institutionalize meetings at regular intervals between experts in areas such as alternative strategic petroleum reserve storage methods, tripwires for tapping the reserve, agriculture-based fuel additives, alternative fuels and reductions in oil intensity.  As we have done previously, we should support the Indian road shows, such as Minister Aiyar's January presentation in Houston, which are designed to elicit interest in India's exploration and production leasing program.  An MOU on information exchange between the Energy Information Agency and the GOI, which has taken eight years for us to finalize, should be signed immediately.  Civil Nuclear Cooperation -------------------------  10.  (C) India has established an ambitious civil nuclear power program, which will be a small but increasingly important part of the country's energy mix.  Its efforts, however, are being stymied because it is now encountering a critical shortage of natural uranium fuel.  The GOI seeks more collaboration with the United States in the civil nuclear area, but believes that U.S. policy does not accommodate realities on the ground.  Foreign Secretary Saran has suggested there should be a comprehensive review of the US-India civil nuclear relationship and a need to move the nuclear relationship forward even within the constraints imposed by our NPT and NSG obligations.  This presents us an opportunity where we can leverage flexibility on our part to move Indian policy in other issues of importance to us, and fold civil nuclear issues into the broader matrix of cooperative efforts with an emerging economy as important as India.  11.  (C) We have been impressed, as was NRC Commissioner Jeffrey Merrifield during his February 8-11 visits to various nuclear power stations in India (Ref B), at the maturity and sophistication that the Indian civil nuclear establishment has achieved as a power generating utility.  There ought to be activities that DOE and its labs could conduct which would be comply fully with current law and with NSG obligations but still respond positively to Indian requests for a broader civil nuclear power relationship.  We should explore cooperative activities that encourage the Indian civil nuclear sector to pursue responsible policies that are consistent with international best practices.  India's current nuclear fuel crunch is pushing the GOI to move in unproven and potentially dangerous directions, such as use of MOX fuel in their boiling water reactors and developing a complex  fast breeder reactor.  We should use this cooperation to assure that U.S. interests are clearly understood and recognized as the Indian civil nuclear industry comes of age.  12.  (C) For example, the United States could support nuclear safety at the aging Indian reactors by permitting the plants to acquire U.S. safety-related equipment under the NSG's safety exception.  We could consider reviewing our policy of blocking India's efforts to acquire uranium for civil nuclear power from other countries, as long as it is consistent with NSG obligations.  Both these steps could be used to leverage placement of additional Indian facilities under IAEA safeguards.  We could also pursue additional US-India cooperation on fusion research and safe reactor designs.  We could support Indian participation in events sponsored by the nuclear power industry within the United States.  Although there are may be difficulties with responding positively to the GOI's interest in becoming a member of the International Tokomak Engineering Reactor (ITER), DOE could make a concerted effort to bring Indian plasma physicists on board U.S. plasma physics efforts just as they are on board high energy physics collaborations (Ref B and D).  We could continue to support Indian participation in the World Association of Nuclear Operators peer review process where members benchmark safety practices and conduct peer reviews of power plant operations.  We could also support Indian participation in INPRO, a forum for exploring the next generation of proliferations resistant reactors (Ref A).  Natural Gas -----------  13.  (C) The natural gas market in India is expected to grow robustly in the years ahead as its share in India's energy mix increases from 8 percent to over 20 percent by 2020.  The Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister told the Ambassador (Ref B) that current Indian supplies of 90 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) is about ten times higher than in the 1980s.  It falls far short of demand, however, which is estimated at 150 mmcmd and projected to increase to 400 mcmd in 20 years.  The 2003 discovery by Reliance in the Krishna-Godavari basin and subsequent discoveries by Cairns and ONGC further have induced aggressive exploration in the Bay of Bengal.  Meanwhile, India has begun to lock in long term supplies of LNG.  There are at least half a dozen proposals for building LNG terminals along India's coasts. It is also exploring ideas for pipelined gas from Iran, Turkmenistan, Burma, and Bangladesh.  14.  (C) We recognized the potential growth of the Indian natural gas market early.  In 2002, DOE co-sponsored with the GOI a \"Building Natural Gas Markets\" conference in Delhi. And we have funded through the U.S. Trade and Development Agency a feasibility study for a national gas grid.  We need to do more.   We should follow up this year with another natural gas conference and related seminars and workshops on regulation, pricing, transportation, LNG, transparency and competition.  As it is doing in other sectors, the GOI wants to establish an independent regulatory body for the hydrocarbon sector.  We should share our experience and knowledge about regulatory best practices with them.  At the conference, we should help secure the attendance of recognized international experts on such regulatory practices.  We should seek out opportunities to help upgrade the office of Indian Director General of Hydrocarbons, the primary GOI technical agency for the oil and gas sector. Engaging early in this sector could yield signficant commercial opportunities for U.S. business.  Clean/Efficient/Renewable Energy --------------------------------  14.  (SBU) India is one of the world largest users of coal and a major emitter of greenhouse gases.  The country has embarked on an ambitious reform program in the power sector in an effort to help achieve its Power on Demand plan by 2012.  This translates to expanding rural power access to over 100,000 villages and connection to 10 million households.  Through DOE, USAID and EPA, we have in place a robust set of cooperative activities that can be loosely grouped together under the clean, efficient, renewable energy heading.  These activities have generally been quite successful, although we need support to raise the profile and broaden and deepen our efforts in such areas as energy efficiency, demand-side management, and distribution reform. We seek support in Washington to enhance the funding levels of these programs.  We would use high-level interest in these programs to showcase their success and build support for them.  15.  (SBU) Such activities include the Coal Advisory Group, which has been a successful forum for sharing experiences and discussing science and economic issues relating to coal. India is a one of the 14 founding members of the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy.  It is also a charter member of the 2004 \"Methane to Markets\" initiative.  The EPA and U.S. Trade and Development Agency have proposed funding a Coal Bed Methane clearing house project.  USAID has a number of ongoing energy-related programs, some in collaboration with DOE.  These programs provide an excellent foundation for DOE to contribute its impressive technical, advisory and policy expertise. DOE and USAID have a long-term relationship under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Prevention project.  At $39 million, this is USAID's largest climate change initiative.  16.  (SBU) USAID is implementing a very effective $25 million Energy Conservation and Commercialization project aimed at building institutional capacity among Indian utilities and state and local governments to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management. USAID also has a multi-year $20 million Distribution Reforms Upgrades and Management (DRUM) program, designed to promote power distribution reforms at the state and local level and efficiency improvements in India's creaking last mile distribution networks.  USAID's $10 million Water-Energy Nexus Activity aims enhances cross-sectoral solutions and investment opportunities.  For the past two years, USAID has been assisting the GOI is assessing the relevance of key US-developed Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology operating on high ash content India coal.  Since 2001, India has been participating in USAID's South Asia Regional Initiative on Energy (SARI/E), which seeks to promote mutually beneficial energy linkages among the South Asian countries.  Conclusion ----------  17.  (C) I hope this conveys the fertile menu of existing and potential cooperative energy-related activities that have great promise.  I would like to suggest that you personally take charge of our Energy relationship with India and in doing so make an early visit here.  It is important we engage at high levels with a country that will play an important role in the global energy markets in the future.  In my recent meeting with Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Aiyar (Ref B), it was clear that he wants to greatly expand cooperation with the U.S. public and private sector.  A visit by you would move our relationship firmly in a direction conducive to U.S. interests and the strengthening of our bilateral relations.  It would also inject momentum into the rich palette of ongoing activities and help launch new ones. I plan to be in Washington in late April and, if your schedule permits, hope to have the opportunity to discuss how we might advance our agenda. MULFORD " }

NEW DELHI 1710      B. NEW DELHI 1519      C. NEW DELHI 1274      D. CALCUTTA 97      E. CALCUTTA 68  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The strong performance of the BJP following recent State Assembly elections has convinced India's mainstream Communists to downplay their differences with the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and cooperate for the time being to meet the \"rightist\" threat.  The Communists view Congress as \"enemy number two,\" however, and their long-term strategy is to form a \"third front\" government that excludes Congress.  As long as the Left Front (LF) parties remain with the UPA they will scale down their economic demands to \"welfare capitalism\" based on poverty alleviation and social programs.  Over the long term, however, the LF would like to destroy the Naxalite and Maoist parties and absorb their followers into a \"united front\" committed to parliamentary democracy and opposed to \"neo-liberal\" development policies propounded by the US, World Bank and IMF.  India's Communist parties are committed, cadre-based, and have never been stronger in Parliament, in the states they rule, and in popularity.  Long confined to West Bengal, Kerala, and Tripura, they could begin to \"break out\" in the years ahead, and expand into other states such as Bihar, and Jharkhand, where they could provide an alternative to corrupt caste-based parties.  Indian Communists increasingly see the electoral success of Communist/Socialist parties in Latin America as the trend for the future, rather than the violent Naxalites.  End Summary.  The Left in a Nutshell ----------------------  2.  (U) The Indian Communist movement spans an ideological spectrum from the far-left Naxalites to the relatively moderate Communist Party of India (CPI).  The Naxalites are a group of disparate Maoist parties which advocate violent revolution (Ref C).  The largest Naxalite party is the Communist Party of India (Maoist).  Slightly to their right is a group of small Maoist parties which advocate the same radical goals but have eschewed violence in favor of parliamentary democracy.  One of these, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) won seven seats in Bihar's recent Assembly Election.  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) is India's largest and most powerful Communist group. It advocated a pro-China policy during the Sino-Soviet split, but now rejects the Chinese model.  Having ruled West Bengal for 17 years, it has revised its Marxist tenets and become more pragmatic.  The CPI, founded in 1925, is India's first Communist Party and all other Communist groups trace their origin to it.  Slavishly devoted to the Soviet Union, the CPI has lost considerable power and popularity to the CPI(M) since the end of the Cold War.  In February, the CPI(M) rebuffed a CPI merger proposal.  3.  (U) The CPI and CPI(M) and two non-Communist parties, the Forward Bloc (FB) and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) constitute the Left Front (LF), which supports the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government from outside.  Although largely confined to their \"red forts\" of West Bengal, Kerala, and Tripura, these four parties had their best electoral performance ever in the 2004 Parliamentary Elections.  The LF currently has 59 MPs, (CPI(M) 43, CPI 10, FB 3, RSP 3).  The LF relies on several prominent spokesmen in New Delhi to articulate its positions and handle day to day negotiations with the UPA.  These include:  CPM(M) General Secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, CPI(M) Politburo members Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechuri, CPI Secretariat Member D. Raja, and CPI General Secretary A.B. Bardhan.  Basic Ideology --------------  4.  (U) Like Communist Parties worldwide, the Indian Communist Parties engage in constant ideological wrangling, but agree on some basic points. --There is no role for violence; Communist parties should participate in parliamentary democracy.  --The Naxalites are \"adventurists,\" who should renounce violence and rejoin the fold of mainstream Communist parties.   --Globalization is for the present inevitable and cannot be avoided or stopped, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is essential for India's economic development, but should be restricted and closely monitored.  --Government intervention in the economy is necessary to prevent exploitation of the poor, carry out redistribution of resources, and achieve a measure of poverty alleviation.  --Countries like India should maintain a mixed economy with a vibrant \"profit-making\" public sector.  --Asset redistribution should be achieved through taxation of the wealthy and government-sponsored social welfare programs for the poor, especially in rural areas.  --The United States, and multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund cannot dictate India's economic and foreign policies.  --India should renounce nuclear weapons, reduce military spending, accept no military alliances, especially with the US, and normalize relations with Pakistan.  --While India's Communists should maintain cordial relations with other Communist Parties, none should serve as a model for India, which will have to devise a country specific socialist system that reflects its own cultural values.  Relations with Congress -----------------------  5.  (U) Of the four parties in the LF, only the CPI has had cordial relations with Congress.  After the 2004 elections, the CPI wanted the LF to join the government, but was rebuffed by its three partners and acquiesced in the interests of \"Left Unity.\"  Within the CPI(M) several senior leaders, including Jyoti Basu, were also in favor of joining the UPA.  After being overruled in internal party conclaves, Basu and other leaders went along with the majority view as required by \"party discipline.\" Congen Calcutta reports that the LF has repeatedly stated that as a \"bourgeois party,\" Congress does not share the Communists' ideology and values. The LF's long-term goal is to establish a \"third front\" of secular, socialist parties, that does not include Congress. However, the LF claims to support the UPA to prevent \"communalist forces\" (the BJP) from returning to power, and to ensure that India's economic policies address the needs of the poor.  As a condition for its support of the UPA, the LF insisted on a \"Common Minimum Program\" (CMP), which is aimed at providing \"development with a human face,\" the political slogan of the UPA government.  6.  (U) Since the UPA has been in power, the LF has repeatedly accused Congress of failing to implement the CMP and not properly consulting with the LF.  Although the LF has a coordination committee which meets regularly with the Congress leadership, it accuses Congress of making important economic decisions without consultation.  Since the UPA has been in power the LF and Congress have clashed over a number of issues including:  --privatization of the pension fund for government employees:  --allowing 74 per cent FDI in private sector banks;  --FDI liberalization in civil aviation; --removal of subsidies on fuel; --enhanced military ties between India and the US and India and Israel; and  --allowing 74 per cent FDI in the telecom sector.  7.  (U) When the UPA was formed in May 2004, the LF committed to support the GOI \"from the outside,\" noting that while it would criticize individual policies, it would not bring down the government.  Despite this commitment, there have been several instances when it appeared that the tension between the LF and Congress had reached the boiling point, with Communist leaders stating that they had reached the end of their patience and were putting the UPA on notice that it should not take LF support for granted.  Many LF party conferences are scheduled for this spring as follows:  --The Revolutionary Socialist Party National Conference, February 17-20;  --The Communist Party of India National Conference - March 29-April 3;  --The Forward Bloc International Conference - April 4-5; and  --The Communist Party of India (Marxist) Conference - April 6-12.  Party spokesmen have reiterated that they would address the LF/UPA relationship at the conferences and discuss other options, to include withdrawing support from the UPA and the formation of a \"third front.\"  One Tune Before the Elections -----------------------------  8.  (C) The state Assembly Elections (Refs A and B) and the announcement of the budget in Parliament have played a key role in the evolution of LF attitudes towards Congress and the UPA.  Poloff met with Communist leaders before and after these events and noticed a distinct change in their political line.  The pre-election views were fiery and anti-Congress, while post-election statements were decidedly less so.  9.  (C) In a February 17 meeting with Poloff, G. Devarajan, the Secretary of the All-India Forward Bloc (FB) maintained that his party's rank-and-file were unhappy with the UPA government and would press for a shift to the left. Devarajan predicted that \"bad days are ahead,\" as the tension between the Left and Congress could grow unmanageable, opening up the possibility of a \"third front.\"  He confirmed that since a third front government is the ultimate goal of the LF, a split with the UPA was inevitable, and the only issue is of timing.  Devarajan maintained that the LF would not \"take the initiative\" until the BJP is sufficiently weakened as to no longer pose a threat.  The breaking point could be the 2006 elections in West Bengal or even before. He confirmed that the Common Minimum Program (CMP) was the \"bare minimum\" for Left support of the UPA.  Reluctant to accept the presence in India of non-unionized American retail chains, Devarajan confirmed that the LF would confer with Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) representatives at their conferences, regarding whether chains such as Walmart would be acceptable.  10.  (C) Devarajan argued that Congress won \"only\" 142 seats in the 2004 election, far less than the Congress high point of 1984, when it won 415 seats in a house of 545.  In Devarajan's view, this electoral performance was not a mandate for Congress and its \"Neo-liberal\" policies.  Rather, the people of India voted for Congress as the best way to get the communal BJP out of power.  Devarajan maintained that what Indians really want is a shift in focus from the urban middle class to the rural masses, and the UPA must provide for the common people or face their wrath at the ballot box. Devarajan conceded that while the LF is opposed to much of neo-liberalism, it has only one MP from the entire Hindi belt, is confined to its \"red forts,\" and does not have the power to stop it.  According to Devarajan, the LF can work with PM Manmohan Singh, but is not happy with FinMin Chidambaram, and is pressing for his replacement in the next Cabinet reshuffle.  11.  (C) Abani Roy, the Secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), echoed Devarajan in a February 24 meeting with Poloff.  Emphasizing that the LF is \"finding it difficult to support this government,\" even for the sake of Left unity, but did not think that a good opportunity to break with the UPA would emerge until the 2006 elections in West Bengal, where the LF would campaign against Congress. Roy argued that India needed a \"third front,\" that would accurately reflect political opinion and would be good for India, providing the poor with their own voice in the democratic system.  Roy dismissed any possibility that \"non-Left regional parties\" such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) of UP and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) of Bihar would be asked to join the third front, as \"we are only interested in anti-Capitalist forces.\"  According to Roy, the LF is not happy with the UPA, which is not doing enough to alleviate India's pervasive poverty, and provide basic necessities to the poorest of the poor.  He argued that since India is an undeveloped country, the GOI must play a strong role in the economy.  Roy complained that India's \"bad government machinery\" soaked up money dedicated to poverty alleviation, while the UPA was curtailed anti-poverty programs.  Another Tune Afterwards -----------------------  12.  (C) In a March 2 meeting with Poloff, CPI Secretary and principal spokesman D. Raja made it clear that circumstances had changed, and the LF was now more amenable to working with Congress.  Raja expressed some satisfaction with FinMin Chidambaram's budget presentation to Parliament.  While the LF had presented the UPA with a demand for a 50,000 crore rupee (USD 1.15 billion) social spending program, he seemed pleased that 25,000 crore (USD 575 million) had been allocated.  He also noted that government subsidies on food, petroleum and fertilizers would continue at the behest of the LF.  Raja was adamant that these social programs would never be implemented were it not for the LF.  13.  (C) Raja was also pleased with the tax revenue initiatives contained in the budget, which he characterized as \"serious efforts to mobilize resources.\"  He emphasized that the LF believed that India should mobilize its own resources to address poverty and not rely on FDI.  For example, he stated, corporate taxation of Indian industrial houses should be increased rather than reduced.  He praised the budget provision imposing a 10 rupee (USD .30) tax on withdrawals of rupees 10,000 (USD 230) or more.  14.  (C) Characterizing those who supported neo-liberalism as \"little more than animals,\" who don't have a \"basic community spirit,\" Raja maintained that the LF would ensure that this \"failed system based on human greed,\" would not take root in India.  Raja maintained that the current UPA government was just an intermediate step for the LF, which wanted to see a third front government take power in India.  According to Raja, the UPA would never unify India's \"secular democratic parties,\" and the LF had gained stature from its marriage of convenience with the UPA and felt encouraged.  15.  (C) The LF was quick to distance itself from the Congress power grab in Jharkhand and Goa (Refs A and B), with the CPI(M) Politburo dismissing \"the hasty manner\" with which the Jharkhand governor swore in the Shibu Soren government in Jharkhand as \"controversial.\"  In private, however, Raja told Poloff that the LF's first priority was to ensure that the BJP \"communalists\" do not return to power.  According to Raja, the Communists have determined that the Congress missteps have revived the BJP and its NDA alliance, which would now take the offensive.  Raja confirmed that the LF would stand with Congress to prevent a BJP return to power and put aside talk of a third front or open confrontation with the UPA until the BJP threat is nullified.  Swing to the Left -----------------  16.  (U) On January 22, Poloff attended a panel discussion that provided some insight into what direction India's Communist/Left parties are headed.  The panel, on the \"anti-Imperialist Struggle of the Venezuelan People,\" was sponsored by the Third World Studies Center, a Delhi group that represents the left wings of India's Communist parties. It included Prakash Karat, the CPI(M) ideologue, marked to assume a leadership role in India's Communist movement in the next several months.  The panelists emphasized that the Left has been too accommodating to Congress and should expand its opposition to neo-liberalism beyond rhetoric to organizing.  17.  (U) The panelists argued that if India's Communist parties continue to placate Congress, over the long term it will exacerbate India's rich/poor divide and encourage Naxalites to greater violence, resulting in needless bloodshed.  They emphasized that mainstream Communists must demonstrate to Naxalites that they are serious about addressing the needs of India's poor.  This was endorsed on February 8, by the Karnataka State Committee of the CPI(M), which urged Naxalites to forego violence in favor of peaceful methods to combat social injustice and exploitation.  G.C. Bayyareddy, the Secretary of the Committee, said that the best way to combat Naxalism was to distribute land to the landless, give title deeds to tribals, provide fair compensation to families affected by development projects, and protect tribals' social and cultural rights.  18.  (U) The panelists contended that rather than the Nepalese Maoists, the Indian Left should adopt as a its model the democratic, non-violent movement of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, and other Left parties of Latin America which are scoring electoral gains.  They contended that the Left should use some of the same tactics developed by Chavez and other Latin American leaders to prevent the US, the IMF and World Bank from \"dominating India.\"  Karat noted that the Left Front pressured the UPA to extend an invitation to Chavez to make a state visit to India in March and would mobilize to give him a \"warm welcome,\" and pressure the GOI to defend Venezuela from \"another US-orchestrated coup attempt (Ref E).\"  Comment -------  19.  (C) India's Communists have modified their Marxist views since taking power in West Bengal and other states.  When governing, they tend to take a pragmatic approach at the regional level that is often belied by some of their rhetoric at public events.  As Communists, however, they take a historic view of their role, with tactical and strategic objectives and short-term and long-term strategies.  Over the short-term, the LF wants to keep the BJP out of power long enough for the Sangh Parivar's political appeal to fade.  If this means that they must work with Congress, they are willing to make the sacrifice.  While supporting the UPA, however, the LF wants to keep its distance from Congress economic policies and maintain its credibility by stressing a \"welfare capitalism\" approach based on poverty alleviation and social programs.  20.  (C) The Communists' willingness to cooperate with Congress depends on large measure on how the Congress leadership packages and presents economic reforms.  We expect the LF to support a greater role for the private sector in the food processing, retailing, real estate, and manufacturing sectors if the GOI provides benefits for farmers and low-income consumers.  The LF will also likely tolerate partial privatization of public sector units if a significant portion of the proceeds are used to fund social programs, as Congress has promised.  The Communists will likely resist Congress' efforts to expand private investment in banking and increase labor market flexibility.  21.  (C) When the BJP challenge has been addressed and the \"rightist enemies\" have faded away, the LF would turn its attention to Congress, \"the second enemy.\"  Communist ideologues argue that the BJP is a short-term threat, as \"communal politics\" has no future in India.  Increasingly, they are coming to agree that \"neo-liberal\" development policies propounded by Congress are a long-term threat that poses a greater danger.  To address that threat, the mainstream Communists hope to destroy the Maoist and Naxalite parties (Refs C and D), which they dismiss as violent \"adventurists,\" and convince their less radical followers to join a common \"anti-imperialist\" front that will be united, democratic, non-violent, and plugged into an international network of friendly parties and governments.  22.  (C) Media profiles of India, including those in the US, have stressed that rapid economic growth is lifting many boats, and downplayed popular opposition to economic liberalization.  However, the growing power, popularity and political influence of the India's Communists indicate that all will not be smooth sailing.  The Indian Left envisions that the \"internal contradictions of neo-liberalism\" will soon become apparent in India, as they have in Latin America, and the country will then be ready to accept a third front government that does not include Congress.  States like Jharkhand and Bihar, where class divisions are acute and growing, provide an opportunity for Communist expansion in the coming years, and the Left's political power is likely to increase along with its seats in Parliament.

(C) Adding to the veritable \"love-fest\" that Mission contacts and Indian press have reported surrounding the Pakistan cricket team's current tour of India (septel), the MEA has publicly cleared the way for an official invitation to Pakistan President Musharraf to attend a match \"of his choosing.\"  Despite media speculation about a Musharraf visit to Calcutta, however, MEA spokesman Navtej Sarna told PolCouns on March 9 that Musharraf would be steered away from that city.  We surmise that part of the GOI calculus is to avoiding letting the West Bengal Communists control the visit, which for the Foreign Ministry stirs up memories of the disastrous Musharraf appearance at the 2001 Agra summit. The MEA's apparent opposition to a Calcutta venue opens the possibility of a mid-April trip to Musharraf's home town of Delhi (see schedule below).  Although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's media adviser Sanjay Baru told reporters that this would be a \"friendly visit\" and not a summit, well-connected \"Times of India\" Foreign Affairs correspondent Indrani Bagchi reported on March 10 that the PM would host a meal for Musharraf during the visit.  2.  (U) The 50-day cricket schedule is as follows:  March 8-12: First Test match in Mohali (Chandigarh), Punjab March 16-20: Second Test match in Calcutta, West Bengal March 24-28: Third/Final Test match in Bangalore, Karnataka March 30: Warm-up One Day International (ODI) in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh April 2: First ODI in Kochi, Kerala April 5: Second ODI in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh April 9: Third ODI in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand April 12: Fourth ODI in Ahmedabad, Gujarat April 15: Fifth ODI in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh April 17: Sixth/Final ODI in New Delhi  (NOTE: The inaugural running of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service is scheduled for April 7.

Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: In a March 9 meeting with the Ambassador, Home Minister Shivraj Patil credited Pakistan with reducing infiltration, called the law and order situation in the state \"more comfortable,\" and expressed confidence that the first Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus would roll on schedule on April 7, despite the harsh winter, which had slowed preparatory work. The GOI had told President Musharraf that he would be welcome to visit India during the ongoing cricket series.  Patil downplayed the effects of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal on India, commenting that there has not been the spillover he expected, but expressed concern and the need to remain vigilant about the internal threat of leftist violence inside India.  End Summary.  Kashmir -------  2.  (C) In a discussion that focused primarily on trafficking in persons (septel), the Ambassador told the Home Minister that he expected Secretary Rice would be interested in Indian views on developments in Jammu and Kashmir during her upcoming visit to New Delhi and asked for Patil's assessment of trends there.  The Home Minister ascribed the significant decline in infiltration not only to the LOC fence, better anti-insurgency measures by India, and heavy snow which clogged mountain passes, but also to Pakistani efforts to reduce the flow of terrorists, commenting that \"You have to give them credit.\"  The law and order situation had improved in part because of Pakistani actions, he stated.  3.  (C) The problem with the terrorists was not their guns, Patil continued, but their grenades and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), as a result of which many civilians were killed and travel via road remained risky.  He expressed great satisfaction that the Kashmiris had braved terrorist threats and intimidation during the February municipal elections, turning out in large numbers and making them a great success.  This was further evidence of strong Kashmiri interest in how they are governed, the Minister stated.  4.  (C) Patil expected the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus to roll on schedule on April 7, despite harsh winter weather that had hampered infrastructure improvements and other preparatory work.  The GOI was looking into opening several more roads (presumably Jammu-Sialkot, Kargil-Skardu, Poonch-Mirpur, and Lahore-Amritsar), but did not elaborate.  The number of delegations visiting each country has increased enormously, which is helping to keep the atmosphere for rapprochement positive.  The Home Minister added that New Delhi had also told Islamabad that President Musharraf was welcome in India for the Indo-Pak cricket series now underway.  Nepal/Naxalite Nexus --------------------  5.  (C) Turning to the crisis in Nepal, the Ambassador noted that the US and India remain very close in their views and are consulting regularly.  He apprised Patil that the US had postponed a military/medical exercise (the JCET) in our ongoing effort to keep pressure on the King, and that there was no lethal assistance in the pipeline to the RNA for the next few months.  6.  (C) Responding to a question about the impact of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal on India's internal security, Patil observed that insurgent groups in Nepal were communicating with groups here and elsewhere in the subcontinent, in Latin America and Africa, and that funds were crossing borders.  By dismissing the government, the King had removed the buffer between the Palace and the Maoists and created even greater problems for himself. Ordinary Nepalis were keeping quiet or saying things acceptable to the Maoists, but they did not back the insurgents.  Patil agreed that the RNA, by increasingly withdrawing into the Kathmandu Valley, had conceded territory to the Maoists.  7.  (C) The situation was very complicated, Patil continued, and India was finding that when it attempted to be of assistance in one area, one problem would crop up, while if it tried another, it would face still other problems.  The GOI had increased its vigil on its borders, so that \"those who do not believe in democracy do not cross over to India.\"  Whatever spillover there was into India, however, remained in small amounts, and was proceeding at a snail's pace. Patil professed not to know whether this was the \"lull before the storm\" or that the status quo would continue.  The situation in Bhutan and Assam had also not deteriorated as a result of Nepal, but India was keeping its fingers crossed. Given his responsibilities for internal security, however, he remained concerned about the internal threat of leftist violence inside India (Reftel). MULFORD " }

Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1. (C) Meeting on March 9, the Ambassador again urged Home Minister Shivraj Patil to focus more on the trafficking issue in order to avoid the downgrading of India from the Tier 2 Special Watch List to Tier 3 in June, which could set in motion a series of unfortunate and restrictive developments in US-India relations.  2.  (C) Commenting that he had raised this issue in January during his last meeting with the Minister along with Senator Bingaman and Congressman Faleomavaega, the Ambassador stressed that with the June deadline looming, the GOI should consider the ramifications seriously.  It was already March, and US legislation was specific on the kinds of steps the USG would have to take in the event of a TIP downgrading, including at multilateral lending agencies.  The Ambassador noted that the USG would then have few choices, which could impact negatively on bilateral ties and which both countries wanted to avoid.  3.  (C) Acknowledging the TIP problem, the Home Minster attributed it to India's huge population, a \"conservative\" population that did not treat the issue as urgently as in \"more liberal countries,\" and uneven levels of development countrywide, as well as deep poverty in neighboring countries from which many trafficked persons originated.  Patil reported that several bills currently before the Parliament would improve GOI ability to investigate and prosecute traffickers.  One bill would amend the Penal Code to improve witness protection measures.  Another would facilitate investigation and prosecution of those who traffic in persons.  The GOI was fully behind these changes in existing law.  4.  (C) Patil apprised the Ambassador about a conference of Chief Ministers planned for after the Budget Session recess beginning on March 23 at which he would take up the trafficking issue.  He acknowledged that this alone would \"not solve the problem,\" but since many responsibilities for addressing the trafficking problem reside at the state level in India, it was necessary to focus Chief Ministers on it for full cooperation.  5.  (C) The Home Minister returned to the trafficking issue at the end of the meeting, which also covered Kashmir and the Naxalite/Nepal nexus (septel), asking again to receive any concrete suggestions about how the GOI could better address this problem.  D/Polcouns drew attention to a proposal the MHA has been tasked to draft for expanded US-India law enforcement training and cooperation against traffickers. The Ambassador stressed that this kind of activity would be a clear demonstration of GOI resolve, and was in Patil's area of responsibilty. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: In the absence of MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar, who is on extended travel for non-proliferation and C/T dialogues in Australia and the UK, PolCouns flagged the need for progress on Indian export control legislation to keep the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) initiative moving in separate March 7 meetings with MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar and MEA Acting Joint Secretary, Disarmament and International Security (DISA), Venu Rajamony.  PolCouns and Poloff encouraged GOI interlocutors to use a US non-paper describing the quid-pro-quos in Phases Two and Three (Ref C) to help overcome skepticism among some officials in India's civil nuclear and space establishments about how India will benefit from the NSSP.  Neither GOI official responded substantively, but both reaffirmed the GOI commitment to the export control understandings attached to the NSSP.  End Summary.  2.  (C) In a meeting with DISA Acting Joint Secretary Rajamony, PolCouns highlighted the upcoming visit of Secretary Rice as an opportunity to define where Indo-US  SIPDIS relations should go in the coming months and as a precursor to a possible POTUS visit later this year.  PolCouns encouraged the GOI to use the impetus of these visits to overcome current bureaucratic obstacles and advance our common NSSP objectives.  PolCouns noted that the US has asked to see India's draft export control legislation before the next NSSP Implementation Group meeting is scheduled. PolCouns also raised several onward proliferation cases (Refs A and B).  3.  (C) PolCouns reiterated Ref C points in a separate meeting with J/S (Americas) Jaishankar.  Reviewing his recent meetings in Washington, Jaishankar underscored the importance of US flexibility toward India's civil nuclear program, and stressed that the GOI does not want to renegotiate the NSSP quid-pro-quos.  On the issue of nuclear fuel supply, Jaishankar stated that he thought a \"liberal interpretation\" of the NSG rules \"is within the realm of possibility.\"  On matters where US assistance to India's civil nuclear program is constrained by US legislation, he asked that \"if the US can't be helpful, at least don't be unhelpful\" (i.e., by not allowing other countries to assist).  Jaishankar was optimistic that a bilateral Energy Dialogue could be a forum for the GOI to explain the full range of India's energy needs, adding that NRC Commissioner Merrifield had already done much to promote this idea in Washington after his recent visit to India.  4.  (C) In response to PolCouns' query about how the GOI might capitalize on the Secretary's upcoming trip to New Delhi to keep the NSSP moving, Jaishankar said that the GOI is carefully considering its approach to her visit.  Some in the GOI did not \"properly understand the entirety of the Indo-US relationship,\" he opined, adding his hope that these attitudes could change in the course of other Cabinet-level visits expected over the next few months.

(C) Summary: With Secstate Rice due to arrive in India March 15, and with political memories still fresh from the announcement of major non-NATO Ally status for Pakistan last March, the issue of F-16 sales to Pakistan is rising.  Indian concern regarding the F-16 issue is reflected in a series of GOI statements, including that of Minister of State for External Affairs E. Ahamed, who stated in Parliament on March 9, that while the Indo-Pak dialogue process was moving forward, the US transfer of arms to Pakistan would impact on Indian goodwill for the US.  During the January visit of Codel Leach, Indian MPs expressed similar concerns, describing US arms sales to Pakistan as an \"irritant,\" in the US/India relationship (Ref A).  There is bipartisan consensus on this issue, as the BJP and Congress have voiced similar objections (Refs B and C).  End Summary  2.  (U) On March 9 Minister Ahamed responded to a parliamentary question about India/Pakistan Confidence Building Measures (CBMs), raised by two Congress party MPs. He noted that the India/Pakistan dialogue process \"was taken significantly forward8 by FonMin Natwar Singh,s February 15-17 visit to Islamabad.  An MP and Embassy contact who lived for many years in New York, then asked whether India has conveyed &serious concerns to the US regarding its alleged arms sales to Pakistan8 at a time when the Indo-Pak dialogue has reached &a sensitive stage.8  Minister Ahamed replied that the GOI had expressed &India,s strong concern8 regarding the &repercussions of arms sales to Pakistan, including on the ongoing India-Pakistan dialogue, at high levels to the US government,8 and that \"such transfers will impact on the goodwill for the US in India.8  3.  (C) MEA Join Secretary S. Jaishankar also raised the F-16's issue in a March 11 meeting with the DCM, noting a \"surge of rumors\" regarding a possible US decision. Jaishankar remarked that an F-16 announcement would be a \"huge deal,\" in which the government would lose the initiative.  \"We will all get caught up in a process beyond our control,\" he averred.  DCM responded that decision-makers in Washington are well aware of Indian concerns.  Comment -------  4.  (C) There is universal opposition in India to the supply of sophisticated arms to Pakistan, with the F-16 aircraft symbolizing a US commitment to upgrading the Pakistani armed forces.  The Secstate visit has raised new fears among the GOI that it could again be blindsided by an announcement in Islamabad, this time concerning new weapons supplies.  With Parliament now engaged, the issue is certain to be raised in the Secretary's New Delhi media interactions. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.5 (B, D)  1.  (S) Summary: In her remarks at the initial working group meeting of the US-India Missile Defense (MD) Workshop in Hyderabad on March 3-4, MEA Additional Secretary for International Security Meera Shankar affirmed New Delhi's desire for a cooperative MD technology relationship with the US over the long term, and said that the GOI would like to formulate its overall strategic MD objectives in cooperation with the USG.  The subject of \"Framework MOU,s\" for facilitating missile defense cooperation, similar to what the US has with a select group of other countries, was raised by the Indian side.  On the planned Workshop exercises, the Indian delegation hoped for a very high-fidelity simulation of actual threats and missile defenses that would generate hard data for use in MD strategic and acquisition planning. The Indian delegation presented a classified briefing reflecting their perception of the ballistic missile threat to India, and a separate briefing characterized as the GOI \"wish list\" for US-India Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) modeling and simulation exercises.  After it became clear that GOI desires were beyond the scope of the MDA's International Modeling and Simulation (IMS) tool, the US delegation re-focused the Indian delegation on the original proposal for a realistic, but lower fidelity, plan to exercise decision-making at the policy and operational levels during a simulated missile attack.  The GOI agreed, but asked for much higher fidelity modeling and simulation exercises in the future.  A framework for upcoming Planning and Command Post Exercises (PLANEX/CPX) was agreed upon, and options for the GOI to pursue high-fidelity MD exercises with the USG were discussed.  Noticeably lacking from the discussions were explicit references to indigenous MD production, categories of assets India might like to defend against missile attack, or co-production of BMDS hardware with the US.  Hosted at one of India's most sensitive missile research facilities, this exchange reflected the deepening level of candor in the US-India MD relationship.  End Summary.  2.  (S) While welcoming the US delegation, Dr. V.K. Saraswat of the Defense Research and Development Organization's Research Centre Imarat (DRDO/RCI) discussed the common missile threats facing both India and the US, and the mutual benefits of working together on them.  He hoped that the US-India MD Workshop would lead to a formulation to mitigate such threats.  In her opening remarks, A/S Shankar added several key points, including:  - Both countries have the political commitment to advance missile defense cooperation and strengthen US-Indian ties;  - Both sides emphasize MD as a stabilizing tool to support the global security environment;  - India was among the first countries to recognize and support US missile defense proposals;  - The GOI welcomes the US offer to make the Patriot Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2) MD system available as part of NSSP (Next Steps in Strategic Partnership) Phase 1;  - India hopes for close cooperation with the US on missile defense technology over a long time horizon;  - Missile defense can help India maintain a credible \"No First Use\" nuclear posture;  - By itself, the international nuclear non-proliferation regime cannot stem proliferators, which \"tend to collect in our neighborhood\"; and,  - India is in an \"arc of proliferators,\" and MD might help stabilize the situation and neutralize those using \"nuclear blackmail.\"  3.  (SBU) Phil Jamison, OSD Office of Missile Defense Policy, noted the February 22 PAC-2 briefing in New Delhi at which US missile defense policy, including cooperation with allies and friends, had been discussed extensively.  He tied those discussions to the meeting in Hyderabad, suggesting that both sides might be able to look back and view these two weeks as the beginning of what could be a long-term missile defense relationship.  A/S Shankar agreed.  US Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Update --------------------------------------------- ----  4.  (SBU) Robert Ciarrocchi, Chief of MDA/ISA's Asia and Middle East Division, presented a status update on the US BMDS.  He emphasized Presidential guidance to deploy available missile defenses while working on future systems, and to cooperate with existing allies and new friends. Ciarrocchi explained MDA efforts to carry out that guidance, including a spiral development program that is moving from lower-tier missile defenses to overarching systems that integrate sensors, communication links, and interceptors for combating ballistic threats in boost, mid-course, and penetration phases.  He also underscored expanding MD cooperation with allies and friends worldwide.  5.  (C) Questions from the Indian delegation on Ciarrocchi's brief included:  - What types of MD memoranda of understanding does the US have with its partners?  - Are MD systems specifications based on the needs of friends and allies, or just on US needs?  - How important is interoperability with allies in US BMDS design?  - Does the US intend to have global missile launch and tracking sensors with regionalized interceptor batteries?  - What is the status of SBIRS (Space Based Infrared Radar System)?  - Are kinetic energy interceptors and spaced based missile defenses integrated or separate programs?  - What does the US mean by \"near-peer\" ballistic missile threat?  PLANEX/CPX Dialogue -------------------  6.  (S) Scott Barham, an SRS Technologies contractor for the MDA's Joint National Integration Center (JNIC), next opened a dialogue on the background, assumptions, scope, and agenda for the MD Workshop.  During those discussions, a large gap between GOI desires and what JNIC was prepared to deliver quickly became obvious.  MDA plans suggested a PLANEX and CPX using the JNIC's generic International Modeling and Simulation (IMS) software to provide ballistic missile attack planning and execution experience for policy-makers and air defense commanders.  While also anticipating a PLANEX and CPX, India hoped for very high-fidelity modeling and simulation that incorporated parameters of actual threats, including MD countermeasures, and parameters of actual/planned defense options against a variety of ballistic attack scenarios.  In short, the GOI wanted hard data for developing BMDS strategy and making acquisition decisions.  7.  (S) Barham explained that IMS can approximate threat and BMDS parameters well enough to aid in concept of operations development and to refine MD tactics, techniques and procedures, but that it was not an appropriate tool to generate data for acquisition decisions.  The Indians were concerned that the proposed exercises were not much of a step up from modeling and simulation demonstrations previously presented, but the US delegation assured them that the proposed PLANEX and CPX were fully interactive with outcomes that vary based on the decisions of the participants.  8.  (S) Jamison recommended that India initially focus on a realistic, but lower fidelity, plan to exercise decision-making at the policy and operational levels during a missile attack.  Specifically, he recommended an initial exercise scenario set in the 2008 time-frame.  He emphasized the importance of having a cross-section of relevant government policy-making organizations participate -- i.e., MOD and the PM,s security staff as well as MEA.  After further discussion, the Indian side agreed to the following vision for the PLANEX/CPX:  - Detection ability and intercept parameters as close as possible to BMDS planned for the 2008 time-frame;  - A two-part exercise with one iteration using stand-alone missile defenses and a second incorporating early warning sensors and upper-tier BMDS;  - Survivability of BMDS assets as part of the model;  - Simulation of geography and terrain that is relevant to India;  - Demonstration of differences in missile threats \"by way of timeline\";  - An exercise scope that includes land and sea-based (submarine launched) multi-directional ballistic attacks (no winged aircraft or cruise missiles) including missile launches from short, medium, and long distances; and  - Policy involvement at an appropriate level.  9.  (C) Additional dialogue centered around how JNIC could incorporate as many of the GOI desires as possible into the PLANEX/CPX using existing IMS software.  10.  (C) PolOff suggested that, in light of the gap between Indian desires for higher fidelity modeling and simulation and what the MDA was currently able to offer, the GOI could define their requirements and transmit a separate letter of request to the USG while continuing with the current effort. Jamison also suggested that both sides look for another forum to discuss missile defense policy-program issues, such as some type of US-India missile defense working group on the margins of other political-military technical discussions.   GOI Ballistic Missile Threat Perception ---------------------------------------  11.  (S) A.S. Sarma, DRDO/RCI Air Defense Project Director, gave a classified briefing on the GOI's perception of the Ballistic Missile Threat to India.  The Indian delegation asked that information contained in the brief not be given wide dissemination within the USG, but controlled on a need-to-know basis.  The brief included threat rings from existing ballistic threats in the region, as well as those under development.  The main thrust was that the ballistic threat to India was not from a single sector, but, in a worst-case scenario, could include coordinated, simultaneous attacks from 360 degrees with multiple objects.  (Note: A hard copy of the briefing was not made available to the US delegation.  End Note.)  GOI Proposals for Future Modeling & Simulation Cooperation --------------------------------------------- -------------  12.  (S) As part of the classified brief, the Indian delegation offered to make DRDO experts available, at some unspecified point in the future, for a collaborative effort with the US to develop advanced BMDS modeling and simulation software.  Speaking in the context of MD modeling and simulation, Sarma listed available Indian expertise as: 1) System Analysis, 2) Modeling and Simulation, 3) Planning and Control, and 4) Software Development.  His bottom line: if the US wants India to do (future) hardware and software development, that could be used with \"others,\" India wants to do it.  13.  (C) N. Prabhakar, a DRDO/RCI Project Director, also presented a \"BMD Simulation For Planning\" briefing that he characterized as a GOI \"wish list\" for cooperative BMD exercises.  GOI areas of interest, from his briefing slides, include:  - Threat Perception and Analysis;  - Effectiveness and Cost Economics;  - Design Considerations;  - Macro/Micro Planning; and  - Simulation Scenarios  Under Simulation Scenarios, Prabhakar listed additional sub-points as follows:  - Define the Parameters:   -- Ballistic Missile Threats   -- MD Countermeasures   -- BMDS  - Interception Policy:   -- Effects of Change in the Threat Pattern   -- Adaptability/Growth Potential   -- Cost of Defense   -- Time Imperatives   -- Kill Assessment  - Structure Definitions:   -- Impact of Lay-out Factors   -- Time-line Considerations   -- Hit to Kill/Near Miss   -- Warhead Kill Mechanisms   -- Multi-Sensors   -- Postulated Countermeasures  - Optimized Defense Layout   -- Leakage Probabilities   -- Defended Assets List   -- Sensor Capabilities   -- Launch Platforms   -- Sensor Platforms   -- Interceptor Capabilities   -- Communication Requirements   -- Command and Control Strategies and Alternatives   -- Integrated Logistics Management   -- Trade-Offs  - Nominal Performance   -- Worst Case Performance   -- Parametric Sensitivity   -- Monte Carlo (random \"roll of the dice\" scenarios)   -- Break Point Analysis  PLANEX/CPX Road Map ------------------  14.  (C) The working group reached broad agreement on the way ahead for a PLANEX as follows.  - 2005 Agenda:   -- May: Demonstration and technical explanation, by JNIC,      of the IMS tool (in India);   -- August: Working Group meeting and Initial Planning      Conference for the PLANEX (in India);   -- December: PLANEX (in India).  - Participation:   -- India: Representatives from the MOD, MEA, DRDO, NSCS,      and the military services;   -- US: Representatives from OSD/P, MDA/IS, MDA/IC, State,      and observers from PACOM.  - Primary Points of Contact:   -- India: Ms. Nutan Kapoor, MEA/DISA   -- US: Mr. Robert Ciarrocchi, MDA/ISA  - Purpose: Facilitated and iterative exercises to examine basic concepts of BMD planning and operations.  - Objectives:   -- Demonstrate impact of very short response times;   -- Demonstrate relevant short, medium, and long-range      ballistic threats from multiple directions;   -- Demonstrate basic MD planning skills, BMDS design, and      allocation of defensive resources;   -- Provide a representation of key policy and operational      challenges associated with BMD planning and execution.  - Basic Event Configuration:   -- A relevant scenario, for India, using notional      geography;   -- A relevant baseline threat depiction   -- Workstation configuration that incorporates both      policy and operational considerations;   -- A first iteration relying on stand-alone BMDS; and   -- A second iteration demonstrating the added value of      additional threat sensors and upper-tier BMDS.  15.  (C) The Indian delegation preferred not to set a time for the CPX Final Planning Conference or the CPX itself until after the PLANEX in December.  Details on the exact number and types of Indian participants and the IMS workstations needed to support them will be finalized at the August meeting.  MEA Closing Remarks -------------------  16.  (C) In her closing statement, A/S Shankar referred to the \"wish list\" briefing, and affirmed her hope that US-India MD cooperation would go well beyond the proposed PLANEX and CPX.  She claimed India may be interested in other BMD systems besides PAC-2, to include PAC-3, MEADS, and perhaps upper tier systems such as THAAD.  Shankar also stated that the GOI would like to build its overall strategic missile defense objectives in cooperation with the USG.  Comment -------  17.  (S) While not stated explicitly, the GOI appears to desire extensive US-India cooperation on BMDS, along the lines of what is developing between the US and Japan. Questions on MOUs, next generation BMDS, and availability of sensor and tracking data to US friends and allies all point in that direction, as do stated desires to cooperate on MD technology and formulate overall MD strategic objectives in coordination with the US.  Moreover, the Indian delegation gave the impression of being willing to devote enough resources to missile defense to become a significant player. Indian strategic thinking on missile defense is in its infancy, but, as related in a conversation on the margins between PolOff and Dr. Saraswat, DRDO/RCI is on the cutting edge of strategic and acquisition planning with its technical focus on making hard data available to policy-makers.  18.  (C) Noticeably lacking from the working group discussions were any significant GOI references to indigenous BMDS production, or reference to specific categories of targets they might like to defend against ballistic missile attack.  During the meetings they made no specific mention of co-production of BMDS hardware or other offsets that could be part of future MD collaboration, although in private conversation with Jamison, Saraswat hinted that such cooperation might be a desirable longer-term goal.  Workshop Participants ---------------------  19.  (SBU) Participants in the MD Workshop meetings included:  Indian Delegation: - Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Director, DRDO/RCI - Meera Shankar, MEA Additional Secretary (Intl. Security) - Nutan Kapoor Mahavar, MEA Under Secretary (DISA) - Santosh Jha, MEA Deputy Secretary (Americas) - N.

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) In response to Reftel and following our contacts with travelers to Thimphu, the Mission assesses little likelihood that the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) will use the upcoming census to justify further expulsions of ethnic Nepali citizens from Bhutan.  United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Representative Renata Dessallien, who resides in Thimphu, told Poloff on March 15 that such a move would go against current positive trends in Bhutan.  Dessallien cited recent positive changes in RGOB practices towards ethnic Nepali residents of Bhutan who have relatives in the Nepal camps, making it easier for them to access public service jobs, schools for their children and identity cards.  She noted that these steps are starting to reverse ten years of discrimination and doubted the RGOB would begin integrating ethnic Nepali relatives of refugees if they were planning further evictions.  2.  (C) Canadian High Commission Political Counselor Adrian Norfolk, who recently returned from Thimphu, told Poloff on March 9 that he believes the Bhutanese are moving in the right direction and will not use the census to expel ethnic Nepalese from the Kingdom.  He also mentioned that the RGOB, in a major policy shift, is now providing ID cards to ethnic Nepalese with family members in the refugee camps.  People have been waiting for years to get these cards to be eligible for government jobs, and it is unlikely that the Bhutanese government would decide to take these steps if they planned to use the census to expel more citizens, Norfolk stated.  3.  (C) However, our human rights contact offered a more cautious assessment.  According to Ravi Nair, Executive Director of the Asia Pacific Human Rights Network, a number of people from the eastern districts of Samdrup Jongkher, Mongar, Tashigang and Tashiyangchi have been left without ID cards after questions over their citizenship status arose during the census.  (Note: This view may not be accurate, because according to the Bhutanese Embassy, UNDP's Dessallien and Norfolk, the census has not yet begun.  End Note.)  4.  (C) The RGOB has not officially responded to our requests for information on the census, but Bhutanese First Secretary Karma Rinchhen stated on March 16 that the survey had not begun, and would take place later in the year over a two-day period.  Dessallien continued that the census has not commenced and that the RGOB plans to conduct the census in May of 2005, but predicted that it could also be delayed until the Fall because of logistical hurdles.  The census conducted this year will be more comprehensive than those done in the past and in line with international standards, Dessallien noted.  He added that the census will be conducted over a two-day period, and not district by district, as done previously.  Comment -------  5.  (C) Like UNDP and the Canadians, we also find it unlikely that the RGOB will use the census to deny citizenship to large numbers of its citizens.  The RGOB is quite sensitive to its international reputation and understands that the creation of another refugee problem is not in its best interests.  That said, it is likely that the census will uncover persons with questionable citizenship status, who may not receive ID cards. MULFORD " }

(U) In the GOI's first public comments on Secretary Rice's just-concluded visit to New Delhi, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran called it \"landmark\" and evidence of the US-India strategic partnership.  Speaking at a small CSIS-sponsored gathering of senior foreign policy experts on March 17, Saran observed that the term \"strategic partnership\" has been used so often with so many different countries that it has almost lost its meaning, but that in the case of US-India relations, the description indeed \"has such a character,\" and \"very substantive implications.\"  Democracy as \"Cement,\" Bilateral Interests Will Mesh --------------------------------------------- -------  2.  (U) Saran's based his assessment on two points:  -- the United States and India are two great, vibrant democracies, with diverse, pluralistic populations, which serve as \"cement\" for the relationship.  Ties have become so extensive that they touch almost every aspect of life. Conceding that there remains considerable cynicism in India about democracy as a slogan, the Foreign Secretary argued that \"when President Bush speaks about his commitment to democracy, he means it.\"  Democracy was a major reason for his (the President's) support of the US-India relationship, Saran stated.  -- India sees the United States as playing an important role in \"what India wants to become.\"  With India looking for \"larger strategic space for itself,\" and \"greater strategic autonomy,\" Saran said his current assumption was that these yearnings would not only \"not clash with India's interests,\" but that they would also \"mesh well with US objectives,\" and cited US-India cooperation during the Tsunami disaster as an example.  Energy, Defense Cooperation ---------------------------  3.  (U) The Foreign Secretary went on to highlight the energy dialogue and defense cooperation initiative as important outcomes from the visit.  The GOI and the United States need to work together on energy issues, he stated, because of India's \"mind-boggling energy needs.\"  Stressing that India cannot rely on fossile fuels, and will have to turn more to nuclear energy, he expressed clear satisfaction that greater civil nuclear cooperation is \"now on the table.\"  India was no longer facing a \"theological NO,\" he said, stressing that \"we need to talk about all issues\" and predicting that energy would become a major component of US-India relations in the future.  4.  (U) On defense cooperation, Saran spoke positively about moving beyond existing mil-mil ties, for example to defense research conducted by the two countries' private sectors, and to potential major acquisitions.  Citing Secretary Rice's comments that the US wishes to be seen as a reliable partner, the Foreign Secreary made the obligatory reference to \"reliability of supply,\" reiterating that the most important concern for India was predictability.  Noting that India is one of the few states with the resources for and interest in purchasing 125 combat aircraft, he said reliability was something that \"exercises the Indian mind.\"  \"If we could reconcile these differences, the two countries would enter an important new era,\" he stated.  5.  (U) Saran concluded his remarks that he was very optimistic about the prospects for US-India relations, and that India was looking forward to the President's visit. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary:  In an upbeat assessment of Secretary Rice's first visit to India, MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar described the action agenda that the Secretary left behind as \"the most significant road map we've had in the last 47 years.\"  Areas for immediate progress include expanding the bilateral dialogue on strategic issues, initiating an Energy Dialogue, and reinvigorating the Economic Dialogue.  Using the Secretary's comment that international institutions must adapt to reflect how the world has changed, the GOI is also eager to engage the US on India's role in those organizations.  End Summary.  Expanding Strategic Dialogue ----------------------------  2.  (C) Following Secretary Rice's positive and productive visit to New Delhi, DCM, PolCouns, and PolMilOff met with J/S Jaishankar, MEA Director (Americas) Renu Pall, and Deputy Secretary (Americas) Santosh Jha on March 17 to review ways  SIPDIS to advance issues raised during the Secretary's visit.  DCM thanked the GOI for their efforts to make Secretary Rice's first visit to India a success.  Jaishankar was clearly very pleased with the substance of the Secretary's visit and about the glowing response her visit inspired in the national and international press.  3.  (C) Using the impetus of the Secretary's visit, the DCM outlined the three key ideas that had emerged from the visit that need immediate action:  expanding the current strategic dialogue, inaugurating an energy dialogue, and revitalizing the economic dialogue.  While the NSSP will remain a valuable framework for strengthening US-India relations, the array of strategic issues on which the US and India have complementary interests is broader than the NSSP alone and should be reflected in an expanded, senior-level strategic dialogue. In addition to civil nuclear, space, high tech, and missile defense under the NSSP umbrella, the Secretary and her interlocutors had agreed that a high-level strategic dialogue would address broader global and regional security concerns, India's defense requirements, including co-production, early warning and command and control systems, high tech trade facilitation, and the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  4.  (C) Expanding on some these ideas, the DCM suggested both sides explore forming a working group of ISRO, NASA, and other officials to identify more areas for US-India cooperation in the civil space field.  Irrespective of the status of the PSI Core Group, the DCM reiterated the Secretary's hope that India would agree to adhere to the  SIPDIS Statement of Principles and might host a regional PSI event this year.  5.  (C) Jaishankar asked whether the proposed strategic dialogue would have Cabinet-level representation.  DCM noted this idea is only in the formative stages, but the Secretary would likely be the intellectual lead, with most of the substantive discussion done at lower levels.  Noting the broad scope of the strategic dialogue, and the increasing degree of commonality in our global security interests, PolCouns encouraged the GOI to consider that such a dialogue has the potential to surpass the NSSP in its significance to the bilateral relationship.  6.  (C) In light of the Secretary and FM's common desire to conclude NSSP Phase II soon, DCM inquired about the status of draft export control legislation.  Jaishankar acknowledged that the US decision to include a civil nuclear component in the energy dialogue would be helpful, but cautioned that, unlike the US system, in the Indian system, \"drafting legislation is the hard part, not passing it.\"  The Ministry of Commerce is officially in charge of drafting the legislation, but Jaishankar lamented that Commerce had earlier been  \"completely laid back\" about the priority of this legislation, \"giving equal weight to export controls as the import of car parts.\"  However, he was encouraged by Commerce Minister Kamal Nath's lunch discussion with the Secretary and promised to invoke the commitments made by the  SIPDIS FM to Secretary Rice to generate movement in Commerce. PolCouns pointed out that Washington has now taken several steps to improve the atmosphere for NSSP progress, and urged the GOI to share its draft export control legislation in fulfillment of Phase II of the NSSP as quickly as possible.  Emerging Energy Dialogue ------------------------  7.  (C) Recognizing that India's growing energy needs will continue to influence its foreign policy, an Indo-US energy dialogue might address issues such as energy security, civil-nuclear cooperation, and environmental concerns. Remarking that the March 16 New York Times article, \"US May Help India to Build a Nuclear Power Plant\" may have been overly optimistic, DCM noted that Secretary Rice's discussions on this issue nevertheless still represent a great step forward.  Jaishankar described \"asymmetrical\" systems for energy engagement, with the Department of Energy leading US energy policy, including nuclear energy.  In the Indian system, responsibility is split among several ministries, including Petroleum, Environment, Non-Conventional Energy, and the Department of Atomic Energy.   8.  (C) On the proposed India-Iran pipeline, DCM lamented that Indian press articles on the subject overemphasized the disagreement, especially considering that there has not yet been a determination that the GOI will proceed with the project, while underplaying the significance of initiating a broad energy dialogue.  Jaishankar stated that he was impressed with the high degree of openness in the Secretary's discussions and agreed that the press had overplayed disagreement in her comments regarding Iran.  Reinvigorating the Economic Dialogue ------------------------------------  9.  (C) DCM hoped that upcoming visits by Transportation Secretary Mineta and Treasury Secretary Snow to India would  SIPDIS re-energize the Economic Dialogue.  Further, Ambassador Mulford would likely use his late April visit to the US to discuss the CEO Forum with appropriate Washington officials.  India's International Role --------------------------  10.  (C) Jaishankar carefully explained that the GOI viewed the Secretary's statement that the world had changed and international institutions should reflect those changes was viewed by the GOI as \"forward movement,\" but understood this was no commitment about the US position on UNSC reform. Jaishankar said he had spoken to other members of the Secretary's delegation  who underscored that the Secretary  SIPDIS said \"international institutions,\" not specifically the UN, and invited India to explore what that might mean. Jaishankar queried whether, with \"reasonable inference,\" India might seek to participate in the G-8.  Jaishankar acknowledged that the US had \"consciously chosen not to show its hand\" regarding UNSC membership, but emphasized that India wanted to \"get into the process early\" and define their position on UN reforms.  Toward this goal, Jaishankar said he would draft a cable instructing Ambassador Sen to invite Senior Advisor on UN Reform Shirin Tahir-Kheli to India in March or early April to discuss US priorities for UN reform with FS Saran.  Explaining that she had just been appointed, the DCM cautioned that Ambassador Tahir-Kheli may not be able to meet on such a short time frame  Failing a separate visit to India, Jaishankar offered that perhaps the FS might join the FM on the April visit to Washington to discuss the matter with Ambassador Tahir-Kheli.  Clarification about MRCA Response ---------------------------------  11.  (S) Jaishankar also sought clarification about the Secretary's indication that the US will participate in the  SIPDIS Request for Information (RFI) for the sale of 126 multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA), asking whether the US must seek a license to respond to the RFI.  DCM clarified that the US will need a license in the next step, the Request for Proposals (RFP), but the US will deliver its formal response in a letter more quickly.  Jaishankar was relieved, saying, \"We have creatively stretched this window for a long time,\" and the GOI was under pressure from \"those who might lose out\" because of US participation in the bid.  He strongly urged that the US deliver the letter as soon as possible, in a few days.  Cooperation on Bangladesh -------------------------  12.  (S) Citing US-India cooperation on Nepal as a \"model,\" Jaishankar suggested that A/S Rocca stop in New Delhi before a proposed visit to Bangladesh in April.  DCM inquired about the possibility of greater intelligence-sharing to which Jaishankar responded that the GOI could organize a \"fairly detailed\" briefing for A/S Rocca during her visit.  Maintaining Policy Line on the LOC ----------------------------------  13.  (C) In response to apparently differing Indian interpretations about discussions about the Line of Control, and noting that the FM and Manmohan Singh had also raised the issues of LOC sanctity and infiltrations, PolCouns clarified that there was \"no change in US policy\" on this matter.  Next Steps ----------  14.  (U) Jaishankar cautioned that the suggestion to slightly postpone the FM's trip to Washington to April 17-18 was only tentative until the GOI can confirm that he is available on these dates.  Both the DCM and Jaishankar agreed that the FM's visit should lay the groundwork for the PM's visit to Washington in the summer, the dates of which also have to be fixed. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: As India's leading newsmagazine splashed across the cover of its March 21 issue, \"the halo has slipped,\" from Sonia Gandhi after Congress' electoral setbacks and questionable decisions in Bihar, Goa, and Jharkhand.  The long term impact for Congress and the BJP is unlikely to be serious.  Congress has closed ranks behind Mrs. Gandhi and PM Manmohan Singh, and media attention could quickly turn elsewhere.  Congress' failed gambles in remote state elections, are likely to have little or no impact in New Delhi, where the UPA remains firmly in control.  Congress heavyhandedness has angered allies in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), but they are content with the status quo and will do nothing to risk a government downfall.  As long as the UPA alliance remains firm, the BJP cannot use this episode to score substantive gains, although Congress faces increased pressure from the BJP as a result of the USG decision to revoke Gujarat CM Modi's visa (Septel).  End Summary.  Electoral Missteps ------------------  2.  (C) A series of Congress miscalculations and missteps has damaged Sonia Gandhi's image as the \"renunciate\" who gave up her chance to become Prime Minister, and tarnished her party's reputation.  Regional parties dominated in the three states that recently-concluded assembly elections (Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana).  Congress unwillingness to acknowledge their predominance has spoiled ties with several regional allies, and opened the party to charges that it was undermining democracy.  3.  (C) According to press reports, two coteries, one local and one in New Delhi, devised the Congress electoral strategy in these elections and convinced Mrs. Gandhi to approve it. In Delhi, the principal campaign leaders included HRD Minister Arjun Singh, senior Congress leader M.I. Fotedar, and Water Resources Minister Priyaranjan Das Munshi.  The Congress leaders in the states included: All India Congress Committee (AICC) functionary Subodh Kant Sahai, former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Ajit Jogi, Jharkhand Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, and former MP R.K Anand.  These leaders recommended that the party not nurse the UPA coalition, in favor of building a base for a Congress revival in North India.  Mrs. Gandhi purportedly agreed to cast aside Laloo Prasad Yadav, and to ally with Bihar Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan and Jharkhand tribal leader Shibu Soren.  4.  (C) The strategy fared miserably in both Jharkhand and Bihar.  In Bihar, Congress declined from 12 assembly seats to 10, and in Jharkhand from 11 to nine, while Laloo's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) won 75 seats in Bihar to remain the state's largest party.  Soren and Paswan failed to win enough seats to secure a majority in either state.  If Congress had not burned its bridges with the RJD, and divided the anti-BJP vote, the UPA could have easily formed the government in Jharkhand and Bihar.  Anti-Democratic Heavyhandedness -------------------------------  5.  (C) Having failed at the ballot box and managed its coalition poorly, Congress then compounded its errors by trying to use compliant governors to install UPA governments in Goa and Jharkhand, even when they did not have a majority.  The strategy compelled the Supreme Court to intervene in the Jharkhand case, while the ruling party ended-up dismissing its own government in Goa.  The NDA was quick to respond in the media, accusing Congress of \"murdering democracy,\" and \"attempting to return to the bad old days of the Emergency.\"   Is Sonia Responsible --------------------  6.  (C) Although the BJP has attacked the PM for being \"invisible,\" party President L.K. Advani acknowledged that the PM had little, if any, role in the recent political machinations, declaring Sonia Gandhi as the principal culprit.  The pro-BJP weekly \"India Today\" argued in its March 21 cover story that despite Congress attempts to distance her from the fiasco, the governors in Jharkhand and Goa could not have acted without her assent, and without keeping her fully informed throughout.  \"India Today\" described Mrs. Gandhi's renunciation of the Prime Ministership as a \"show\" meant to provide her \"maximum empowerment by other means,\" arguing that she personally makes all major political decisions, has masterminded the Congress political strategy since the UPA came to power in 2004, and should therefore be held responsible.  Dissension in the Ranks -----------------------  7.  (C) These state level developments have caused dissension within the UPA, with the regional satraps resentful of Congress meddling and heavy-handedness.  Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Chief Sharad Pawar continues to resent Mrs. Gandhi for selecting the Chief Minister in Maharashtra, even though the NCP won more seats than Congress in the Fall 2004 elections there.  Although Laloo Yadav remains dependent on a sympathetic UPA government in New Delhi to return to power in Bihar, he has publicly expressed bitterness and anger for the way he has been treated.  8.  (C) The next round of state level elections is scheduled for February 2006, when Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala go to the polls.  Congress does not have a sufficient power base to come to power on its own in any of the three states, and will again have to rely on regional allies to form UPA governments.  In Tamil Nadu, UPA ally DMK Chief M. Karunanidhi, has already stated that he will not share power with his Congress allies should he win.  In West Bengal and Kerala, Congress will contest against the Communists.  Confessions and Confusion from Congress ---------------------------------------  9.  (C) In a March 15 meeting with Poloff, AICC Secretary Wasim Ahmed admitted that his party had made a series of blunders over the past several months.  Laying the principal blame on such state level politicians as, Ranajan Das Munshi, Subodh Kant Sahai, Ajit Jogi, and Syed Sibtey Razi.  Ahmed asserted that they told the Congress High Command that:  --Laloo Yadav was very vulnerable and could be removed from power; --Ram Vilas Paswan would deliver the Muslim and Dalit vote on election day; --Paswan and Congress would form the Bihar government without Laloo Yadav; --Shibu Soren's JMM would emerge as the largest party in Jharkhand; --Congress and the JMM would form the government in Jharkhand; and --Congress could use the Goa governor to grab power there.  10.  (C) Ahmed argued that neither Mrs. Gandhi, the PM, nor senior advisors Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, and Makhan Lal Fotedar should bear any responsibility, as they had all relied on state cadres for advice.  He claimed that he and other party insiders have told Mrs. Gandhi that the election outcome signals the need for a change in strategy, and that Congress must stop interfering with its regional allies, give them free reign, or face disaster.  In Ahmed's view, UPA allies are now united in their suspicion of Congress, and if not placated will stop cooperating, leading to potential UPA losses in Bihar, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh (UP), with the Communists poised to decimate Congress in Kerala and West Bengal.  Ahmed maintained that Congress must reassure the regional parties by humbly supporting Laloo Yadav's efforts to regain power in Bihar, ending support for Paswan, and convincing the DMK in Tamil Nadu, and the Communists in West Bengal and Kerala, that Congress would not seriously oppose them in 2006. 11.  (C) Ahmed also confirmed that the Congress strategy for reviving its fortunes in UP has not been successful, and that the party has decided that since it cannot return to power on its own, it must play junior partner to a regional party. Ahmed claimed that Congress is currently negotiating an informal alliance with BSP leader and former Chief Minister (CM) Mayawati, under which the two parties would not contest against each other in key constituencies, and Congress would support Mayawati for CM after the election.  The negotiations are not going smoothly, he maintained, as Mayawati is not yet convinced that Congress can provide much help in her battle against her rival and current CM Mulayam Singh Yadav.  Until an agreement can be worked-out, Congress has no choice but to leave Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) in control.  Straight Talk from a Journalist -------------------------------  12.  (C) Political journalist Zafar Agha stressed to Poloff on March 15 that Congress and the BJP would both like to reduce the influence of regional parties and create a two party system in India.  According to Agha, Congress hoped to remove Laloo Yadav and replace him with pliant allies -- Paswan in Bihar, and Shibu Soren in Jharkhand -- but has failed on both counts.  Agha argued that both parties would continue to displace regional parties whenever they had an opportunity, but were not overly concerned about failure, as political battles in remote areas like Bihar and Jharkhand have little practical impact in New Delhi.  Agha maintained that it was ludicrous to believe that Mrs. Gandhi did not approve the Congress strategy, asserting that \"few believe Congress efforts to lay the blame on a few rogue officials.\"  13.  (C) Agha pointed out that the news was really not that bad for Congress and the UPA.  He predicted that the NDA government in Jharkhand would be weak and may not last as long as six months before the UPA brings it down.  Likewise, the UPA will exercise de-facto rule in Bihar, and likely form the government there, with or without Laloo.  In Agha's estimation, the losses and gains from the recent election were largely symbolic.  The BJP is pleased because it can use its friends in the media to create the impression of a BJP/NDA revival, and that Congress has been humbled. However, there will be few substantive benefits for the BJP, in that it cannot change the balance of power in New Delhi. While UPA allies in the states will continue to grumble, they will remain solidly with Congress in New Delhi, as they want political stability, and have nowhere else to go, he maintained.  Comment -------  14.  (C) While the BJP has used this episode to score points against its Congress rivals, shore up its National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and cast doubt upon the credibility of Sonia Gandhi and PM Singh, the long-term gains could be minimal. The NDA government in Jharkhand will be weak and vulnerable and the BJP does not have the strength on the ground to come to power in next year's elections.  Although Congress has lost some of its luster, the Indian economy continues to do well, there are no pressing law and order or communal problems, and most Indians are happy with improved India/Pakistan relations.  15.  (C) Another party would replace advisors who gave its leaders poor advice and devised a flawed strategy.  Such moves are anathema in Congress, however, where personal loyalty to Sonia Gandhi is prized above performance.  Within the Congress culture, loyal footsoldiers are seldom called to task, and no prominent Congress leader is likely to lose his or her job over this episode.  Confident that it can maintain the UPA alliance in New Delhi, Congress will wait for this episode to blow over.  16.  (C)  Congress faces increased pressure from the BJP as a result of the USG decision to revoke Gujarat CM Modi's visa. For analysis see Septel. MULFORD " }

Blake, Jr., for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (U) This is an action request, see paragraph 6.  2.  (C) Summary: Amid extensive media coverage of the USG decision to not issue an A2 visa to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and to revoke his B1/B2 visa, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran called the DCM to his office late afternoon on March 18 to express the GOI's \"grave concern\" and to request the USG to reconsider the decision.  Characterizing it as \"uncalled for\" and a display of a \"lack of courtesy and sensitivity,\" in an otherwise friendly meeting Saran conveyed GOI concern that our decision had already incited a controversy and threatened to spark just the kind of divisiveness the US alleges Modi himself facilitated.  Saran emphasized the GOI considers Modi a democratically-elected Chief Minister under the Indian Constitution, and that the US should take this into consideration.  The DCM assured the Foreign Secretary that the USG's decision has been in accordance with US law, which he explained in some detail. Following the meeting with the DCM, the MEA issued a statement, the full text of which is in paragraph 7.  End Summary.  Opinion Versus Office ---------------------  3.  (C) Saran argued to the DCM that the USG had made a decision based on opinion, an opinion that even some in India hold.  That opinion, however, is a separate issue from the fact that Modi is a constitutionally-mandated office holder whose position derives from the people.  Saran argued that the US as a democracy would appreciate this, and argued that the dignity of the office of Chief Minister cannot be overridden.  Calling the USG determination that Modi had failed to act in Gujarat during the 2002 riots a \"subjective judgment,\" Saran suggested that perhaps Washington had not considered that this was a separate issue in the Indian mind.  Reverse Effect --------------  4.  (C) Appreciating the importance the USG attaches to religious freedom, Saran cautioned that this determination could have an effect opposite from that intended -- a strong emotional reaction which had the potential to polarize the Indian people.  This would not be in the interest of religious harmony, or shared US and Indian objectives, he noted.  Highlighting the political ramifications, Saran observed that Parliament was in session and said \"this will no doubt become a major issue,\" adding that the BJP was \"up in arms.\"  Saran stated that this incident might \"open up an odd type of standard to give or not give visas.\"  Request for Reconsideration ---------------------------  5.  (C) In light of the above considerations: that Modi's office is separate from the subjective judgment of his complicity, and the possibility that this decision could heighten intercommunal tensions, Saran requested the DCM to ask Washington to reconsider its decision.  The DCM explained the two parts of our decision, the refusal of the A2, and the revocation of the B1/B2, highlighting that we had acted in accordance with our own law and democratic constitution. Noting the considerable popular and Congressional interest in this case, the DCM told Saran that we had taken into consideration independent reports, including that of India's own National Human Rights Commission, and that the decision was not taken capriciously, but involved many people in Washington.  The DCM also noted that the most recent USG International Religious Freedom Report had characterized the overall state of religious freedom in India as improving.  6.  (C) Action request: In light of Foreign Secretary Saran's request that the USG give Modi's visa application urgent reconsideration, post requests a review of the case, so we can respond back to Saran on March 19 (the day Modi was to travel.)  (Post does not expect any change, but would appreciate a cable telling the GOI we took a fresh look and decided to maintain our decision.)  7.  (U) The MEA issued a statement following Saran's meeting with the DCM.  Begin text:  The Government of India expresses its deep concern and regret that the Embassy of the United States of America denied a visa to Shri Narendra Modi, Hon. Chief Minister of Gujarat, to visit the US for an event organized by the Asian American Hotel Owners' Association.  The visa had been requested by the Ministry of External Affairs through a note verbal (sic) to the Embassy on February 28, 2005.  This action on the part of the US Embassy is uncalled for and displays lack of courtesy and sensitivity towards a constitutionally elected Chief Minister of a state of India.  The Ministry of External Affairs has called the Head of Mission of the Embassy to the Ministry to lodge a strong protest against the denial of visa to Modi and to request an urgent reconsideration.

NEW DELHI 2094      B. STATE 47876      C. MUMBAI 756  Classified By: DCM Robert O. Blake, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) Summary: The March 18 USG revocation of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's visa has set off strong criticism in the BJP, and prompted the Foreign Secretary to call in the DCM to lodge a protest (Ref A), followed by an MEA statement expressing its \"deep concern and regret.\"  The BJP reacted immediately, with its spokesman denouncing the move as \"condemnable\" and \"an insult to the nation.\"  Not all reaction has been negative, however, with Congress politicians, human rights activists and Christian and Muslim leaders welcoming the move.  Modi remains unpopular inside and outside his party, and we expect few outside the BJP to defend him.  Mission closed FCS and USEFI offices in Ahmedabad as a precaution, convened an EAC (Septel), and is monitoring reactions in Hindu nationalist quarters to gauge the likelihood of anti-American violence.  This incident will chill our relations with the Gujarat government and the BJP, but we expect no other serious or longterm national consequences.  End Summary.  2.  (C) In an attempt to explain the decision (Ref B) to the BJP leadership before the news hit the wires, DCM called former Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha on March 18 to inform him of the impending denial and revocation (Sinha had called DCM the previous day on behalf of Modi to press for a timely decision).  Drawing from press guidance, the DCM reviewed the reasons for the action.  Sinha accepted the explanation calmly, but noted that the USG process did not allow Modi the opportunity to express his side of the case, which amounted to a \"conviction without trial.\"  The DCM replied that the decision was based in part on the assessments of Indian organizations, including the independent National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).  Sinha expressed appreciation for the heads-up.  The DCM also informed MEA Acting Joint Secretary (Americas) Renu Pall of our impending decision, who  SIPDIS expressed thanks for the advance notice.  The CG's Revocation -------------------  3.  (C) The Consul General called in Gujarat New Delhi Resident Representative Aral Meena to explain the decision to deny Chief Minister Modi's A2 visa and revoke his valid B1/B2 visa.  Meena was also given a sealed letter addressed to Modi formally notifying him of the decision.  Before returning the passport, the Consul General cancelled Modi,s B2 visa issued in 1998 (valid until June 2008).  Modi,s A2 application was also refused under section 214b.  A name check failed to return a Department hit for Modi under Section 212 (a)(2)(G), and the NIV system does not permit overseas posts to make this entry.  Consul General decided, therefore to enter a P2G quasi-refusal in Modi,s name.  Post recommends that Department make the formal CLASS entry and remove (CLOK) our temporary quasi refusal entry.  4.  (C) Meena appeared genuinely shocked that the visa had been denied, and perhaps more than a little concerned at having to pass on the bad news.  Although clearly not acting on instructions, he urged the CG to let Modi present his case, and requested that the USG discuss the matter with the GOI, arguing that Modi was a good friend to the US, and that this step would have a negative impact on the India-US relationship.  5.  (C) CG explained that while we recognized the sensitivity of this issue, it was a decision based in law and not foreign policy or other considerations.  The decision reflected only the fact that US law required denying entry to the United States to any foreign government official who was believed to have been responsible for particularly serious violations of others, religious freedom.  Meena pushed again for an opportunity for Modi to present his case, or for the Embassy to discuss the matter with the GOI.  CG replied that the Embassy is always willing to discuss sensitive issues with the government, and if Mr. Modi wished to write to us we would pass his concerns to Washington.  CG stressed, however, that this decision had been very carefully considered and that Meena should not leave with the impression that it was likely to be reconsidered.  Media Frenzy Follows --------------------  6.  (U) Following the revocation, Indian media carried largely factual reports based on Department's press guidance, noting that A2 visa was denied \"because Modi was not coming for the purpose that qualified him for the visa,\" and that the revokation of his B2 visa was a result of US law that prohibits issuance to anyone \"responsible for or who directly carried out at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\"  One report characterized the matter as \"a stinging snub\" to the Chief Minister.  Angry BJP Response ------------------  7.  (U) The BJP reacted almost immediately, with party VP Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi describing the step as \"condemnable and serious,\" adding that \"we do not need a certificate from any government.  We are proud of our religious freedom and democracy.  This is not only an insult to Gujarat or Modi. It is an insult to the nation.\"  Naqvi demanded that the GOI \"take up this issue\" with the USG, asking whether it had been discussed with Secretary Rice during her recent visit to New Delhi.  In a formal statement to the press, Sinha noted: \"I am surprised that the US Government has taken a unilateral view on this.  While the question of issuing a visa is the sovereign right of any nation, the reasons they have given are unacceptable.  Coming to such a decision without consulting or taking into account the views of the Gujarat Government is unacceptable.\"  Modi supporters reportedly protested in the Gujarat administrative center Gandhinagar, calling on their compatriots to boycott American products and bar U.S. citizens from the state.  Modi Angry ----------  8.  (U) In a 1400 press conference, Modi thanked the Indian community in the US for inviting him, characterizing his visa revocation as \"an insult to 50 million Gujaratis and the Indian Constitution, and an attack on Indian sovereignty.\" He asked how the USG could interfere in India's internal affairs, especially since no American or international court has found his government guilty of any crime.  Modi berated the US for maintaining \"double standards\" by preventing him from entering, while treating Pakistani President Musharraf as an \"honored guest, despite the fact that Pakistan-sponsored terrorism had killed many Kashmiris and forced Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) from the state.  Urging the GOI to \"rise above politics\" and intervene on his behalf, Modi pledged to write to PM Manmohan Singh to \"take up the matter.\"  Others are Not --------------  9. (U) Arjun Modhvadia, head of the Congress delegation in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, was quick to assign blame to Modi himself for the visa denial, saying \"People the world over know that Modi has been involved in human rights violations by orchestrating the Gujarat riots.  The visa denial is the direct fallout of his tainted image.\"  Positive Reactions from Mumbai ------------------------------  10.  (C) Yogesh Kamdar, VP of the Indian People's Union for Civil Liberties, told Mumbai Pol/Econ Chief that secular forces across India would applaud the decision.  At the same time, the USG should expect a critical, differentiated reaction to the decision, even among observers, like himself, who have the sense that \"justice has been done\" to Modi.  To many Indians, the decision will look very selective, and will not appear as a \"normative or moral\" action, Kamdar predicted.  Commentators from across the political spectrum will probably ask why Modi was picked out \"as there at least 10,000 leaders like Modi who have committed similar crimes,\" such as Pakistani President Musharraf or former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, yet nobody would expect the USG to deny visas to such leaders.  The USG should therefore prepare itself to address such criticism in India in the coming weeks, he advised.  Predicting that the decision would strengthen Modi's position in his political battles against rising opposition within his own party in Gujarat (Ref C), Kamdar observed that the BJP may have disliked Modi, but Gujaratis are close-knit and clannish and will rally around their leader when they think he is under attack from outsiders.  11.  (C) Maharashtra-based Human rights activist Javed Anand called Mumbai's Pol/Econ Chief soon after the first TV reports to thank the USG.  Anand and his wife Teesta Setalvad head a civil rights NGO that was instrumental in moving the Indian Supreme Court to re-open criminal investigations into the 2002 Gujarat killings, and edit \"Communalism Combat,\" a bi-monthly magazine devoted to investigative reports on communal relations in India.  Anand said the decision would remind India that the world had not forgotten the Gujarat riots and that those responsible still need to be held accountable.  A Muslim who is normally very critical of USG human rights policy,  Anand predicted that Muslims in India and elsewhere would applaud the decision, which he called \"a step that re-establishes our faith in American democracy.\" Anand predicted that many Indian secularists will fax their support to the Embassy and the Consulate.  He quoted one elated human rights activist as saying:  \"This decision is in the tradition of Jefferson and Lincoln.\"  In a call to Congen Mumbai, Urdu newspaper publisher Moin Ahmed called the revocation \"a very good step,\" noting that \"we are going to thank the US government in tomorrow's edition.\"  12.  (C) Adil Bagadia, the Muslim owner of a large construction and engineering company in Ahmedebad, told Mumbai Pol/Econ Chief that the decision was the major topic among mosque visitors during Friday prayers.  For most Muslims the decision was &great news,8 he reported.  Based on Modi's mindset and that of his supporters, the decision would have come as a &shock and a jolt8 to them, Bagadia commented.  While officially many BJP officials in Gujarat will speak of outrage and insult, they will be concerned that other countries could follow the USG lead and ban Modi, or that they, too, could also risk losing their ability to travel to the United States.  Modi,s supporters reportedly were worried that the opposition to him at the state level was not dissipating, despite continued strong backing from BJP party chief LK Advani.  The USG decision would only increase their insecurity, Bagadia alleged.  The announcement would therefore probably strengthen Modi,s position in the short term, but it is yet another stain on his image that could be exploited in the medium term by the growing number of BJP members who opposed Modi, Bagadia stated.  Mission Takes Precautions -------------------------  13.  (C) Although there have been no reports of anti-American violence, DCM convened the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) to discuss the potential for threats against the Mission, its employees, or US interests generally, ordered the closure of the FCS and USEFI offices in Ahmedabad as a precautionary measure, and issued a Warden Message urging Amcits to \"keep abreast of news reports regarding reaction to the US Government's decision and to avoid any area in which demonstrations may arise.\"  Post will closely monitor developments to determine the likelihood, if any, of violence. Comment -------  14.  (C) The Congress-led UPA government now finds itself in the awkward position of defending one of its harshest opponents, but its protest appears to be more in the order of going through the motions in \"the national interest\" than a spirited defense of Modi  The BJP will also close ranks behind Modi, although his many opponents within the BJP will privately applaud his predicament, while making pro-forma protestations of outrage.  In private, India's secular parties (whether allied with the BJP or not) will likely express a range of views, from euphoria to indifference, but will be careful about their public comments, as they consider this to be a BJP problem.  Although this incident will chill our relations with the Gujarat government and the BJP, we do not expect serious or longterm national consequences. MULFORD " }

(SBU) Summary: Deputy Secretary of Labor Steven J. Law's February 21-27 visit to India to review progress on the DOL- sponsored INDUS Child Labor effort and other DOL-sponsored projects was well received by GOI officials, project managers, and participants.  The highest-ranking Labor Department official ever to visit India, D/S Law also met with national, state and local government officials, NGOs, and business leaders to discuss child labor and general labor-related issues.  He was accompanied by representatives from DOL's International Child Labor Program and the Bureau of International Labor Affairs.  The visit also focused attention on the problem of trafficking and bonded labor in India, indicating that these issues are likely to become areas of greater interest to DOL in the future.  From the Mission standpoint, the INDUS projects are outstanding examples of \"quiet successes\" that address important humanitarian problems while also advancing US-India relations.  End Summary.  INDUS Child Labor Project Site Visits -------------------------------------  2.  (U) D/S Law traveled to two INDUS project sites, Kanchipuram (Tamil Nadu) and Aurangabad (Maharashtra), meeting with officials and rehabilitated child laborers enrolled in school as a result of the INDUS Project on Preventing and Eliminating Child Labor in Identified Hazardous Sectors, a technical cooperation venture between the USG and GOI implemented and monitored by the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor. D/S Law, accompanied by senior ILO officials, expressed satisfaction with the advanced state of the programs and with the efforts of local officials and project managers to coordinate activities with parents and employers.  The INDUS project is currently providing educational and training opportunities to more than 44,000 children.  The INDUS project appears to have made impressive progress in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, and the program is likely to reach over 100,000 children by the time it expires in 2007.  3.  (U) After witnessing how the INDUS project had improved children's lives at both sites, the D/S commented that the programs there could serve as examples for the rest of India and South Asia region.  Children and their parents spoke movingly about their aspirations for the future, with school children in Aurangabad imploring the USG to continue its support for the project beyond its anticipated three-year life.  NGOs in Tamil Nadu commented that while the state government had been proactive on child labor, authorities needed to do a lot more to meet their goal of eradicating child labor by 2007 (one of the 15-point Action Plan goals of the state's Chief Minister).  NGOs remarked that the legislative framework was good, but that enforcement had to be improved drastically.  ILO-DOL -------  4.  (U) D/S Law also held discussions on two joint DOL-ILO projects -- Decent Employment for Women in India and the Prevention of HIV/AIDS.  He noted that the success of these projects serves to engage Indian officials and could be replicable elsewhere in South Asia.  5.  (U) During a visit to the Decent Employment for Women project site in New Delhi, D/S Law was moved by success stories that beneficiaries - economically deprived women - shared with him.  Touring the shanty town slum just after a stop by visiting Afghan President Karzai, Law witnessed many women and children whose lives had undergone a distinct change after participating in the project.  The project has trained over 3000 women in Bangalore and New Delhi, providing them with skills that have enabled them to find productive decent employment.  IJM/Bonded Labor ----------------  6.  (SBU) In an expression of increasing DOL interest in the issue of bonded labor in India, the D/S met with representatives from NGOs and the US-based International Justice Mission (IJM) in Chennai and Mumbai for briefings on child and bonded labor in India.  He listened to the testimony of freed bonded laborers at a site visit on the outskirts of Chennai hosted by IJM.  Workers recounted how entire families worked at rice mills in Tamil Nadu to pay off loans taken from the mill owners.  The laborers indicated that while they had been rehabilitated under government-sponsored programs, they were free today largely due to the efforts of IJM activists.  (Comment:  The area from which the laborers were rescued has been under intense media and government scrutiny in recent months.  In November 2004, India's National Commission for Women held a public hearing in the region on the condition of bonded laborers and castigated the local administration for not tackling the issue.  A report of this hearing has been pouched to DRL and DOL/ILAB.  End Comment.)  Software and Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) --------------------------------------------- -------  7.  (U) In Chennai, D/S Law held productive discussions with members of the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), India's largest and most important IT industry group (890 member firms), on the growing interaction between Indian and US businesses in high technology sectors.  Arguing that outsourcing had become an integral part of the world economy that no one could stop, Indian participants expressed concern over the length of time it took to obtain visas (e.g. alleging twelve week waits for a six-week assignment), and urged the USG to develop a \"business passport.\"  Interlocutors also did not wish India to be viewed as \"low cost labor,\" but rather \"quality labor.\"  In view of the extensive and rapidly expanding US-India linkages in the IT sector, interlocutors were especially keen to identify issues that could impact their future ties with US firms.  8.  (U) D/S Law also met with a large group from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), a major trade association headquartered in New Delhi.  In a presentation on the overall labor scene in India, labor law expert Dr. C.S. Venkata Ratnam argued that reforms in India's archiac labor laws were necessary, but maintained that existing legislation was not a major impediment for companies (in-depth analysis follows septel). Ratnam also called for better enforcement of existing laws relating to child and forced labor.  9.  (U) In each of his meetings with business executives, D/S Law stressed that while US-India economic ties would continue to grow, business leaders and politicians should pay more attention to social issues like child labor, which play an important role in the American debate on outsourcing.  The D/S urged his interlocutors to use their influence with the GOI to prevent these social issues from becoming problems in the bilateral economic and political relationship, because this could affect otherwise strong and growing commercial relationships.  Ministry of Labor -----------------  10.  (SBU) D/S Law met with Minister of Labor K. Chandra Shekar Rao, Labor Secretary K.M. Sahni, and Joint Secretary K. Chandramouli on February 24 to discuss the INDUS project and to reiterate US concerns over child labor in India. Briefing on his perspectives on the INDUS Projects, D/S Law noted that despite the slow start in negotiations, the project's results and commitment of local officials and NGOs had impressed him, but stressed that continued high-level GOI support was necessary to keep the programs on track.  11. (SBU) Asserting their strong commitment to preventing child labor, Ministry officials highlighted GOI efforts to create public awareness of the problem via the National Child Labor Project (NCLP) instituted by the government.  In a meeting attended by the Ambassador, Labor Minister Rao described child labor as a \"shame\" and reiterated GOI commitment to remove children from all hazardous occupations by the end of 2007.  The Minister stressed that India would approach this problem in a progressive manner as it had with bonded labor.  Joint Secretary Chandramouli indicated that the GOI intends to incorporate lessons from the INDUS program into its NCLP plans, and that INDUS would become a catalyst for self-sustaining Indian efforts to combat child labor.  He also observed that while the GOI had addressed the bonded labor problem via legislation, the problem of child labor was \"much more complex.\"  Frank Talk ----------  12.  (SBU) Labor Secretary Sahni, Joint Secretary Chandramouli, and D/S Law later held a frank discussion on child labor and the possibility that India might be downgraded in the upcoming Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which could impact World Bank loans and damage Indian's international image.  D/S Law offered DOL cooperation in working with the Labor Ministry to help develop a strategy for dealing with the trafficking of child labor.  Chandramouli commented that the definition of child labor was open to interpretation, and that there should be a distinction between forced/trafficked child labor and children who traditionally work with their families. Arguing that as long as a child was receiving an education, it was \"acceptable to work at home,\" he said that the GOI \"should not presume to know more than the parent\" about children's welfare.  13.  (SBU) Labor Secretary Sahni expressed the hope that the USG would view the child labor issue \"in the broader Indian social context\" (i.e. in view of widespread poverty), and not only as a possible trade policy issue that \"could be used against India.\"  He asked bluntly whether the USG was planning to raise TIP or child labor during trade and economic negotiations, as had happened in the WTO context, noting that he has had to be \"very stiff with colleagues in the past\" and wanted to be prepared for it.  He asked the US delegation to organize an \"experience sharing\" regional South Asian mini-summit within the next four months to discuss trafficking issues and to compare notes with other regional leaders in combating this problem.  He also expressed interest in further USG support to the NCLP in a \"plus\" capacity, specifically in funding micro-enterprise financial assistance credit for post-vocational training and help in setting up a business once child laborers complete their education under the INDUS Project, although made no direct request for USG assistance.  14.  (SBU) Briefing on the other DOL-funded projects in India, Joint Secretary Chandramouli called the Coal Mine Safety and Health Project (that ends in June) \"a tremendous success,\" adding that the GOI had hoped for a second phase of funding.  Joint Secretary for Employment and Training K.K. Mittal briefed on the progress made on the Decent Employment for Women Project (that also ends in June). Observing that the GOI wanted to expand the project's reach to Mumbai and Kolkata, he requested that DOL consider funding an expansion of the project to these cities.  15.  (SBU) After D/S Law expressed concern about bonded labor, Chandramouli maintained that it was a \"very limited\" phenomenon in India, with Sahni expressing surprise that it was still occurring at all and asking whether it was an issue the U.S. was \"worried or concerned about.\"  If the USG is concerned, he said, it was worth investigating, and asked for specific evidence.  D/S Law pledged to pass along any specific information he received.  16.  (SBU) The Ambassador also hosted a lunch for D/S Law that was attended by media, business, human rights and NGO leaders.  The Ambassador called attention to the TIP issue, which he pointed out could become an irritant in US-India relations and could require the USG to have to vote against India in international lending institutions if India were to fall to Tier III from its position on the Tier II Special Watch List.  This prompted a flurry of questions to the INL Office Director by business and media representatives about steps the GOI could take to forestall such a step.  The INL Office Director discussed the issue at some depth with several guests, pledging to send them more information on TIP issues in India.  Comment -------  17.  (SBU) D/S Law's visit was well received by the GOI and by media at the project sites, although his interest in bonded labor caused the Ministry of Labor to send a diplomatic note to the Embassy urging against a visit to the IJM site in Tamil Nadu, indicating continuing anxiety in parts of the state government and in New Delhi about calling attention to the bonded labor problem.  18.  (U) From the Mission's standpoint, the INDUS projects are outstanding examples of \"quiet successes\" that address important humanitarian problems while also advancing US- India relations.  19.  (U) D/S Law cleared this cable. MULFORD " }

Reasons 1.4(b,d)  1.  (C) Summary: Poloff delivered the UNCHR 61 demarche (Reftel) to MEA Deputy Secretary (UN Economic and Social) Gopal Baglay on March 17, and PolCouns double-tracked with Joint Secretary (UN) Hamid Ali Rao.  Baglay reiterated that the GOI neither supports country-specific resolutions nor opposes no-action motions in principle.  Noting that the GOI will back a resolution on the right to development again this year, he added that India disagrees with the proposal to universalize the membership of the CHR as recommended by the High Level Panel Report.  We will follow-up on these issues at more senior levels before the GOI's Geneva delegation departs Delhi approximately March 26.  End Summary.  Polite Disagreement on US Goals -------------------------------  2.  (C) Baglay reiterated GOI opposition to Item 9 country-specific resolutions, including proposed resolutions on Cuba and Belarus, alleging that they are counterproductive.  India's support for country-specific resolutions against apartheid was a unique case.  The GOI prefers Item 19 actions first.  Baglay listened to our position that Cuba represents a special case and promised to pass that message to his superiors.  3.  (C) Baglay similarly demurred from supporting the USG position against no-action motions, arguing that they do not limit debate, but only indicate that the resolution in question was unacceptable to the majority.  He admitted, however, that allowing such votes permits each country to take a clear stand on the issues.  Indian Goals for UNCHR 61 -------------------------  4.  (C) Asked about India's broader goals for the session, Baglay replied that the GOI did not plan to sponsor any resolutions, but would support several that it traditionally championed, including one on religious intolerance.  He added, however, that the GOI does not support enumerating examples of religious intolerance in this resolution, which distracts from the general principle.  5.  (C) Baglay noted that India would again support a thematic resolution on the right to development, traditionally sponsored by Malaysia and the Non-Aligned Movement.  Observing that over time this resolution has garnered more and more \"yes\" votes than abstentions from Western nations, he stated that India would like to find common ground with the US on this question.  Advised that the USG prefers to use the CHR to focus on fundamental civil and political rights, Baglay responded that India believes that economic and social rights can be discussed concurrently.  Nepal and Cuba --------------  6.  (C) Informed of the proposed US resolution on Cuba, Baglay promised to draw his superior's attention to the minimalist USG position.  On Nepal, the GOI had not decided on what course to take regarding the CHR, he said, but its response to a Swiss/European proposal would depend on the exact text.  7.  (C) Baglay welcomed the establishment of a democracy caucus, commenting that this would advance common goals of democratic nations.  Universalization of the membership of the CHR would be counterproductive, he stated, and India therefore opposed such a move. MULFORD " }

(C) Summary: Aside from limited and localized protests in Gujarat and scattered nationalist editorial comment, BJP efforts to build a domestic political issue out of the Modi visa revocation seem to be dissipating.  Few outside the Sangh Parivar have risen to the bait and responded to BJP calls to make this into an India/USA confrontation.  In private conversations with us, Indians have expressed overwhelming support for the US decision.  Initial shock at the denial is now turning to embarrassment.  Modi harmed himself by making vitriolic anti-American statements that are not resonating well.  With Modi's political fortunes fading, the BJP leadership may decide at the appropriate time to quietly cast him aside.  The big loser could be Party President LK Advani, who may have been too quick and too outspoken in his support of Modi.  We will address BJP internal politics septel.  End Summary.  Deep Divide in Gujarat ----------------------  2.  (C) Gujarat CM Narendra Modi has been teetering on the edge of political ignominy for at least a year.  In 2004, then Prime Minister Vajpayee, with the concurrence of many within his party, pushed for Modi's dismissal, but lacked sufficient determination to deliver the final blow.  Just prior to the flap over Modi's visa denial, 60 members of the BJP parliamentary party in Gujarat called on him to step down, and the numbers were growing daily (Mumbai Septel). The BJP dissidents argued that Modi's dictatorial and arbitrary style of functioning was hurting the BJP in Gujarat, which could lose the next election there if Modi were not dismissed.  3.  (U) Initial press reports had claimed that the visa incident bought Modi a reprieve from his opponents in Gujarat.  The \"Hindustan Times\" argued that, \"the dissidents' campaign against Modi is bound to be weakened, at least for some time.\"  One dissident noted that, \"Modi has proven to be lucky one again,\" as we \"will have to lie low.\"  Another maintained that, \"Now that Mr. Modi has been denied a US visa, he has again become a hero in Gujarat...this has come as a reprieve for him.\"  4.  (U) Even though the visa controversy is only days old, the dissidents are already coming back in strength. Dissident leader Vallabh  Kathiria indicated on March 19, that Modi's reprieve would prove short-lived, as the dissidents were in no mood to give up their agitation, noting that, \"People will not remember this forever.  There's no pro-Modi tempo in Delhi.  Our campaign is slow and steady. It may just take a little longer.\"  BJP Turns to America Baiting ----------------------------  5.  (U) Among the BJP's national leadership, no figure is more closely connected with Modi than Party President and former DPM LK Advani, who quickly came to Modi's defense.  At a Modi rally in Ahmedabad on March 20, Advani was the most outspoken, charging the USG with treating India as a \"pushover,\" and warning that \"this is not the end, but just the beginning of the battle for vindicating the self respect of the country.\"  Advani urged Indians to hold similar pro-Modi rallies across the country to \"awaken the nation, so that one ever dares to treat it as a pushover.\"  6.  (U) At the rally, Modi launched new anti-American attacks on the USG in Advani's presence, claiming that the USG revoked his visa at the behest of an anti-Hindu lobby in the US upset over Gujarat's passage of an anti-conversion law. Modi further claimed the USG denied him a visa to prevent Gujarat from working with Iran to bring a gas pipeline to India, as \"the US was afraid this would lead to Gujarat and in turn India, becoming an economic power.\"  Although not as outspoken as Advani, other BJP/NDA leaders also pledged support to Modi, including George Fernandes, BJP General Secretary Arun Jaitley, and Manohar Joshi.  SIPDIS  Deep Divides Between the BJP and Congress -----------------------------------------  7.  (U) The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was largely silent after presenting a formal protest on March 18 (Ref B).  The BJP was quick to thank the GOI for its \"support\" of Modi, with Advani expressing gratitude to PM Manmohan Singh for his \"bold stand\" against a \"powerful country like the US against hurting India's pride.\"  Congress Spokesman Anand Sharma quickly pointed out that the GOI protested the treatment of \"a duly elected chief minister who holds a constitutional post,\" but this \"does not dilute its opposition against the BJP leader.\"  Sharma also declined to \"condemn\" the US action or characterize it as an \"insult\" to India.  Separately, a senior party strategist close to Sonia Gandhi contacted PolCouns on March 20 to make sure we understood the UPA was just \"doing what it had to\" in demonstrating support for Modi, and to ensure this would not detract from Secretary Rice's successful visit.  The Congress agenda, our contact added, is to make this issue disappear from public view as quickly as possible.  8.  (C) The Modi incident comes at a time when the political divide between Congress and the BJP is deep and growing.  The two parties are fiercely contesting state governments in Goa, Bihar, and Jharkhand, and Parliament has almost ceased to function due to BJP obstructionism.  The BJP has refused to cooperate with Congress on economic measures even when they are endorsed by both parties, including the new Patent Law (Ref D), and a BJP threat not to execute the Value Added Tax system scheduled for implementation on April 1.  The Secular/Communal Divide ---------------------------  9.  (C) Modi and his followers within the BJP have been attempting to use nationalism to rally mass support around Modi, painting his visa revocation as, \"against all principles of democracy and human rights,\" \"an \"insult to the Constitution of India, which infringes on India's sovereignty,\" and an \"audacious step that has been taken specifically for deriding and insulting India.\"  Media reports indicate, however, that these arguments are having little impact outside Modi's core supporters within the BJP and Sangh Parivar.  10.  (C) A broad spectrum of \"secular\" groups, including political parties, NGOs and newspapers, have failed to take the bait, condemning Modi and applauding the USG move, despite the risk of being blamed \"unpatriotic.\"  The Rashtriya Janata Dal, for example, stated that, \"Mr. Modi is an Indian, so we have no choice but to tolerate his presence here, but other sovereign nations do not have to allow religious bigots to enter.\"  The leader of the Congress delegation in the Gujarat State Assembly suggested that his Chief Minister, \"refrain from going abroad,\" as he \"remained constantly surrounded by controversy.\"  11.  (C) The GOI has also come under criticism for its rush to support visa issuance to Modi.  Press reports indicate that \"at least 35\" groups representing overseas Indians appealed to the PM \"to look at this not through a nationalistic lens or as a violation of protocol, but to consider the larger issues involved.\"  Most editorials pointed out that sovereign nations have the right to deny visas to human rights abusers, and that India should have resolved this issue, the Indian legal system should have prosecuted Modi, the BJP leadership should have dismissed him, and the UPA failed to push for quick prosecution of riot related cases after coming to power in New Delhi.  12.  (C) BJP and Sangh Parivar calls for Indians to rally around Modi have not cowed his opponents, who continue to demand his dismissal.  The generally anti-America \"Hindu\" characterized the visa episode as \"an additional setback\" for Modi, predicting that he is \"in for a long hot summer.\" While the \"Times of India\" urged the BJP to \"realize that it can't shield its poster boy of hate under the pretext of electoral mandate,\" and leading Indian columnist Pankaj Vohra urged the party to \"seize the opportunity and replace Modi before he causes any further embarrassment.\"  13.  (U) Private comments by a wide range of Indians to Embassy officers show there has been strong support by most Indians for the USG's decision.  One former director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, for example, told DCM that \"Nine five percent of India stands with you.\"  Comment -------  14.  (C) Modi's political problems continue to grow, and his options narrow.  The BJP initially hoped to use Modi's visa problems to overcome deep internal divisions and rally public support.  Any gains are likely to be short-lived, as Modi's continued presence as a BJP leader exacerbates party divisions.  Rather than silencing his critics, the visa case is providing them with ammunition, sullying the BJP's reputation and keeping it on the defensive at a time when it hoped to make political gains against Congress.  Within Gujarat, emotions are currently running high, and Modi has won a reprieve, but it is likely to be short-lived.  As attention shifts from the visa issue, his opponents will re-emerge.  15.  (C) The UPA government having \"gone through the motions\" by protesting the USG decision, is unlikely to ratchet up the pressure further.  Congress has long viewed Modi as a vulnerable target and will, at the appropriate time, use the visa incident as further ammunition against him.  Both Congress and the BJP particularly value the US-India relationship and Modi's America bashing has made many nervous.  Both parties will likely move to ensure that the negative impact on the relationship from this incident is minimal.  With Modi's position deteriorating, the BJP leadership could decide to quietly push him aside at the appropriate time.  This could become a further liability for Advani, who the senior party leader most visibly supporting Modi. MULFORD " }

KUALA LUMPUR 919      B. NEW DELHI 8015  Classified By: PolCouns Geoff Pyatt.  Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) In the strongest language we have heard so far from the GOI on the East Asia Summit (EAS), MEA Joint Secretary (Southeast Asia) Mitra Vashishta asserted that if India is left out, New Delhi will resort to \"other means.\"  Meeting with PolCouns and Poloff on March 17, she insisted on a status for India equal to that of the Plus Three partners (Japan, Korea, China), calling for an ASEAN plus Four arrangement, with an agenda distinct from that of ASEAN plus One or Three.  Vashishta argued that the \"world recognizes India,\" therefore the country must be included, and elaborated \"other means\" for further cultivation of India's CMLV (Cambodia, Burma, Laos, Vietnam) \"clients\" to support the GOI bid.  2.  (C) Possibly referring to one of the three options from the March ASEAN senior officials' meeting (Ref A), ASEAN plus Three plus India, Australia, and New Zealand, Vashishta asserted that India cannot be \"clubbed\" with Australia. Vashishta also rebuffed the only ASEAN plus Three possibility for the EAS, stating that \"they already have an ASEAN plus Three.\"  3.  (U) Speaking at a March 17 CSIS-sponsored conference on Southeast and East Asia, former Indian Ambassador to Laos SD Muni remarked that New Delhi considers CMLV the \"new ASEAN, strategically and economically distinct from the rest.\" Echoing Vashishta's comments after the November 2004 ASEAN plus One summit (Ref B) about India's \"special relationship\" with those four countries, Muni described this as an area with greater space for Indian involvement in the areas of security, energy, and economic and technological assistance.  Comment -------  4.  (C) The East Asia Summit presents something of a test case for India's aspirations in Asia.  The GOI view on the EAS has evolved from dismissal to alarm at the possibility of being excluded from a new Asia club.  Realizing that the EAS is likely to happen, and that it is not necessarily a given that it will include India, the GOI may turn up its lobbying efforts, a tactic the Singapore High Commission had previously criticized New Delhi for not pursuing (Ref B).

(C) Summary: Joint Secretary (SE Asia I) Mitra Vashishta defended India's policies in Burma in a March 17 meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, suggesting that progress on democratic reforms was dependent on engagement with the Burmese body politic, and warning that the USG focus on Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) could backfire.  Foreign Minister Natwar Singh leaves for a four-day visit to Burma on March 24, but MEA contacts tell us not to expect significant new developments, despite press reports speculating about the reopening of the \"Stilwell Road.\"  Vashishta did not believe Bangladesh would cooperate on a potential gas pipeline from Burma to India, suggesting that the project will remain hypothetical.  End Summary.  GOI and USG Policies --------------------  2.  (C) In a wide-ranging discussion with PolCouns and Poloff about GOI and USG policies toward Burma, outgoing Joint Secretary Vashishta defended Indian engagement with and plans  SIPDIS for Burma.  Pressed on the apparent contradiction between India's new doctrine of active support for democracy in the region (Ref C) and its policy toward Rangoon, the Joint Secretary averred that more time was needed for GOI policies  SIPDIS to bear fruit.  Drawing a parallel to the current Indian pressure on Nepal, she suggested that the GOI was waiting for a time when its influence across Burmese society would increase to the point where the regime would listen to Indian demands for democracy.  3.  (C) Responding to the USG push for a resolution on Burma in the Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) (Ref A), Vashishta doubted the effectiveness of any such action.  There was not enough international involvement in Burma for outside pressure to have an effect, she argued, adding that the US and European policy of isolation will not work because China's support allows Burma to get away with ignoring international pressure.  4.  (C) The Joint Secretary warned that the US and European preoccupation with imprisoned leader ASSK could be counterproductive.  While ASSK's status was important, it was not the only issue.  Pondering the \"cost of getting her out,\" she cautioned that international pressure focused only on freedom for ASSK might let the junta \"get away with more\" in return for freeing the detained democracy activist. Vashishta repeated the GOI's view that ASSK is less relevant to democracy promotion than increased engagement with the society (Ref B).  No Blank Check --------------  5.  (C) Vashishta acknowledged that India's current policy could be construed as giving a blank check to the junta, but replied that the GOI was following the best policy for dealing with Than Shwe.  She acknowledged that the GOI needed to do a much better job of describing publicly its support for democratic forces in Burma, in order to refute perceptions of a morally vacant approach.  The regime would not respond to isolation or sanctions, she argued, because that would cause it to lose face.  While India was trying to engage Burma to gain influence with the junta, US policy had nothing positive to offer the regime.  She added that India's previous USG-approved disdain for the regime in Rangoon had let China gain influence in Burma at India's expense.  Foreign Minister to Visit Rangoon ---------------------------------  6.  (C) Foreign Minister Singh will visit Rangoon March 24-27, another stop on his tour of India's neighbors in his first year in office.  MEA Undersecretary (South-East Asia) Pooja Kapoor told Poloff that the FM is expected to meet with Than as well as the Burmese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, where he will raise India's concern for democracy, political reforms, and treatment of the political opposition.  Although noted strategic commentator C Raja Mohan has speculated that the GOI is discussing reopening the \"Stilwell Road\" linking India, China and Burma, Kapoor stated that no new announcements would come out of the meetings.  7.  (C) While democracy may be on the agenda, the GOI is more concerned with insurgent groups operating across the border between Burma and Manipur state in India, MG (ret) Ashok Mehta, a noted Burma expert, told Poloff.  Mehta suggested that Natwar's priorities will be encouraging Burmese military action against insurgents, and reiterating GOI proposals made during Than's October 2004 New Delhi visit for defense cooperation and equipment sales.  Although India has not conducted joint military operations with Burma, Mehta asserted that two Indian Army brigades are currently operating against insurgents in Manipur on the Burmese border, a line we have also heard from other security contacts.  Gas Pipeline Unlikely ---------------------  8.  (C) Vashishta predicted that the proposal for a gas pipeline from Burma to India via Bangladesh would collapse because of obstacles placed by Dhaka, lamenting the \"obstructionist\" attitude and internal disputes between Bangladeshi leaders.  There was no will among the politicians in Bangladesh to make it work, she complained, and Burma and India had no influence over them.  Comment -------  9.  (C) The Foreign Minister's visit to Rangoon is a routine stop on his calendar, but is incongruous coming during the meeting of the UNCHR and following Foreign Secretary Saran's February 14 speech in which he stated that India would always stand with democratic elements in neighboring countries (Ref C).  The GOI shows no signs of fading in its belief that further engagement across the society, rather than isolation, is the best way to induce democratic reform in Burma. Conveniently, GOI engagement with the junta also furthers India's own strategic interests in cracking down on insurgents in Manipur, exploring new options for energy supplies, and countering the rise of Chinese influence in India's periphery.

(C) On 21 March, Poloff delivered Reftel demarche to Indian MEA Deputy Secretary (UN Economic and Social) Gopal Baglay and Bhutanese Embassy First Secretary Karma Rinchhen, reiterating our interest in this year's Cuba resolution.  2.  (C) Baglay responded that the GOI has no official response to the proposed Cuba resolution, but reiterated India's well-known opposition to country-specific resolutions.  He promised to convey the USG position to his superiors.  Post will follow up on this issue at more senior levels.  3.  (C) After Poloff expressed appreciation for Bhutan's abstention last year, which enabled passage of the Cuba resolution, Rinchhen replied that he had no response from his government on its plans for voting this year, but pledged to forward our points to Thimphu.  4.  (C) Comment: We will need to consider carefully the timing for a more senior approach to New Delhi on the Cuba resolution, bearing in mind the likely mid-April visit to Washington by Foreign Minister Singh.  In this context, we would appreciate further Department guidance on the likely timing of the Cuba vote.  On Bhutan, we will wait to hear from Thimphu on whether the RGOB will stick with its abstention (which we were told the Cubans bitterly attacked).  As in 2004, a Washington-level approach to the Bhutanese Foreign Ministry may be necessary to keep the RGOB on our side. MULFORD " }

(C) PolCouns and Poloff on March 22 delivered Ref A talking points and supporting non-paper to newly ensconced MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Dilip Sinha.  Sinha welcomed the news of adding Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) to the UNSC 1267 Committee list of organizations affiliated with al-Qaida and the Taliban as \"an important step\" and agreed to hold the information in confidence until after Washington and Ottawa formally submit LeT to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee on March 28.  PolCouns reminded Sinha that adding LeT to the UN counterterrorism list was subsequent to a discussion between then S/CT Coordinator Ambassador Cofer Black and MEA Additional Secretary Meera Shankar during the August-September 2004 US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group (Ref B) and expressed the hope that this step would help to create a climate for further progress on the Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue.  2.  (C) On the related issue of terrorist infiltration from Pakistani Kashmir into J&K, Sinha observed that the heavy snowfall this year would delay the opening of the passes used for infiltration, and that the GOI would have to wait until May-June to assess if the stated drop in infiltration was due to weather or to changed policies in Islamabad.  Sinha's predecessor, Arun K. Singh, noted that LeT had well documented connections to the Pakistan Army, and expressed the hope that our step would encourage Islamabad to sever these ties.  3.  (C) Separately, Poloff and Canadian PolCouns delivered the same Ref A talking points and non-paper -- as well as a nearly identical Canadian version of the non-paper -- to MEA Director (Americas) Renu Pall on March 22.  Pall was as positive as Sinha in receiving the prenotification, and agreed on the importance of keeping the information tightly held.  She recalled the Black-Shankar conversation, appreciated Washington and Ottawa taking this action against LeT, and indicated that she would forward the prenotification to MEA's senior leadership.  4.

(SBU) Summary: Signalling a break from India's traditional view of the world, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared in a February 25 speech that democracy and open economies are now the core of India's foreign policy values, replacing non-alignment, solidarity with developing countries, and the country's distinct non-Western self-definition.  Although largely ignored by the Indian media, the PM's address is a topic of discussion among New Delhi's strategic elite, several of whom have described to us the PM's personal vision of India's role in an international concert of democracies.  Despite this welcome change in direction, the bureaucracy and political class are likely to adapt slowly.  End Summary.  2.  (U) Although virtually ignored by the press, the PM's speech at the \"India Today\" conclave in New Delhi outlined a new Indian foreign policy that continues to resonate.  The speech, seen as the PM's comprehensive vision for India in a post-Cold War world, situates Indian interests more strongly than ever with the West, and complements Foreign Secretary Saran's February 14 address declaring that India would support democratic forces in its neighborhood (Reftel).  Democracy as the Norm ---------------------  3.  (U) Linking Indian foreign policy to open economic policies, the PM implicitly repudiated India's traditional third world solidarity with authoritarian governments, proclaiming that \"liberal democracy is the natural order of political organization in today's world.\"  \"All alternate systems,\" he continued, \"authoritarian and majoritarian in varying degrees, are an aberration.\"  4.  (U) The PM emphasized that India's policies toward the world should be guided by the core values of liberal democracy and secularism, while upholding India's support for developing countries.  In fact, he called on India and other \"developed democracies\" to support the emerging democracies of \"societies in transition,\" hailing India's assistance to Afghanistan as an example.  5.  (U) Singh declared that an open society and open economy, not \"authoritarian responses,\" are the best way for a government to deliver improvements to its citizens. Observing that \"democratic methods yield the most enduring solutions to the most intractable problems,\" Singh challenged India to \"show that democracy can deliver development and empower the marginalized.\"  Open Economies and Good Relations ---------------------------------  6.  (U) Reinterpreting the Nehruvian doctrine that \"ultimately, foreign policy is the outcome of economic policy,\" Singh dwelt at length on the manner in which increasingly open economic ties between India and other nations have altered bilateral relationships.  He underlined that \"shared values and growing economic links have enabled a closer strategic engagement\" with the US.  7.  (U) Singh also noted that India's growing strategic interactions with Europe, Russia, and the rest of Asia were preceded and shaped by economic ties, and that trade, investment, and energy transactions are defining India's relations around the globe.  Emphasizing the importance of growing economic links, he called for a sense of \"partnership\" in South Asia to replace the narrow political calculations that had governed previous bilateral interactions with neighbors.  8.  (U) The PM reminded his listeners that India still sees itself as a champion of the developing world -- although committed to open economic policies to assist development. While urging India to take advantage of global markets and sources of capital, he promised to seek \"the reform and democratization of multilateral institutions,\" and called for a strengthening of \"South-South cooperation.\"  9.  (U) Singh concluded that an Indian foreign policy guided by commitment to open societies and open economies was not only true to India's principles, but would accelerate India's efforts to \"recover its due status in the world.\"  The development of economic ties and \"mutual interdependence\" would secure \"peace, freedom and development in our neighborhood.\" Positive Reception by Pundits -----------------------------  10.  (U) Leading Indian strategic thinkers have applauded the PM's exposition.  In a March 5 article, commentator K Subrahmanyan praised the speech as \"the first attempt\" to spell out \"India's role in the new international system\" following the Cold War.  Noting that the PM had \"declared India as part of the first world of nations which are democracies and market economies,\" he argued that, by identifying the opportunities inherent in globalization, Singh was advancing Nehru's vision of a world of \"free cooperation of free people.\"  11.  (U) In two recent columns, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professor and noted foreign policy expert C Raja Mohan highlighted Singh's rejection of India's decades-old adversarial relationship with the Western world, and declaration of confidence that it can hold its own in a global market.  Observing that the PM's call for regional economic integration was a radical departure from India's traditionally suspicious interactions with its neighbors, he posited that the time was ripe to overcome bureaucratic conservatism and make dramatic progress in relations with Pakistan, China, the US and Japan.  12.  (SBU) The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has gone out of its way to highlight the India Today address to foreign missions in New Delhi, and the speech was a major focus of PMO media adviser Sanjay Baru at the recent Aspen Strategy Group meeting.  One columnist told us that the PM had referred to the speech as a personal manifesto, reflecting the desire to firmly situate India as part of the international community of democracies.  Comment -------  13.  (SBU) Although the PM has now located India squarely in the camp of democratic, free-market societies, the GOI must make deep changes in its foreign, domestic and economic policies to translate his ideas into practice.  India's entrenched habits retain a strong hold over its foreign policy, including periodic calls for a revitalization of the Non-Aligned Movement, repeated at the March 19-20 meeting of the G-20.  At the very least, the PM's speech serves as a useful reference point to encourage GOI interlocutors to support democratic and liberal values, including at the present session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, and in India's policy toward Burma.

(C) Summary: Recently ensconced MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Dilip Sinha was largely upbeat on Indo-Pak relations during a March 22 introductory meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, especially with regard to the Indo-Pak cricket series and the anticipated April 16-17 visit of Pakistan President Musharraf to New Delhi.  Sinha offered an unusually positive view of Musharraf as a leader who could help advance the peace process as long as he does not \"overplay his hand\" as at the Agra Summit in July 2001. Sinha and his predecessor, Arun K. Singh, also reported on recent irritants in the Indo-Pak relationship, alleging that Indian diplomats in Islamabad were under resumed harassment by Pakistani intelligence after a long hiatus. Encouragingly, he did not seek to project these irritants on to the broader political relationship.  End Summary.  1.  (C) In a March 22 introductory meeting with PolCouns and Poloff, MEA Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) Dilip Sinha offered the following nuggets on Indo-Pak relations:  -- On the Indo-Pak cricket series, Sinha agreed that the matches were going well and that the Indian media coverage continued to be largely positive.  Sinha did not raise recent Indian news reports that some Pakistani visitors had overstayed their visas.  He agreed with our assessment that popular enthusiasm on both sides was making it harder to return to a path of hostility.  -- With regard to the anticipated April 16-17 visit to New Delhi of Pakistan President Musharraf, Sinha confirmed that there would be \"a meal\" and \"a working program,\" but that details were not yet nailed down for the visit, which would be \"less than 24 hours long.\"  -- When asked by PolCouns when the Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue would resume, Sinha responded that, although the talks are to run from April through July, specific dates had not yet been set.  He added that the pending Musharraf visit was diverting MEA resources away from larger Indo-Pak issues, implying there will be little work on the Composite Dialogue until after April 17.  2.  (C) In response to PolCouns' question of how the Indian High Commission in Islamabad views Musharraf (noting the presence in MEA of High Commissioner Shiv Shankar Menon), Sinha observed that Musharraf wanted to play a significant role in the Indo-Pak peace process.  \"If he can be reasonable, it will contribute to the process,\" but Musharraf should not \"push beyond what is rational.\"  In this context, Arun Singh commented that Musharraf had \"overplayed his hand at Agra.\"  Overall, Sinha allowed that Musharraf was keeping the Composite Dialogue moving despite \"dissident voices\" in Islamabad, especially on the Kashmir issue.  3.  (C) Turning to recent irritants, Sinha reported without specifics that Islamabad was equivocating on the proposed Lahore-Amritsar-Nankana Sahib bus service, and noted that while Indian fishermen who strayed into Pakistani territorial waters are being released from Pakistani jails, their boats continue to be held, consistent with a recent announcement from Islamabad to that effect.  On issues out of the public eye, Sinha complained that after a long hiatus, Indian diplomats in Islamabad were again being harassed by Pakistani intelligence operatives, although he presented no specifics. Encouragingly, he did not suggest that any of these setbacks would retard the broader Indo-Pak dialogue. MULFORD " }

(C) Following up on our recent demarche on Cuba (Refs A and B), PolCouns and Poloff met with MEA Joint Secretary (UN Political) Hamid Ali Rao and incoming Joint Secretary (UN Economic and Social) Manjeev Puri on March 24 to review our UNCHR priorities.  Recalling the recent statements by the PM and Foreign Secretary (Ref E) regarding India's commitment to liberal democracy in its foreign policy, PolCouns urged the GOI to use the ongoing UNCHR session to side with the USG in supporting democratic objectives.  Emphasizing India's \"moderating\" role among Non-aligned Movement and developing states, Rao responded that India would like to reach consensus with the US especially on a resolution on the right to development, but reiterated continuing GOI opposition to country-specific resolutions, including Cuba.  (Note: As discussed Ref D, a Washington approach may help emphasize our Cuba position.  End Note.)  Rao reiterated that India's major contribution in the UNCHR context is its moderating influence on others.  2.  (C) PolCouns noted that the Community of Democracies (CD) represents another opportunity for US-India cooperation that fits the newly-energized GOI mission of promoting democracy. Rao agreed that both the CD and the UNCHR are venues that India uses to advance democracy, but stated that India's role, though useful, is \"different from that of other democracies,\" highlighting India's historically strong ties with the developing world.  3.  (C) Rao also outlined New Delhi's concern that UNCHR mandates have become \"too broad, overlapping, and impossible to fulfill.\"  He stated that the GOI would like to reform the mandate of the UNCHR to eliminate these weaknesses, observing that such a reform would improve the work of the Commission. We will continue to engage the GOI on UNCHR reform to identify areas of agreement (Ref C).  New Joint Secretary for UN Economic and Social: Bio Note --------------------------------------------- -----------  4.  (SBU) We were joined in the meeting by Manjeev Puri, who assumed the position of Joint Secretary (UN Economic and Social) on March 23.  The brother of Indian Ambassador to Geneva Hardip Puri, former Joint Secretary (US and Canada), Puri was last posted in Muscat.  His previous MEA assignments included four years as Deputy Chief of Protocol, in which role he interacted intensively with White House personnel on advance work for President Clinton's India visit.  Puri spoke warmly of his past interaction with Embassy officers, and appeared eager to revive his official contacts with the US. MULFORD " }

Blake, for Reasons 1.4 (B, D)  1.  (C) During a March 23 meeting with DCM and PolCouns and pursuant to discussions at the August-September 2004 US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group (reftel), MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) S Jaishankar delivered the following  SIPDIS non-paper  requesting USG assistance with the GOI investigation into the December 1999 IC-814 hijacking.  While agreeing to forward the paper, DCM noted that we had earlier inquired at senior levels on this issue in Washington, and urged modest GOI expectations for any new US data.  Begin Text:  GOI requests urgent US response on the following pending requests for assistance in connection with the IC-814 hijacking case:  -- To liaise with the concerned American authorities relating to the reported seizure of documents relating to the hijacking of IC-814 by US forces operating in Afghanistan.  -- To collect evidence relating to the landing of the flight at Kandahar and the roles played by Afghan Taliban authorities.  -- To get the responses from Mr. Mansoor Akhtar, ex-Civil Aviation Minister in the Taliban Government of Afghanistan, and Mr. Akhtar Usmani, the Taliban corps commander in Kandahar (reportedly in the custody of the American authorities) during the hijacking crisis.  --  Examine the possibilities of getting statements from some important Taliban functionaries, now reportedly under the custody of American authorities.  -- Any additional information available regarding the whereabouts/location/hideouts of the seven Pakistani nationals involved in the hijacking of IC-814.  -- Any information available in the United States on the conduct of these aforesaid seven accused terrorists prior to, during, and after the hijacking of IC-814.  -- Any photographs that may be available in the United States of accused Abdul Rauf, a key conspirator.  -- Any additional evidence available in the United States relating to the landing of the hijacked aircraft at Lahore Airport, its subsequent refueling, take-off, etc.  End text.  Comment -------  2.  (C) We shared this demarche with Legatt/New Delhi, who will forward it through FBI channels to Washington.  Legatt noted that the FBI has shared all its information relevant to the hijacking of IC-814 with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's lead federal law enforcement agency, but has not acquiesced on requests it deems \"fishing expeditions.\"  In January-February 2005, CBI handed to visiting FBI Special Agents hundreds of documents for the US prosecution of IC-814 principals that had not been previously shared, adding that they were only sharing \"what we think you need to know.\"  This formulation might raise US prosecutorial concerns that some exculpatory information may have been withheld.  3.  (C) Legatt has also made the point to the GOI that the US prosecution of IC-814 principals could be bolstered with information tying IC-814 to other terrorist acts, such as the October 1994 kidnapping of US national Bela Nuss and the January 23, 2002 kidnapping and subsequent murder of \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Daniel Pearl.  Legatt reported that this line of approach had not resonated with the CBI.  4.  (C) Post, drawing heavily from Legatt's files, will draft a cable septel laying out the history and evolution of US-India cooperation on the IC-814 hijacking. MULFORD " }

Nonetheless, hardline separatists, Hindu nationalist and Kashmiri Pandit groups, and assorted intellectuals continue to dismiss the bus as a diversion from the \"core Kashmir issue\" or flawed.  Authorities express confidence that security measures will be sufficient to ensure the safety of the bus, while Kashmiris expect Pakistan to order jihadi groups to leave it alone.  It will be difficult for either government to reverse this step, reflecting the degree to which popular sentiment is shaping the Indo-Pak peace process.  End Summary.  2.  (U) As April 7 approaches, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus is increasingly seizing Indian imaginations in J&K and beyond.  The national media are reporting daily, across the country, and in considerable detail about logistical and infrastructural improvements, the mechanics of the operation, and human interest stories, usually of elderly Kashmiris longing to see family members last seen many, many years ago.  Senior GOI attention is focused on the event, with the PM scheduled to travel to Srinagar to see it off, perhaps joined by Sonia Gandhi, who has reportedly rearranged her schedule for this occasion.  3.  (C) Although Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has been careful about giving credit to New Delhi and Islamabad for their leadership in making it happen, he is treating the launch as the most important achievement in his tenure as Chief Minister.  As the politician in India most associated in the public eye with the bus proposal, he has used it to highlight its potential for breaking down barriers between India and Pakistan, calling the service a \"bridge of friendship\" and a major step in creating the atmosphere to deal with the Kashmir issue, while stressing that it is also not a solution.  In some speeches he has gone further, saying the \"softening of the LOC will transform South Asia.\"  This echoes the PM's oft-repeated notion of \"reducing the relevance of the LOC\" in Indo-Pak relations.  Modalities ----------  4.  (U) The Indian media have carried extensive reports of military units from both countries working together to widen roads, clear mines, and repair bridges that have had no civilian traffic since Partition.  Towns along the road, known colloquially in J&K as the \"Rawalpindi Road,\" are being given facelifts, and prefab facilities, including a tourist welcome and document checking station, a cafeteria and restrooms, are being erected at Adoosa, a hamlet located just before Kashmiri travellers cross the LOC.  The infrastructure is scheduled to be completed by March 31.  5.  (U) Information varies regarding the number of buses that will travel, with some reports suggesting that two will carry 19 passengers and four Intelligence Bureau (IB) officers each for a total of 30 persons, while other sources indicate that the buses will carry 30 passengers apiece, and that VVIPs and media may also accompany in separate buses.  J&K has purchased four new vehicles, each with video/TV systems and refrigerators to ensure that the three hour, 130km trip on the Indian side, or total 4-4.5 hour 170km total journey, will be in comfort.  A roundtrip ticket will cost Rs 1500 (USD 35). Travellers ----------  6.  (C) Journalists in Srinagar tell us that 150 travel permit forms were issued on March 4 and 500 on March 21, on a first come, first served basis.  Amidst widespread disappointment that the first tranche was so small, the number was increased, and long queues formed to meet demand, leading to protests, police lathi charges, and a nascent black market.  To facilitate access to residents outside Srinagar, forms were also issued in Kupwara, Jammu, Pulwama, and Baramulla, but residents there have complained the number were far too few.  Their format differs from visa applications, in that they do not ask for passport details, but require detailed information on places and persons to be visited.  Permits will reportedly be valid for one month, and visitors from Pakistan will be able to travel throughout J&K, but must register with the police as soon as they reach their destination.  They can only stay in locations declared in advance.  7.  (C) Technically, all Indians are eligible to travel, but non-Kashmiris are not likely to be on the first buses, given the focus on re-uniting divided families.  On March 23, the United Jehad Council reportedly issued a warning that only Kashmiris, and not Indians, should travel.  Of the 62 completed applications received by March 13 by the Indian authorities, 50 were from Srinagar residents, with the rest from Rajouri and Poonch districts.  On March 22, J&K and AJK authorities exchanged the first lists of some 40 Indian and 46 Pakistani names for verification by as many as five central and state security and intelligence agencies.  8.  (U) Information on the mechanics of the crossing at the LOC is sketchy, contradictory, and in flux, journalists who have visited the site recently tell us.  The bus will procede to the village of Adoosa, the last settlement about .5km from before the LOC where passengers will disembark and procede on foot across a series of three bridges (Lal Pool, Weak Bridge, and Wood Bridge, the last of which has been a relic of Indo-Pak animosity for decades) that are being repaired. Thereupon, they will board a bus on the Pakistani side and continue their journey.  Security Not a Major Worry --------------------------  9.  (C) In view of press and other reports that jihadis may attack the buses, Indian security forces have been taking special precautions.  The bus will travel in something of a convoy, with lead and follow cars, after Road Opening Parties have traversed the road to clear it of IEDs.  There have also been reports that residents along the road have formed vigilance committees to reduce the likeihood of ambushes, including by using the \"zimmewari system,\" by which civilians look out for suspicious items that could be explosives.  J&K police officials say that should credible reports surface of IED threats, a jammer car may travel in the convoy.  10.  (C) In a March 22 conversation with PolCouns, outgoing MEA J/S (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) Arun K Singh downplayed concerns about security, commenting that the security forces have taken the necessary steps.  The Indian media have also carried reports quoting Pakistani officials who express \"100 percent confidence that nothing will happen.\"  Kashmiri separatist Javed Mir agreed, telling D/Polcouns March 22 that as long as Pakistan had bought into the bus and supported it politically, it would ensure that it would not be attacked.  The overriding sentiment in J&K, journalists in Srinagar tell us, is that the Islamabad will instruct terrorist groups to behave, especially with President Musharraf expected in New Delhi in connection with the Delhi One Day International cricket match on April 17.  Increase the Frequency! ----------------------  11.  (C) Kashmniri politicians and civic groups have begun to notice that few people will actually travel on the bus because of its low capacity and fortnightly service, and are now focusing on increasing its frequency.  Mufti has already spoken of instituting weekly, and, later, daily service.  He has also begun to urge that the route be opened to cars and trade.  His daughter, PDP President Mehbooba Mufti, has been stressing trade opportunities for Kashmiri products in Pakistan, a traditional market for Kashmiri produce (particularly apples and saffron) as well as handicrafts until Partition.  12.  (C) Not to be outdone, National Conference (NC) President Omar Abdullah has joined the bandwagon to advocate daily service, commenting that \"we must not waste the goodwill that this bus has created.\"  Quoting his grandfather, the legendary Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah who had advocated opening the road before his death in 1982, Omar used the bus issue on March 21 to differ publicly for the first time with his father, former NC leader and Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah (who has not been effusive about the development), leading to speculation in the media about \"whether Farooq has become irrelevant.\"  The MEA's AK Singh confirmed that the GOI was open to increasing frequency, presumably after both sides gauged how the system was working, and subject to the overall tenor of the Indo-Pak relationship.  Other Roads -----------  13.  (C) Experts in ethnic and linguistic patterns in Indian and Pakistani Kashmir have reminded us that the vast majority of divided families live in regions close to the LOC, with considerable concentrations also residing in the Jammu region (especially Doda District) and elsewhere.  Demographer and human rights activist Balraj Puri estimated that 98 percent of extended Muslim families in the Jammu region are divided, as opposed to only two percent in the Valley.  Hurriyat Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq confirmed to D/Polcouns on March 23 that the distribution was much heavier closer to the LOC, but that the breakdown was probably closer to 80/20;  almost all his friends and acquaintences in Srinagar had relations of one kind or another across the LOC.  14.  (C) Puri and others argue that the concentration of divided families near the LOC made the current arrangement for the bus unusually cumbersome and inconvenient, as they have to travel all the way to Srinagar to apply, and then to travel, which can amount to 900km for what would otherwise be a hop, skip and jump as the crow flies.  This also applies to tens of thousands of Hindu families in Jammu, who fled from what is now POK or Pakistan after Partition.  The first reports are now surfacing of elderly Hindus residing in the Jammu region who originate from what is now Pakistani Kashmir and wish to visit their ancestral areas, and who complain of being ignored in favor of Muslims.  On these grounds, Puri reported that pressure is building in the Jammu region to open the Jammu-Sialkot Road, which would enormously simplify contact between families there, he stated.  We understand that this road is in good condition and could be opened in a matter of days, if the governments decide to do so.  15.  (C) A recent story in \"The Week\" reported that at least 60,000 residents in the Uri and Baramulla districts have relatives across the LOC, as cross-LOC marriages have been common and there are myriad extended families.  Residents in these areas come from similar socio-cultural milieux and speak Pahari and Gojari dialects.  Corresponding patterns apply to ethnic and linguistic groups that straddle the LOC in Kargil and the Northern Areas, which increases calls for opening a Kargil-Skardu route, Puri stated.  Jammu-based Kashmir correspondent for the \"Statesman\" Kavita Suri told us after a recent visit to the LOC that among Kashmiris in many of these isolated rural areas knowledge about procedures to obtain permits is still very rudimentary, but she expected it to grow.  Moderate Separatists OK with it -------------------------------  16. (C) In meetings this week with D/Polcouns in Delhi, all major moderate All-Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leaders expressed support for the bus, although they emphasized that it was not the answer to the Kashmir issue.  Moulvi Abbas Ansari termed it a \"good step\" and \"a just beginning on the long road to peace.\"  The Mirwaiz, Prof AG Bhat, and Bilal Lone were unanimous that it was a good development, and said that their views were shared across the state, even by people with no extended family across the LOC.  Javed Mir from the JK Liberation Forum also welcomed it, and did not disagree with a colleague of his who wondered out loud whether visits by Pakistanis from across the LOC might cause them to think twice about \"which country offers more.\"  JKLF leader Yasin Malik considered the family unification dimension positive, but expressed bitterness that New Delhi and Islamabad had chosed to freeze Kashmiris out of their dialogue.  17.  (C) The moderate Hurriyat leaders have confirmed to us their interest in travelling on the bus, but said they would wait until the second or third trip in May or later, partly to allow divided families which have no other opportunity to travel to go first, but also to see how the process unfolds, as well as to allow arrangements for such trips to be made. \"We are not interested in going to Pakistan for tourism,\" the Mirwaiz stated.  Opponents Continue to Whine ---------------------------  18.  (C) Not all reaction has been positive, with criticism continuing to come from assorted hardline separatists, Hindu nationalists, Kashmiri Pandit groups, and intellectuals. Hardline, pro-Pakistan separatist SAS Geelani has called the bus a \"non-issue,\" \"part of the Indian agenda,\" and \"merely a toy to pacify Indian slaves.\"  In fact, Geelani has become so angry with Pakistan that he has begun to criticize President Musharraf, accusing him of \"sprinkling salt on our wounds\" and \"giving a burial to our prolonged struggle for self-determination.\"  Geelani boycotted the high profile Pakistan National Day Reception in New Delhi on March 23 for the first time since 1989 in protest.  19.  (C) The \"Panun Kashmir\" Pandit group has commented that the road will do nothing to improve their continued plight. The Hindu nationalist RSS has termed the bus \"insane\" and \"fraught with serious consequences for the country's security,\" highlighting New Delhi's compromises over documentation and the potential for terrorist infiltration. Mufti has dismissed these concerns, observing tartly that terrorists have not traditionally crossed over to J&K legally.  20.  (U) Even liberal commentators on Kashmir and well-wishers of Indo-Pak amity like the Mumbai-based writer AG Noorani have joined the criticism, although their focus is more on flaws in the procedure than opposing the bus itself. Calling the bus \"sheer symbolism,\" Noorani has highlighted the logistical difficulties for the rural, poor Kashmiris who live in border areas or in the Jammu region when they apply for permits and seats on the bus.  Noorani has also attempted to diminish the significance of including Gilgit and Baltistan to the list of areas Kashmiris can visit, on the grounds that they will have to travel via Abbottabad in the NWFP.  He also complains that visitors to Mirpur will have to visit via the International Border, because the old Muzaffarabad-Mirpur road no longer exists.  Comment -------  21.  (C) This is no ordinary road, and no ordinary bus; it is one of the biggest Kashmir stories in many, many years. Although it is important to filter out the media hype, the enthusiasm in J&K and elsewhere in India for this development is genuine, palpable, and has done much to keep interest in the fledgling Indo-Pak peace process alive, despite the absence of other major achievements in the Composite Dialogue.  The symbolic and political significance of the bus has reinforced the stakes India and Pakistan have in its success.  22.  (C) Although it does not deal directly with the \"core issue\" of Kashmir, the bus has the potential to begin a new era in intra-Kashmir relations.  Those who continue to dismiss it as a diversion or otherwise flawed sound increasingly cranky and out of touch with the march of history.  The matter of more frequencies and more routes will depend on the larger Indo-Pak relationship, but there is no doubt about the popularity of such steps in the state.  One of the few things that could affect the bus negatively is terrorism, but even a spectacular attack would be self-defeating, given the potential for causing a backlash among Kashmiris.  With public views so positive, it will be difficult for either government to stop this bus. MULFORD " }
